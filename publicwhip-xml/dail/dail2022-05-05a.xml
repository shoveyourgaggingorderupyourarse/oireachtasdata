    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-05a.8.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1475" speakername="Jack Chambers" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022050500003#A00500"><p>The Minister, Deputy Martin, sends her apologies.  She has a bereavement in her family and cannot be here this morning.</p>  <p>  Recruitment continues to be a significant challenge for the tourism sector, with up to two thirds of businesses reporting reduced capacity due to staff shortages.  My Department and F&aacute;ilte Ireland have been collaborating with industry and other  Departments to ensure there is a co-ordinated approach to addressing the labour and skills shortages.  In February 2022 F&aacute;ilte Ireland published its most comprehensive research to date on the tourism and hospitality labour market.  This robust and wide-ranging research programme covered the views of 1,000 employers and 3,500 workers with tourism and hospitality experience as well as international benchmarking and a review of education provision and consultation with recruitment agencies.  This research is shaping F&aacute;ilte Ireland's work programmes this year to provide support to the industry.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland's work includes supporting businesses to work together to drive the long-term repositioning of the sector as an appealing and rewarding career choice and workplace, helping to build the capability of individual employees to assist businesses to bridge the skills gaps they are experiencing and also driving greater employer attention by improving the quality of training across the business.</p>  <p>  F&aacute;ilte Ireland also chairs the tourism and hospitality careers oversight group, which continues to work closely with industry bodies, education providers and other Government bodies to support sustainable employment in the tourism sector with an immediate focus on recruitment and retention initiatives, as well as focusing on the long-term repositioning of the industry as a career choice.</p>  <p>  My Department and the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science are both represented on the career oversight group.  Officials from my Department also participate in the inter-departmental group on work permits chaired by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  The work of the group resulted in up to 350 work permits being granted for managerial positions in certain tourism and hospitality businesses.  Last year my Department also successfully advocated for the prioritisation of chef permit applications, that is, engaging with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment with regard to different permits now required.  My Department and F&aacute;ilte Ireland will continue to engage with and provide support to the tourism sector through these challenging times.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-05a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1497" speakername="Imelda Munster" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022050500003#A00600"><p>The situation is so bad now that some restaurants and pubs have to close early or are having to close a few days a week to cope with the shortage.  The shortage of chefs is particularly acute.  The Minister of State mentioned F&aacute;ilte Ireland's tourism careers research.  That showed that there is currently a shortage of 40,000 workers in the tourism and hospitality sector, and 30% of businesses that were surveyed in 2021 said that they faced closure if recruitment challenges are not resolved.  Given the very difficult past two years that the businesses in this sector have had, this is making things much harder for them at a time when they should be firing on all cylinders.  Would the Minister of State agree that his Government should lead on this and increase the minimum wage to a living wage?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-05a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1475" speakername="Jack Chambers" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022050500003#A00700"><p>F&aacute;ilte Ireland is working hand in glove with key sectoral bodies on the tourism and hospitality oversight group, which is pivoted to focus on supporting the industry to address some of its immediate recruitment challenges in the months ahead.  Obviously, matters relating to wage rates are set by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, and we are working with the Department as part of the career oversight group.  The current staffing and skills shortages in the tourism sector are unprecedented.  However, staffing shortages are not just a problem in the tourism sector.  There are many sectors in the Irish economy facing this same change.  Tourism around the world is also experiencing it.  The loss of skilled workers and the difficulty in recruiting and retaining staff is undoubtedly one of the greatest barriers to the sector's recovery from the pandemic.  Even before Covid, the tourism industry faced a particular set of employment challenges in attracting and retaining workers.  The closure of the sector exacerbated those challenges.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland estimates that there are more than 40,000 vacancies in the industry across all roles, with almost a quarter estimated at management level.  As I said, every piece of work now with F&aacute;ilte Ireland is being occupied with trying to work within that oversight group to meet the unprecedented challenges in the months ahead.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-05a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1497" speakername="Imelda Munster" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022050500003#A00800"><p>It is not up to F&aacute;ilte Ireland to solve this problem.  I asked what the Minister of State's opinion was on the Government increasing the minimum wage to a living wage for workers in the sector.  Retention is equally as much a problem along with recruitment.  According, again, to F&aacute;ilte Ireland's research, one in three workers in the sector was new to tourism and hospitality, and 42% of workers in the sector who are on the PUP did not return to their employers.  Does the Minister of State think there is a case where employers improved pay conditions that they might be able to manage and to improve retention levels?  Everyone in the sector understands that there are unsociable hours, but when you have people working very long hours, when they are sometimes denied breaks and having to work split shifts on a wage on which they just cannot afford to live, bearing in mind there is a cost-of-living crisis and a rental crisis and people simply cannot afford to work.  Also, the sector is very vulnerable because the trade unions are not organised in the sector.  Given that he has not answered the question about his Government's opinion on increasing the minimum wage to a living wage, what is his opinion on the role of employers in improving conditions to retain staff in the sector?</p></speech>

That is why F&aacute;ilte Ireland is developing an excellent employer programme to showcase good employers across the industry and to help businesses improve their employer practices and reputation.</p> <p>The programme aims to reposition the industry as an appealing and rewarding place to work which can attract and retain talent.  Participating businesses will have access to people management training for their teams, employee surveys and a range of bespoke business supports as well as the opportunity to become a certified top employer thereby enhancing their employer brand and supporting their recruitment and retention.</p> <p> F&aacute;ilte Ireland is also working through a recruitment awareness campaign to drive the awareness of a variety of roles available and it is launching a multiplatform recruitment campaign with an allocation of &euro;600,000 to promote the unique benefits of working in the industry targeting people from the ages of 16 to 60.</p> <p> On Deputy Munster's general question, as the Deputy will be aware, the matters around the living wage and the minimum wage are being led by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Deputy will have opportunities to engage with the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Varadkar, on that but the Government has followed through on the independent wage commission's report, which was published last year.</p></speech>

Eligibility for social welfare supports, as the Deputies will be aware, is a matter for the Minister for Social Protection and neither I nor the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, have any statutory functions in that regard.</p><p>However, I can assure the Deputy that the issue of disabled artists participating in the basic income scheme it is a matter which the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, takes very seriously.  The Minister wants to ensure that all artists, including those with a disability, can apply to participate in the pilot.</p><p>The basic income for the arts is a sectoral support for the arts to give recognition to the intrinsic value of the arts to Irish society and to place a value on the often unpaid work that is undertaken in order to develop an arts practice required to produce the art we all as a society enjoy and benefit from.</p><p>Stakeholder engagement has been core to the policy development process for the basic income for the arts and this included a stakeholder forum on 15 December 2021, which over 150 people attended, representing 50 resource organisations and representative organisations, including disabled artists and representatives from Arts and Disability Ireland.  In addition, the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, held a public consultation throughout the month of January and the impact of such a scheme on artists with disabilities was a theme which was raised throughout the consultation.</p><p>As the Deputies will be aware, the basic income for the arts pilot scheme was the number one recommendation of the Arts and Culture Recovery Taskforce, which the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, established to make recommendations to ensure that the arts and culture sector would recover fully after Covid and thrive post pandemic.  The Department of Social Protection was a member of the oversight group the Minister established last year tasked with appraising the recommendations set out in the Life Worth Living report, including on the manner in which the basic income for the arts pilot should be implemented.</p><p>In addition, bilateral engagement between the two Departments on the treatment of the basic income for the arts payment has been ongoing over the past number of months, in particular, discussions around the treatment of the grant payment for the purposes of income disregards across a number of social welfare schemes, including disability allowance.</p><p>I can assure the Deputies that the issue of artists with disabilities is something which the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, is focused on.  The Minister believes that the basic income for the arts has the potential to help artists and creative arts workers, including those with disabilities, to overcome labour market barriers by creating a self-sustaining creative practice, operating on a self-employed basis.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the pilot scheme is a three-year research programme to examine the impact a basic income-style payment could have on artists and creative arts workers and their creative practice.  A key research question will be the impact such a payment could have on artists with disabilities. To that end, the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, was determined since the outset of the pilot scheme that artists with disabilities would be in a position to participate in the scheme to the greatest extent possible within the legislative framework to ensure the research captured the experience of disabled artists.</p><p>Accordingly, as I mentioned already, the Department has worked with the Department of Social Protection, to establish that the payment will be treated as earnings from self-employment and can be taken into account in earnings disregards that apply to many social welfare payments, including disability allowance and the one-parent family payment.  That means that the basic income for the arts will be treated like any other income a person on social welfare earns from employment.</p><p>In the case of the disability allowance, it will be possible for many people to avail of the basic income and retain social welfare benefits in addition to the moneys received from the pilot scheme.  Of course, each individual case will differ depending on other household income.</p><p>The actual impact of the basic income on a person's welfare entitlements will depend on each individual&rsquo;s circumstances and applicants will need to engage with the Department of Social Protection on the matter.</p><p>The Department of Social Protection published a guide to the interaction of the basic income for the arts pilot scheme with Department of Social Protection payments, <i>www.gov.ie/en/publication/bd818-interaction-of-the-basic-income-for-the-arts-pilot-scheme-with-dsp-payments</i>, on <i>Gov.ie</i>on 13 April to assist all applicants in receipt of Department of Social Protection supports, including those with disabilities.</p><p>The Department of Social Protection has also undertaken to engage directly with disabled artists who are selected for the pilot to help them understand the impact accepting the payment would have in their individual circumstances.</p><p>The Department has met with representatives from the disabled artists community to examine how best we can make artists aware of the position established between my Department and the Department of Social Protection in respect of supports and the treatment of the basic income for the purposes of income disregards.  My Department also has a dedicated email address to answer any questions that applicants may have about any aspect of the scheme to assist artists and creative arts workers with queries about the pilot.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-05a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1551" speakername="Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in" time="09:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022050500004#B00600"><p>I thank the Minister of State.  I am intrigued by that response.  It is quite comprehensive.  As the Minister of State was going through it, I was not sure whether we were going to a space where the Minister was working on it.  Towards the end of the response, it appeared the Minister of State outlined the Minister is aware of the issue and is working on it but he seemed to indicate that there is not an issue.  However, there may be individual cases which the grand sweep of what the Minister is trying to achieve will not cover.  I ask the Minister of State to outline to the House that somebody in receipt of disability support will be classed as a self-employed person and on that basis, he or she should not have any concerns about losing whatever supports he or she has.</p>  <p>  As the Minister of State can appreciate, the arts are about giving license to those who have tensions within their lives to express them and if we are excluding those with disabilities from this scheme, then that will be a major disadvantage, not only for them but for the wider Irish society.  I am intrigued to get more detail on the Minister of State's response.  It appears to be welcome.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-05a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1478" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="09:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022050500004#B00700"><p>Obviously, the Minister is aware of the issue.  I say, "Well done", to the Music and Entertainment Association of Ireland, MEAI, among others, for campaigning on this.  However, it is worth saying, on the task force that was looking into the basic income project, there was no representative of people with disabilities and we need to be absolutely certain that there is not a disincentive for people with disabilities to sign up for the basic income pilot.  Certainly, on the calculations the MEAI has done, there is potential for them to lose in some cases the medical card and for a failure to take into account that people with disability carry additional costs to those who do not have disabilities.  An Indecon report recently estimated there is &euro;10,000 a year additional costs if one has a disability.  Whereas somebody who does not have a disability will get 100% of the benefit of everything over previous social welfare basic payments, the people with disability could see much of that additional money eaten up by what they lose when they take up the payment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-05a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1475" speakername="Jack Chambers" time="09:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022050500004#B00800"><p>I thank both Deputies for the questions.</p><p>To respond to Deputy Boyd Barrett, I am informed that there were 150 people at the stakeholder forum, representing 50 resource organisations and representative organisations, including representatives from Arts and Disability Ireland.</p><p>Similar to all income, the payment will be reckonable for the purpose of social welfare means tests.  Whether a person's social protection payment will be impacted or not will depend on his or her individual circumstances.  However, many of the income supports provided by the Department of Social Protection include income disregards to encourage people to work.</p> <p>The Department of Social Protection has undertaken to engage directly with disabled artists who are selected for the pilot scheme to deal with and address their individual circumstances.  As I said earlier, the impact that income from the basic income pilot scheme will have on a person's disability allowance payment, for example, will depend on each person.  There is no definite consequence.  I am aware of the concern that exists in the broader community, as the Deputy mentioned, but perhaps I can go into more detail about it in a later reply.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-05a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1551" speakername="Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in" time="09:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022050500005#C00200"><p>This scheme in general is extremely welcome.  There will always be issues, but this is a big one if one is a person with a disability and one is expressing oneself through artistic means and one may be locked out of the scheme.  What I am hearing from the Minister of State is that he is aware of this, that he is meeting and engaging, that he is engaging with the Department and that this is going to be resolved both on a wide basis and on an individual basis.  If that is the case, those who are listening to this debate will be comforted by that.  I want to be absolutely clear that this issue has been recognised, that the Minister is aware of it and is working it out with the Department and those who represent artists with disabilities and that it will be resolved on a project basis and on an individual basis.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-05a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1478" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="09:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022050500005#C00300"><p>Unless it is addressed, people on disability payments or blind payments could potentially lose up to &euro;90 of their payments.  Inevitably when one is getting a higher payment as one would on the basic income, it is going to impact on other payments.  However, the critical point here, as has been pointed out by the MEAI and others, including Disabled Artists and Disabled Academics, DADA, is that people with disabilities carry additional costs variously estimated, depending on levels of disability, at between &euro;7,000 and &euro;12,000, or an average of approximately &euro;10,000, and there is the potential to lose their medical card.  What they want is certainty that this will not be the case and that the additional money over basic social welfare payments in the new &euro;325 payment will be available to artists with disability to channel into their art, which is the purpose of the basic income pilot, and is not gobbled up by them compensating for losses in their disability payments.</p></speech>

However, it is important to stress that, as part of that, every individual's case is different in terms of their household income.  The Deputies will know how familial cases vary.  That is why there is a structure with the Department of Social Protection.  The Department will engage directly with all disabled artists who are selected for the pilot scheme to help work through and understand the impact that accepting the payment will have on their individual circumstances.  It is something on which the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, is focused.  She believes the basic income has the potential to help artists and creative arts workers, including those with disabilities, to overcome labour market barriers by creating a self-sustainable creative practice operating on a self-employed basis.  That is why there is that structure between the two Departments to work through.  As I said, the Department of Social Protection is willing to engage with all who are selected as part of the pilot.</p></speech>

What additional supports are being made available for all artists who are suffering, have suffered through the Covid-19 pandemic and suffered prior to the pandemic in terms of income?</p></reply>

The Department expects a high volume of applications and it will not be possible to provide funding to all eligible applicants.  The pilot scheme will run over a three-year period and the intention is to research the impact a basic income would have on artists' creative work patterns by providing the opportunity to focus on their practice, recognising the value of the unpaid element of work that goes into creative practice, to minimise the loss of skills from the arts as a result of the pandemic and to contribute to the growth of the sector.  The overarching objective of the scheme is to address the earnings instability that can be associated with the intermittent, periodic and often project-based nature of work in the arts.  The scheme will research the impact on artists' and creative arts workers' creative practice of providing the security of a basic income, thereby reducing income precariousness.</p>  <p>  Funding for the scheme will allow for approximately 2,000 eligible applicants to participate in the pilot research scheme.  Selection will be a non-competitive process.  Once an applicant satisfies the eligibility criteria he or she will be included in an anonymised random sampling process to determine the pilot recipients from the pool of eligible applicants for the BIA pilot.  In addition, up to 1,000 eligible applicants who were not selected to receive the payment will be selected to participate in a control group to facilitate the evaluation of the pilot.  Control group participants will respond to the same survey and data requests as those in receipt of the payment to help assess the impact of the payment as compared with those not in receipt of it.  As part of the application process, applicants will be asked to indicate if they do not want to participate in the control group.  Control group members will be paid two weeks basic income for each year of the pilot scheme to compensate them for the time required to engage in the data collection process.</p>  <p>  I am very cognisant of the challenges faced by the arts, culture and live entertainment industry as the sector recovers post pandemic.  To this end, a &euro;50 million suite of supports for the live performance sector was delivered in 2022 to provide performance and employment opportunities for artists and crews.  I might have a chance to outline those later.</p></speech>

I hope the Minister of State will be able to come back to it, because he appeared to be getting to the nub of it.  It is welcome that 2,000 artists will avail of the new scheme.  It will be interesting.  Those in the control group will receive &euro;650 for being in the group over a full year, which is also welcome.  However, that leaves many thousands more artists who will continue to struggle after the pandemic, as they had prior to it.  What are the plans to support their recovery, additional to the basic income?  Will the Minister of State outline how he will address the poverty and the failure of incomes for artists throughout the country into the future?</p></speech>

However, the supports for the arts and culture sector secured in 2022 are very clear.  There is &euro;25 million for the basic income scheme for artists and arts workers.  We are maintaining the Arts Council allocation at a record level of &euro;130 million.  This allocation allows the Arts Council to continue to protect the jobs and livelihoods of artists and to assist arts organisations through financial difficulties.</p>  <p>  There is &euro;50 million for further supports in 2022 for the live entertainment industry as this important sector emerges from the devastating impacts of the pandemic.  There is a more than &euro;6 million increase in funding for Screen Ireland from its initial allocation in 2021 to more than &euro;36 million.  There is &euro;5 million additional funding for the national cultural institutions, which will ensure they provide high quality services to the public, and &euro;4 million to deliver a suite of initiatives proposed by the night-time economy task force, including a new scheme for pubs and cafes to broaden night-time economy activity across the country.  There is &euro;5 million to support the 2022 commemorative programme.</p>  <p>  The Deputy can see that there have been unprecedented allocations to support the arts and culture sector in addition to progressing the pilot scheme, which was a key policy objective.</p></speech>

That was the answer I was hoping for but which I did not get in the first round.  I wish those on the scheme well when it starts.  It is to be hoped that we will learn lessons from it that can be addressed.</p> <p>The previous question addressed some of the pitfalls that have already been outlined.  A total of &euro;25 million is being diverted to 2,000 artists.  I want to ask about additional money rather than the same money.  Has additional money been set aside for other artists who do not avail of the scheme and who can apply for additional grants as we come out of the pandemic?  Most of the money the Minister of State announced was ring fenced for the pandemic to try to ensure some artists living in poverty who had no other source of income could survive.</p></speech>

There is &euro;50 million for the live performance restart grant scheme to support the recovery of the live performance sector.  There is &euro;4 million for the music and entertainment business assistance scheme.  This is specifically to support small music and entertainment businesses that do not operate out of rateable premises.  There is &euro;5 million for local authorities to support local artists and performers through the local live performance support scheme.  This scheme in particular has provided thousands of hours of employment for local musicians, artists and crews.  There is &euro;5 million to continue the capital support scheme for venues, including for ventilation upgrades and other Covid adaptations.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy has seen from what I referenced in the previous response, from the unprecedented funding to the Arts Council, funding for the national cultural institutions and additional support for the live entertainment sector, there is unprecedented support in many funding streams.  Artists will see a real benefit from these through this year.  The fact we have the basic income pilot happening, which has been called for and spoken about for decades, puts the arts on a positive trajectory in the coming years.</p></speech>

To this end, more than &euro;50 million has been provided in a suite of supports for the live performance sector in 2022.  This includes &euro;4 million for the music and entertainment business assistance scheme, specifically to support small music and entertainment businesses which do not operate out of a rateable premises.  A total of &euro;20 million was allocated in the third strand of the live performance support scheme to support events which were due to be staged in December 2021 and January 2022 and were curtailed, cancelled or rescheduled due to the restrictions.  A total of &euro;5 million was allocated to the second strand of the live performance support scheme to support pantomime and seasonal musical theatre impacted by the Covid restrictions in place in December and January.  There is &euro;5 million for local authorities to support local artists and performances through the local live performance programming scheme.  There is &euro;5 million to continue the capital supports scheme to venues, including for ventilation upgrades and other Covid adaptations.  This scheme is open for applications until 31 May 2022.  There was also &euro;1 million for the St. Patrick's Festival 2022.</p>  <p>  A total of &euro;15 million has been allocated for the live performance restart grant scheme.  This will provide a new grant for businesses engaged in staging live events in the arts and culture live performance sector.  The scheme aims to help underpin the recovery of the live performance sector by providing business restart grants to successful applicants as a support to de-risk the planning of events across spring and summer of 2022.  Grants of up to &euro;100,000 will be available to eligible businesses under the scheme.  This scheme closed for application at 1 p.m. on 20 April with 210 applications submitted.  Applications are being assessed and to date grants totalling &euro;6.5 million have already been offered to 79 applicants under the scheme.  Assessments are ongoing and decisions will continue to issue on a rolling basis.  The payments process will commence shortly and payments will continue to issue on a weekly basis as grantees submit their documentation and payment requests.</p></speech>

The specific issue is on when the much needed funding is allocated.  While everyone welcomes any support for this hard-pressed sector there seems to be misalignment between the demands of the live performance sector and the manner in which the Department operates.  There are many great venues in my constituency in Cork South West, such as Levis's Corner Bar in Ballydehob, De Barra's in Clonakilty and Connolly's of Leap.  These types of venues need months to plan in advance to secure acts, crews and equipment.  Any scheme to support spring and summer events should have been distributed months ago.  It is extremely disheartening and frustrating for venues and performers because a scheme that is supposed to buffer against uncertainty and additional costs is becoming a source of uncertainty and stress.  The sector needs to have this funding in bank accounts as soon as possible.  Will the Minister of State please clarify whether there is a date by which these funds have to be spent?  Originally this was cited as June, which is unfeasible at this stage.</p></speech>

The payment process for the scheme will commence shortly and I appreciate the need for it.  Payments will issue on a rolling basis as grantees submit their documentation.  All payment requests will be dealt with without delay.  I will revert to the Deputy on the question of when it needs to be paid by.</p></speech>

I hope he can appreciate the frustration of the sector.  Measures were first mentioned in the budget and launched separately but applications are starting months later and the funding is later again.  The timely delivery of these supports would make a massive difference in ensuring the viability of so many venues.  As well as the restrictions and hardships of the past two years, small and medium-sized venues are facing increased costs especially in rural areas.  The cost of living crisis impacting families is also being felt by arts and hospitality businesses.  In particular local employers in these sectors highlight the rise in energy and insurance expenses to me.  While these issues are not directly in the Minister's portfolio, they are major concerns for all in the arts and hospitality sectors.  Will the Minister of State outline the engagement of the Minister with other Ministers on insurance and energy costs?</p></speech>

We were all delighted at Christmas when the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, announced funding for the pantomimes.  Many had to be cancelled at short notice because of Covid.  We have an excellent company in Carlow, Striking Productions.  It had to cancel all of its shows, which had been booked out.  I met the Minister.  A portal was opened for the company to apply for funding.  Striking Productions still has not received its funding.  I am trying to contact the Department and the local authority to see who pays it.  This is unacceptable.  It is now May.  This excellent group had sold out all of its shows.  It owes a lot of money to people it had hired and cannot pay them.  Will the Minister of State confirm whether the payment is through the local authority or the Department?  There is confusion between the two.  The group needs to be paid.</p></speech>

With specific regard to the development of tourism product offerings such as the proposed Irish Sea Way walking trail, these are operational matters for F&aacute;ilte Ireland in line with its tourism development functions.</p>  <p>  Regarding the Irish Sea Way, I understand that F&aacute;ilte Ireland has conducted initial reviews to understand the nature and scale of any existing infrastructure that could assist in progressing an overall walking trail along the route.  Over the past two years, however, given the devastating impact of Covid-19 on the tourism industry, F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s overriding focus was on supporting tourism businesses through the pandemic.  Due to the fact that key human and financial resources were diverted towards Covid-related priorities and on account of Covid-related public health restrictions limiting opportunities for site visits and community engagement gatherings, it was not possible for F&aacute;ilte Ireland to advance considerations of the Irish Sea Way proposal during this time.</p>  <p>  Now, however, I understand that work on the Irish Sea Way walking trail project has been scheduled to commence in the second half of this year.  Prior to any engagement with communities, of course, an understanding of the scale and feasibility of the project will be required.  Accordingly, I believe F&aacute;ilte Ireland's initial focus will be on developing a framework and roadmap to inform its approach to developing of the walking trail.  This work will then inform a methodology for developing route options, a community consultation strategy and indicative costs for the infrastructural development of the trail.</p>  <p>  As regards timeframes envisaged for the forthcoming stages in this project, I understand that F&aacute;ilte Ireland is aiming to complete by the end of quarter 3 of 2022 the procurement process to engage consultants to work with the agency on this project and it estimates that the consultancy work will take nine to 12 months.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland has advised that a public consultation strategy will be developed by the consultant team and that it is aiming to conduct public consultations during 2023.  </p></speech>

What we are really looking at is an infrastructural piece and I am not sure this is the type of thing F&aacute;ilte Ireland could or should be involved in.  I think there is a role for central government in it and there is clearly a role for local authorities.  A good example of this is found in Waterford where Waterford City and County Council has worked with landowners to develop a coastal trail that runs from Dunmore through Portally as far as Ballymacaw with plans to bring it further to Tramore but that was not a F&aacute;ilte Ireland piece and was not developed at a desktop.  It was developed in consultation with landowners building on a traditional trail that was already there.  As an infrastructural piece, I believe there is a role for central government to bring people together on this and possibly give direction to local authorities for them to be able to engage with landowners in that meaningful way.</p></speech>

I see Deputy Calleary is present and I know that when it came to the greenway in Mayo, with which I am very familiar, a lot of local work and engagement with landowners allowed that to progress but I am sure this is something that F&aacute;ilte Ireland will engage with.  It is the early iteration of this, as I referenced.  It has four main funding channels for its capital investment in tourism product development to support the enhancement of tourism attractions.  These are large grant schemes provided under the platforms for growth approach, small grant schemes, strategic partnerships and other collaborations.  A lot of the work they are doing at this point concerns the framework for how to develop the walking trail, developing route options and community consultation, so it concerns putting that initial piece in place around what is possible.  The agency hopes to commence the consultancy work and public consultation in 2023 to achieve some progress.</p></speech>

I mentioned the route from Dunmore to Ballymacaw.  There is also a loop trail that is the final furlong of St. Declan's Way, which takes in the Ardmore cliff walk.  Again, this was developed by the local authority and was done in a very sympathetic way that respected the surroundings.  It is easy to diminish something like walking tourism but in the Scottish tourism economy, it is worth &pound;1.26 billion per year.  It is a complete counterpoint to that kind of coach tourism involving that kind of "gone in 60 seconds" whistle-stop tour.  It slows tourists down.  It is also obviously a local amenity.  It gives people a real sense of place and allows them to engage with the culture and our food offering in a more meaningful way.  It is in the programme for Government and is something I would like to see driven forward.  We can already see the benefits in places like Wicklow and Waterford and it is a direction in which we should be moving.</p></speech>

In February 2022, a figure of &euro;50 million was announced for the 2022 scheme, which will support dozens of outdoor projects across the country and provide a major boost to rural tourism.  It will see the development of natural amenities such as our mountains, lakes, beaches, bogs, walkways, greenways and blueways to support adventure activities.  There is a strategic partnership between F&aacute;ilte Ireland and key State bodies like the Office of Public Works, OPW, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, Coillte, Waterways Ireland and most recently &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, which owns and manages many sites of vital importance to tourism.  The recent announcement of the strategic partnership with &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta will allow for collaboration across the Gaeltacht strengthening the tourism experience there.

It relates to sustainable and slow tourism.  The Dubliners may have sung "Thank God We're Surrounded By Water" but certainly in terms of transport or tourism, being an island nation makes it more difficult for people to arrive here in a sustainable way.  What steps are being taken to promote slow tourism through sail-rail-trail sustainable tourism offerings?</p></reply>

The report identifies a suite of actions that will promote sustainable tourism practices ahead of the development of a new national tourism policy.  The successful implementation of these actions will shine a light on areas and destinations that are striving to be best in class in terms of sustainability and will provide better access to information and tools for the tourism industry and visitors to practise responsible tourism.</p>  <p>  On foot of the suite of actions set out in an interim action plan, F&aacute;ilte Ireland will this year work with the National Transport Authority, NTA, to give appropriate consideration to linkages to ferry ports and the rail network when considering new walking trail developments and extensions to existing trails.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland will also carry out a feasibility study on the infrastructure required to be able to travel and tour Ireland's experience regions by sustainable modes of transport.  From a promotional perspective, Tourism Ireland will tailor our marketing programmes to focus on sustainable tourism product and work towards the longer-term goal of ensuring that we are successfully marketed as a sustainable tourism destination.</p>  <p>  F&aacute;ilte Ireland is also involved in the development of walking, cycling and water-based trails with the tourism agency either developing best practice guidelines or supporting the Sport Ireland guidelines for trail development - all aimed at supporting trail developers, tourism businesses and local communities to harness the economic opportunities of such trails.  With regard to access to the countryside, this is being addressed as part of the development of the new national outdoor recreation strategy under the remit of the Minister for Rural and Community Development.</p>  <p>  Tourism Ireland continues to work with all ferry companies serving Ireland to promote attractive fares and to highlight travelling here by ferry.  In 2022, Tourism Ireland is investing &euro;594,000 in co-operative activity to promote ferry travel to Ireland.  My Department has initiated the development of a new national tourism policy that will mainstream sustainability.  This new policy will be informed by and build upon the work undertaken by the sustainable tourism working group and will promote sustainable development and management within the tourism ecosystem.  </p></speech>

The marketing department of F&aacute;ilte Ireland can have the following for free.  I want people to see the greenway as the green way.  I want tourists to be able to arrive into Rosslare Europort, step onto a train to bring them to Waterford city, unload their bicycles and go from there.  That way, they can enjoy Waterford city, head to Kilmacthomas and on to Dungarvan.  Hopefully, as we begin to develop the national cycling network, they will be able to go on to many of the peripheral towns throughout County Waterford.  I believe, however, that we have to improve the foot passenger experience in particular, not just in Rosslare, but also in Dublin, in order that the journeys of passengers who arrive with a bike or just as foot passengers through the port and onto public transport are seamless and much more pleasant and enjoyable.  </p></speech>

That is why &euro;594,000 is being used to promote ferry travel to Ireland.  The Deputy referenced Rosslare Europort being so close to Waterford, and the huge sustainable progress that was made there in the tourism offering.  I will bring the Deputy's feedback on the necessity to link that particular marketing experience with what should visually appear as people arrive in Rosslare to both F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland.</p></speech>

People are increasingly choosing to travel by ferry.  There might be a range of reasons for that.  It might be that they get to bring their car.  There are also a certain number of people who are choosing to fly less and use other modes of transport to arrive at their tourist destinations.  However, not every service that is coming in and out of Rosslare Europort offers that foot passenger option.  For example, I know that one of the routes goes to Bilbao.  I would very much like to go on that ferry journey.  I do not particularly want to have my car with me when I arrive there.  I find having my car in Europe only adds to my stress, rather than anything else, with driving on the wrong side of the road etc.  We really need to focus on that offering.  We must ensure that when people arrive as foot passengers, it is a nicer place to arrive into.  We must ensure that there is a seamless transport option for foot passengers to take them to the places in the country that they want to visit.</p></speech>

I think it is a very significant opportunity for the whole of the country.  There is a vision where we can link Rosslare to Waterford, through Tipperary and into Limerick.  Some very good work is being done.  The launch of the national greenway network yesterday was very positive.  In time, we will see slow travel being embraced.  Visitors will come from France and Germany, and northern and southern Europe.  They will travel by ferry to the ports, particularly on our east coast.  They will spend a week or two cycling round the country.  We need to advance this as quickly as possible.  I look forward to the draft of the sustainable tourism policy that is coming out.  I encourage the Minister of State to engage with communities and stakeholders across the country to ensure that we have the best policy.  I think it is a fantastic opportunity for all of Ireland.  I welcome the Minister of State's comments.</p></speech>

I think everyone would support the development of a sail, rail and trail offering to link the regions.  That is why the development of a national tourism policy will seek to mainstream sustainability.  The development of the new policy will involve extensive consultation with the tourism industry, as well as our communities, to help set out a path for the coming years which will support a sustainable recovery and subsequent growth in the sector.  Following the completion of an initial informal consultation and a review of the previous policy, People, Place and Policy, a formal consultation will take place with a view to publishing a new sustainable tourism policy in 2023.  There will be plenty of opportunities for engagement over the coming months.  I thank the Deputies for their comments.</p></speech>

My Department and F&aacute;ilte Ireland have been collaborating with industry and other Departments to ensure that there is a co-ordinated approach to addressing the labour and skills shortages.  In February 2022, F&aacute;ilte Ireland published its most comprehensive research to date on the tourism and hospitality labour market.  This robust and wide-ranging research programme covered the views of 1,000 employers and 3,500 workers with tourism and hospitality experience, as well as international benchmarking, a review of education provision and consultation with recruitment agencies.  This research is shaping F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s work programmes this year to provide support to the industry.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland's work includes supporting businesses to work together to drive the long-term repositioning of the sector as an appealing and rewarding career choice and workplace, helping to build the capability of individual employees to assist businesses to bridge the skills gaps they are experiencing, as well as driving greater employee retention by improving the quality of training across the business.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland also chairs the tourism and hospitality careers oversight group, which continues to work closely with industry bodies, education providers and other Government bodies to support sustainable employment in the tourism sector with an immediate focus on recruitment and retention initiatives, as well as focusing on the long-term repositioning of the industry as a career choice.  My Department and the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science are represented on the careers oversight group.  Officials from my Department also participate in the interdepartmental group on work permits chaired by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  The work of the group resulted in up to 350 work permits being granted for managerial positions in certain tourism and hospitality businesses in 2021.  My Department also successfully advocated last year for the prioritisation of chef permit applications, and is currently engaging with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment with regard to permits now required.  My Department and F&aacute;ilte Ireland will continue to engage with and provide support to the tourism sector through these challenging times.</p></speech>

Some 88% of respondents to the survey referenced by the Minister of State said they had considerable difficulty in recruiting chefs.  We must consider the fact that 42% of workers who were working in the tourism and hospitality sector pre-pandemic, and who received PUP as a consequence, did not return to the industry.  There are 40,000 vacancies in the sector.  We pride ourselves in being Ireland of the welcomes.  Tourism is a people-focused and a people-led experience.  Until we can fill that gap, that experience will be diminished.  I have often made the point that there was an organisation called CERT that was specifically focused on hospitality, tourism, and training chefs and hospitality staff.  We need to go back to that organisation.  I must say that I commend F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  The survey is an excellent piece of work and research.  It highlights the challenges that we face.  The survey also found that in summer 2021, one third of hospitality workers were new to the industry.  That figure will probably be even higher this summer.  We need a strategy in place.  It is too late for summer 2022 but we need to give guarantees to employers for summer 2023.</p></speech>

They are two regions that rely very heavily on tourism.  One could draw many parallels between the two regions.  Westport is a bustling town in County Mayo; Clonakilty is a similar town in west Cork.  Belmullet in County Mayo is similar to the Beara Peninsula in west Cork.  There are many similarities.  The point I am trying to get at is that there are many regions around Ireland, both on the coastline and inland, that rely heavily on tourism and hospitality, from the smaller caf&eacute;s and pubs, up to the larger hotels.</p> <p>Regional Ireland needs the survival of hospitality and in order to do that we need staff, to be able to recruit staff and to narrow the skills gap.  There is a challenge and the Department needs to do everything possible to ensure that recruitment challenge is met so that the hospitality sector can survive into the future.</p></speech>

F&aacute;ilte Ireland is supporting businesses to address vacancies in several ways.  Regionally, F&aacute;ilte Ireland is helping the industry to build relationships with further and higher education providers to reach students and graduates who are available to work at peak times and become a key part of the seasonal work force.  As part of this, F&aacute;ilte Ireland has also linked all the local education and training boards, ETBs, with businesses that are looking to recruit students to make them aware of the range of training and the scope of upskilling courses they can provide to newcomers to the industry.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland is also working with the Department of Social Protection to promote the pathways to work strategy and improve opportunities for tourism and hospitality businesses to recruit from the live register to help ensure a future pipeline of talent and inspire the future generation of tourism.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland recently launched the first ever industry-wide transition year work placement programme to provide tourism and hospitality businesses with a direct link to students looking for work experience placements which can progress to become seasonal roles.</p></speech>

I commend Mayo, Sligo and Leitrim ETB, which has commenced a programme of training for bar staff with local bars.  It is a focused programme that provides skills.  The level of vacancy is a threat to businesses.  Some 30% of 1,000 responders to this robust survey say they face closure unless it is resolved.  We are either serious about tourism as an industry or we are not.  We have to put it on a proper and co-ordinated footing in terms of training.  Let us build on this fantastic report.  It has to wake us up to the challenge we face and we need an action plan on training and recruitment.</p></speech>

There was a feeling within hospitality that once the PUP was reduced recruitment and staff shortages would be less of an issue but that is not the case and unfortunately it is still a big issue.  I will give the Minister of State an example of some of the issues.  I spoke to one business recently that advertised for a chef position in June of last year and by October it had only received one CV, despite being quite a reputable business and that challenge is ongoing.  Another business I spoke to was advertising on a monthly basis in the local newspapers to recruit in certain positions and it now has to do that on a weekly basis.  It has to employ international recruitment agencies in order to try to recruit staff.  There is a particular issue with chefs and visas for non-EU chefs, which needs to be expedited.  On the whole we need to ensure there is an approach within the Government and the Department to ensure that hospitality and a career in it is a viable option and is attractive to young people.</p></speech>

That is why significant work is ongoing by F&aacute;ilte Ireland with the ETBs, the Department of Social Protection on pathways to work and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment on permits and visas as was referenced.  We are all aware of businesses and restaurants in our local areas and people across the hospitality and tourism industry that are struggling to meet demand and the huge difficulties there are.  That is why the number one focus of the tourism and hospitality oversight group is to address the immediate recruitment challenges.  As I referenced in my initial response there is cross-departmental representation on that.  Work is also ongoing to develop a new and excellent employer programme to showcase good employers across the industry and to help businesses improve their employer practices and reputation so they become places that can attract and retain talent into the long term.  In addition to the immediate work ongoing to address the gaps in the labour market, significant work is ongoing to develop it as a long-term and sustainable place to work.</p></speech>

With specific regard to research and development of our tourism product, this is an operational matter for F&aacute;ilte Ireland as the national tourism development authority.  With regard to expenditure on research and development, F&aacute;ilte Ireland has advised that in 2021 it spent a total of &euro;2.6 million on research relating to consumer planning and insights and on economic and industry analysis.  Informed by the results of this research, F&aacute;ilte Ireland takes a strategic and insights-based approach to its investment in tourism product development in line with its tourism investment strategy 2016 to 2022, which sets out the overall framework for capital investment in tourism infrastructure to stimulate innovation and improve international competitiveness.  This investment also aligns with the national objectives laid out in Project Ireland 2040 and the provision in the national development plan 2021 to 2030, NDP, for the delivery of enhanced amenity through capital investment in tourism product development and enhancement, with a particular focus on tourist attractions and activity-based tourism to provide the type and quality of experience that visitors are seeking.</p>  <p>  F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s capital funding programme comprises a large grants scheme, that is now under the platforms for growth investment programme, which targets project categories that have the greatest potential to grow and support sustainable tourism.  It also includes individual grant schemes, strategic partnerships with other bodies and direct investment in experience brand infrastructure.  Its objective is to optimise key assets for the benefit of tourism and sustainable economic development while also increasing the geographic spread of visitors, promoting season extension and supporting sustainable growth management.  At regional and local level, F&aacute;ilte Ireland develops, supports and promotes tourism in line with the relevant tourism experience brands, which provide the overarching context for related product development, marketing and enterprise supports.  Looking to the future, officials in my Department have commenced the development of a new national tourism policy.  This will provide an updated policy context for future tourism product development.</p></speech>

Tourism is an invisible export, which must be worth billions.  It has always concerned me to think that F&aacute;ilte Ireland, the tourism agency body, spends so little on research into tourism.  It spent &euro;2.6 million in 2021, which is risible.  I imagine the research budgets for the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and its agencies; Enterprise Ireland; the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment; and science are multiples of this and tourism is such an incredibly valuable product for Ireland.  It always amazes me that so little is spent on tourism research, not just for visitors coming from Ireland but for visitors within Ireland to ask them what they want to see in their cities and towns from a tourism perspective.  I want to get the Minister of State's perspective on that.</p></speech>

The results of this research are used to inform a strategic approach to investment in tourism product development.  As I have referenced previously, there is a new tourism policy development, which we launched in 2023.  That will inform the prioritisation of spending lines.</p> <p>Specific decisions related to expenditure not made by the Minister or her Department are made by F&aacute;ilte Ireland as the national tourism development authority.  However, research carried out with the &euro;2.6 million provides a strategic insight and enables much of the data to be upheld on promoting tourism.  That research and insight is used to promote tourism across the board.</p></speech>

The Minister of State will have heard me speak about the following things before.  I would love to see research into how we can replicate Culture Night in Dublin.  It is one night per year and yet it absolutely transforms the city.  One rarely sees families in Dublin but on Culture Night, the city is populated with families.  We have many art galleries but when we look at the tradition, history and reach of Irish music internationally, we see we have no tourist offering, whether for people at home or for visitors from abroad.  One of my ambitions is for a good look to be taken at the Customs House.  It houses the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  It is not fit for purpose for a modern Department that preaches the climate action piece.  It would make an incredible city-centre based museum as a showcase for the history of music in Ireland from O'Carolan right through to contemporary musicians.  What a site and location it is and could be as a tourist attraction.  We could put a bit of money into Culture Night and the Customs House in terms of research and the tourist offering in the city centre.</p></speech>

In 2022, research will account for 2.52% of the core budget.  I appreciate what he has outlined around certain areas that warrant research and a focus.  A number of <i>ad hoc </i>projects in specialised areas are being undertaken to try to embrace opportunities for the tourism economy to recover first.</p><p>Tourism Ireland in 2022 continued to undertake the Covid tracker research programme to track travel behaviours and identify the potential opportunities and barriers on the road to recovery of tourism.  It will undertake research on segmentation, which will allow it look again at an overseas holidaymaker segmentation model.  It will carry out more research on sustainability as it implements the learnings from the 2021 sustainability research.  It will also carry out brand and campaign testing through the year, as well as <i>ad hoc</i>projects to support the priorities of the organisation.  As an example, Tourism Ireland undertook research on the UK Nationality and Borders Bill in March and April to help inform our position on the issue prior to meeting with key stakeholders such as the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee.  However, I will bring the Deputy's feedback on what he has referenced.  I appreciate what he has outlined.</p></speech>

These changes are for the most part driven by advances in technology and the manner in which we consume media content.  The Government is committed to putting in place a framework that will enable a sustainable future for a vibrant, diverse and independent media sector, encompassing print, audiovisual, radio and online.</p>  <p>  A key element in this was the establishment of the Future of Media Commission, which was chaired by Professor Brian MacCraith.  I am sure the Deputy appreciates that the commission's task was a complex one with a remit to address the many issues of concern for the entire media industry.  As a result, the its report and the wide ranging recommendations it contains has required careful and detailed thought.</p>  <p>  However, the consideration of the commission&rsquo;s report cannot be carried out in isolation but must have regard to a range of other complex and interrelated issues that the Government is addressing in the wider media and digital space.  These include the national digital strategy and Ireland&rsquo;s approach to the implementation of the Digital Services Act, which has been recently agreed at political level in Europe.  Another key element of this overall approach is the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill 2022, which is currently on Committee Stage in the Seanad, and in particular the establishment of a new media regulator, coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n.</p>  <p>  An coimisi&uacute;n will provide the regulatory and developmental framework to implement the report of the Future of Media Commission.  The commission will comprise an executive chairperson and three additional commissioners, including a broadcasting commissioner and a media development commissioner.  Both of these will have a role in ensuring the effective delivery of the report.  The detailed consideration of the Future of Media Commission&rsquo;s report by an Taoiseach, the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, and other key Ministers is nearing conclusion and will be brought to the Government for consideration in the coming weeks.</p></speech>

The release of the Future of Media Commission report is a central part of this.  I welcome the creation of the Future of Media Commission and I recognise that it was tasked with some challenging, wide-ranging topics to consider, namely, how we can put in place a sustainable framework for the wider media sector.  It is vital that we support our media sector in Ireland and encourage diverse opinion and debate and that we support a sector which is ever more inclusive and accessible to all in society.

One thing that was highlighted was the funding.  The Minister of State is aware that local media are vital in rural Ireland.  They provide real information in real time and do a great job of fighting wrong information.  What are the supports for Carlow and Kilkenny's KCLR station?  It is important for the future.  Throughout Covid, we all saw how important local radio was to inform and let people know such as elderly people.  My mother listened to it every day.  She was able to tell me everything that was happening.  Even though it covers local radio, it covers many national issues, which is also very important for people today.  Funding is of utmost importance.  KCLR has been operating for 18 years this week.  I wish it the best.  I was delighted to be on the station yesterday to wish it well.  I hope it will see another 50 years.</p></speech>

An additional &euro;3.2 million was also provided in 2021 for this purpose, which is a further acknowledgement of the importance of the sector and the impact swimming has on the nation&rsquo;s health.  The funding was administered by Ireland Active on behalf of Sport Ireland and it supported 280 pools throughout the country.  The day-to-day financial management of these public utilities is normally a matter for the operators of the facilities themselves.  Capital funding for new swimming pools or the refurbishment of existing pools was previously provided through the local authority swimming pool programme, LASPP.  A total of 52 pools have been completed under the LASPP.  Three swimming pool projects, namely, those in Lucan, Buncrana and Edenderry, remain in the programme, with the Lucan project currently under construction.</p>  <p>  My Department's capital support for new swimming pools is now being provided through the large scale sport infrastructure fund, LSSIF.  The national development plan provided a capital allocation of at least &euro;100 million for the fund to 2027.  The first call for proposals under the fund was made in 2019, with applications confined to local authorities and sports national governing bodies.  All applications were assessed in accordance with the evaluation procedures.  Thus far, &euro;86.4 million has been awarded to 33 projects.  These initial allocations include funding for eight swimming pool projects.  The priority in the short term is to advance all these projects, including the swimming pools, to  construction stage.</p>  <p>  Regarding future capital funding for pools, we are undertaking a review of progress on all existing LSSIF grants.  As part of this review, my Department is also considering the timing of any new call for proposals.  Turning to future policy, the national sports policy commits to the development of a national swimming strategy.  As part of this, there will be a review of swimming pool provision to identify where gaps exist and how these can be addressed.  Furthermore, the Sports Action Plan 2021-2023, which I published last November, contains an action to develop and implement a national swimming strategy to provide additional swimming opportunities indoors and outdoors.  Initial preparatory planning work has been undertaken by my Department in this regard.  It is intended to establish a working group in the near future to advance the detailed work of preparing a national swimming strategy, with a view to its completion and publication later this year.</p></speech>

He will accept, however, that while excellent calls have been published and funding has been drawn down, several projects are still simply caught in the process.  I have deep knowledge of two such local projects in my constituency, including one of the pools in which I learned to swim.  That was the infamous Glenalbyn swimming pool in Stillorgan, which has still not been redeveloped.  The finance is in place and planning permission has been secured but agreement has not been reached between the local authority and the GAA.  I call on the Minister of State to use his offices to intervene to get this situation resolved speedily.  Generations of young children in that area have not had access to learn to swim in a public facility.  The situation is the same just up the road in the Samuel Beckett Civic Campus.  Planning permission has been obtained for the swimming pool and funding has been secured, but the project has still not gone to tender and construction has not started.  The knock-on effect is that I and many dozens of other parents will spend three or four hours queueing to sign our children up for swimming lessons when those become available.</p></speech>

Perhaps I can revert to him regarding the progress being made on these specific projects.  I do know the Samuel Beckett Civic Campus project has an allocation of &euro;5 million.  We can provide an update on that project directly to Deputy Richmond.  I agree, though, that there is a broader demand which must be met.  Part of the national swimming strategy and our work with Swim Ireland will involve determining how we can identify new ways to develop facilities and infrastructure in communities.  We can continue to build projects that cost tens of millions of euro, such as many of the projects listed under the auspices of the LSSIF.  New ways of building infrastructure, however, can also deliver outcomes in respect of providing swimming lessons and facilities to local communities.  There are new and innovative ways to provide more facilities in communities at a lower cost.  We are working this approach through in the national swimming strategy and exploring new and innovative ways to deliver more swimming pool infrastructure.  That is the work we are doing this year.</p></speech>

Considering population growth, especially in my community, and factoring in the number of planning permission applications approved in the context of that expected growth, we can see there is going to be increased demand for what is an already oversubscribed swimming pool system.  We not only need the two pools I mentioned to be refurbished and the new pool, but also more pools to service the community.</p>  <p>  More pertinently, regarding the development of existing swimming pools, I must raise a matter about which concern has been expressed several times to my office.  Following the Covid-19 pandemic, the reopening of our pools and the restructuring of lessons, there has been a slip-up in providing swimming facilities for those with additional needs.  That is particularly the case for younger people with special needs in respect of having access to swimming pools for particular lessons and swimming and pool therapies.  This is an issue that should shape the Swim Ireland strategy.  We should be ensuring that learning to swim and to use the water correctly and enjoying that is something for all in our society.</p></speech>

Part of what we fund every year, through funds from dormant accounts, and what we are trying to do in the context of our Sport for All approach is ensure that there is inclusion across all sports, including swimming.  All providers should be continuing or strengthening what they were doing prior to the onset of Covid-19, especially for people with disabilities.  They should be ensuring that all activities are provided in an inclusive way.  A key part of the national sports policy and the sports action plan, as I said, is to develop a new swimming strategy.  As Deputy Richmond said, swimming is a vital life skill and one we have an increasing demand for in the context of the younger demographics of our population.  It is a life skill that allows people to participate and be active in an activity from a young age all the way through to and then during retirement.  We are cognisant of the need to ensure we have ongoing development of swimming pool infrastructure, as well as ensuring that is provided in an inclusive and affordable way.  We will work this through with the Deputy and others.  We are keen to ensure that we deliver a national swimming strategy this year and we are working that through with Swim Ireland.</p></speech>

Coimisi&uacute;n na Me&aacute;n will also have functions relating to the promotion of an open, trusted and pluralistic media and online environment, including research, education, media literacy, the protection of children and journalistic and creative supports.  Given that infringement proceedings have been launched against Ireland for the delay in the transposition of the revised audiovisual media services directive, which will be given direct effect in Irish law by the Bill, we are keen to see the legislation enacted by the summer recess.  This would pave the way for formal establishment of an coimisi&uacute;n by ministerial commencement order in the second half of this year.</p>  <p>  The Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill 2022 was initiated in the Seanad on 25 January last and moved to Second Stage on 22 February.  Committee Stage of the Bill in the Seanad commenced on 26 April and continued on 28 April and yesterday, 4 May.  The next Committee Stage session is scheduled for 10 May.  Given the importance of an coimisi&uacute;n, the Government has approved its establishment on an administrative basis prior to the enactment of the Bill.  While an coimisi&uacute;n will, as set out in the legislation, ultimately be funded through levies on regulated services, &euro;5.5 million was secured in the 2022 budget to provide start-up funds to resource the establishment process.</p>  <p>  A programme of work is now under way to secure the recruitment of key staff with the relevant skills and expertise to establish and lead an coimisi&uacute;n and to lay the groundwork for the commencement of its regulatory functions.  This includes managing the transition of BAI staff and functions to an coimisi&uacute;n, while also ensuring the continuity of existing broadcasting regulation set out under the Broadcasting Act 2009.</p>  <p>  The recruitment of the senior staff who will lead and manage an coimisi&uacute;n is a priority.</p> <p>Work is currently under way between my officials and officials from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Public Appointments Service to secure the recruitment of those staff, including the executive chairperson and online safety commissioner, through open, transparent and effective public competitions.  In light of the international reach of an coimisi&uacute;n's remit, the recruitment process will commence with an executive search by the Public Appointments Service, to raise the profile and awareness of these critical posts.  I expect that this process will commence in the current quarter.</p></speech>

I welcome that the legislation will provide for the establishment of a multi-person media commission.  It is important that we realise we are living in an extraordinarily different time in terms of how people consume media and information.  It is timely and perhaps a little bit behind time that the State is starting a body of work in this area.  Urgency must be shown in this regard.  Unfortunately, many younger people are susceptible to potential misinformation through forms of social media.  It is quite concerning.  We need to bring in regulations and safety mechanisms and put an individual in place to examine that work and issues that may arise.</p>  <p>  Could the Minister of State give us a little bit more information about the hiring process?  Is anything available to the House in that regard in the context of where we are after coming though a very difficult two years?  I urge the Minister of State to get down to the body of work that it is ahead of him, because it is important that it happens.</p></speech>

I have made reference to the executive search process and the work ongoing between the Public Appointments Service and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  That is expected to happen in this quarter.  We estimate that approximately 121 personnel will be required for the start-up phase of Coimisi&uacute;n na Me&aacute;n with a number of these to be hired before formal establishment.  An additional 33.5 staff are being sought for the commission to deliver on the recommendations of the Future of Media Commission.  In addition, as provided for by the Bill, the staff of the BAI, who currently number 35 full-time equivalents, will transfer over to Coimisi&uacute;n na Me&aacute;n on its establishment.  In the longer term it is envisaged that Coimisi&uacute;n na Me&aacute;n will require in excess of 300 staff to fully operationalise its functions as envisaged in the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill 2022.</p></speech>

The latest figures for March show that we have almost 10,000 adults and children in emergency accommodation.

It is an important one.  A priority for me as Minister is to continue tackling the serious problem that is homelessness.  The continuing increase in the numbers, which I flagged a number of months ago and which was to be expected, is of serious concern to me as I know it is to the Deputy.  The Government, local authorities and others are making every effort to reduce homelessness.  I will go through some more details shortly.  Key to this is the delivery of new social housing and boosting overall supply.  I want a housing-led response to homelessness.  That is what we are focused on.</p>  <p>  We are investing significantly in social and affordable housing, with record funding allocated for current and capital expenditure this year alone.  This year, funding is in place to deliver 11,800 new social homes, including 9,000 new builds.  That is the highest number in any given year in the history of the State and is thus building on the progress we made last year when, even with Covid, we delivered 9,183 new social homes, a 17% increase on 2020.</p>  <p>  More specifically, I have established the national homeless action committee, a standing committee within Government made up of NGOs, me and representatives from other relevant Departments, reflecting a whole-of-government approach.  Its initial key priorities are the advancement of additional measures to prevent homelessness and work on the youth homelessness strategy.   There will be a voids programme for 2022 with an emphasis on quick turnaround and reletting of vacant social housing stock to those on social housing waiting lists, including those in emergency accommodation.  I want a specific focus on that and discussed it with our main local authorities recently.  I also reinstated the delegated sanction to local authorities in respect of social housing acquisitions that meet certain criteria.  This will allow local authorities more flexibility to secure acquisitions that support a household to exit homelessness or to prevent homelessness.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-05a.128" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1468" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022050500012#K01000"><p>I thank the Minister.  Part of the problem is that many of the things he is outlining are not going to be coming on-stream, particularly for those who are in emergency accommodation for very long periods.  The driving causes of homelessness are the shrinking nature of the private rental sector, increasing numbers of vacant possession notices to quit, increasing presentations and a dramatic fall-off in the number of exits both for single people and families.  If we look at exits from homelessness in Dublin, for example, there was an average of 141 per month in 2019 and 186 per month in 2020, falling to 58 in 2021 and to 30 or 40 a month this year.  That trend is going to continue.  Nothing the Minister has outlined to date is going to address that trend in the short to medium term.</p><p>I am very concerned with the latest circular the Minister has issued to local authorities.  I do not believe it gives adequate flexibility.  It is too rigid and will only result potentially in a very small number of people being prevented from falling into homelessness through the tenant <i>in situ</i>scheme.  I urge the Minister to be more flexible and to engage with the Opposition to ensure the measure does much more in the weeks and months ahead.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-05a.129" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1561" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022050500012#K01100"><p>I thank the Deputy.  To conclude my initial response, I also want to refer to mortgage to rent, which is a very important mechanism for preventing homelessness.  Last year, I made some significant changes which came into effect from 14 February of this year.  Last year, 678 borrowers availed of the mortgage to rent scheme.  We are targeting 1,000 this year and in each year onwards and I think we will exceed that.  It is really important that we increase supply and I am going to do that significantly this year.</p><p>To respond to the Deputy's question on acquisitions, the circular was issued and changes made in consultation with the local authorities and the Local Government Management Agency, LGMA.  I want to put on the record of the House that I particularly asked local authorities to look at the tenant <i>in situ</i>situation, particularly in respect of housing assistance payment, HAP, and rental accommodation scheme, RAS, tenants, to see where we can prevent it and also making sure there is no distortion.  I do get criticism from time to time in respect of an expanded acquisition programme that we are competing with first-time buyers.  That circular was done in conjunction with the local authorities.  I want to see how it works and am committed to doing it.  While I am not convinced that it is inadequate in any way and want to see it work, I will also say to the Deputy that if we need to tweak it as we move forward I can assure him I will be happy to do that in conjunction with Opposition parties also.</p></speech>

First, the language indicates that it applies only when the household is deemed to be at risk of homelessness, for example when they are eligible for homeless HAP, which would be six weeks out from their notice to quit.  That is far too late in the day to intervene.  Second, under the previous tenant <i>in situ</i>scheme there was greater flexibility.  Dublin City Council, for example, would have acquired properties for households at risk of homelessness who were on the housing list five years.. For Kildare, even lower in my own local authority, it was about eight years.  This circular is being interpreted as applying only where a tenant would otherwise have a successful allocation of accommodation, so ten to 14 years on the list, and only when they are imminently at risk of homelessness, so six weeks out.  That is far too rigid.  The private rental sector has become so constrained that there is virtually nothing out there, as the Minister knows, for those families who have notices to quit.  I urge the Minister to sit down and meet with Opposition spokespeople to tease out how to make the wording of the circular more flexible to prevent families from becoming homeless and to reduce those increased presentation numbers from next month and the months immediately after that.</p></speech>

The Deputy referred to the tenants <i>in situ </i>scheme in Dublin City Council, which it effectively ran itself.  It has not been precluded from operating that scheme.  We need to balance what we are doing to make sure those waiting for a long time on the list will not be waiting even longer.  This is a preventive measure.  I want to see it work.  I have been really clear with the local authorities.  I have had two housing summits with them recently.  These summits involved all chief executives and directors of services in all 31 local authorities.  I attended the summits and addressed both meetings.  I am in regular contact with the local authorities, particularly the ten larger ones.  With regard to Dublin City Council in particular, it is in the four Dublin local authority areas that homelessness and the risk thereof are most predominant.  I am happy to examine this as it moves on.  I can give the Deputy that assurance.</p><p>In 2021, we had 5,234 exits from and preventions of homelessness.  There was significant work done in that regard.  We have an issue with a shrunken rental market.  It would be interesting to hear the views and policies of the Deputy and his party on how to retain landlords within the system.  We need to retain individual landlords within the system, which may require tax measures.  I am assuming I will have the Deputy's support if that must be done.</p></speech>

I understand they are denied by the board members specifically.  It is important that we say that.  I have appointed a senior counsel, Mr. Remy Farrell, to provide a report to inform my consideration of the matter.  Any allegations of this nature, be they related to individuals or the process, must be taken very seriously.  We have done so in advance of the recent public commentary on this.  The terms of reference, to which the Deputy referred, and the timelines for the report are nearing finalisation.  I will publish them.  It is right that we do so and that people have sight of them.</p>  <p>  I understand the Office of the Planning Regulator, OPR, has independently written to the chairperson of An Bord Plean&aacute;la requesting the chairperson to outline the systems and procedures that An Bord Plean&aacute;la has in place to ensure effective compliance with all statutory duties provided in sections 147 and 148 the Act and any other matters that the office deems relevant.  The board is independent in its performance of its functions under the planning Act.  We have to guard that independence.  Pending the outcome of the considerations, I am not going to make any further comment, but I assure the Deputy and others who have shown an interest in this that the terms of reference will be published and shared when concluded, which will be very soon or in a matter of days.  We need to let the senior counsel proceed with his time-bound work.  I want it focused; I do not want it to drag on.  I want this examined so we can deal with this issue efficiently and expeditiously.</p></speech>

It is the view of many of us that this confidence has been eroded over the past several years, in part because of some very controversial decisions in contravention of local city and county development plans and, in many cases, the advice of its own inspectors.  This has led to the extraordinary situation of Dublin City Council being forced to take judicial reviews on two occasions, with respect to both St. Anne's Park and Salesforce in the docklands, to defend the democratic integrity of the development plan and the strategic development zone there.  Therefore, I fully support the Minister in expediting this matter as quickly as possible to restore full public confidence.  Can he confirm that the terms of reference will cover all the allegations currently in the public domain?  I am not asking him to comment on them but to state that the terms of reference of the senior counsel review will be broad in that nature.</p></speech>

He will see that very shortly, or in a matter of days, when we publish them.  The work is now being concluded.  It is important that the public have confidence in the board.  We all have a responsibility to ensure this is the case.  The Government has made significant changes to the planning process by reinstating a two-stage process that starts in the local authorities through the large-scale residential developments legislation.  The strategic housing developments are no more.  Those that are just working through the system will conclude because they have started.  That is a very significant step forward.</p>  <p>  I have approved an additional 42 posts in An Bord Plean&aacute;la to make sure it is resourced.  I am considering a further workforce plan in conjunction with the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, to determine what additional resources can be put in place.  We want this done quickly.  The terms of reference are broad enough to cover any of the matters in the public domain right now.  I am happy to share them.  We will publish them because we need transparency in this process.</p></speech>

One of the most important recommendations of the 2016 review of An Bord Plean&aacute;la that is as yet unimplemented is the recommendation that all future appointments to the board be made through the Public Appointments Service.  Particularly in the current context, it would be a very wise move.  Could the Minister commit to doing that during his time in office?</p>  <p>  Given that the last internal report initiated by one of the Minister's predecessors into allegations of planning impropriety, the Mulcahy report into certain planning matters in Donegal, still has not been published, will the Minister commit to publishing it and, crucially, the report of the senior counsel review into the matters concerning An Bord Plean&aacute;la?  I fully welcome and support the Minister's commitment to transparency.  It is many years since Mr. Gerard Convier won his High Court cases with respect to allegations of planning impropriety in Donegal; yet the report, which is on the Minister's desk and has been inherited from two of his predecessors, still has not been published.  Transparency would dictate that the Minister publish it.  Could he give a commitment in that regard and a commitment to publishing his own commissioned report on these matters concerning An Bord Plean&aacute;la?</p></speech>

Applications for housing support are assessed by the relevant local authority in accordance with the eligibility and needs criteria set down in section 20 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 and the associated social housing assessment regulations.  The regulations prescribe maximum net income limits for each local authority in differing bands according to each area concerned, with income being defined and assessed according to a standard household means policy.</p>  <p>  The income bands and the authority area assigned to each were based on an assessment of income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation in the country.</p> <p>A blanket increase of &euro;5,000 was introduced prior to the new system coming into operation.<br/><br/>Housing for All - A new Housing Plan for Ireland, was published in September 2021, as the Deputy knows, and was part of a broad suite of social housing reforms committed to reviewing income eligibility for housing.  The review, which examined the efficiency of the current banding model and income limits applicable to local authorities, has been completed and the Minister is currently considering its findings and expects to make a decision shortly on the recommendations.</p></speech>

The Tipperary County Council cap is &euro;25,000 for a single person and &euro;27,500 for an average family comprising two adults and two children.  These figures have not been reviewed since 2011.  Given the significant increase in rent, and the massive rate of inflation and increase in the cost of living, it is simply not in any way realistic to expect a family of two adults and two children to meet their housing needs and living expenses on an income of &euro;27,500 per year.  It is just not possible.  Will the Minister review this?  He said he has carried out a review, but when will we see it?  This is causing considerable problems, especially given that the cost of renting an average four-bedroom house in County Tipperary is approximately &euro;1,200 per month., meaning that a family with an income of &euro;28,000 is expected to pay 51% of their income towards the rental of a property.  This is just not possible.  It is inhumane and should not be accepted.  The review is eagerly awaited.</p></speech>

That is why the Department and Minister have initiated a review under Housing for All.  It also includes the context of the wider global interventions we are making in housing from the record level of social housing construction to the affordability measures from direct purchase and shared equity and our new cost-rental model, which will be a game changer in terms of giving people secure tenure below market rental rates.  All of those interventions have to be judged with this review.</p>  <p>  We should consider the scale of Housing for All.  There will be &euro;4 billion in multi-annual funding for constructing a record level of housing.  The Minister has to base that on the increase in rents which are capped by the new interventions and a number of items of legislation we introduced to protect renters throughout the Covid pandemic and ensure they would not be evicted.  The review will be judged on shortly.</p></speech>

Housing for All is a totally inappropriate name.  In the face of significant increases in rent across County Tipperary and, as I said, a considerable increase in the cost of living, the income limits are wholly inappropriate.  I call on the Minister to act as a matter of urgency.  We keep talking about aspirations and good intentions, but they will not house people.  People cannot afford their rent and cannot avail of HAP.</p><p>According to information on <i>daft.ie</i>, just 60 properties are available to rent in the entire county of Tipperary, from Carrick-on-Suir to Lorrha.  Tipperary is a huge county.  There are only four properties available in my town of Clonmel.  There are 3,521 on an approved housing list waiting for housing in Tiobraid &Aacute;rann.  As I said, people cannot get places to rent.  It is a huge problem and needs to be dealt with.  The national average listed rent is now &euro;908, an increase of 61% from the lowest rate.  The property rental crisis is now at its worst level ever.  My office and every other Teachta's office is overrun with people and we cannot do anything for them.  The new strategy is called Housing for All, but housing for who and when?  Cad a dh&eacute;anfaimid feasta gan adhmad, n&oacute; cad a dh&eacute;anfaimid feasta gan teach?</p></speech>

Many people in our society are unable to reach the threshold to get a mortgage.  That is why we have a record level of affordable housing investment to meet that need.  Housing for All is the most appropriate name for a document to capture society and respond to the needs of the demographic change in society I can ever see.  There is investment behind that.  As I said, the review has been completed.  The Minister is assessing it and will make decisions in the context of the record levels of affordable housing that are being provided to the State, as well social housing.  That is what the document will be judged on.</p></speech>

The strategy sets out, over four pathways, a broad suite of measures to achieve its policy objectives, together with a financial commitment of in excess of &euro;4 billion per annum.  A suite of measures under way in the pathway to address vacancy and the efficient use of housing stock includes the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe towns fund, as referenced by the Deputy, which will be delivered by local authorities for the provision of serviced sites housing to attract people to build their own homes and support the refurbishment of vacant properties.  This will enable people to live in small towns and villages in a sustainable way.</p>  <p>   The consideration of the approach to the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe towns fund is at an advanced stage, including the scope and appropriate timeframes, and will be launched very shortly.  As Deputy Matthews said, this is an important fund from the Government and one which will breathe new life into towns and villages.  A direct payment will enhance the viability of bringing vacant and derelict stock back into residential use.  It is important to breathe life into towns and villages across the country.  We look forward to launching this fund later on this year.  I look forward to seeing applications coming in from the 31 local authorities.</p></speech>

I also recognise that Housing for All is an extensive and significant housing policy document that encompasses a massive range of housing, including social, affordable and private.  That needs to be acknowledged, as well as the fact that success is being delivered within that.</p>  <p>  A committee recently carried out an extensive series of meetings on dereliction, vacancy and regeneration, and how we can bring building stock back into life and concentrate not just on buildings in towns but also deliver nicer public areas and address transport to and through those towns as we bring life back into our towns and villages across the country.  Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe will definitely support that.</p>  <p>  Another area we have to examine is the fact that we know where the dereliction is and we are getting more and more information on vacancies.  As the census reports and local property tax returns come in, we will have better information on that.  We know where the derelict properties are and why we need to address that.  We know it makes perfect sense and that many people now want to live in towns and villages, given working from home, digitisation and improved transport throughout rural Ireland coming on stream.</p>  <p>  We also need to examine how we will do this.  The current building regulations are comprehensive and vitally important, but they put an extra layer of difficulty on developers as they try to bring upper floors and second and third stories back into use.  We need to examine the regulations, not in any way to reduce the regulations or standards but to simplify the process and make it easier for people to carry out that work.</p></speech>

We are working through matters with the Directorate General for Competition in respect of state aid.  There is a similar scheme in Sweden that was successful.  What we have to do is notify that, which we are doing.  I expect that we will launch it in the coming weeks.  There will be a lead-in time, so I cannot give a figure for how much will be drawn down this year.  The predominance of it will probably start from next year.  All details of the scheme will be published.  We will hold a briefing before that.  We received Cabinet approval on Tuesday in respect of moving forward to the next stage.</p></speech>

There will be two strings to it.  One string will involve looking at a reduced cost of self-build in terms of serviced sites, which is very important for the system, while the second will relate to the refurbishment of vacant properties.  There is evidence to be seen around the country in respect of how many vacant properties there are.  That is a potential we have to tap into and bring back into use.  There is a target of 2,000 homes being brought back into use by 2025.  Those direct payments will defray VAT, development levies and the building regulations.  However, we have to be careful regarding the standards to which we are delivering housing in this country.  We have the best quality housing to the best accreditation in terms of energy and regulation and we have to be careful that we do not compromise our standards in the context of that role.</p></speech>

I am glad the Minister stated the fund will be launched shortly.  I look forward to the detail on that.  I have brought forward a Bill that considers how we can streamline the regulation process as well.  That is very much part of it.  It is good that the Government recognises that and has committed substantial funding to it.  We also need to consider how we do this in the context of either private owners who want to do this or those who wish to develop second and third storeys.  It is important that the whole pattern of how we do this is considered.  I look forward to discussing those regulations and suggestions with the Minister at a later date.</p></speech>

What progress has been made on that scheme?  I do not know whether that question was answered in reply to Deputy Christopher O'Sullivan.  There is much high-density development.

There is a fund to which the Government has committed &euro;500 million between cities and towns.  The Deputy is 100% correct.  There are approximately 80,000 planning permissions that have not been activated, many of which are for high-density development or in city areas.  The Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe cities fund will be focused at five cities, namely, Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford.  I brought the proposal and memo to Cabinet on Tuesday and we got approval to move to the next stage.  That means that within a matter of weeks, we will be launching an open call on the fund.  It will provide real assistance for owner-occupiers.  It will create viability within those developments.  It will be an open call for people to come forward with their proposals, on the condition that those proposals are built out.  It will be done on an open-book basis.  I know this is something for which the Deputy has advocated strongly, and rightly so because this speaks to ensuring we have compact urban growth and that we actually get some of these sites developed, with people and families living on them.  We are only weeks away from the launch.  I again thank the Deputy for his interest in this matter.</p></speech>

There is a shortage of affordable homes to rent or purchase in parts of the county, especially in towns such as Westport, Castlebar and Ballina.  The national affordable housing delivery targets were published but I was disappointed to see that Mayo County Council was excluded and that the Department&rsquo;s five-year targets were allocated to only 18 local authorities.  No scheme has been approved in Mayo County Council to provide affordable housing at present and that is having a negative impact on future economic development in the county.</p></reply>

I am anxious that all counties can participate in the affordable housing fund.  They can do so should relevant schemes be brought forward.  I asked all local authorities, including Mayo County Council, to prepare housing delivery action plans, which they have done.  Each authority was asked to assess the level of housing demand with affordability constraint projected for their area using a common tool, namely, the housing need and demand assessment tool.  Local authorities with a strong and identified affordable housing need were asked to prepare affordable delivery action plans and were set five-year affordable delivery targets.</p>  <p>  An identified level of affordable housing need arises where, of the projected housing need in the county, more than 5% of new households would not qualify.  The level of affordability constrained need in Mayo is assessed at below 5% although, in fairness, we have not constrained it to being county-wide.  I understand there are localised affordability issues, particularly in Westport and also potentially in Ballina.  We are happy to consider those issues.  Where local authorities have localised affordability measures, as is the case in the two towns to which I referred, they can still apply to the Department for funding to develop affordable housing schemes if they can demonstrate that an affordable scheme is needed to address those localised affordability challenges and they can meet the criteria for the fund.  I am confident that can be done.</p>  <p>  I will come back in on the Deputy&rsquo;s supplementary question to specifically inform him of the interaction between my Department and Mayo County Council.  We are engaging with it right now - we did so as recently as yesterday - regarding the potential development of affordable housing schemes in Mayo.  We have offered assistance to the county council, as we do to all local authorities if they are bringing in schemes that are specific to particular areas within the county.  The county he represents is a large one and there may not be an affordability constraint in the context of the whole county but, within it, there may be such a  constraint.  Those are the ones we want to ensure come into the scheme.</p></speech>

As he outlined, the issue for young people and families seeking home ownership and trying to get onto the property ladder is that the average house price in Mayo is below the 5% affordability constraint for access to the affordability scheme.  As he outlined, the issue boils down to the calculations on a county-wide basis.  Mayo has the fourth-lowest market house price in the country but that is certainly not reflective of the open market price of new-build homes in areas such as Westport, Castlebar and Ballina.  Some of these A-rated new premises are on the market for between &euro;270,000 and &euro;350,000.</p>  <p>  I am delighted to see Mayo County Council has been proactive.  It reached out to the public in Mayo, seeking information to understand better the demand for affordable housing, including locations of choice and the affordability constraints of potential applicants.  The threshold for social housing in Mayo is &euro;25,000.  Many people are above that threshold but caught within the squeezed-middle bracket.  It is important that we respond to these pressure areas.  Mayo has significant issues in respect of vacancy and dereliction.  Increasing housing supply in the area would be an important step forward.</p></speech>

We have to tackle the scourge of vacancy and dereliction and we are going to do so.  That fund will come out very soon.</p><p>As regards Mayo in particular, in June 2021 a scheme was submitted for 25 homes in Westport under the previous fund, namely, the serviced sites fund.</p> <p>We have told Mayo County Council that it can resubmit that to the new fund and I understand work is ongoing between my Department and the council on that.</p> <p> KPMG is doing some work for Mayo County Council on the future analytics side, to prove the affordability constraint in other areas.  Mayo County Council has asked for a meeting, to which we have agreed, but it asked that it would happen after the work with KPMG is concluded.  I understand that work will conclude this month and we are happy to meet with Mayo County Council in June, once it has received that data.</p> <p> The fund is open.  We have issued an open call for people to apply.  Finally, from 1 July this year the first home shared equity scheme will be open for first-time buyers.  We believe in home ownership.  That scheme will be country wide, right across the 26 counties and it will give people choice too.  </p> <p> Specifically on Mayo's applications to the fund, we are working with the council on a positive basis because I want to see schemes come in from Mayo.  </p></speech>

It is hugely important.  We have a very good housing team in the local authority and I am working closely with that team.  However, housing policy in Mayo has been dictated by financial interests rather than by the needs of the locality and that certainly needs to be reformed.  We should pursue affordable housing initiatives not based on the risk or the cost but based on the needs of people who want home ownership.  With social housing, councils get 100% reimbursement whereas the cost of affordable housing is met by the councils and they carry the risk.  That is the danger here for local authorities; they want to implement a scheme but they want support from the Department.  I thank the Minister for his engagement and look forward to working with him on this in the coming weeks.</p></speech>

As I said already, where schemes can be brought forward, we want them.  We have also issued a call on advance purchase for schemes that are currently being built or being built out and we have received six or seven proposals on that already, which will see homes delivered this year.  In urban centres the LDA, through Project Tosaigh, will deliver hundreds more affordable purchase and cost rental units this year and quite a lot into 2023 too.  Deputy Dillon can be assured that we will continue this work and I thank him for his engagement and support.</p>  <p>  In response to Deputy &Oacute; Broin's supplementary question, the cost rental affordable regulations were laid before the Houses.  They are done and that national scheme is in place.  The regulations for affordable purchase through local authorities were concluded a number of weeks ago and I would expect that they have been laid before the House but will double check.  Our work is concluded on that.  The final piece that we need to do relates to the first home shared equity, which we are wrapping up right now.  As soon as we have the criteria for that, we will lay them before the Houses.  </p>  <p>  I will double check in relation to the affordable purchase regulations.  We have concluded them and I have signed off on them.  I would expect they are there-----</p></speech>

The regulations on affordable rental through cost rental have been laid as well.  The final piece of work or the other leg to the stool relates to the first home shared equity and that work will conclude in the next few weeks.  We will be publishing that and will have an extensive public information campaign on it because this Government supports home ownership.  All three parties in the Government want to make sure that affordable housing is central to our housing response and we are making progress in that regard.</p></speech>

Deputy O'Sullivan has advocated for this very strongly and we all recognise the importance of the Government giving assistance to those who can bring vacant and empty homes in our towns and villages back into use.  We are within weeks of launching that fund.  It will be managed through our local authorities.  The Ministers of State, Deputies Burke and Noonan, and I want to make sure the process is as simple as possible.  It will be done by way of a grant scheme for home owners.</p>  <p>  Right across our country we have a resource in the form of empty housing stock that can breathe life back into our towns and villages and we should use it.  Working this fund right the way through has been quite complex but we are nearly there on it.  We got Cabinet approval on the fund itself on Tuesday last and will now move the cities and towns fund forward.  It is a significant investment on behalf of the Exchequer, to the tune of &euro;500 million.  This will run between now and 2026 and we want to make sure it works.  </p>  <p>  The local authorities have been very supportive of this and will administer the fund and the applications.  I want the application process to be simple and clear for people.  This is another avenue through which we can ensure that our young and not-so-young people who aspire to owning their own homes and living in their own areas will be able to do so.  It also speaks, and rightly so, to the policy that the Ministers of State, Deputies Burke and Noonan, launched recently, the town centre first initiative and supporting that.  Our aim is to support growth within our towns and villages and this is a really significant step forward by this Government.  This is a strong commitment in Housing for All and in the programme for Government and the fund will be launched within a matter of weeks.  I thank Deputy O'Sullivan for his support and for advocating for these changes on behalf of his own constituents.</p></speech>

I am regularly asked when Cro&iacute; Conaithe funding and finance will be made available, particularly by single people who really see this as an opportunity to get on the property ladder or get a house for themselves, as well as by young couples.  What we are struggling with at constituency level is directing people towards proper information.  The sooner we can get detailed information, with FAQs on different aspects of the scheme, the better.  We can then direct people who see this scheme as a potential solution to that information.</p></speech>

There will be public information campaign on the scheme.  There is a lot of interest among Government and Opposition Deputies in this fund.  We will make sure all Deputies receive the relevant information.  Local authorities will be managing the scheme.</p>  <p>  I am glad that Deputy O'Sullivan mentioned single people, a cohort of people who find the current housing situation acutely challenging.  That is why we have made very significant changes to the local authority home loan scheme.  We have increased the limits for single people.  The Cro&iacute; Conaithe fund will apply to single people.  It will also, as is the case with all of the policies the Department has brought forward, be underpinned by the fresh start principle and will apply to people whose lives may have changed through divorce or separation and who do not have any interest in other properties.  They are entitled to a fresh start too and that will happen through this policy and through the first home shared equity scheme too.  It is really important that we recognise changes in our society, including changes to family types.  </p>  <p>  This fund will really help people and as I said, we are only a matter of weeks away from launching it.  We will make sure all of the relevant information is available.  I thank Deputy O'Sullivan and others for their support on this.  This could be a game changer for regional Ireland in particular and for towns and villages right across the country.  </p></speech>

It could increase footfall on our high streets.  At the moment, there are some villages and towns experiencing 50% to 60% vacancy rates on their high streets.</p>  <p>  Another important issue is the fact that a lot of over-the-shop premises can be quite difficult to work with.  I have seen many that are in quite a state of disrepair and access can be a real issue.  There are also complications around fire certificates and other certification requirements.  I ask the Minister to provide detail on the situation regarding premises that can be difficult to work with in terms of access and certification.  Is there a plan in place to ensure that dealing with those issues is as smooth as possible?</p></speech>

That has not been cracked yet in respect of the regulations.  We have a group working on that, particularly on fire regulations and so on.  It will conclude its work on that very shortly.  We will not wait for that to be done to get Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe launched.  There are vacant homes on the main street in Clonakilty, in Deputy O'Sullivan's constituency, and in Banagher, County Offaly.  They are homes that were residences before.  I see the fund working first for them, and then I want to get the above-shop units back in place because the cost of bringing a lot of them back into use is prohibitive for people.  Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe will be launched very shortly.  The work on access, egress and fire certification is being undertaken by an expert group in the Department, including stakeholders within the sector.  That work will conclude this year.  We will not wait to launch Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe.  We want to launch it soon because there are homes out there that we can get working on pretty much straight away.  The resource of above-shop units is one not just within our towns and villages; we see above-commercial-premises units within our cities as well.  We have made changes in planning and I have extended the regulations for conversion of commercial buildings, including now conversion of former public houses to residential units without the need for planning permission.  That has been done really successfully, particularly in two counties I mentioned, Waterford and Limerick, which have really led the way on this.  We are encouraging all counties to do the same.</p></speech>

While significant work has been done, there is still considerably more work to be done.  There are a myriad of reasons for the increase, including landlords leaving the market, which I think the Minister referred to, and HAP availability decreasing.  There are a significant number of challenges that we are attempting to address.</p>  <p>  Contrary to what is perhaps suggested by the question, there is no national policy that prevents local authorities from providing assistance until a person has become homeless.  As set out in Housing for All, the Government is committed to a housing-led approach as the primary response to all forms of homelessness.  This includes the prevention of loss of existing housing.  We actively encourage local authorities to undertake prevention measures.  For example, Housing for All provides for enhancement of the provision of targeted prevention and early intervention services for families and children who are at risk of homelessness through a co-ordinated multi-agency response, with the Department, the HSE, Tusla and local authorities leading in this area.  Local authorities already oversee a range of homelessness prevention and tenancy sustainment measures.  Many of these services, including those operated on behalf of local authorities by NGOs, are funded by our Department.  These include Threshold's tenancy protection service.  This service has been instrumental in preventing homelessness in the first instance and in supporting people to remain in their homes.  Our Department also funds the HAP place finder service, which plays a vital role in keeping families out of homelessness and housing families who find themselves in emergency accommodation.</p>  <p>  All additional measures we can take to address the rise in homelessness are being actively pursued by the Government.</p></speech>

The officer will offer full, proper assistance only when a person or family find themselves without a home.  Cork County Council has been to the fore in bringing voids back into the social housing stock and in delivering social housing in general.  The Minister will visit Skibbereen next week and the 50 social houses there and the 100 social houses in Clonakilty that are being delivered for families that need them.  However, there are families who find themselves only a matter of weeks from being without a home because of the sale of a property, for example.  They are not able to avail of the county council's homeless services and emergency accommodation.  The likes of Novas are under serious pressure to deliver such services, so something needs to change in that regard.</p></speech>

I dealt with a woman to whom this happened the other day.  She broke the agreement on the basis of being in hospital.  She is dealing with eviction and the money has been sought upfront.  There were legacy arrears of &euro;1,600.  It is a huge issue and something that absolutely needs to be addressed.</p></speech>

Once that is validated, Cork City Council or Cork County Council will support the tenant with services such as HAP place finder.  If a tenant is in arrears, Cork local authorities may refer to MABS and explore if a hardship clause can be used, if the landlord can be engaged with, etc.  If a tenant has not received the notice to quit but is expecting one, the tenant must remain in the property to receive assistance if and when the notice to quit is issued.  The local authority should then proceed to provide support - for example, referral to Threshold.  As I said in my opening response, I think Cork County Council, in the Deputy's area, does engage.</p>  <p>  The Deputy referred to the voids programme.  The Minister will announce a new voids programme next week for social housing tenants.  This will include the delivery of 100 social housing units in Clonakilty.  I hope that that provides a response to the Deputy's specific question.</p>  <p>  In response to Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute;'s question, it would be useful if the Deputy could provide details of the specific issue he raises.  I think there should be some discretion there, but if he could provide us with details of that issue, we will-----</p></speech>

It is HAP central that is saying that that is the case from February, that no one who breaks an agreement will get a new one and that no new tenant can enter into a brand new agreement.

The council would be at the very top if there were a league table.  The Minister of State has quite correctly read out the policy as to when the place finder mechanism should kick in.  I am saying we do not always see that on the ground.  Quite often we see instances in which people are two, three or four weeks away from having to vacate a property and the place finder mechanism that local authorities have does not seem to assist as it should.  Novas and Threshold, as was said, have big caseloads to deal with, unfortunately.  Maybe the question should be rephrased to ensure that the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage ensures that local authorities implement that policy where a notice to quit is demonstrated and that the place finder service does everything possible to ensure that accommodation is found.</p></speech>

Our Department funds Threshold, so if the Deputy and clients are not finding this to be the case on the ground, it should be the case.  They should have that support immediately, and in advance if they are at risk of homelessness or find themselves with a notice to quit.  It is critical that all local authorities have that standardised approach.</p></speech>

All accommodation and housing options are being examined by the task force.  These include the medium-term delivery of modular and volumetric accommodation, refurbishing or reconfiguring vacant buildings and stimulating and accelerating construction of new permanent-build homes.  The Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, recently brought proposals to the Government for approval in this regard.  These proposals include establishing an emergency vacant housing delivery unit in the Local Government Management Agency to support refurbishment of vacant buildings, assigning a director of service and a small team to co-ordinate the local response between agencies and community groups supporting the provision of services to Ukrainians, requesting each local authority to scope the refurbishment of at least one building capable of accommodating multiple families in their area and establishing a clearing house to resolve issues associated with planning permissions granted but not yet activated - these could be infrastructural issues such as water and wastewater.</p> <p> Further options will be brought to the Government in the coming weeks and will be developed.</p> <p> I refer to issues around emergency beds in each local authority area as well.  Certainly in my local authority area, there is quite a considerable amount of activity and the local authority is being very proactive in trying to deliver both the emergency shorter-term options and longer-term ones.</p> <p> To reassure the Deputy, this is working in parallel with Housing for All.  We are quite clear that the Housing for All targets will be delivered as well in tandem with this, which is an immense humanitarian challenge right across Europe.  The Government is determined to play a critical role in trying to support these families fleeing this terrible situation.</p></speech>

There are 62,000 holiday homes and there is a window of opportunity to potentially bring them into use.  It probably would need some level of payment though, to attract some of those 62,000 into use.  They would be really valuable.</p>  <p>  I welcome the fact that the Minister of State has an emergency vacant housing delivery unit, he has the Office of Public Works, OPW, looking at modular building and he has a clearing house in his own Department but it seems a quite complex structure.  Should we not be going for a more focused singularly responsible leader for all of this response, whether it be modular, activating vacant property or removing infrastructural blockages and giving that body the authority to modify schemes, such as the lease scheme, in order that one could have a more speedy response without bureaucracy?</p></speech>

The task force that the Government has set up, which will meet next week, and the response immediately is being led by the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth but all Departments are playing a significant role in that regard.</p>  <p>  The issue of holiday homes is being considered and the subcommittee will look at that as well.  I suppose what we are in is a unique situation unprecedented in our time.  We have always had issues with refugees in this country and have not always dealt with them adequately.  The response by Government now has been focused and determined.</p>  <p>  Certainly, the point made by the Deputy in relation to that singular approach is substantially what we are doing in government but the role at local level by local authorities is critical here.  That communication level, from the Government response right down to local authorities, is playing a considerable and significant role in trying to address this crisis.</p></speech>

It is a matter for the relevant planning authority, as the Deputy quite rightly pointed out, to agree to take in charge any individual housing estate.</p>  <p>  When taking in charge an estate under section 180 of the Act, the planning authority agrees to take in charge the roads, footpaths, public lighting and open spaces associated with the development.  With regard to water-related infrastructure such as sewers, water mains or service connections within the attendant grounds of a development, these, which are initially taken in charge by the planning authority, must then be transferred to Irish Water by ministerial order pursuant to section 12 of the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013.</p>  <p>  Ultimately, progression of individual developments through the taking-in-charge process is a matter for the relevant housing developer, the residents in such developments and the relevant local authorities following the procedures set out clearly in section 180 of the Act.</p>  <p>  Under section 30 of the Act, I, in my role as Minister of State with responsibility for planning, and the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, are precluded from exercising any power or control in relation to any particular case with which a planning authority or the board is concerned.</p></speech>

Families and homeowners with whom I have been in contact in towns such as Clonakilty, Kinsale and Skibbereen are being left in limbo and somebody needs to step up to help them.  The infrastructure in their housing estate is either deficient or deteriorating and the original developer in many cases is no longer around.  The local authority is refusing to take responsibility for the estate until existing issues, which would cost tens of thousands of euro to rectify, are resolved.</p>  <p>  Currently, there is no way out for these families.  After years of campaigning, and in a piecemeal fashion, some of these issues eventually get solved.</p>  <p>  The situation is compounded by the families having to pay property tax but not receiving services that they need.

The problem is this system is set up to leave nobody responsible.  Developers, local authorities, Irish Water and the Department are all playing pass the parcel while families in some cases cannot let their children out to play or older residents cannot walk because of the crumbling footpaths and broken lighting.  This type of <i>laissez-faire</i>approach defines housing policy.  This is a situation where the Minister of State could make a concrete difference to families in residential estates across the country.</p><p>I am also wondering what practical measures the Minister of State is taking to prevent this happening in the future and what regulation enforcement is in place to ensure developers put in place and maintain the infrastructure they should.</p></speech>

I mentioned that we had almost 3,000 ghost estates in this country, and we have changed the law to ensure that this does not happen again.  There are mechanisms to ensure that developers have bonds in place that guarantee that planning permissions will be completed as prescribed.  The local authority has the independence to hold them to account on that.  That process is clearly set out in legislation.  Also, subsequent to that and with regard to the taking-in-charge process, it is clearly set out in the Act that residents can request the local authority to take estates in charge.</p>  <p>  The Department has had huge funding streams over the last decade to try to respond to massive remediation plans to install infrastructure in estates throughout the country.  Ultimately, however, it is the responsibility of the local authority to do that and to hold to account developers who are required to finish estates to the level that is prescribed in the planning permission.</p></speech>

We had a debate last night about rents and one matter that I was not able to put on the record then was the fact that the Government provides nearly &euro;1 billion in direct rental support to families, and rightly so.  Approximately &euro;585 million goes to HAP.  Sometimes that is forgotten and others try to paint it as some type of subsidy to the private landlord sector.  It is not.  The payments are supports that go to real families.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge the Deputy's question and I will give him an update on the current position.  There is no question but that there are pressures due to rising rents.  We have introduced the 2% rent cap and that is taking effect.  That aside, we commit to ensuring that HAP levels are adequate to support vulnerable households while we increase the supply of social housing.  I want to see people exiting HAP and going into permanent homes.  There were approximately 4,300 exits from HAP into other social houses in 2021, which is good.  We are seeing a substantial reduction in the number of increases within the HAP.  Fundamentally, there is a top-up payment of 20% above the maximum limits and up to 50% in the Dublin region for those households either in or in immediate risk of homelessness.</p>  <p>  However, under Housing for All we have committed to undertake an analytical exercise to examine whether an increase in the level of the 20% discretion available to all local authorities and the discretion in the four Dublin local authorities is required to maintain adequate support for families.  The Housing Agency was undertaking this work and has completed it.  The review has been submitted and it is with my Department at present.  I expect to receive the recommendations following the analysis of the Housing Agency's work by the Department.  That will conclude shortly and I will be engaging with the Oireachtas joint committee through its Chairman, Deputy Matthews, and members of the committee.  That work is nearing conclusion.</p>  <p>  I fully recognise that the increases in rent and the HAP limits pose problems, and particularly acutely in the Deputy's area of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown.  We want to help not just by increasing the HAP, which I am open to doing based on the analytical data that come through, but also by providing permanent homes for people.  To reiterate, there was a significant number of exits, 4,587, from HAP into other social houses in 2021.</p></speech>

We have to give people options.  However, this is a matter of urgency.  I am not exaggerating.  Everybody who is approaching me, and the number has been increasing over the last few months, are doing so often because they are being evicted from HAP tenancies.  By the way, I appeal to the Minister on that ground.  If people are being evicted from HAP tenancies on grounds of sale, the local authorities should just buy those properties straight away.  Why would they not?  If they are for sale and one can prevent people being made homeless, just buy them so we do not have the same people knocking on the council's door and saying they are homeless.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, there is a massive gap between the HAP limits and the actual rents.  The HAP increases must be introduced as a matter of urgency.  Otherwise the numbers going into homeless accommodation are going to increase.  Even the place finder service is sending people out to look at places which the HAP limits would not allow them to view.  It is ridiculous at this point.  They have to be increased as a matter of urgency.  Otherwise people who are looking for a rental property and do not have a roof over their heads or are facing eviction are in really deep trouble.</p></speech>

I represent Dublin Fingal and I meet people and talk to tenants all the time.  It is difficult.  We are making progress in that regard by increasing the supply of permanent homes.  That is very important because we need a supply-led and housing-led response to homelessness.</p><p>To answer the Deputy's question specifically, I am treating this as a matter of urgency.  I required the Housing Agency to do a piece of work, and the Deputy would expect me to do that, so that what we do is based on sound analytical evidence.  As I said in response to earlier questions, I have told all local authorities by way of a circular that they can acquire homes to prevent people going into homelessness, particularly where there are HAP and RAS tenancies.  All 31 local authorities, including D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, know that because the circular has been issued, and I encourage local authorities to do so.  We are providing the finance for that to happen.  That acquisition with the tenant <i>in situ</i>is available now.</p><p>I will keep the Deputy informed and up to date with regard to the review and when we are bringing forward any changes to HAP.  I want to do that as quickly as possible, but it must be based on sound evidence.  I will do that.  I recognise the Deputy's genuine concerns in this regard and I thank him for tabling the question.</p></speech>

By the way, and we will discuss this later, we should be looking for purchases in excess of 10% in private developments as well, given the situation we are now facing and to increase the options for people.  Apart from that, I should also mention the income thresholds, because I probably will not get a chance to mention this anywhere else.  The Minister could respond on that.  Seriously, there are many people who are caught in limbo.  They are just over the threshold and as a result cannot even get HAP support, never mind get a council house.  Something has to be done about that as a matter of urgency.  These people are caught.  I am aware of one woman who has been in emergency accommodation for three and a half years.  She is working in a State agency and now she is not entitled to housing support, but her income would not get anywhere near the local rents.  We need to look at the things that are happening to people and tailor the policy to that.</p></speech>

That is a definite difficulty that will lead to homelessness.  Beyond that, there is an issue I brought up with the Minister previously.  We have to look at the means assessment being carried out now for over a year in respect of getting onto the housing list.  It is leading to people not getting on the list, having severe difficulties and even some people not getting houses.  We must look at the means by which we are doing that.  The way it was done previously, by taking a four-week period of wages, meant one was not thrown by certain anomalies that can occur over a 12-month period.</p></speech>

I am looking at the circular again.  One of the conditions is where the property is one of the priority categories in Circular 02/2022, which was one-bedroom and four-bedroom properties or properties for disability adaptations.  Does that mean two-bedroom or three-bedroom properties would be excluded under the revised circular?  Clarification would be helpful.  The circular also states that proposals for acquisition by approved housing bodies should continue to be submitted to the capital advance leasing facility, CALF, team in the Department in the normal manner.</p> <p>Does this mean a CALF acquisition might provide a solution where a local authority acquisition would not meet the criteria as the Minister has set out?  Is this something we should be exploring?</p></speech>

In response to other questions we said the work is nearing conclusion.  I received a submission and sought further changes to it.  It has gone back to the officials and we will have it very shortly.  This is with regard to social housing limits throughout the country.  A very important measure the Government has brought forward is a new form of tenure in cost rental.  This is also in the Deputy's constituency.  We have seen the first tenants in place paying approximately 50% of market rent.  The tenancies in the development are secure as they are for 70 years.  There are also many others.  We have hundreds of cost rental tenancies.  I want to see it expanded to thousands of tenancies.  People over the social housing limits can get State-backed secure affordable tenancies.  This is happening with cost rental.  We are reviewing it and I am close to concluding it with regard to the social housing limits.</p><p>On purchase and tenant <i>in situ</i>I want to say very clearly that one-bed accommodation is something we are acutely aware of.  We all know the predominance of single people in our homeless numbers.  We need to focus on this.  We also need to focus on larger families and four-bed accommodation.  This does not exclude two-bed and three-bed accommodation.  Approved housing bodies are referenced in it by way of accessing CALF finance where they see opportunities that may be there.  It may make more sense for an approved housing body to do this in an area and if so we will do that.</p><p>Part V was increased in the Affordable Housing Act.  I know the Deputy had issues with it and that is fine but we have 10% social accommodation and 10% affordable accommodation in new tenancies.  We need to increase the supply and we are doing so.  We are reviewing it and nearing a conclusion.  We are not just reviewing it as we are looking at changes to social housing limits and how they will fit in with affordable and cost rental accommodation.  This is important.  We need more and more families in affordable cost rental accommodation and affordable purchase accommodation.</p></speech>

The local infrastructure housing activation fund would contribute just over &euro;2,000 per unit to trigger it.  It seems that it is stuck.

This enables the accelerated delivery of housing on key development sites in urban areas of high housing demand, adding to supply, a crucial factor in terms of moderating house prices.  LIHAF projects often involve complex, large-scale public infrastructure developments which pave the way for associated housing developments.  This requires extensive design, planning, public consultation and procurement processes in advance of the projects moving to construction.</p>  <p>  In respect of the Midleton Water Rock project, which includes roads and waste water infrastructure, Cork County Council has confirmed that the most economically advantageous tenderer for the infrastructure project construction works has been identified following a two-stage tender process.  Pre-contract correspondence is ongoing between Cork County Council and the most economically advantageous tenderer and this process is taking longer to finalise than had been anticipated.  I am, however, informed that Cork County Council and the LIHAF landowners have completed advance clearance works, which will enable commencement of the main contract works following the successful conclusion of the pre-contract discussions.  I understand that every effort is being made by Cork County Council to ensure all requirements are satisfied so that the tender process can be progressed and the works commence in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  This is significant funding to deliver significant units in Cork.  The Minister was in discussions yesterday with Deputy Stanton on this issue to try to move it along.  It is a very important activation fund.  This country really has to activate planning permissions and get projects on the ground.  LIHAF is one key component of providing infrastructure to do so.</p></speech>

For &euro;2,000 each there would be 2,500 homes.  It seems one hand of government is trying to push it along and another is trying to block it.  Funding for the proposed upgrade of the N25 was dropped and now TII is saying it is inappropriate to go ahead with the development.  We now have a real problem.

The arms of the State have to work together to deliver key infrastructural projects such as this.

Increasing housing supply and addressing homelessness is a priority for the Government and we will continue to support all local authorities, including Galway City Council and Galway County Council, to deliver on this agenda.  Housing For All sets out national housing policy and implementation measures up to 2030.  In September 2021, the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, issued social housing targets to each local authority, including Galway City Council and Galway County Council, setting out build and leasing targets over the next five years. </p>  <p>  A key action of Housing for All is that local authorities will develop and submit housing delivery action plans to include details of social and affordable housing delivery.  All local authorities submitted their action plans in December and the Department is now working closely with the local authorities to review and finalise the plans.  The plans will be published by local authorities before the end of the second quarter of the year.</p>  <p>  Under Housing for All, the funding is in place to support both Galway local authorities, including the approved housing bodies with which they work.  We are keen that they progress their social housing schemes as quickly as possible and that they receive the support of public representatives in the advancement of their programmes.  The Department has provided significant resources to both councils in order to address the issues raised by the task force.  To date in 2022, the task force has met once and three further meetings are scheduled this year, with the next one being this month on 10 May.</p>  <p>  Housing For All recognises the significant role that approved housing bodies have played and continue to play as partners in social housing delivery.  We are also aware of the challenges presented to the CALF funding model in certain areas outside the main urban centres where rent levels are lower.  Commitment 4.10 of Housing For All is a specific action to review the structure of the payment and availability CALF funding model.  This review will determine whether the funding model should be adjusted to support delivery by the approved housing body sector in a wider range of areas and what options might be available to enable this.  Work is under way on this review by the Department with the support of the Housing Agency and it is on track to be completed by the fourth quarter of this year.</p>  <p>  The Department is closely monitoring the issue of homelessness, including Traveller homelessness, in Galway city and county.  I understand it is acute and a significant problem.  The Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, is working with the local authorities in this regard.  At the meeting of the Galway social housing task force on 15 February, it was proposed by the Department that a subgroup on homelessness, with a particular focus on Traveller homelessness, be established and report back to the task force.  This subgroup, which has held its first meeting, is chaired by departmental officials, with members also including representatives of both local authorities.  The next meeting of the Galway social housing task force is scheduled for 10 May.</p>  <p>  I might come back specifically on some of the activations on Traveller accommodation in Galway county between this year and last year and some of the funding allocated.  We do have a challenge with Traveller homelessness in Galway that needs to be addressed.</p></speech>

In a contribution I made yesterday I highlighted the acute situation in Galway and the extraordinary rise in rents in the county and city, which have increased by more than 115%.  Homelessness is as acute.  I have a serious concern that the new subgroup will be like the existing task force, which meets and monitors but the situation gets worse.</p> <p>It is monitoring a situation that is becoming unbearable and unsustainable and that calls for serious reflection on our housing policies, not only in Galway but also generally.</p></speech>

Despite serious concerns being voiced by many women and many prominent medics about the relocation of the hospital to the site at St. Vincent's University Hospital in Dublin, the Government is relentlessly pursuing the option of leasing the land on which the hospital will be built instead of owning it outright.  It is very concerning that the deputy chairperson of the HSE board, Professor Deirdre Madden, a leading medical law scholar, and Dr. Sarah McLoughlin, a patient advocate on the board, both dissented from the board's decision to recommend the legal framework.</p>  <p>  Everyone in this House agrees that a new national maternity hospital needs to be built and become operational as soon as possible but expedience cannot be at the cost of rights in any way.  The full range of legally permissible services must be available in the hospital to any qualifying patient.  The minutes of the HSE board meeting of 14 March show that Professor Madden and Dr. McLoughlin expressed concerns at the "legal ownership of the site and building, and the governance and control of the proposed new maternity hospital" and felt that these concerns were not adequately addressed in the revised legal framework.</p>  <p>  It does not make any sense that the Government is going to build a vital piece of health infrastructure at a likely cost of approximately &euro;1 billion on land the State does not own.  The Taoiseach said yesterday that the lease would only cost &euro;10 per year but that does not change the fact that the new hospital will have a private landlord.  The question must be asked once again, because no answers were forthcoming on this issue yesterday from the Taoiseach, as to why the Sisters of Charity and St. Vincent's University Hospital cannot simply gift the land to the State.  It is a simple question.  What is the answer?  Why is the Government accepting this convoluted, messy ownership model that is stoking unease and worry?  What we need is a publicly built maternity hospital on publicly owned land delivering public healthcare services for women at a standard of excellence.  Sin &eacute;.  That is what is required.  This would protect the State's investment and address the concerns of so many who fear that religious dogma could compromise the delivery of healthcare at the hospital.</p>  <p>  We understand from media reports that, among others, the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media raised concerns about this model at Cabinet.  It is incumbent on the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications to give a full answer as to why the Government continues to pursue a model of ownership that does not enjoy the confidence it should.  Will he outline his position?  Is he satisfied with this model of ownership despite the fact that the land will not be owned by the State?</p></speech>

As she rightly stated, what we decided at Cabinet on Tuesday is that it would be very good for us to have this debate in order to have full scrutiny and transparency with all the legal documents because people on all sides and from various different parties are concerned.  It was right and appropriate for us to make the decision that the Minister for Health would go before the Joint Committee on Health and answer every question in order that every possible angle of this matter might be examined.  I fully agree with the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media in this regard.</p><p>There are very different medical views on this matter.  The Deputy quoted one medic versus another.  The vast majority of medics and the wider public recognise that the existing situation in the National Maternity Hospital, as good as that facility is in terms of medical care, is intolerable and that we cannot delay.  The Master of the hospital attended our parliamentary party meeting yesterday and said that even if we went out and commenced work tomorrow, it would be 2030 before we would see a new hospital in operation at St. Vincent's.  Any further delay that would put matters back five, ten or whatever number of years, as we started to look at alternative options, would give rise to real controversy.</p><p>My view is that the legal documentation and the various structures show that there will be no religious interference, which was one of the main concerns I have heard over the years in respect of this matter.  This is clear and transparent.  A good article in <i>The Irish Times</i>today states that legal experts think that if religious interference were allowed, those responsible would rightly be accused of medical negligence.  There are legal structures in place to give reassurance in that regard.</p><p>The issue of how this hospital will operate is a much wider in nature and relates to our voluntary health and voluntary hospital systems.  All three maternity hospitals in Dublin are voluntary hospitals, with structures that in some cases go back over 200 years.  There is a debate separate to the religious issue as to whether we should engage in compulsory purchase of those hospitals and move away from a voluntary hospital system.  There is an argument to be made in that regard, but it has not formed part of the debate to date.  Another article in today's edition of <i>the Irish Independent</i>refers to the fact that the voluntary hospitals are the ones that are currently providing the full range of services, whereas not all public HSE-run hospitals do.  This is a complex and difficult issue in terms of the strengths and benefits of voluntary hospitals versus HSE-run hospitals.  Our voluntary health system has real benefits</p><p>My view is that the national maternity strategy should be central to this because it provides the guiding direction.  The strategy gives me real reassurance and we need to apply it because it recognises that even with the voluntary hospitals, hospital group CEOs will ultimately be accountable to the national director of acute hospitals for all services delivered within the maternity network.  That is an important point.  This is where the actual direction comes from.  What is that direction?  It is for a woman-centred system that is midwife-led rather than consultant-led, with much more care in the community.  This is what we need to focus on delivering at St. Vincent's, Holles Street, the Rotunda, the Coombe, Limerick and every other maternity hospital.  That is the guide as to where we should go and how services should be developed and delivered.</p></speech>

I asked why the Sisters of Charity and St. Vincent's cannot gift this land to the State.  It is as simple as that.  From what the Minister said, it seems that he supports the idea of spending &euro;1 billion of taxpayers' money building a hospital that we all agree is needed on land that is not owned by the State.  Does he agree with the statement that I have not heard a single dissenting voice from anyone who does not believe that the hospital must be in complete public ownership?  That should involve not the creation of a lease arrangement but, rather, the transfer of ownership of the site to the State so that there is no uncertainty or lack of clarity regarding ownership.  These were the Minister's words in opposition.  The difference is that now he has some power to do something about it.  It should not involve the creation of a lease arrangement but rather the transfer of ownership of the site to the State so that there is no uncertainty.  The Minister previously said that the State needed to step up.  It is time for him to step up.  Deputy Hourigan was on the radio yesterday saying that this is an incredibly serious issue.  She said it went to the core of why people voted for the Green Party.  Has the Minister abandoned the position he held, which was that a lease agreement was not acceptable and did not provide the certainty or has he now rolled over to the tune of Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il?</p></speech>

The Government has changed what was set down somewhat.  The lease arrangement was originally for 149 years; it is now for 300 years and will cost &euro;10 a year.  It is my understanding that the Sisters of Charity were asked if they wanted to sell the land.  Their response was that they did not want do so.  My understanding is that they are no longer in the business of healthcare.  The St. Vincent's Healthcare Group has decided, as is its right, to retain its voluntary hospital status and operate this co-located model.  The change made by the Government is that rather than just St. Vincent's and the National Maternity Hospital having board members, there will be three public interest members, and the Minister will appoint the chair.  As stated, we have changed some aspects of the arrangement.</p></speech>

Why is it beyond the capability of this Government - and why was it beyond that of the two previous Fine Gael-led Governments - to countenance a State-owned and controlled national maternity hospital, built on State lands and through the use of State funds?  The Minister once agreed that this was the only credible outcome.  In 2017, he told the D&aacute;il that the new maternity hospital &quot;should involve not the creation of a lease arrangement but rather the transfer of ownership of the site to the State so that there is no uncertainty or lack of clarity on the ownership&quot;.  Has he changed his mind in that regard?  Does he, like the Taoiseach, believe that a lease agreement is practically the same as ownership, so what is the big deal?  Is it only the future of women's healthcare services that is on the line and, of course, a &euro;1 billion investment of public funds.  The Taoiseach made a big thing of the &euro;10 annual rental charge yesterday.  Tellingly, he failed to mention that the actual rent stipulated in the lease agreement is &euro;850,000 per year.  It will be reduced to &euro;10 as long as list of six conditions are complied with, including that the landlord, St. Vincent's Holdings, retains a controlling stake over the use of the hospital.  If these conditions are breached, the rent will revert upwards.  If St. Vincent's Holdings is magnanimously offering an annual rent of &euro;10, can the Minister explain why this punitive penalty clause exists?  It is especially bizarre that a separate legal document - an options agreement - specifically countenances the State purchasing the site.  If everyone agrees that it is legally feasible that the State could buy the site, and that outcome is expressly provided for in legal documents, why is the State not just buying the site?</p><p>There has been a lot of talk about conspiracy theories in recent days, with those who have genuine concerns about this deal being vilified and equated almost to anti-vaxxers or Covid deniers.  This is something I personally find pretty reprehensible.  If we want to talk about conspiracy theories, I have a better one.  An article in <i>The Irish Times</i>today suggests that the Minister of Health has 100% guaranteed that terminations and sterilisations will be available in the new hospital, a guarantee which, as reported by the media, could be relied on in legal proceedings as evidence of the Government's intention concerning the hospital.  That is nonsense.  The only thing that a court will have regard to is the legal documents underpinning the deal.  A Minister's guarantee, unless it is contained in the legal documents, is worthless.</p><p>I have two questions.  Why, when the Minister, Deputy Ryan, once insisted that the State should own the site, is he apparently happy to go along with this deal?  Second, is the rest of his party in agreement with him?</p></speech>

The hospital group decided that it, as a voluntary hospital, wanted to run with the arrangement involving Holles Street and the new board .  That arrangement has changed, with public interest directors being added to the board.  With St. Vincent's saying "No" and with real benefits in a co-located system, the question that arises for the Government is what to do.  Do we look for another hospital or another co-location facility, recognising that we are probably going to have the same issue with the Coombe and Rotunda in time, because the strategy is to move towards the model where our maternity hospitals are co-located?  There are benefits in that regard.  We are agreed on that.  Therefore, the choice for the Government is whether to turn down a 300-year lease at &euro;10 a year, which is akin to ownership.  There is not a material difference between outright ownership and a 300-year lease at that rate.  It is better to progress with that, because there is an urgency around delivering combined health services, rather than going back to the drawing board and waiting the five, ten or 15 years that it tends to take this State, unfortunately, to deliver principal health systems.  We have not built a new maternity hospital probably since the Coombe in the 1950s or Holles Street in the 1930s.  I cannot think of another instance of one being built since then.</p></speech>

We do not build a lot of maternity hospitals, and we are incredibly slow at delivering them.  We need to deliver.  A 300-year lease gives us the reassurances that we need.  The legal structures give real assurance against the risk of religious interference, which, I understand, has been a real concern.  I believe that matter has been addressed.  In my mind, doing nothing, walking away and deciding not take that option would not be the right approach.</p>  <p>  We look forward to the debate at the Oireachtas committee this week and to hearing what the alternative approach is, how we can avoid delay and how we might move forward in another way.  I do not see another way.  It is important that we act.</p>  <p>  Going back to the key point - and I hope the Deputy, as one of the people involved in bringing forward the Sl&aacute;intecare report, agrees with this - I see the national maternity strategy as being centrally connected to it.  Does the Deputy agree that the focus needs to be not only on who owns the hospital but also on how we get a midwife-led, woman-centred maternity system in place?  I do not believe that we have delivered the maternity strategy with the pace and the ambition that is required.  That is where the focus needs to be.  It is not just about whether a 300-year lease constitutes effective ownership.  That is not the key issue for the women of this country.  We need to focus on the care.</p></speech>

This project has been delayed for almost a decade.  Four successive Ministers for Health were incapable of delivering the project in a way that would satisfy the public in terms of the independence of the hospital and the protection of a massive public investment.  The Minister referred to co-location.  Nobody argues about that.  This is about so much more than co-location, however.  It is about a takeover.  Does the Minister realise, because I do not think he does, that the new national maternity hospital is due to become a wholly owned subsidiary of St. Vincent's Holdings?  Its status is to change completely.  Furthermore, we all know that the Vatican had to approve the nuns' transfer of their shareholding to the new holding company.  When asked what terms and conditions were attached to this transfer and whether any documentation exists spelling them out, the Minister of Health flippantly responded that we would have to talk to the Vatican about the matter and that the Government does not have any such documents.  Is the Minister, Deputy Ryan, seriously telling us that that question has never been asked in the context of that delay?  If it has not been asked, why is that the case?</p></speech>

I am not one bit reassured.  I welcome the pause, but I am deeply troubled that at the same time there is a pause that will allow the committee to look at it we have reports in <i>The Irish Times</i>, a newspaper of repute, telling us that the Government has no intention of changing any of the documents.  It is as if the Government is seeking to calm the masses.  I will look at the Minister's point on the existing hospital.  The conditions are intolerable but I ask the Minister to please not use up the reply telling me that.  On this side of the House, we have repeatedly called for the hospital to be co-located on a site owned by the public and run by the State.  What is equally intolerable is the failure of the Minister, the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for Health to deal with any of the issues we are raising today.</p><p>Deputy Shortall raised the issue of rent and the Minister conveniently ignored it.  Even with my background, I am struggling to read through the documents we got.  I look at those documents and I see there is a 299-year lease and a provision for rent.  As has been alluded to by Deputy Shortall, the documents set out the position regarding rent.  The Minister might explain that further and outline what will be the default position when the higher rent comes into being if the conditions are not met.  The Minister might apologies for saying that the delay is on our side when the delay has consistently been on the side of the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group and the Religious Sisters of Charity.  The Minister might explain how the gift we were going to get never materialised.  He might also explain, as Deputy Doherty asked, why we cannot have the site given over to us in our name.</p><p>I have struggled with these documents.  I can see no reason for all this complexity.  If we look at the senior counsel's opinion that was commissioned by Uplift, it states: &quot;Insofar as ownership of the lands are not obtained, the proposed arrangements are Byzantine in their complexity, almost Kafkaesque&quot;.  In 2020, Dr. Peter Boylan, in the context of the ownership, was informed by the National Maternity Hospital's lawyers that there would be a plethora of different structures and ownerships and a complexity to the legal documents.  The Minister is telling us today that the situation is intolerable in the hospital.  I agree.  What is equally intolerable is the Government's failure to deal with the serious concerns we are raising, that Dr. Boylan has raised and that the two dissenting and very distinguished members of the health executive board raised.  That is not to mention the women and men of Ireland who are concerned and the three motions unanimously passed by this D&aacute;il asking for public ownership of the hospital.</p></speech>

That is what was decided at Cabinet.  We will have to wait and see what will be decided at Cabinet in two weeks time.  It is not decided on the front page of an Irish newspaper.</p><p>No one on our side, in our party or, certainly, from what I have heard, in government is casting blame for the delay or saying it was one side or the other.  From listening in recent years, it seems that the central concern relates to religious interference in procedures in a new institution.  One of the outcomes of the delay that has occurred in recent years is that there is a clear legal certainty that this will not be the case and that those concerns can be allayed and addressed.</p></speech>

I refer back to another article in <i>The Irish Times</i>today which states that various independent legal experts were asked if they think there is still a concern in that regard.  From what I read, the vast majority of those which expertise in the area of medical legal matters stated that should no longer be a concern.  It was important that this was addressed.</p><p>This matter is complex.  It is complex because the charters and rules of governance of Holles Street and the Rotunda Hospital date back to when they were founded 200 or 300 years ago.  Trying to bring together one of these institutions with a voluntary hospital organisation is difficult.  Our voluntary structures are strange.  Let us be honest about that.  If you were designing a system from the start, would you design it along the lines of our complex Irish health system which has these effective, flexible and capable voluntary hospital systems?  Probably not.  We have those systems, however.  What would happen if we were to compulsorily purchase the entire voluntary health sector or another sector?</p></speech>

Catherine Day carried out her analysis and compiled a report on how we might manage that.  I am of the view that it can be managed and that we can retain a voluntary health system that will be a public health system that will Sl&aacute;intecare-based and that puts communities first.  It should not all be led by and centred on hospitals and consultants.  That change needs to come.</p>  <p>  This new institution will not answer, solve or change all of those issues.  We need it to be built.  We also need to ensure that its buildings, etc., will be much better than those in which people in Holles Street are operating at present.  For that reason, I look forward to going back to Cabinet in two weeks to hear what has been said at the committee and to make a decision on the matter.  Further delay would not be the right choice.</p></speech>

That is very good.  We have that clarified.  My concerns are in respect of the documents I have read and the absence of some extremely important documents, such as, for example, as the constitution of the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group.  Mr. Menton tells us that the group is evolving into a secular organisation.  Evolution is slow and I would like to know where we are in the evolutionary process of the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group.  Where is it as a secular organisation?</p>  <p>  The Minister mentioned complexity.  There is no complexity here.  This is the 21st century.  On the basis of what has happened in our history, which I do not have time to go into, we have to have a national maternity hospital on a public site.</p>  <p>  On the documents that are missing - in addition to the constitution I have mentioned - I would like to know on what basis the Religious Sisters of Charity was finally happy to give over its share.  How did the Vatican allow the order to do that and still comply with its ethics and so on?  It is difficult to get that information.  This matter needs to be the subject of proper debate here in the D&aacute;il.</p></speech>

That is one of the questions she asked.  One of the analysis documents I read today looked at its objectives or mission statement.  Whether they is religious or secular, the values referred to in that document are ones we would all agree on.  They are not two separate or completely different worlds.  The values the hospital wants to deliver - I have seen it deliver them - relate to valuing and protecting life, the Hippocratic oath and treating patients with fairness and equity.  As I understand it, that is outlined in the hospital's mission statement.</p></speech>

Mr. Michael O'Flynn, the highly-respectable building contractor and developer of more than 40 years' experience, said in an article in <i>The Irish Times </i>by Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Hancock last week, and which should be compulsory reading, that the lack of zoned land was at the heart of the housing crisis.  That is down to poor planning.  Politicians need to get over the mistakes of the past and start talking to and listening to the people who have experience in home building, that is, the developers who are left and have ability.</p><p>There are people here who are talking and talking and have never and will never build a house.  Last year, the O'Flynn Group completed 480 homes.  Mr. O'Flynn said that the reduction of VAT in building is vital.  Developers are overpaying for land in a race to get sites.  The national framework is flawed in that it is based on the premise that 40% of all developed land should be brownfield but it needs to be viable and affordable.  If a proper economic assessment of that policy was done, it would be clear that it is not possible for that brownfield land to be developed without subsidisation or incentives.</p><p>Nothing can be developed, unless it is viable.  The fast-tracking of planning through the system of strategic housing developments was good but has now become mired in legal reviews and is being replaced instead of being improved.  We are throwing out the legislation and that is incorrect.</p><p>The banks at present in Ireland are not fit for purpose.  People cannot get loans.  Homeowners or those who want to be homeowners, small builders and medium-sized and larger groups cannot get access to money.  AIB is continuously putting up signs to say it is backing brave.  It should be made take down those signs because they are stupid and very annoying for people who are being taken to hell and back begging for money and loans.  They are in the bank looking at this sign saying AIB is backing brave.  AIB would not know what brave was if it hit it in the face.</p><p>We need to zone more land and to reduce the 13.5% VAT rate.  We need to reform planning to reduce delays.  We need to loosen the Central Bank of Ireland mortgage rules to allow people to borrow four and a half times their income rather than the current three and a half times.  In the past, land prices were 10% of the house cost.  Now they could be 30%.  VAT in the past was 3%.  Now it is 13.5%.  A shared equity scheme would not be needed if the Government was not taking so much VAT in the first instance.  People think-----</p></speech>

I also do not agree with him about cutting the likes of tax, VAT and so on.  That would just go to the developers rather than the householders.  The Housing for All strategy the Government is delivering is the right approach to tackling this.  Central to it has to be the national planning framework.  At its core are three key objectives: better-balanced regional development, more compact development and low-carbon development.</p>  <p>  The first objective of better-balanced development is very important.  I go around country to talk to different councils.  I was in Limerick, Cork and Waterford and will be going to Galway shortly to listen what is actually happening on the ground.  I spend time with the councillors to hear what is really happening and about what is being zoned and built and about what is not happening.  We are still not sufficiently following the guidance of the national planning framework.  Too much of the housing is still in the greater Dublin area.  We need housing in Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Galway, in particular, but also in towns and villages throughout the country in order that we get a better-balanced spread.</p></speech>

We need better-balanced regional development.</p>  <p>  That will not happen in Cork, Limerick, Galway or Waterford just by zoning ever-outwards which has been the characteristic of development.  It will happen by the measures the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, is introducing with the State intervening not just in social housing but also through the Land Development Agency.  Development happening around Colbert Station in the centre of Limerick is a very good example of how we are under-using land in the centre.  It is not a shortage of zoned land.  It is a shortage of good planning and good strategic thinking.  The benefit of the compact approach where one goes back to the centre is that it is by nature low carbon.  We do not have to keep building out new water and other infrastructure.</p>  <p>  That is another key element of what I have learned by going round the country listening to councils.  Clare is an example.  Why is it that we are not building new housing in those 51 or so perfect towns and villages in Clare that are ripe for development and where we have the schools, the church and the pub?  It is because we need to ramp up Irish Water and its investment in the infrastructure within existing towns and villages that would help us to deliver houses in those areas.</p>  <p>  The sort of funding that the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, is providing helps to provide some of that infrastructure.  In cases where developers cannot make a business case for it, the State directly invests to support some of the projects getting built.  That is the way of tackling it, and not by going down the road of zoning everything.  That is what happened in the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s and got us into a housing crisis.  It was a developer-led approach.  We do not need to do that.  We need a plan-led approach with the State in a central role working with developers rather than for them.</p></speech>

Builders small and large and developers large and small are needed to fix the problem.  It is not the people in government or in opposition talking and talking who will do anything good.  However, we need to make the policies.  We need to get the policies right.  What we have done is put regulation on regulation and red tape on red tape to make it impossible for people to build and make it sensible to do so.</p>  <p>  It is like doing away with bedsits.

In the first quarter of this year, my understanding is that some 6,000 houses were completed, built and delivered.  In the year to February of the previous year, there were 35,000 commencements.  It is not enough and we need to get better-balanced regional development to get more housing in other parts of the country than the east but it is working.  We have some control over it because it is State led.  We are putting in significant resources and giving real direction to councils and developers throughout the country.</p>  <p>  It is at a critical moment in time.  Most of the councils are in the middle of their development plans.  Deputy Michael Healy-Rae will know that, as I am sure it is the same in Kerry as everywhere else.  I stand up in this process for the Office of the Planning Regulator because his office has the right vision and the job to guide those councils to make sure we do not free fall where every council is trying to get as much zoned land as possible.  Instead, we need to be strategic and use sticks as well as carrots to make sure that idle land and vacant sites are developed.  That is what we will do.</p></speech>

That means seven nurses are being assaulted in our hospitals each week.  If we consider all staff, then that figure goes up to 5,600 incidents of physical, verbal and sexual assault.  These figures were provided to my colleague, Deputy Cullinane, in response to a parliamentary question.</p>  <p>  In talking about her experience, one nurse described the accident and emergency department as "a pressure cooker", with "aggression [...] causing junior nurses to quit", while she no longer feels safe in her workplace.  It is completely unacceptable that people are in this position.  Our nurses and hospital staff need to be protected.  We must acknowledge that overcrowding in our hospitals is, in the words of the president of the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, Karen McGowan, "a recipe for disaster", which has increased anxiety and the risk of aggression.  What measures are we going to take to ensure the safety of our nurses and hospital staff?  Does the Minister agree that we need to urgently bring forward an accident and emergency department plan to tackle waiting times and overcrowding?</p></speech>

What he described is intolerable and the details provided in response to the question from Deputy Cullinane raise serious concerns.  I cannot let this pass without noting that if overcrowding is the real issue, then I can think of one hospital that is affected more than any other, and that is Holles Street hospital.  It is the most overcrowded hospital and that is why we must act and make decisions in this regard.</p>  <p>  The solution to this issue also involves the delivery of Sl&aacute;intecare.  That will be a way of taking care out to the community and of using many new remote sensing systems.  Shift Left, Stay Left is a new policy being examined by the HSE.  Much care can be provided using remote sensory devices, and that is better for patients, hospitals and the HSE's budget.  These sorts of initiatives to remove overcrowding are going to be the key solutions.</p></speech>

We welcomed the publication of certain relevant documents on the HSE website and the Government delaying the decision in this regard.  Having listened to the exchanges this morning, however, it seems the Government is not proposing to make any changes.  Yet we are still lacking some crucial information.  We have still not seen the details of any correspondence there may have been between the Vatican and the Religious Sisters of Charity concerning the transfer of ownership.  We understand that permission from the Vatican was required to transfer ownership, but we do not know if the Minister has seen that correspondence or if the Government has sought it.  The Government may say it is relevant, but it is deeply relevant because it may answer the question of why the hospital site cannot simply be gifted to the State.  If this new hospital is to be public in all but name and if a 299-year lease amounts to a public site in all but name, then why not put this matter beyond doubt and make it public?  Let us see why the Religious Sisters of Charity cannot simply gift this site to the State.</p></speech>

It is up to them to decide whether they make public what is private correspondence.  We must be careful regarding basic fundamental rights.  There are rules around freedom of information and provisions governing which information by statute can be directed to be made publicly available.  Private correspondence, however, is not included in that.  Should the parties concerned wish to do so, I would welcome them releasing the correspondence.  It would be a dangerous and difficult precedent, though, if we went down the road of governments forcing private correspondence to be made public.  That has legal consequences, and it would be very risky.</p></speech>

It is important to acknowledge the incredible work of our midwives.  Unfortunately, the role of midwives in Ireland is greatly under-resourced.  In many jurisdictions, midwife-led home births are the norm, but in Ireland, in some situations, women are forced into hospitals.  In CHO 1, for example, covering Cavan, Monaghan, Donegal, Sligo and Leitrim, the HSE facilitated four home births between 2015 and April 2022.  I repeat that it was four.  Additionally, the HSE banned water births in 2020.  The Community Midwives Association, CMA, and the Midwives Association of Ireland, MAI, have called this ban non-evidence-based, unethical and inequitable.  Those organisations are calling for the immediate reintroduction of water birthing.  What is the Government doing to support midwives and midwife-led home births for those who want them?  Will the Minister for Health instruct the HSE to lift this ban on water births, with immediate effect?</p></speech>

Our maternity system is not sufficiently midwife-led.  I think it should be.  That is why I want to bring back to this debate something I raised earlier concerning how we implement the national midwifery strategy.  It points in the direction not of a consultant-led, active management type of system, but, as the Deputy said, to a much more patient-centred and midwife-led system.  This encompasses a range of different issues, including the arrangements referred to by the Deputy regarding pool-based systems.  Therefore, I agree this is the direction in which we need to go.  It is set out and agreed, but it is not being delivered with sufficient speed.  We must have a debate and discussion about the nature of our hospitals' structures, etc., but the subject of having a midwife-led system, and its nature, is where this debate and our attention and focus needs go.</p></speech>

Several factors are at work here, including demand, supply and price.  Some women are finding it difficult to source some HRT products in the State.  The British Government has prioritised this issue in respect of the demand, supply and price.  What is the State doing about the situation many women here find themselves in?</p></speech>

I am told there has been a significant increase in demand for HRT products, which has outstripped supply, as the Deputy said.  A successful awareness campaign has seen demand for some products increase 4.5 to 7.5 times compared to 2019 levels.  Suppliers have confirmed they have increased the planned supply of HRT patches to Ireland this year, while continuing to work to find solutions to the immediate supply issues.  This is a global issue.  Unfortunately, shortages of medicines have become increasingly prevalent globally in the last decade and they are a feature of modern health systems around the world.  There are many reasons, I am told, for these shortages, including the shortage of raw materials, manufacturing difficulties, logistical transport issues and product recalls.  Therefore, this is an issue and a global problem, but the Government and the health system are aware of it and trying to find solutions.</p></speech>

Each instance represents damage done to a patient or a person suffering from ill health.  There has also been a significant rise in extreme incidents, such as death or permanent incapacity, to 579 annually.  This is happening because of a lack of accountability and resources.  At the same time, the accident and emergency department in Navan hospital is threatened with closure by the HSE.  I spoke to medical professionals in the Royal College of Surgeons of Ireland, RCSI, Hospitals Group, and they told me that the closure of the accident and emergency department in Navan hospital would be a travesty for patients in our region.  Patients in County Meath would be forced from our hospital into a hospital group which has seen the highest level of adverse incidents in the country.  If the Government proceeds to close the accident and emergency department in Navan hospital, it will have a fight on its hands, the likes of which it has never seen before.  Tens of thousands of people will be on the streets and a Fianna F&aacute;il or Fine Gael Deputy in County Meath will be a thing of the past.</p></speech>

I will also pass on Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n&rsquo;s request for reassurance regarding Navan hospital.  To make a general point, though, for all the failings of our system, recent analysis - and I do not have the exact figures, statistics or research here - has shown that our life expectancy in this country has increased dramatically.  Independent international assessment of the outcomes experienced in our health system, which is ultimately measured in that length of life and the quality of the service, shows there have been significant improvements and that a good job is being done by our health system, despite all its failings, and the people working in it.</p></speech>

Some people have been waiting up to four years.</p> <p>It is clear that there is no proper co-ordinated regional approach to funding or staffing.  The Mater hospital under the guidance of Professor David Keegan in collaboration with CHO 9 started a waiting list initiative prior to Covid.  Through this initiative they have managed to drastically reduce the waiting list in the last two years, even through Covid.  It is the only adult unit in this country to have achieved a reduction in figures this month in that there are only 94 people waiting.  That is in sharp contrast to 4,885 people waiting in CHO 1.  In CHO 5, which covers County Tipperary, there are 2,361 patients waiting.  This is shocking and we need co-ordination.  I salute Deputy Michael Collins who has his 90th bus going up to Belfast, the "Belfast or blind" bus, but we should not be having to do this.  Surely we can deal with this and have it properly co-ordinated.</p></speech>

He is quite right that the numbers are very high.  The figure of 2,361 in University Hospital Waterford in CHO 5 is correct.  Currently there is a new theatre being fitted out in respect of ophthalmology.  The Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, has also made available &euro;350 million this year coupled with the &euro;50 million already in place for the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, for waiting list initiatives.  The details are being worked out at the moment.  What the Minister is hoping to achieve is that anybody waiting six months by the end of this year will receive the treatment they need.</p></speech>

Recently, we have seen fish being landed in Derry for processing in Killybegs.  The Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, SFPA, has now removed the permission to land there, presumably because it is not a recognised EU port.  The Northern Ireland protocol supposedly treats the Six Counties as inside the EU.  Does this not apply to fish landings?  What is the situation?  The fish should be landed in Derry, transported to Killybegs and processed there as of right.  What is the situation in respect of the protocol?</p></speech>

As a Government Deputy, I will be in attendance in Cork.  Recently, the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, and I attended a meeting with the 12 principals of the special schools in Cork.  Thankfully, the HSE and the Minister of State committed to reinstating all the therapist posts lost when the PDS programme came in.  That was very welcome and I understand it is happening right across the country in special education settings.  That said, although the advertisement of those posts is welcome, we all know that filling them is the real challenge.  Can the Minister brief me on how we are going to fill them?  Will it entail outsourcing, training existing staff or how are we going to fill the posts?</p></speech>

It is a real shortage.  The shortage is also exacerbated by the difficulty in hiring new people.  My understanding is that our assessment processes are so long that many of the therapists who should be engaged in therapy provision are actually in the assessment process.  We need to look at that as part of the overall approach and measures.  The issue was raised, debated and discussed at a Cabinet sub-committee in recent weeks and there is a real commitment to addressing the shortfall.  It is not easy.  I think there may be a need for training and education of new people.  There is not a pool out there.  I think that is the way to go.</p></speech>

The National Transport Authority was before the transport committee recently and stated that it would be in the revised draft.  It has now informed us that it is not in the revised draft because of a direct intervention from the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, who wrote to the NTA and directed it not to include it.  Is that correct?  The northern distributor road, phase 2, is very important.  Phase 1 is from Coonagh to Knockalisheen.  We had that debate and thankfully it is proceeding.  Why did the Minister make that intervention?  Phase 2 of the northern distributor road is very important.  Even the national development plan states that local authorities can bring forward important road infrastructure projects to deal with particular safety and access issues.  That is what phase 2 of the northern distributor road is doing.</p></speech>

I also believe it is important for the likes of Ennis and Clare to develop, not as an adjunct sprawl out from Limerick but to see strong towns in Clare and a strong city in Limerick developing.  That is why I believe the northern distributor road is not the right way to go.  Public transport in Limerick is the way to go.</p></speech>

It recycles more than 12,000 tonnes of plastic which it buys from materials recovery facilities.  It sells 90% of the processed, recycled materials to Irish companies.  This model has become untenable because some European countries, including the UK, have a levy on virgin material, increasing demand for recycled material.  The Irish Government through Repak is paying a subsidy on recycling PET bottles but they are not recycled, they are separated and sold to the highest bidder.  Currently they are being sold outside of the country.  The Minister needs to take action to keep recycled material in Ireland to be reprocessed.  There should be zero subsidy for exporting raw material out of the country.  We are increasing our carbon footprint and putting 50 jobs at risk in Monaghan.</p></speech>

The Government this week brought the Circular Economy, Waste Management (Amendment) and Minerals Development (Amendment) Bill 2022 to the Oireachtas environment committee on Committee Stage.  That provides a lot of the answers and reassurances to the company.  In the development of the likes of the deposit refund scheme, where plastic and PET bottles are not just thrown into the green bin and the average waste stream, that we get a very high quality stream of PET bottles that can be used in recycling I would imagine in the facility the Deputy is talking about and other facilities around the country.  It is one of 200 measures in the waste action plan which we are going to deliver to make the circular economy real, reduce emissions, create jobs, and reduce waste and litter.  It is agreed with industry.  It is being delivered and is very real.</p></speech>

There is obviously a fuel cost and an environmental issue.  My understanding is that the Port of Cork has made a submission to the Department looking for the facilities to be developed.  What progress has been made?  Is it likely that we can have all goods coming in to the Port of Cork able to get the clearance there to be used on the Irish market?

There are two key immediate solutions that the Government has to provide.  I understand the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage has, with the agreement of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, committed to additional staff for An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  We need planning, ecological and science-based expertise, in addition to expertise in a range of other areas.  The board needs additional resources; that is absolutely clear to me.</p>  <p>  The Attorney General is conducting a review of the Planning and Development Act 2000 that will codify and modernise it.  The Act has been amended so many times and is so complex, layered and difficult to interpret that it, too, is not helping in making fast planning decisions.  The work is to be concluded by the end of this year.  It is one of the most important projects or tasks taken on by the Government.  I have 100% confidence in the ability of the Attorney General and the special team he has brought together to deliver that.  That will be key.</p></speech>

Children who have been transferred to Louth now find they are not on any waiting list in either county.  One family who contacted my office applied for respite for its child over three years ago and, despite fighting its case with the HSE for years, has been told Government intervention is required to resolve it.  The child is nine years old and has mental and physical disabilities.  They were transferred from Enable Ireland to the HSE's disability services in Louth last autumn.  Since then, they have received no respite, no home help, no physiotherapy and no speech and language therapy.  The family is under enormous stress as a result.  What will the Government do to resolve this and ensure every child has access to the care he or she is entitled to?</p></speech>

The importance of road-space allocation arose time and again regarding public transport punctuality, ensuring children have safe routes on which to walk or cycle to school, and the creation of good public spaces.  What steps are we taking to support local authorities to provide more road space to ensure we address all our active-transport objectives?</p></speech>

One of the approaches we will take to do so will involve setting up leadership teams or acceleration task forces within key Departments, bringing together agencies, other Departments and outside experts.  The first meeting of one such team, which will focus on sustainable mobility, will be tomorrow..  Critically, we will be seeking to determine what we can do in the next three years, or the remaining two years and nine or ten months of this Government's lifetime, to accelerate the delivery of active-travel infrastructure and examine the allocation of road space to achieve a modal shift, reduce emissions and improve journey times for everyone.  I hope to keep everyone informed of that work.  We discussed it at the national climate dialogue in Dublin Castle last month and agreed we would come back in the summer to monitor and measure progress.</p></speech>

However, we must also acknowledge that private operators have to form a part of the solution.  Recent measures, including the 20% fare reduction for public transport and the 50% reduction for those with a student Leap card, are absolutely welcome, but we must include private operators in the process because, outside urban areas, these operators transport 54% of the people who need to be transported.  We need to include private operators in order that their passengers also can avail of the reductions.</p>  <p>  Another issue arises over St. Patrick's Quay, Cork city, and a change happening there that will affect the private operators.  I will send the Minister a memo on that and perhaps he can come back to me.</p></speech>

The Deputy is right about the first point he made in that private coach operators have a critical role in the provision of public transport.  I regard them as part of the public transport system.  Prior to Covid they were expanding widely across the country, and very successful new routes were being created.  Covid has obviously put a real spanner in the works but a lot of the operations kept going through the Covid period and we kept supporting them to do so.</p>  <p>  The lower-fare card to give a 50% reduction to those under 24 will be introduced.  It will take slightly longer to introduce it for private operators but it will be made available for them.  It has been more difficult with the 20% fare reduction because we do not have the mechanism to monitor, manage and audit fare collection.  We do not even set the prices pertaining to the private operators.  I have met the coach operator organisations on this and recognise it is an issue.  While there are no immediate, easy solutions, we will determine what we can do.  We want the private operators to succeed just as much as anyone.</p></speech>

Since last October, the waiting time for a respiratory appointment at University Hospital Galway has increased from 18 months to a whopping 42 months.  Nationally, there are now 18,632 people waiting for a respiratory outpatient appointment, almost 5,000 of whom have been waiting for more than 18 months to be seen.  Are these delays due to the escalating number of people developing long Covid?  While we are talking about air quality, the resulting respiratory problems and the ongoing effects of long Covid, why are we not getting serious about tackling this waiting list problem?  Why is the HSE not using the National Treatment Purchase Fund to address these appalling outpatient waiting times?</p></speech>

However, I will ask the Minister for Health to try to provide an analysis as to why the queues have lengthened and whether it is possible to use the National Treatment Purchase Fund.</p></speech>

Over 2,000 taxi licences have gone after Covid, and thousands of licenceholders have not returned to work.  We have circumstances in which people cannot get a taxi or face an inordinate delay when they want one.  At the same time, drivers are struggling to make a living.  They may be busy for a short number of hours but their business is very quiet beyond those hours.  There are increases in running costs.  I encourage the Minister to review the taxi advisory committee's ten-year rule and come forward with a fare increase.  Is he concerned about the health and viability of the taxi industry?  Will he engage with the representative groups?</p></speech>

We differ on whether there should be a further extension.  We provided one throughout Covid.  If we continue to increase the age of the fleet of the taxi industry, it will become an issue for customers and the quality of the industry at a certain point.  It is now time to go back to the ten-year rule.</p>  <p>  The Deputy is right that we have lost about 2,000 taxi plates, the number having decreased from about 21,000 to 19,000.</p> <p>There is a strange mix of realities, as the Deputy said.  I follow very closely what is happening in the taxi industry.  On the one hand, taxis are not very busy in some areas.  On other occasions, people are flat out and it is difficult for customers to get taxis.  We will work with the taxi regulator on an ongoing basis to make sure we get the best service and correct number of taxi drivers.  If there needs to be more taxis on our streets, that might be one of the solutions.</p></speech>

The NTA confirmed to us last week that because of his intervention this critical infrastructure for the mid-west region has been removed from the strategy.  Does the Minister realised that Clare County Council is firmly behind this proposal?  Does he realise that the Limerick Chamber of Commerce, and all of the chambers of commerce in Clare, are behind this proposal?  Does he realise that the industrialists who provide thousands of jobs in Limerick support this road?  Does he realise that this has been in the planning process for nearly 20 years?  Due to his intervention, it has been removed.  It is illogical.  I ask the Minister to go away from this solo run and re-evaluate what he has done.  The road should be reinstated in the programme.  It makes sense and will deliver public transport.  The Minister is looking for public transport and the road will provide that.  It will link in to active travel projects on which we are spending huge amount of money every day of the week.</p></speech>

Ever onwards sprawl is not going to work for development.</p>  <p>  Rather than the University of Limerick crossing the Shannon and going into the eastern part of Clare, we could ask it to have a satellite operation in Ennis town and bring the university into the town.  I am convinced that the approach we are taking will see the likes of Ennis town and Limerick thrive, rather than a model where everything moves outwards and Clare County Council tips over to the eastern Shannon side in a way which makes it an adjunct to Limerick, rather than a strong centre in its own right.</p></speech>

I was proud to march in Belfast and Dublin in both large marches on our island to celebrate May Day, which is of course an international celebration.  </p><p>It is in the spirit of seeking to advance the cause of workers' rights and ensure that we are building on past progress that we are introducing this important Bill, which seeks to ensure that the hundreds of thousands of people who are on low pay in Ireland can get, in effect, the pay rise they so badly need.  The purpose of the Bill is to amend the National Minimum Wage Acts so as to provide for a pathway to a living wage as the national minimum wage.  </p><p>Our Bill would transform the low pay commission into a living wage commission and assign it new duties to enable it to make recommendations to ensure that the minimum wage is transformed into a living wage over a three-year period.  We provide the definition of a living wage, meaning an annual wage that, in the opinion of the commission, if paid to a single adult person living alone and in full-time employment would afford that person a standard of living that meets the person's needs at a minimum but socially acceptable level.  </p><p>I acknowledge that the programme for Government committed to progress from the current national minimum wage to a living wage over the lifetime of the Government, but we in the Labour Party are conscious that nothing has yet been done to make any progress or deliver on this commitment.  We understand it would require legislation in order to change the remit of the low pay commission, and that is precisely what this Bill seeks to do.</p><p>The Bill is also timely because we are seeing an unprecedented spike in the cost of living, a spike that is affecting every household, individual, family and community across Ireland.  Inflation is surging to a 22-year high and the costs of fuel, rent, housing, food, childcare and basic services are rising.  Even the price of basic items like bread and milk are rising.  All of us are hearing daily from constituents who are feeling a real squeeze and whose incomes are no longer enough to meet the rising cost of living that they face. </p><p>The Government response to the cost of living crisis has simply not gone far enough.  Ireland need a pay rise.  In particular, for those on low pay we need a clear increase in the national minimum wage in order that it can rise to a genuinely living wage.  A national pay rise means more than that.  It means creating an effective pay rise by addressing the costs of basic services for which people are paying after-tax income, such as healthcare and childcare, services which in other countries are heavily subsidised or free.  We are unapologetic about the need to ensure that the costs of those services are addressed and tackled in a serious and substantial way in order to give people what is effectively a pay rise.  </p><p>I am conscious that at the weekend, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, produced a report on this very topic about the need to ensure that incomes are adequate to meet the cost of basic services, not only by increasing incomes but also by addressing the cost of those services.  We in the Labour Party are also unapologetic about the need for negotiated pay rises for those who may not be on low pay but whose income is simply no longer enough to meet the rising costs they face in housing and feeding and accessing care for their children.  For all of these reasons, we are conscious that this is an important time to seek a legislative intervention to increase the national minimum wage.  </p><p>We will bring forward the Bill during our Private Members' time next Wednesday.  I am delighted to introduce it today, in the week of May Day, and in light of our clear call on Government that Ireland now needs a pay rise.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-05a.396" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="13:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022050500029#EE00300"><p>I am pleased to be opening this debate, which has as its main focus the measures the Government is putting in place to address the accommodation needs of those fleeing Ukraine.  Thus far, more than 27,000 people have arrived in Ireland from Ukraine.  This is why the co-ordinated whole-of-government response that we have put in place is so crucial.</p>  <p>  Our domestic response cannot be divorced from the international context.  Ireland's continued diplomatic support for Ukraine is an important part of today's debate also.  We are maintaining close and regular contact with the Ukrainian Government.  The Taoiseach met the Ukrainian Prime Minister on 20 April and on 14 April, I visited Ukraine, including the town of Bucha.  As part of this visit, I met with my defence and foreign affairs counterparts.  I was the first foreign minister to visit Kyiv since the Russian invasion on 24 February.</p>  <p>  After witnessing the shocking aftermath of the devastation in Bucha, I expressed to the mayor of Bucha the sincere condolences of the Irish Government and people.  I committed to bearing witness to those terrible atrocities and to raising the situation internationally.  I know that I have the full support of this House when I say that those who perpetrated these heinous crimes must be brought to justice.  On 19 April, as promised to the mayor of Bucha and the foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, I briefed the UN Security Council on my visit.  I described how I stood at the edge of one of the mass graves, where the work of carefully exhuming bodies continues.  At that stage, 503 civilians had been identified, and just four soldiers.  These are 503 individual human beings, men, women and children, who were not combatants and yet who appear to have been deliberately killed, in some cases having been tortured in a brutal manner before that happened.  In that city I saw first-hand the devastating impact of the use of explosive weapons, including prohibited cluster munitions, by Russian forces in populated areas, without regard for civilians.  Homes, hospitals and schools have been destroyed.</p> <p>At the UN Security Council I was clear that these facts speak to a total disregard by Russian forces for their clear international obligations under international humanitarian law to protect civilians.  I also highlighted that Ireland is supporting all efforts to bring an end to the conflict through all diplomatic means available, to hold Russia accountable, and to call out Russia's cynical attempts to use the Security Council and other UN bodies to spread disinformation about supposed biological or chemical programmes in Ukraine.</p> <p> Ireland joined more than 40 countries in referring the situation in Ukraine to the International Criminal Court, ICC.  While I was in Kyiv, I announced a further &euro;3 million in funding to the ICC, &euro;1 million of which will be dispersed immediately to the office of the prosecutor.  This will assist in the investigation of the situation in Ukraine, along with other situations the court is involved in.  In addition to the ICC's investigation and joining the Group of Friends of Accountability, we have also supported the Human Rights Council and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, to use their own accountability mechanisms to bring to light the full truth of Russia's actions in Ukraine and to document and seek accountability for human rights abuses there.</p> <p> As these efforts continue, we also need to address immediate humanitarian needs.  Thus far, Ireland has allocated &euro;20 million in direct humanitarian assistance to Ukraine and neighbouring countries via the International Committee of the Red Cross and other UN agencies.  This includes a dedicated Ukraine civil society fund of &euro;2 million specifically to support NGOs responding to the crisis.  We are also providing support through core funding of UN agencies, including early disbursement of our annual contributions for 2022, in order that they can adequately plan and deliver crucial assistance.  Ireland has provided emergency medical supplies to Ukraine, including nine ambulances, in response to requests from the Ukrainian Government.  We are offering medical evacuation support and two Ukrainian paediatric patients have been treated in Ireland to date.  Four rapid responders have also been selected for deployment with UN agencies in Ukraine and in neighbouring countries.  The EU is providing &euro;1.5 billion in a package from the European peace facility to support the Ukrainian armed forces and Ireland is contributing its full share, which is just over 2% or &euro;33 million thus far.  Our focus is on military assistance outside of lethal weaponry.</p> <p> Ireland is supportive of further measures being taken against Russia as part of a sixth EU sanctions package.  The European Commission presented proposals for a sixth package of sanctions yesterday, aimed at depriving Russia and Belarus of the ability to pay for the continuation of the scale of this war.  The package will include additional listings of individuals and entities, including senior military officers and other individuals deemed to have been involved in committing atrocities in Bucha and elsewhere, and in the siege of the city of Mariupol in particular.</p> <p> The package also targets additional Russian and Belarusian banks, including Sberbank, which is Russia's largest bank.  The three big Russian state-owned broadcasters will also be sanctioned.  The package targets services, including accountancy, public relations, and consultancy services to Russian companies.  A complete import ban on all Russian oil is also proposed, to be introduced in an orderly fashion so as to ensure that EU member states can secure alternative supplies.  Crude oil will be phased out within six months, and refined products such as petrol and diesel by the end of the year.  Ireland has frozen approximately &euro;1.25 billion of Russian assets as of 29 April.</p> <p> When I met the Ukrainian foreign minister in April, I reiterated that Ireland fully supports Ukraine's application for EU membership.  Ireland, along with a group of EU member states, is working to provide political and practical assistance and support of Ukraine's European perspective.  EU leaders have agreed to develop a Ukrainian solidarity trust fund, with a view to the reconstruction of a democratic Ukraine, once this Russian onslaught has been brought to an end.</p> <p> We all hope that this dreadful period in Ukraine's history will soon pass.  When it does, the world will remember the bravery displayed by the Ukrainian people in defending their families, their communities and their homeland.  It will also be remembered by those who continue to work for democratic change within Ukraine.</p> <p> Deputies will remember that last month, when we were addressed by President Zelenskyy in a joint sitting of the Houses, he thanked Ireland for its support and for its principled approach to this crisis.  I can assure the House that Ireland will continue to use its voice internationally, to the greatest effect that we possibly can, in its principled support for Ukraine and continued focus, not only on supporting Ukraine in surviving this aggression, but also on trying to find a way to bring it to an end.</p> <p> The focus of this debate, I know now, will be on the challenge we face here at home in accommodating the tens of thousands of Ukrainians who are displaced and driven from their homes for their own safety and the safety of their children.  Some 85% of all of the Ukrainians who have come to Ireland are women and children.  We have a moral obligation to ensure that Ireland plays its part in this war effort - because that is what it is - to offer generosity and openness, and practical solutions to the security and housing needs of those who chose to come here.  We have made a very clear decision not to apply any quotas and not to require any visas to be filled out.  Instead, anyone who chooses to come to Ireland to seek safety, security and stability during this war will be accommodated.  This does put our systems under pressure, and it is important to acknowledge that.  Trust me when I say that given the stories many of us heard from the Ukrainians who have come here, the challenges we face really do pale into insignificance compared to the stories that many of them will recount when they come here, and the trauma they are trying to recover from, in Irish homes and in the hotels, vacant properties and other accommodation facilities we are providing.</p> <p> It is important to be honest about the extent of this challenge.  Not all of the solutions will be perfect.  We need to ensure that we are honest about that.  When there are stresses on certain elements of the system, we need to be able to respond to it.  I pay tribute to my colleague the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, who is sitting next to me here, for the work that he and his Department have done.  They are, effectively, the lead Department in providing the accommodation and facilities.  Many other Departments are supporting, but the Minister and his Department have done an extraordinary job, in the space of little more than two months, to accommodate more than 27,000 people, predominantly women and children.  We will continue to do that and work in a whole-of-government manner, to make sure that the accommodation needs are provided as comprehensively as we possibly can.  In years to come, when we look back on a dark period for Europe, which is what we are living through right now, I hope we will be to say that Ireland behaved in a way that was generous, outward looking, appropriate and in solidarity with a country and a people that are being torn apart.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-05a.398" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="13:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022050500030#FF00200"><p>Since the outbreak of the conflict in Ukraine on 24 February, and the invoking of the temporary protection directive shortly thereafter, my Department has been working intensively as part of the cross-government response to the Ukraine crisis.</p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s role is focused on the immediate accommodation needs of those who have fled here.  We have established a Ukraine unit within the Department, comprised of almost 50 staff, to support this effort.  The accommodation provided is temporary in nature and is focused on the emergency need to provide shelter.  The team is also assisting in directing refugees to all relevant Departments, agencies, NGOs and local authorities, as well as the private sector, to ensure that refugees are facilitated in accessing the supports from others that they require.</p>  <p>  I want to focus on the scale of the challenge being faced across the Government, and in particular within my own Department, at this present time.  As of yesterday, 27,372 people have fled here from Ukraine, with some 18,000 of them requiring accommodation.  Ireland has never experienced an influx of refugees on this scale before.</p> <p>We are doing so at a time when our own housing crisis is severe and approximately 10,000 people are in direct provision, which is a system of accommodation we are committed to ending.  It is in this context my Department has been tasked with finding accommodation for what is now just short of 20,000 people in the space of two months.  Thus far, everyone who has fled here from Ukraine has been offered a place of safety and security.  I pay tribute to the efforts of my own officials, many of whom have worked long hours every day since the outbreak of the conflict to source this accommodation, to the local authorities and the NGOs that have supported this work and in particular the communities across the country that have done so much and been so welcoming to Ukrainians.</p> <p> As I acknowledged when speaking on this previously in the House, much of the accommodation being provided is not perfect and involves a degree of congregated or grouped living.  Over the past week, local authorities stood up emergency accommodation locations across the country and the majority of immediate accommodation allocated at this time is in emergency accommodation.  The nature of emergency accommodation is that it is temporary and can involve a number of moves for those involved, which is also a logistical challenge for the Department.  This need to move people on from the temporary and emergency accommodation is not ideal.  We would have hoped not to add to the stresses of our new arrivals.  However, it must be acknowledged we are dealing with a crisis of proportions absolutely unprecedented in the modern era.  We must not fail in our endeavours to meet this crisis and meet the needs of these refugees to the very best of our ability.  It is with this in mind my Department is exploring all options for accommodating new arrivals and that has involved some creative solutions to an ever-evolving situation.  In an effort to reach those solutions my Department has contracted approximately 11,500 hotel beds, with additional capacity being pursued through guest houses and bed and breakfasts, accommodation pledged by the general public, State-owned or privately-owned properties that may be suitable for long-term accommodation, accommodation belonging to volunteer bodies such as Scouting Ireland, religious properties, local authority facilities and working with Airbnb.  The Millstreet Green Glens Arena has opened and will take up to 320 people and some larger serviced accommodation centres such as hotels will also come on line soon.  My Department is advancing other options such as student accommodation as well.  In doing all this the central consideration is the immediate safety and security of the displaced people fleeing Ukraine.</p> <p> If the initial accommodation provided to someone is in emergency accommodation, every effort is made to move people to serviced accommodation as soon as possible.  People in serviced accommodation are advised when arriving this is temporary and the intention is they will be moved into pledged or other medium-term accommodation as soon as this is available and that this may not be in the same area as the initial temporary accommodation.  I know people have made contacts and have established connections in these locations and may wish to remain there.  However, we must also recognise this crisis is real and continues to result in a very large number of people arriving on a daily basis.  Until such time as they are housed in permanent accommodation, the movement of people may be part of our response here.  Again, this is not perfect and is not our preference but it is part of the reality of the situation we face.</p> <p> I am conscious there has been a focus on the issue of pledged accommodation and we welcome those people who have opened their homes to people fleeing the crisis in Ukraine.  As a Government, we are incredibly grateful for those offers.  These pledges have been made through the Irish Red Cross, IRC, and to date in excess of 24,000 pledges have been made.  The process of getting people moved into pledged accommodation has been slower than I would like.  I refer to the scaling up of what needed to be done.  This was a process that had had 600 pledges come in over a five-year period and then experienced 24,000 over a five-week period.  We had to scale up and support the Red Cross in putting in the infrastructure.  That included funding, staff and additional personnel from other State bodies like Pobal and the Defence Forces.</p> <p> The process of matching people with pledged accommodation or pledged rooms is ongoing at the moment.  My Department is working closely with the IRC to deliver that.  Of course, because we are dealing with people fleeing a situation of really unimaginable suffering and stress, that process of moving people into vacant or shared accommodation must be done right and with consideration of the needs of the people involved.  That process takes time.  I thank those who pledged their accommodation generously for their patience to date and in those cases where we have not yet been able to arrange for a Ukrainian family to move in, I ask for some more patience.  We are ramping up this system and ensuring it will work quickly and effectively.  My Department understands from the Irish Red Cross all those who have pledged accommodation have now received a phone call.  Over 32,000 phone calls were made.  Of those calls, to date 13,000 were not responded to and 6,000 people said they needed to withdraw from the original pledges for various reasons.  We are following up with all those who have contacted.  Of the pledged vacant properties, 1,837, having been processed by the Irish Red Cross, have been forwarded by my Department to the partners that are assisting us with moving people into these properties.  These are predominantly the local authorities across the country.  I again want to thank them for their assistance.  There is also the Peter McVerry Trust and the International Organization for Migration, IOM.  At every point, for various reasons some properties cannot be taken up but to date, 700 people have moved in to pledged accommodation across the country.  This is mainly to vacant units.</p> <p> We are now looking at the vetting process for the shared accommodation as well to ensure that can be done as quickly as possible.  However, especially where a child or vulnerable person is moving into shared accommodation, I think everyone would agree a vetting process is an essential part of the child protection measures we must take.  As we know, there is currently no payment for those pledging property but this is an issue that is being actively considered by the Government at the moment.  Beneficiaries of the temporary protection directive are, as we know, in receipt of assistance from the Department of Social Protection, such as the supplementary welfare allowance and child benefit.  Pledges have a role to play in supplementing other short-term accommodation and my Department will continue to support the Irish Red Cross and implementing partners to give effect the pledges we can.</p> <p> All in all, as a country we have responded well to the call to support the effort in easing the burden of relocating to Ireland from Ukraine.  We all hope for an end to this war as quickly as possible but in the meantime we will continue to play our part.  It has not been easy to scale up the level of services in a short period.  I again acknowledge that not everything we have done is perfect but it is evolving and getting better.  From speaking to Ukrainians, I know of their gratitude for the support the State and especially communities across the country have shown.  I conclude by again thanking those communities, the people and all the State agencies and NGOs that have done so much to support people in such desperate need.</p></speech>

Putin&rsquo;s war of devastation has thrown down the gauntlet to us to stand by our values and live by our best traditions of decency and fairness.  Ireland is not a global military power but we are a humanitarian one and we can give badly-needed compassionate refuge to those fleeing the bullets and bombs of this ruthless invasion.</p>  <p>  I pay tribute, as my colleague the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, just did to the generosity of spirit displayed by Irish people in their warm-hearted response.  Our NGOs too, have responded in an exceptional manner.  I thank all of them for the work they have done heretofore and their ongoing commitment.  In particular, I thank staff in local authorities right across the Republic for their extraordinary effort on top of all the other pressures they must bear.  We are asking much of them and they have shown remarkable agility, innovation and empathy in their work to assist those who need our help.  Their continued engagement has made a real difference to the lives of the Ukrainian people who have arrived here.  The immediate, emergency response as outlined by my colleague, the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, is directly with his Department.  The medium- to long-term requirements of new accommodation supply are being addressed by my Department.  Co-ordination is being undertaken by a newly established special Cabinet committee headed by the Taoiseach and a Secretary Generals' group.</p>  <p>  Housing is the greatest challenge facing the Government and it is where the pressure of the Ukrainian emergency will be felt most acutely.  The crisis simultaneously poses an unprecedented demographic shock and a supply chain crisis for our housing system.  The invasion will have an impact on the overall housing supply.</p> <p>However, the situation is too volatile and unclear and it is too early to quantify exactly what the extent of that will be.  This means we need a tiered response that we can escalate as needed, depending on the scale of numbers seeking refuge and the length of time for which our friends from Ukraine stay in Ireland.  It also has to take into account the economic impact, inflationary risks and supply chain issues that are real.</p> <p> My goal, as Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, and that of the Government is to protect Housing for All, the national housing plan to address our domestic crisis, and meet the accommodation requirements of our friends from Ukraine.  In order to achieve this, my Department is responding with a twin-track approach.  The first strand is focused on meeting the specific needs of our Ukrainian friends, while the second addresses the broader impact on the housing system.</p> <p> First and foremost, Housing for All, the national housing plan, remains at the heart of Government policy.  It is the most ambitious housing plan in our history, backed with unprecedented levels of funding.  It places home ownership back within the reach of working people and massively ramps up public and private home building.  Measures to address the needs of Ukrainians fleeing the conflict will be in addition.  We will take additional and accelerated steps to help accommodate the impact of desperate people forced from their homes.  I emphasise that the response to the Ukrainian crisis is separate from and additional to Housing for All.  It is not and should not be displacing existing targets.  Those are required to address our own pressing housing needs.  To address the Ukrainian crisis we are undertaking a tiered set of extra actions that can respond to each scenario of numbers seeking sanctuary as it emerges.  The bright red line between existing measures to tackle our housing crisis and extra steps to address the needs of Ukrainian refugees is vital.</p> <p> Those fleeing conflict are not simply collateral damage in this invasion; they are a core part of the Russian strategy.  Russia has sought to weaponise human misery and use it against European solidarity.  Putin is gambling that the pressures and strains of accommodating and caring for people and tackling a cost-of-living crisis will snap the bonds of democratic solidarity with Ukraine.  For the sake of all small nations seeking to assert their right to independence, we cannot and will not allow that gamble to pay off.  Putin and his allies are indulging in crude nuclear imagery on state television in an attempt to bully small nations.  That will not stand.</p> <p> We can and must look after our people while helping Ukrainians who need our aid in their darkest hour.  That challenge places a profound moral and political responsibility on all Members of this House.  We cannot allow the seeds of division to be sown or issues be stoked for partisan gain.  We have to confront misleading and false information and engage in good faith on the challenges this crisis presents.  However, I do not agree with Deputies who heretofore opposed Housing for All using the crisis as an excuse to repeat their call for an immediate new national housing plan.  That would only blur the lines of our response, confuse delivery targets, risk pitting one group against another and achieve nothing but further uncertainty in a volatile situation.  I urge Deputies to desist from doing that.  While every plan needs to show flexibility, the core commitments, policies and funding of Housing for All are at the heart of Government policy.  There is already an inbuilt annual review in the plan to ensure it is on track.  Ultimately, those calls in respect of stalling or revising the plan are motivated from a political perspective and I will not go down that road.</p> <p> As with Brexit and Covid, Irish people have continually shown their depth of resilience, natural innovation and immense empathy.  This international crisis caused by Russia&rsquo;s aggression will see us do the same again.</p> <p> Essentially, my Department&rsquo;s response to Ukrainian accommodation needs is set over three areas, with a special housing task force drawing the various strands together.  The first strand focuses on vacancy and refurbishment, the second on temporary volumetric and modular accommodation, and the third on new permanent homes.  This threefold strategy builds on a series of summits, workshops and meetings with both the public and private sectors though the past two months as well as consultation with Members of this House to design an agile and tiered response to the crisis.  In the first area, relating to vacancy, I have established an emergency vacant housing delivery unit within the Local Government Management Agency, LGMA.  This unit will support relevant Departments and agencies in repurposing vacant State-owned buildings for emergency use.  It will also support each local authority to refurbish a flagship project in their area to house those fleeing Ukraine.  These properties will be selected from buildings we have identified across the country, further adding to our capacity.  More than 500 units have already been analysed by a team of former chief executives.  A total of 89 buildings, covering an estimated 5,300 potential beds, are already being transferred to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  I am also funding local authorities to establish specific support teams, and designating an additional director of services in each local authority to co-ordinate supports and services locally and across agencies and community groups, building on their sterling work to date.</p> <p> In the second area, the Office of Public Works, OPW, will take the lead in designing and constructing modular homes on State lands.  To be clear, this will be a small but important part of the State response.  It will assist in plugging the gaps where other accommodation is not readily available.  My Department will support it in identifying and planning for appropriate serviced sites.</p> <p> On the third area, the focus is on activating the 80,000 unused planning permissions in the State.  I will issue a national call for inactive permissions shortly to help collate delayed or stalled developments.  I am setting up a clearing house group composed of key planning and infrastructural experts.  Its role will be to identify and analyse the reasons behind the lack of progress on these matters.  The clearing house group will be empowered to make specific recommendations to me to issue special time-bound planning permissions and changes to catalyse developments.  Any suitable and additional permanent accommodation under these measures will be returned to general social and affordable housing if and when the Ukrainian crisis is resolved and special accommodation needs end.</p> <p> Our housing system is coming out of a decade of undersupply that has been compounded by pandemic shutdowns.  It is now facing supply chain and inflation pressures from the Ukrainian crisis.  To help address these issues, I have removed the local authority acquisition cap and restored local decision-making in certain emergency situations.  There will be a new voids programme in 2022 that will focus specifically on those on the social housing lists.  Using new regulations under section 9 of the Local Government Rates and other Matters Act 2019, I will restrict the use of commercial rates vacancy refunds to encourage the reuse of vacant stock.  We will also look at the potential for zoning additional lands, as well as for providing temporary emergency permissions through section 181(2) of the Planning and Development Act.  We are doing a trawl of all 31 local authorities for public and private sites on which we can develop homes for our Ukrainian friends in a speedy way.</p> <p> We will stand shoulder to shoulder with other democracies against authoritarian aggression.  We will look after our people as well as those fleeing war and we will live up to the best traditions of fairness and decency towards those who need our support.</p></speech>

I commend, as did the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, the generosity and enormous community spirit of people the length and breadth of the country.  They have opened their homes, pockets and hearts and we support them in their efforts to do so.  Like other speakers, I wish to make clear that it is the view of Sinn F&eacute;in that this war is absolutely unjustified and the behaviour of Russia deserves the utmost condemnation.</p>  <p>  In particular, I commend the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and his Department on the enormous efforts they have made to date in trying to ensure the warmest possible welcome and the greatest level of support for those who have been forced to leave their country.  One of the great merits of the response of the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth is that it is seeking emergency accommodation outside the mainstream housing system.  It is a sensible approach, particularly because it avoids putting Ukrainians who, rightly, are seeking refuge in competition with other people in acute housing need who experienced the rough end of our own housing crisis.  At all times, the Government and the Opposition must ensure that, in everything we do, we do not in any way generate that kind of competition, or the potential resentment that could emerge from it, to ensure those fringe elements of our society who would seek to exploit that resentment are unable to do so.</p> <p> I want to raise three particular issues with the Minister  for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth for his consideration.  I raise them in a constructive spirit and I hope he accepts I am doing so on that basis.  First, as he knows, the Irish Refugee Council made quite a detailed policy proposal at an earlier stage in this refugee crisis.  One of its central elements related to trying to access a small percentage of vacant holiday homes, with the offer of a legally binding 12-month licence agreement and a modest administrative payment to encourage people to participate.  While the Minister stated that the Government is actively considering the issue of a payment, that specific proposal was not mentioned.  As we move into the holiday season, we are already hearing from hotels that there may be some pressure in the context of continued access to beds.  In that context, a call for vacant properties could yield a small but significant number of the 62,000 vacant holiday homes which are out there in the right locations, which would ultimately provide a better quality of emergency accommodation for the families in question, particularly from a child protection point of view, which would be more cost-effective than commercial hotel accommodation and which would involve accessing properties outside of the housing system.</p> <p> Second, while I fully understand and support the Government's accessing of hotel accommodation through the international protection accommodation services unit, IPAS, there have been at least two instances where homeless service providers in Cork city and Wicklow have expressed some concern that hotels that would otherwise have been the primary source of emergency accommodation for families presenting as homeless are now fully booked up by IPAS.  This is one of the imperfect solutions the Minister spoke about, but it is really important that there be the maximum level of co-ordination between his Department, IPAS and homeless service providers to try to avoid such a difficulty in as much as is possible.  While I am sure that already is happening, I urge, as the homeless numbers are likely to increase in the coming months, that there be even greater co-ordination.</p> <p> Third, where IPAS is leasing out commercial buildings such as hotels, there is the potential for a loss of employment for people working in those locations who may not be involved in the direct provision of services to guests or refugees.  This is particularly the case with large commercial hotels that have events sections, etc.  It would be very unfair, and potentially counterproductive, if people were to lose employment because of the need to secure those locations for emergency accommodation.  I ask the Minister to pay particular attention to that issue to ensure it does not create difficulties.</p> <p> As the lead Opposition spokesperson on housing, I wrote to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage on 8 March seeking a meeting to discuss his Department's response to this crisis and ideas we have to address it.  I received a two-line reply directing me to the Minister  for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and his Department, as the lead agency.  On 21 March, I wrote to the Secretary General of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage asking what advice was being given to local authorities with respect to the many questions they would face regarding the refugee crisis.  I was told that, at that point, no such advice was being given.  I wrote to the Minister and the Secretary General again on 31 March.  On 1 April, I received a reply from the latter with more detail about the work the Department was doing to support the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and IPAS in trying to secure large vacant buildings and other emergency accommodation solutions.</p> <p> Unfortunately, during all of that period, there were many newspaper reports claiming to be based on briefings from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage or the Minister regarding the fair deal scheme and whether properties coming into the housing system under that scheme would be available for Ukrainian refugees.  It was also claimed that local authority acquisitions, voids and relets would be made available, as well as emergency planning powers, to tackle all of this.  Those briefings and the media coverage they generated have caused enormous confusion.  It is a pity the Minister responsible for those issues is not in the Chamber to hear this.  They had real potential to cause a lot of anger and resentment and they were deeply unhelpful.  I fully appreciate the crisis situation the Government is dealing with but I urge all Ministers to ensure there is clear and coherent communication as we move through what will be very trying times for Departments, civil servants and the wider public.  I urge that briefings be avoided where one Minister is trying to present himself or herself as being more active than another.  We need to have clear public communications, as the Minister present has been providing to date.</p> <p> We received a briefing from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage on 26 March in which we were told categorically that all the media briefings in previous weeks were inaccurate, social housing would be used not for refugees but for the social housing waiting list, fair deal properties would be used for those in the private rental sector and no new emergency powers were being introduced, contrary to what we had been told.  We were told, as the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage had indicated, that his Department's focus was on assisting IPAS in identifying large vacant buildings to be potentially refurbished for multi-family occupancy and on the provision of some modular housing for emergency accommodation.  Given that, according to those officials, the emergency timeline may be as much as two to three years, depending on what happens in Ukraine, which we do not control, I strongly urge the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage and the Government in general to approach the issue of modular accommodation with real consideration.  There is no reason we cannot use new, good-quality, high-end building technologies to accelerate the delivery of social and affordable homes for a very large section of the community, including those Ukrainians who have no home to return to after the war and who opt to stay in Ireland.  I urge the Government to learn the lessons of direct provision and avoid short-term, low-grade modular housing villages that could end up being accommodation for refugees for much longer than initially intended.</p> <p> It is an enormous mistake for the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage not to revise the targets underpinning his housing plan.  They already are under huge pressure from rising homelessness, a shrinking private rental sector, low private sector supply, rising housing prices and rents, and inflationary pressures.  If we are to ensure that the long-term housing needs of Ukrainian refugees who stay in Ireland are met at some future point, now is the time to revise those targets and push them upwards.  I see no reason for the Government to stand by its current plan or housing targets.</p> <p> I thank the Ministers for the information they provided.  As Sinn F&eacute;in housing spokesperson, I stress the need for a new housing plan that can meet the housing needs of all sections of society, from refugees to the homeless and everybody in between.  I urge the Minister  for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth to take that point back to Cabinet and impress it upon his colleagues.</p></speech>

Everybody is very mindful of the situation facing people in Ukraine  We are all thinking of those who are facing that situation today, including those who are fleeing and those who are trapped without the choice or chance to get out of the country.  Like Deputy &Oacute; Broin, I want to acknowledge the work that has been done to date, particularly by the Minister  for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and his Department.  As Chairman of the Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, I sometimes feel like everything falls to that Department.  This was an added difficulty nobody foresaw and, in fairness, he and his staff have dealt with it extremely well to date.  They should be commended on that.</p>  <p>  I also acknowledge the great work done in counties Carlow and Kilkenny, in my constituency, where people in communities really have rowed in, whether through collections or by providing accommodation or other services.  They are trying their very best to ensure people, particularly children, are integrated and involved in community activities.  This discussion is about housing but I was in Wicklow last Friday where I visited a number of early years facilities that are making provision for Ukrainian children.  I was told they children have integrated totally, which is fantastic and very welcome.  I take this opportunity to raise a point made by those service providers.  There are Ukrainian women who have come to Ireland who are qualified in early years care and would like the chance to work in the sector, in which there is a severe staffing shortage.  Where people want the opportunity to work, it would be fantastic to facilitate it.  I gave a commitment to raise the issue with the Minister.  One of the points the service providers made is that there is a major difficulty with Garda vetting.  Of course, nobody is saying that people do not need to be vetted.</p> <p>However, if anything could be done to speed up that process or to help people to access those jobs while services are crying out for staff and there are people who would really like to work, it would make perfect sense.  I wanted to take the opportunity to say that.</p> <p> I also wish to make a point, which Deputy &Oacute; Broin also made, about employment.  I have seen a few unfortunate cases in my constituency, mainly affecting people who are part-time or students doing weekend and summer work.  Still, that work was invaluable to them.  They have been told there is no longer work for them because of the situation.  Maybe weddings and various other events in hotels have been cancelled.  Perhaps that could be considered as well.</p> <p> The other point I wish to raise - it is a difficult one, and it is hard to know exactly how we can police this - is that there have been some incidents of people being taken advantage of.  When we speak about this issue it is really important we all plead with people to go through the proper channels.  While I know there can be goodwill in WhatsApp and Facebook groups, I have been horrified by some of the stuff I have seen.  I encourage people to go through the proper channels, that is, the Red Cross and various other channels.  I know there are many people with goodwill and most people are very well intentioned, but we always see people who will exploit these situations.  I encourage people to make sure they go through the proper channels in order that everything is vetted and above board.</p></speech>

I have dealt with staff in the Department since the beginning of this crisis and have found them to be really helpful and sensible about these situations.  In my county, Leitrim, we have a hotel, Lough Allen Hotel, in Drumshanbo, which has been closed for a number of years, since Covid, and is now open and has more than 200 Ukrainian refugees there.  I have been there and visited them.  It is a tremendous wonder to see people from practically the other side of the world come there and integrate and get on so well.</p>  <p>  I spoke to the principal in the local secondary school as well.  There are children preparing to go there.  Some of them will wait until after the school holidays because we are so close to them now.  A big effort is being made.  However, I think the schools will need more assistance with all this because some of the children who come, naturally, will have difficulties with language, etc.  Also, for some of them, there is autism and all the things we have in this country, which will come with them when they arrive.  There are also elderly people who have various disabilities, conditions and other issues who will need medical assistance.  That is one of the problems.  Even in County Leitrim, with our low population, it is very hard to get a GP.  That is one of the big issues that is coming up for an awful lot of the refugees.  They cannot get a GP.  They are being sent from pillar to post with no assistance.  Particularly in an area where there is a hotel and a large concentration of refugees, some kind of medical service needs to be put in place to assist with that.</p>  <p>  The other issue I have come across I came across first in Bundoran, where there was also a large number of refugees in a large guesthouse and now in a hotel as well.  All of them want to work.  They want to know where they can get work.  Some of them are coming with skills.  Some are nurses or doctors.  There are people in various professions.  With some of those professions, we absolutely need their work.  We need them to come and help out because we have shortages of those skills.  As mentioned earlier, however, the issue of Garda vetting and so on comes into play.  Where will they go to get Garda vetting?  They cannot go to the authorities in Ukraine, obviously.  That will not happen.  Therefore, some other system needs to be found to deal with that.  That is absolutely essential.</p>  <p>  In some areas there is a little tension or concern, perhaps in towns which, over the summer in particular, depend on tourism, with other businesses in the town also depending on tourists coming.  Such areas now find that the hotels and other accommodation are not available for tourists.  That will cause a little tension, so there needs to be due care and diligence around that to ensure that jobs and the possibility of business and commerce in those towns are not displaced.  We just need to get that right if we can at all.  So far, in fairness, there have been huge efforts and we are making great progress in getting it right.</p>  <p>  The other issue that comes to mind is the huge number of people who have pledged accommodation and said they are prepared to take people into rooms in their houses.  We know that will be difficult.  I know of some cases in which it has been difficult up to now.  A real effort needs to be made to try to get that done as speedily as possible for people and to ensure that if they do go into a place in somebody's home, there are services there to back up and to support the family that was prepared to take them on.</p></speech>

As the Minister will know, I am a member of the Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability Integration and Youth.  Everything seems to fall under the remit of that committee.  I have spoken in the past about the mental health challenges that displaced Ukrainian people will face when they land on our shores.</p>  <p>  Today, however, I will focus on the housing situation we are in.  The Government has failed spectacularly to get to grips with the housing crisis, and now we have a crisis upon a crisis.  The Government's housing plan is not fit for purpose.  The Government hopes to reach 10,000 social and 4,000 affordable homes by 2025.  That is not good enough, and the bar was set deliberately low.  The Government seems to be playing politics with people's lives.  Before the war in Ukraine, our housing system was in a deep crisis.  The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage referred to blurring the lines.  Last week, he was forced into an embarrassing climbdown.  For weeks his office had been talking about the fair deal homes, local authority acquisitions and social housing voids being used for Ukrainian refugees.</p></speech>

I would appreciate it if he would have the courtesy to not do so now.</p>  <p>  On Tuesday, representatives from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage told the joint committee that what the Minister said about such housing being used for Ukrainian refugees was not the case.  There seem to be mixed messages coming from the Minister and his Department.  This caused hurt and confusion among people languishing on the housing list, people stuck in their mothers' and fathers' back bedrooms, people in substandard accommodation and people living in overcrowded dwellings.  The Minister can point his finger as much as he wants.  He should point the finger at himself and successive Governments that have stood over these policies for a number of years.  The people who contacted my office were upset and felt, because of the briefings, that the Government was going to push them further down the list.  They thought they would have to endure these living conditions longer.  It was pitting one group of marginalised people against another.  I had a look at the word "marginalised" and what it means.  It used to refer to minority groups that were unable to access basic services or opportunities such as housing.  However, they are not smaller minority groups any more.  These Government policies the Minister has stood over have ensured that.  These minorities and socially excluded people will no longer be silent.</p>  <p>  Thousands of Ukrainian people will land on our shores over the next while.  We must be able to look after them as best we can, as much as we will look after the people who are currently victims of the social housing policy the Government has stood over.</p></speech>

Their resistance has been heroic and inspirational in the face of the reprehensible actions of their much larger neighbour.  The stories coming out of Ukraine about the war crimes that have been committed are sickening.  The recent simulation shown on Russian TV must be met with a strong response.  We are long past the time to expel the Russian ambassador.  He needs to go - no ifs, buts or ands.  We are a peaceful, neutral country, and this kind of behaviour must be confronted.</p>  <p>  As the saying goes, a bayonet has a worker at both ends.  Workers and their families are suffering to satisfy the bloodlust of Putin and his oligarchs.  The casualties on both sides are mounting.  The UN and the EU must use every available channel to try to get the message through that this war must end.  Ireland must use its position on the Security Council to push for reform of the UN.  It must also encourage the Chinese Government to withdraw any support it might be providing to Russia.  I commend the work of the Red Cross and other groups and individuals who are working to ensure we welcome as many refugees as possible.</p>  <p>  We learned at the Committee on Budgetary Oversight last night that we could see more than 100,000 people arrive here, with a contingency of &euro;3 billion set aside.  I was surprised to learn that the EU has not provided any funds and is probably unlikely to do so.  It is clear we will need people to open up their homes to cope with the numbers.  We need an assurance that local authority tenants who open up their homes will not face any repercussions, be that in respect of income thresholds or occupancy levels.  We need adequate payments made available to support families who welcome refugees.</p>  <p>  I am worried about the ongoing spin that this war is being used to abandon our long-held military neutrality.</p> <p>Our Defence Forces need investment.  Our serving personnel need to be paid better.  Their working conditions need to improve and they need modern equipment.  We need the basics first, such as radar and reliable vehicles.  We do not need NATO levels of equipment.  Why spend millions of euro on drones that can kill people from miles away when we have families living in emergency accommodation and old people on trolleys for days?  We need to get our priorities right here.</p> <p> Finally, I implore the Government not to forget the victims of war elsewhere in the world.  I am thinking particularly of Palestinians who have endured Israeli aggression for decades.  We must stand up for them.  The first step must be to fulfil the programme for Government promise to recognise the state of Palestine.</p></speech>

We in the Labour Party will stand in solidarity with the people of Ukraine and we will stand in support of all the Government efforts that have been taken to ensure that we are offering as much sanctuary and support as we can in this country, as the Minister, Deputy Coveney, said, without the imposition of quotas or visas. </p>  <p>  This is a national effort.  We are militarily, but not politically, neutral on this and that is clear.  Certainly, in my previous capacity, on the then Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Defence, I spoke out consistently against Russia's aggression in waging a proxy war in Syria.  It is the exact same tactics that we are seeing here with Russia waging this war, directly, in this case, on the people of Ukraine but also, as the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, said, weaponising human misery by seeking to undermine European solidarity and European democracies through creating and exacerbating a cost-of-living crisis and through causing so many thousands, indeed, millions, of Ukrainian people to have to flee their homeland in such appalling circumstances.</p>  <p>  We will continue, of course, to stand in solidarity with Irish Government efforts to ensure Russian accountability for complicity in the brutal war crimes that we have seen committed against the people of Ukraine.  I appreciate the Minister, Deputy Coveney's update on that.</p>  <p>  Last week the Labour Parliamentary Party wrote to the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, to offer our constructive support in the national effort to ensure that we in Ireland can offer the strongest possible support to our Ukrainian friends who have come here seeking sanctuary.</p>  <p>  We are also responding separately - my colleague, Senator Rebecca Moynihan, our housing spokesperson, is collating a response to the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien - with constructive suggestions on possible vacant housing options.  We welcome the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien's call for buildings and his engagement with Opposition representatives on this.  We recognise the immense challenges involved and we appreciate and acknowledge the substantial effort of so many public servants, civil servants, NGOs and local authorities that have really stepped up.  Fifty staff, in the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth alone, form the Ukraine unit.  I have met with so many public and civil servants who have done so much already to support Ukrainian visitors.</p>  <p>  In my constituency, in Dublin Bay South, we have seen a huge community effort.  We have seen the great Evergreen centre in Terenure set up a weekly event for those hosting Ukrainian families and for their Ukrainian visitors, Swan Leisure in Rathmines holding community events, and many church groups across the constituency and other community groups organising events, and we are seeing similar across the country.</p>  <p>  We are also looking at accommodation needs.  I, along with my colleague, Councillor Dermot Lacey, have identified the long vacant Baggot Street hospital as a State-owned building.  I think it is on the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien's radar that it may well be available to offer emergency accommodation.  I am also aware of Avalon House, for example, an empty hostel on Aungier Street in Dublin city centre, that also has space and has quite a considerable number of empty bedrooms.</p>  <p>  We are aware that the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman's Department is co-ordinating the State response but clearly there is substantial feed-in and co-ordination with other Departments.  In our letter to the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, we sought to offer our support in a range of different areas.</p>  <p>  On the accommodation point, we asked for clarity on the role of international protection accommodation service, IPAS, as compared with the role of local authorities.  We have received a little more clarity on that today but we want to ensure that there is clear co-ordinating of the accommodation needs of Ukrainian guests.  Certainly, I have been contacted by constituents telling me there is a lack of information available.  The Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, said we all need to be patient.  Clearly, this is a massive effort and the Irish Red Cross has had to have significant additional capacity provided to enable it to co-ordinate responses to those pledges of accommodations alone.  Certainly, there should be clearer information and co-ordination in terms of the offer of accommodation and I absolutely agree with the need to ensure that there is no divisive rhetoric used in the co-ordinated response on accommodation.</p>  <p>  This can be a win-win in terms of offering constructive solutions to address our own pre-existing homelessness crisis along with providing more emergency and shorter-term accommodation for our Ukrainian guests.  Student accommodation clearly will be coming into the picture as well in the summer and that will be welcome.  In my constituency, there is quite a significant body of availability there.</p>  <p>  We are also asking for a timeline for the establishment of community hubs across the country.  We understand Tusla is the designated agency and we have suggested that it might be preferable to establish such hubs uniformly across the country.  We have asked how the views and experiences of those affected who have fled Ukraine can be inputted into developing our national response.</p>  <p>  In my engagement with my local officials in Dublin City Council, I am aware there is a concern about having a clear funding stream available to local authorities to enable them to offer support.  In many cases, this involves small amounts of money.  These are essential supports to fund community and voluntary organisations working on a local basis with Ukrainian families and individuals here and we seek to have that clear funding stream available.</p>  <p>  On the issue of employment, any Ukrainian visitors I have met are so keen to engage in work and many are so highly skilled.  I met some, particularly women, with wonderful qualifications.  I have also met with local employers who are keen to recruit and to ensure that they can match their skill shortages in sectors, for example, pharmacy, retail, hospitality and care work, with the skills of Ukrainians coming here.  I have already put down questions on this.  What co-ordinated response can we offer to those who wish to offer their services and to those who are looking to employ Ukrainian visitors here given the skill shortage and the recruitment difficulties in many sectors?</p>  <p>  We have also raised questions with the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, around educational needs of children to ensure minimal disruption of children.  There are some reports of children being moved from school to school since arrival in Ireland.  That is clearly regrettable.  Indeed, there is a need for supports for those with mental health issues and with physical health issues to ensure that there is consistency of care from GPs across the country.</p>  <p>  We have offered many different constructive solutions and we look forward to engaging further with the Government.  I will hand over to my colleague.</p></speech>

It is demanding an unprecedented response from Government.</p>  <p>  Housing is the greatest challenge but, below housing, there are many important and pressing immediate challenges.  I was in St. Finian's Community College yesterday meeting the fifth and sixth year politics and society students and they were asking questions.  A girl, named Ciara Brady, asked me if I knew the Ukrainian people who are living up in the hotels in north County Dublin, such as the Shoreline Hotel, and in Emmaus, the Christian Brothers' facility, and I said I did.  She asked, "Is there anyone up there looking after them?"  It was the most simple question but it cut to the heart of what I am dealing with on the ground, day in, day out.  I have been in touch with both the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputies Darragh O'Brien and Joe O'Brien, respectively, who, in fairness, have been really responsive, as has the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, in terms of coming back to me, but that simple question cut to the heart of the day-to-day issues that many of us are trying to assist with and for which I feel there is a deficit in the response.</p>  <p>  The Fingal response forum is doing much good work but it does not have competencies in social protection, health, school transport and school placement.  These are real issues of concern and ones that we are finding difficult to resolve.  If it was not for the work of local volunteers, such as Ms Corina Johnson, locally in Donabate, people would not be getting to doctor and dentist appointments, would not be getting school transport and would not be getting into schools.</p> <p>What I and the Labour Party are seeking is to have a dependable, experienced presence in these centres, be they hotels or whatever, from the State.  It could be retired community welfare officers or experienced Intreo people, but it should be people who are able not only to point people in the right direction and solve problems as they arise but also to have a dependable reporting function to the Ministers and the Government so we know what is happening.  Every day, we are getting a new, unique, worrying query.  I have encountered safeguarding issues and people coming onto sites looking to take Ukrainian women from sites.  I do not have full faith in the structure of the event companies and facilities management companies that are taking over properties.  We need experienced State officials here.</p> <p> I also believe IPAS is too opaque.  It is impenetrable, and we cannot contact it even though it is playing a vital role in this.  That is very important and it is something I ask the Minister to take on board.</p> <p> They are the two issues - a dependable State presence on these sites and examining how IPAS is functioning.</p></speech>

In the past ten weeks, 28,000 Ukrainians have come to our shores seeking refuge from war.  We have provided accommodation to all who have asked for it, some 19,000 people, and people across the country have opened their homes to them.</p>  <p>  In terms of facilitating integration of this extraordinary flow of inward migration, the Government and broader society are getting the fundamentals right.  Key to this is the temporary protection directive and particularly how Ireland is implementing it swiftly for new arrivals.  I credit my colleagues in the Department of Social Protection for their role in this.  People are granted the same rights as EU citizens immediately.  This is a game changer as I believe broader society is also more inclined to see our new arrivals as equal because they have been granted equal rights.  There will be an enduring bond, beyond this war, between Ireland and Ukraine, as the basis of many Ukrainians' introduction to Ireland will facilitate successful integration.  Successful integration will also happen very much because of the groundswell of support from individuals and communities across the country.  Personally, I have never seen anything like it and we in Government must nurture and support this public reaction.  One of the ways we can do this is through our support of the community and voluntary sector.  The fast, responsive and adaptable reaction of the community and voluntary sector across the country has been extraordinary.  While there has been leadership at the highest levels in government on this issue, there also has been leadership in spades across the country at community level.  However, there is more to do.</p>  <p>  Community response fora have been set up in every local authority area to co-ordinate the local State and community sector response to the Ukrainians accommodated in each area.  The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, has provided supports to local authorities for these fora.  I have visited 12 different accommodation locations across the country in the past two months and everyone I have met is working hard to assist Ukrainians to settle in.  Agencies are generally working well together.  The local authority-convened community response fora must continue reaching out to all Ukrainians in their areas, especially those accommodated by the State, and assess additional needs.  I also ask all community groups working with Ukrainians to connect with their local community response fora.  In all the locations that I visited, and Roscommon last week was a prime example, the local response to Ukrainians has been strongest and most supportive in the areas where inter-agency relations have been established and grown, where community and statutory bodies work hand-in-hand and where new working relationships are formed and old ones strengthened.  It is also key that all community response fora include representation of Ukrainians themselves in the fora.  I am staying connected to the issues on the ground by visiting local responses and regularly meeting stakeholders such as Community Work Ireland, Volunteer Ireland, The Wheel and the Irish Local Development Network.</p>  <p>  I also want Members to be aware of the work being carried out in response to the Ukrainian crisis by two particular programmes funded by the Department of Rural and Community Development.  First, there is our network of funded volunteer centres and staff across the country and the volunteers they support.  We have a funded volunteer centre in every local authority area, which is a massive resource and is doing extraordinary work.  I also acknowledge the hundreds of community workers across the country who, under the social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP, have turned their attention to the needs of Ukrainian refugees in their communities.  I attended an online meeting this morning regarding how SICAP nationally through its over 600 community workers, even before the Ukraine crisis, was doing so much work to facilitate the integration of migrant communities.  Now these workers are stepping up to the plate again with their expertise and connections to assist Ukrainians across the country.</p>  <p>  I assure the volunteers, SICAP workers and the broader community and voluntary sector that I am working at national level with other Departments to get more supports for their work.  I am aware that their workload remains while they have done this additional work over the past two to three months.  The Taoiseach, the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O&rsquo;Gorman and I met a number of NGOs and community groups working on the ground two weeks ago and we have taken on board the issues they raised.  We are working on them and hope to meet the groups again soon.</p>  <p>  On the issue Deputy Duncan Smith raised with regard to the Shoreline Hotel, I understand that school transport has now been organised.  Fingal County Council is going in there.  English language classes are starting today via F&aacute;ilte Isteach and next week, and this is a model I expect will be replicated in other hotels around the country, Fingal County Council is facilitating all those key State agencies to come in and meet the refugees.</p></speech>

I will flag a couple of practical issues of which Ministers should be aware.  Much has been said that I agree with, particularly Deputy Duncan Smith's points about a State presence.  In my constituency, the local Fine Gael councillor, Mr. Jim Gildea, offered his home on the second day of the conflict to the Irish Red Cross.  He and his wife live in a home with additional space.  They have yet to receive a telephone call.  They received an email saying they would get a telephone call but nothing has happened.  Meanwhile, another family down the road nearby has a Ukrainian family staying.  They have been there for the past two months and with the pressure for everybody it has to move on.</p>  <p>  I could link them directly, but I cannot do that because the home and so forth have to be assessed, there must be Garda vetting and one cannot put vulnerable people in a newly vulnerable situation.  My difficulty is that I am aware of both situations but I cannot deal with the gap.  I have nobody to call and I cannot reach the Irish Red Cross or the IPAS unit.  I cannot join these dots even though I am aware of them, and this cannot be the only situation where this is occurring.  As public representatives we are encountering many of these different situations which we can use and flag and connect with somebody who can take things further.  As Deputies have said, it is difficult to reach IPAS and the Irish Red Cross.  I appreciate that they are under overwhelming pressure at present, but we have practical things that can be resolved on the ground.  We just need a better-connected system.</p>  <p>  I also have a particular concern about Ukrainian teenagers who are coming here, particularly those who are coming alone and who are reliant on Tusla due to whatever tragic reason they are in Ireland alone.  The difficulty is where they are ageing out of the Tusla system from 17 years old into 18 years old.  In usual circumstances in Ireland, a minor coming to 18 years old is under the after-care programme of Tusla.  It is not necessarily clear, it may be so but it is not yet apparent to me, that this is also the case in respect of Ukrainian children.  They are not necessarily under a care order, for example, but they are under the remit of, and generally reliant on, Tusla.  How do we protect those very vulnerable young people who may be moved from one accommodation to another and may be placed in a situation that is more at risk than where an 18-year-old would otherwise be placed?  I draw that to the Minister's attention.</p>  <p>  Other Deputies have raised vacancy.  That is an ongoing issue.  Going around my constituency last week I counted five vacant homes in one estate which historically had been a council estate.  I went back later in the week for a constituency clinic and I saw activity in three of them, so something is happening.  That is fine, but I cannot access the information about the others.  It is still difficult to do that.</p>  <p>  It occurs to me, however, that we have a very good rent a room tax relief scheme.  When the Minister was the spokesperson on housing for Fianna F&aacute;il he tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, asking for it to be extended from &euro;14,000 to &euro;15,000 per year.  I can understand that.  However, consider the pressures now in addition to our housing crisis, people coming out of direct provision and a greatly increased number of people looking for accommodation.</p>  <p>If we are trying to increase housing stock generally without placing additional pressure on the social housing system, is it really time to look at this scheme on a temporary basis?  Should we conduct a macroeconomic analysis and not only consider tax forgone?  If we take a three year temporary programme and do something radical such as double it or increase it by 50% to try to get more one-bedroom places for individuals or couples in Irish homes and provide tax relief to do so, the Department of Finance will speak about tax forgone against general tax income.  Could we look at an overall macroeconomic analysis of something such as this?  Could we examine what the impact may be on take-up and what the relative cost of this in terms of tax forgone might be versus the cost to the State of acquiring or providing emergency accommodation in other forms?  This could then be benched against the humanitarian concern of housing people in what we all recognise are not necessarily appropriate circumstances.  It is a radical thing to ask.  I ask that the view taken is not only the Department of Finance's quite narrow view of the tax analysis of it but that something more broadly across government would be considered.</p></speech>

According to the UNHCR, more than 5.5 million people have been forced to flee Ukraine since the Russian invasion on 24 February.  As of yesterday, 27,372 people have arrived in Ireland from Ukraine.  A total of 18,661 people have sought accommodation through the international protection accommodation service scheme.  I welcome confirmation from the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth that they have been offered safe emergency accommodation while long-term arrangements are being finalised.</p>  <p>  I thank the Minister, Deputy O'Brien.  I also thank his colleagues, the Ministers with responsibility for children, education and justice and other Departments and agencies for their efforts to date.  I know staff have made a tremendous effort over the past few weeks to deal with this unprecedented challenge.  I also commend local authority staff on their efforts.  In D&uacute;n Laoghaire Rathdown we have seen fantastic initiatives and efforts made in recent weeks.  As have other speakers, I highlight the tremendous welcome provided by the Irish people to people fleeing their homes in Ukraine and the efforts of local volunteers who have stepped up to support Ukrainians in towns and villages throughout Ireland.</p>  <p>  Given the extent of the situation, the State has done well to date, but there are longer-term issues.  One can foresee pressures and challenges and the Minister might consider a number of suggestions.  I have spoken to people who have offered homes or are considering offering homes, particularly on a more long-term basis.  They feel guidance or standard arrangements for essentials such as insurance and terms of licences would be helpful.  A modest payment to families hosting people to cover underlying costs might also be helpful.  A modest grant, linked with appropriate terms and conditions, to bring housing stock up to standard might be a quick way to unlock long-term vacant stock.  The Minister is examining this.</p>  <p>  Having visited Lithuania in March I am well aware of the feeling in the EU, particularly in the Baltic states which are subject to ongoing hostility and threats from Russia.  Europe must continue to stand united against Russian aggression and sanctions must continue until Russia ends its war and occupation in Ukraine.  In the meantime, Ireland must do everything we can to support the people of Ukraine.  As noted by their ambassador to Ireland, H.E., Gerasko Larysa, Ukraine and its people are fighting for their existence in Russia's barbaric illegal war.</p></speech>

Unfortunately since the previous occasion I spoke on this matter the situation in Ukraine has become even worse.  The human cost of the war continues to grow as cities are razed, towns are steamrolled and villages are laid to rest.  Nowhere appears to be out of reach of Russian brutality.  Even cities in the far west of Ukraine such as Lviv are targeted.</p>  <p>  Sadly we have often seen the brutal use of missiles in recent years by so-called great powers and superpowers.  As ever, civilians the world over continue to pay the price for the wars of the elite.  It is ordinary men, women and children in the firing line.  Whether it is residential neighbourhoods in Mariupol, children playing in Gaza, weddings or field hospitals in Afghanistan or starving villages in Yemen or Somalia modern remote warfare always hurts innocent civilians the most.  While some states try to normalise this brutal form of war it is the responsibility of neutral states such as Ireland to call it out.  It is also our responsibility to lead against the war and against the institutions that facilitate it.</p>  <p>  The efforts of Ireland's diplomatic mission at the United Nations and the leadership it has shown have not gone unnoticed.  However, I believe our political leadership can and should go further.  The United Nations and not NATO is the proper forum for delivering aid to Ukraine if sought and, if sought, a peacekeeping mission.  Ireland can and should be more vocal on this point.  We should be acting as leaders for a non-aligned policy of peacekeeping at the Security Council.  We must challenge the veto of imperialist powers, whether that is Russia or any other great power, and ensure human rights, peace and solidarity are the defining virtues of UN decision making.  We must use our position to show leadership among the non-aligned nations of the world and advocate a new democratic model of UN decision making.  While imperialist powers continue to hold a veto against UN peacekeeping deployments they will continue in their war of aggression the world over.</p>  <p>  As has been mentioned, it is important that we accept those fleeing Russian terror.  The generosity of the public needs to be reflected by the Government.  We have the resources to house all and it is important that we do not divide society.  Earlier, Deputy &Oacute; Broin made suggestions that are worth taking on board.  I acknowledge the work the Irish Refugee Council and local authorities have done on managing the reception of Ukrainian refugees.  Dublin City Council has been very supportive of the community that is welcoming residents at the Evergreen Club in Terenure.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge the work and commitment of the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman.  He and his staff have been hugely professional, supportive and encouraging.  Along with all of his staff they have made a huge difference.  I welcome the commitment by the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, to ensure the current targets are not impacted by Ukrainian refugees.  This would only set vulnerable groups against each other and could damage social cohesion and social solidarity and give the extremists an opportunity to develop their hate.  As do other Deputies, I believe the Baggot Street hospital provides an opportunity to develop support and it is important that it is done.</p></speech>

They have been displaced by war and forced to leave their homes.  A huge amount of work is going on at State level to support them.  The response from communities throughout Ireland has been very generous.  We have seen communities come together and put the shoulder to the wheel.  We have seen community leaders and community activists showing real leadership on this, turning huge goodwill into practical help.  It is important to recognise this.  There are also those working for local authorities and Departments who are doing a huge amount of additional work.  It is very important to recognise this.</p>  <p>  I want to touch on a few issues raised by the Minister on some of the measures to increase housing supply overall.  I welcome that the commercial rates refunds for vacant properties will be ended.  This should have been done a long time ago.  It never made sense to reward vacancy through a tax exemption while those who put buildings to use pay the tax.  For this to be effective the loophole needs to be closed for the many commercial vacant premises, particularly newer developments.  By "newer developments" I mean those in communities that were built ten or 15 years ago, such as in Clongriffin in my constituency.  More than 50% of the commercial units at ground floor level are vacant and have been since being built.  This is matched in newer developments throughout Ireland.  I understand many of them escape rates being applied because the owners claim the units were never finished and are still shells.  This is even though the planning permission to fully finish them has long expired.</p> <p>For this measure to be effective, that loophole needs to be shut down and it needs to be shut down quickly.  It is important in terms of bringing buildings back into use and if they are not commercially viable, converting them into housing and if they are commercially viable, getting life back into communities.  It is also important in terms of sustainability.  Could the Minister look at that?  <br/><br/>In terms of activating unused planning permissions, the Minister has been very vocal for a number of years about the need for very strong &quot;use it or lose it&quot; measures.  I think we are still waiting to see those strong measures so they need to be brought in urgently.  We often hear this narrative about the planning process.  It is a significant issue.  I accept the frustrations some have with the planning but there are a lot of planning permissions.  There is a significant issue with them not being used and built out.  In the last quarter of last year, about 6,200 homes were under construction in Dublin but there were 28,500 homes with planning permission.  There is an issue with people sitting on those planning permissions and not wanting to bring them to market at the same time because that would obviously have knock-on effects on affordability.  It would be good for people in terms of affordability but might not be in the interests of all the developers.  Different landowners and developers over the year have told me that this is what they do.  They release them at a slow pace to control the prices, which, of course, is what they will do if they are able to.  <br/><br/>A practical issue that is a small one but one that affects supply in terms of vacancy is the delays around things like trying to get fire certificates.  I know of one landlord with a vacant office for which there is planning permission.  Everything is in line to try to convert it into housing above a shop in a town but the landlord has been waiting for months while trying to get the fire certificate.  Every time, the landlord gets an update, he is told it will take another few months.  These are premises that could be used for housing.  It is on a small scale and the landlord is very frustrated about it.  When we are putting more and more work on to people who are already stretched in terms of housing delivery or processes and are not putting in additional resources, there is a problem.  This landlord was told recently that one of the administrative staff dealing with fire certificates has been taken off that to deal with the current housing crisis.  By not having those extra resources, we are actually creating additional issues in terms of vacancy.  <br/><br/>I very much agree with the comments of Deputy Duncan Smith in terms of needing full State presence in those professional supports.  A significant effort has been made by volunteers but we cannot continue to rely on that will and volunteers.  I appreciate that this is an emergency and people have put in significant effort but to date, there has largely been reliance on hotels and other forms of emergency accommodation.  This accommodation is suitable for short-term accommodation but we need to move into more sustainable options for people.  As Deputy Devlin said, in the case of people who might have an under-utilised property such as a holiday home they do not rent out that is in walk-in condition and could be used, apart from the voluntary pledges that are being worked through, there is no framework or information about insurance or helping to meet those costs of wear and tear.  A very strong call should be made to people who have holiday homes that do not see much use who might only use them once or twice a year to make them available for this housing need on a once-off basis but a framework needs to be put in place.  It is only reasonable then for these people to be given some compensation to cover their costs and if, for example, they have to make alternative holiday arrangements.  This could and should be done.  I am concerned that there is an over-reliance on continuing to use hotel accommodation- not by the Minister's Department but by the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, which is leading on this - when there are other options that should be used.  The Irish Refugee Council has been strong on the need to do that.  I appreciate that it takes time but we should not repeat bad mistakes made in other areas, including in terms of homelessness where people have been caught in substandard emergency accommodation for extended periods with the indefensible pressure that puts them under.  <br/><br/>In addition to holiday homes, at least 92,000 vacant homes are available.  According to GeoDirect, there are more than 22,000 derelict homes and almost 30,000 vacant commercial buildings.  Ground floor vacancy rates in Irish towns are well above the European average with vacancy rates as high 28% in Tipperary town according to the Heritage Council and 24% in the centre of Dundalk and Tralee.  To put those figures in context, about 120,000 people are on housing waiting lists or in insecure HAP tenancies.  It is not true to say that we could match those vacancies exactly with those 120,000 people.  Where there is housing need does not match perfectly with where there is housing demand, or anything like perfectly, but it is true to say that while much of this vacant stock is in isolated rural areas, according to the 2016 CSO figures, 64% of it is in urban areas and is largely located in areas where there is housing need.  <br/><br/>The Minister is correct that we need both to deal with the existing housing crisis and to meet the needs of people forced to flee their homes as a result of war and he has my full support in this regard.  We need to tackle vacancy to free up existing homes and we need a tax on vacant homes, which has been talked about for years but has still not happened.  There are reports in the <i>Irish Examiner</i>about campaigners Jude Sherry and Frank O'Connor, who have done excellent work identifying 700 derelict properties - this does not include vacant properties - within 2 km of Cork city centre.  In the middle of a housing crisis, there is no justification for that.  This requires an emergency response from the Minister and the Department as to how on earth in the middle of a housing crisis, 700 derelict properties can be identified by two volunteer campaigners in Cork.  It should not be left to Dr. O'Connor and Ms Sherry to do that; Cork City Council should be doing this.  We need a significant effort relating to vacancy and dereliction and we need it now.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-05a.422" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1598" speakername="Fergus O'Dowd" time="14:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022050500038#OO00200"><p>On the last point, Louth County Council are leading the way.  I do not know what is happening in Cork but Louth County Council identified over 100 abandoned homes and renovated them at an average cost of &euro;100,000 per home.  All of those homes are occupied and families are living in them.  I agree with Deputy Cian O'Callaghan that we need a tax on empty homes.  It is something for which I have been arguing for in Fine Gael for a number of years.  I hope more people are beginning to listen to the sense those arguments make.</p>  <p>  I strongly support the view of Deputy Carroll MacNeill regarding the rent a room scheme.  It is an obvious way.  These are people whose children have left home.  The rent a room scheme might be used to help many of these families.  It will not be easy to match up individuals with empty properties and there are other issues such as governance and appropriate placements but it would make a lot of sense and I very much commend that.  </p>  <p>  This is the 71st day of the war.  Over 7.7 million people have been dispossessed and 5.7 million people have left Ukraine.  This is the same as every man, woman and child in Ireland leaving Ireland to go to another country.  This is what is happening in Ukraine.  </p> <p>I very much welcome and support the work of the Government and the work of the Ministers concerned.  Indeed, I believe that my own council, Louth County Council, is doing an excellent job.  I also commend the community groups.  I wish to mention two Ukrainians who are showing very important leadership locally, Olga Duka and Natasha Ibanez.  They are helping their community and us to ensure that the Ukrainians are welcomed into our community.  Their support is very strong and they are going from strength to strength.  As others have done, I wish to voice my support for providing support to families who have taken in refugees.  It is a fact that energy costs are going up.  People are realising that now.  Unfortunately, the energy crisis and the war is leading to an even more difficult situation.  There is an issue that has been mentioned in the media, but I have not heard a Minister talking about it today.  Let us get the facts out.  What is happening on the proposed payment of &euro;400 per month for those who take in refugees that was announced in the media?  Are we flying the flag or paying the money?  I think it is time to pay the money and to support those families, who will have significant and increasing energy costs as a result of this humanitarian crisis.  <br/><br/>The crisis has brought a great response from Louth County Council.  The crisis management team, in co-operation with community and other groups, has made a significant difference both in Dundalk, where they have repurposed the Dundalk sports centre, and in Drogheda, where they are repurposing and using the Dominican and Franciscan facilities for longer-term accommodation.  I know the work is going on.  They are looking at Drumcar and the Marist college in Dundalk to provide further medium- to long-term accommodation.  At the end of the day, this has all happened before.  It is nothing new for Ukrainians to be dispossessed from their homes.  Indeed, a Soviet commentator, Vasily Grossman, wrote about it in two of his novels, <i>Stalingrad</i>and <i>Life and Fate</i>.  He was present in Ukraine 80 years ago, when the Nazis were murdering, plundering and killing millions of citizens there.  The largest number of Jews that were exterminated during the Second World War were Ukrainians.  Grossman wrote his book a long time ago.  He wrote about Nazi Germany, but if we put in the word &quot;Russia&quot; into his text, it sounds very true today:  What has become of Russia?  What has happened?  They burn villages, organise executions of prisoners of war and massacre peaceful civilians.  His question is relevant today:  Are there no longer any good, noble or honest Russians?  How can that be?  We know their science, literature, music, philosophy and culture.  Russia and its people will survive, and goodness will triumph over evil.  It is not acceptable, when we talk about the war, to talk about ordinary Russians.  It is really Putin and the political system.  We are not talking about the ordinary people of Russia.  I hope that there will be changes there.  I have about ten seconds left.  I wish to state that the Minister is doing an excellent job.  We must put our money where the people are.  We must look after the people who are in our homes, and ensure that the families who are accommodating them receive the payment.  </p></speech>

I thank the many volunteers, and those who have opened their hotels, apartments and homes to people who are fleeing the war in Ukraine.  I also wish to acknowledge, in particular, the Irish Red Cross, the many other NGOs and their volunteers, who are playing such an essential role in this national effort.  I extend a welcome, a c&eacute;ad m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte, to every person who has arrived here since the war began.  I know, from hearing the stories of many Ukrainian people who have come to Ireland, that home is undoubtedly where they want to be, with their families and friends, living in their own homes, going to work or school and living a normal life.  Instead, they have been forced to flee, in many cases, leaving their loved ones behind and, in particular, the older people and the men in their lives.  Few of us can imagine what it feels like to have one's life turned upside down like that.  Words must be little consolation.  However, I hope that people will feel welcomed and safe here, in their temporary home.</p>  <p>  We have welcomed 27,000 Ukrainian people to our shores.  Two thirds of them are women, and around one third of them are under 18.  Of those people, 18,500 have sought accommodation from international protection accommodation services.  There is no doubt that we, as a country, have a massive challenge on our hands.  There is a challenge to ensure that each of these people is looked after and is housed appropriately.  We do not want to add to their trauma in any way.  I welcome that in addition to hotels, tourist accommodation and pledges made through the Irish Red Cross, the Government is also identifying State-owned or local authority properties which may be suitable for accommodation.  I ask the Minister to consider engaging with the HSE before its site in Crooksling, in my constituency, is sold.  There is an out-of-use nursing home there, with around 6,000 sq. ft of accommodation and facilities in Brittas, which is on a bus route to Dublin city centre.  It could be repurposed to help accommodate Ukrainians.  Now is the time to be innovative and to think outside the box, to bring in additional supply to our housing stock.  Unfortunately, as we all know, our housing stock was not adequate to meet demand before the war.  That is why we need to supplement it with additional homes that otherwise would not be available.  That is why it is so important that we engage with people on the holiday homes front.  We should really incentivise them to give up their holiday homes for the duration of this crisis, where possible, to accommodate Ukrainians.  As others have stated, another great way of bringing more properties into use is to look at tackling vacancy and dereliction.  We speak about the issue quite a lot.  There are plans in place.  Fine Gael recently launched a document on renewal.  There are some good ideas in that that could quickly turn vacant or derelict properties into homes.  It is also important that we look at the homes of people who are in nursing homes currently, through the fair deal scheme.  I note that the Minister has made some commitments around this.  It is very timely.  These are all important solutions that could help us increase and add to our current housing stock.  As Deputy Carroll MacNeill has said, a great way of doing that is by extending the rent-a-room tax relief.  I understand that additional individual pledges are still coming into the Irish Red Cross and are being assessed.  We all want to see that progressing as quickly as possible.  The reimbursement that we have spoken about today is crucial to help tackle the cost of living crisis that families are facing.  It is a big undertaking, and one which people should not enter into lightly, in giving up their holiday home or having a new family in their existing home.  I think that supporting Ukrainian people with social welfare support services, as we have done from the moment they have arrived in Ireland, is key to giving them the independence and self-support to turn things around.</p>  <p>  I know that it can be quite frustrating for some Irish people, who have their own housing problems, to hear us talking about this additional level of crisis in our housing market.  However, I do not think this needs to be an either-or situation.  We need to ensure that the efforts of the various Departments, that are working so hard to ensure that we are addressing the existing housing and affordability supply, are doubled down on.  In the past 12 months, 22,000 new homes were completed, construction began on 35,000 new homes, and 43,000 planning applications for new homes were granted.  Scaling up our social and affordable housing supply, increasing cost-rental delivery, improving supports for first-time buyers and returning our vacant stock to the housing market are all important steps to take at this important and challenging time.  </p></speech>

There might not be consensus emerging across the House, but I think everybody in the House seems to agree with the broad thrust of where we are going in terms of the provision of housing for Ukrainians.  There is increased unanimity on the view that we must tackle vacancy.  Points have been made about dereliction, which we are further away from tackling, and bringing properties back into usage.  My colleague, Deputy Matthews, has some very interesting ideas around that.  I know that the Minister has engaged with him.  I want to use my time to drill down into a few specific issues.  There has been much praise for the response of local authorities.  That is very much deserved.  From engaging with my own local authority officials, I know that they are responding first, and worrying about costs later.  They are spending the money now in the expectation that they will recoup it from central government.  Of course, there should be oversight of spending and we should always try to ensure value for money for the taxpayer.  However, it is important that we give that commitment to local government that the money that they spend will be recouped.</p> <p>As we had to have an emergency response in accommodation, we are housing people in emergency centres and hotels.  As we move towards a more medium-term solution, however, I strongly believe we have to consider the layering up of services.  Accommodation and housing are central but on top of that we have to look at education provision, the availability of employment, social protection services and transport provision.</p> <p> While IPAS is the lead agency in providing accommodation, I have heard estimates that between one quarter and one third of Ukrainians are staying with family members.  That means the local authorities do not really have sight of these people and do not have a role in providing accommodation for them in the long term.  Policy should never be done because of specific examples but I have heard specific examples of people arriving with complex needs for whom it is difficult.  The accommodation provision they have is not suitable.  For example, I am aware of a child in a school who is autistic and is finding it hard to deal with the dislocation and trauma of the move.  That must be extremely difficult and it must be amplified when that family is in a hotel room and must go back to that constricted and confined space.  As we move to that medium-term solution, we need to look at the basket of services that we need to apply.  They have to follow housing but we also have to think about the other services we provide.</p></speech>

Putin's army has invaded a sovereign land and is murdering and terrorising a sovereign people.  There are increasing reports, as happens in so many conflicts, that Russia is using rape as a weapon of war.  There are reports of the rape of women, children, girls and now also of men and boys.  The savage cruelty and inhumanity of Putin's war makes our humanitarian response all the more important and urgent.  Given their experience, it is crucial that these people who are coming to us - and I will call them our Ukrainians as that is who they will be - feel safe and secure, starting with how and where we house them.  It is important that those who have suffered sexual abuse will be given the proper supports when they arrive here and that our NGOs do not have to waste any time with fundraising when they could be providing that vital support.</p>  <p>  Sadly, for a lot of the Ukrainians coming the Government has made a shambles of their accommodation needs, adding to our housing crisis.  I have people in north Kildare who would love to offer accommodation to people fleeing Ukraine if they only had a house of their own.  However, in their 60s they are sleeping in their cars or camped out on their children&rsquo;s sofas.  For the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, and his Government, what is a home for our citizens compared to the millions in profits that a vulture or cuckoo fund can make?  It is the lowest of the low to try to blame the poorest of the poor for a housing crisis that is a direct result of his Government's phobia of public and affordable housing, particularly seen as there are none as generous as people who have experienced poverty.  They would share their last sandwich with you.</p>  <p>  The Government is obsessed with turning housing, something every human being needs, into a profit commodity for the wealthy and the fabulously wealthy.  When you look at the pain, suffering, anxiety and fear of people coming to us day in, day out and week in, week out and desperate for housing you can see where the term "filthy rich" came from.  It is repulsive in this well-off State in 2022.  It is repulsive that we would have our own people struggling to find a place to buy or rent and it is beneath any Irish Minister, given our history, that he would seek to blame migrants for the housing crisis-----</p></speech>

Or has the Government let the cat of the bag that it thrives on and is obsessed by optics, gestures and cheap PR that cost the taxpayer and the people with no homes a fortune?  Is it more important for the Government to stand on the international stage and be seen to welcome Ukrainian refugees than to have housing and accommodation that they need?  Instead of posing as international statesmen I would ask the Members of Government to be actual statesmen for all the people and use this crisis that is affecting our people and the people we welcome so warmly to revolutionise housing in this State.  There are too many already trapped in the no-man&rsquo;s land on our housings lists, losing their children's childhoods waiting and waiting.  The Government has the power and the duty to fix this crisis.  We are happy and willing to work with the Government because we know from our clinics that there are too many people wasting their lives away waiting for a home.</p></speech>

There have been bring and buy sales and many people across my constituency have welcomed these people.  I also know from my dealings with the Irish Red Cross that its staff are working their fingers to the bone.  It is important that we get this right.  If the Irish Red Cross needs extra help and resources, it is important that they are given to it.  Vulnerable people coming here must be provided with a roof over their heads through the proper channels.  This is so important because not everybody has good intentions.</p>  <p>  One thing we are not happy about is how the highly controversial company, Aramark, is managing to get another ride on the public money merry-go-around to provide meals to another group of fragile people coming to us.  There are serious questions in the public mind about the services they provide to direct provision.  How did this happen?  Why was the process skipped?  There are serious questions to answer here.  I hate it when I see reference made to "feeding people".  We feed animals and we provide meals to people.  Those meals are supposed to be nourishing, appetising, well thought out and well presented to human beings, not least human beings who have been traumatised.  I would like to ask the Minister on what evidence of it providing this service was this company chosen again?  To me, it beggars belief.</p></speech>

I did so in response to the Minister's letter, which I responded to a number of weeks ago.  I will not get into the politics or the foreign policy because I do not have time and we will debate that on another day.  I want to discuss the practical issue of how we do what we have to do, namely, both accommodate Ukrainian refugees and address the housing crisis, which is very severe at present.  I want to argue with the Minister that we have to make this a win-win.  Notwithstanding all our debates on previous policies and so on, if the current situation has prompted the Government into doing extraordinary and unprecedented things and if it is willing to consider extraordinary and unprecedented things, then I suggest we do that to get that win-win.  We have the opportunity to do it because Putin's bloody invasion and the fact there is a war gives the Minister extra powers and I specifically refer to the Emergency Powers Act 1939, which gives him the power to do extraordinary and unprecedented things.  Critically, this includes the power in section 2(2)(g) to "authorise and provide for the acquisition, taking possession, control or user (either by agreement or compulsorily) by... the State of any land or other property whatsoever" in the context of war.  We should have used those powers before to get hold of vacant and empty buildings but whatever about that debate, I am appealing to the Minister to now use that power because he is justified in doing so.</p>  <p>  I want to cite the following examples from my area.  I invite the Minister to look at the Seamark Building on Google.  It is 10,000 sq. m large with about six storeys and has been empty for a decade at Merrion Gates.  It is a scandal and we could use it for accommodation.  We could reconfigure it very quickly; it is a modern building and a lot of people could be put in there.  Right beside it, in the hands of the Religious Sisters of Charity, are the St. Mary's Centre Telford complex and the Caritas nursing home, which are virtually empty and have been for a few years.  Whatever about the previous history of that it is available and there are other public and private buildings available.</p>  <p>  I am saying we need to do this unprecedented thing.  Simultaneously, we should use the same powers to get a higher proportion of social and affordable housing from new developments.  Legislatively the Minister can get 10% social and affordable housing in new developments and I know the Minister has upped it to 20%.  I am asking the Minister to seriously consider getting a higher proportion.  In my area one could drive along the N11 and see multiple apartment complexes near completion.  In Cherrywood, there are huge amounts of properties near completion, for example.  In the current situation we are justified in doing this and the Minister has the power to purchase more of those apartments, both for people on the housing lists and for the extra housing needs we have.  We have to do that now.</p> <p>Otherwise, we will not be able to deal with the housing crisis, which is at a very acute level.</p> <p> The Minister was saying I was a bit late.  I know he has to run off.  I have just come from D&uacute;n Laoghaire courthouse where a young working man and his family are about to be evicted by the council over a dispute about family succession.  I will not get into the rights and wrongs of the issue, although I think it is wrong, but it makes no sense.  Why would we allow no-fault evictions in the current climate?  Why would the Minister allow it?  It will put extra burden on the emergency accommodation which we need for all the refugees.</p> <p> There is a win-win here.  Stop the no-fault evictions on an emergency basis.  I would like to see it go further but surely this is the emergency that would require that to happen.  I ask the Minister to stop them even if it is on a temporary basis for a year or two.  Given the current climate, why would we put extra burdens on emergency housing services by allowing no-fault evictions from public or private housing?  I ask the Minister to get a higher proportion of the buildings that are near completion or completed and to use the emergency acquisition powers that are available to him to get public and private buildings.</p> <p> We should go on an aggressive campaign to recruit people directly to local authorities or to some sort of State construction core in order to reconfigure and refurbish buildings.  I know the Minister has made efforts to move in this direction, but in my area there are more council voids than there have been for quite some time.  It is clear that we have not got enough staff.  There should be an aggressive campaign to recruit people directly in order that the State will have the capacity to move in and refurbish both council and private properties that could be reconfigured to provide temporary, emergency or medium- and longer-term accommodation.  I appeal to the Minister to take those suggestions seriously and to look at some of the proposals in my area.</p></speech>

The Minister shook his head when it was mentioned a moment ago and indicated he did not say what he is reported as having said.  He should clarify his comments because what seemed to be said on the radio was that a serious cause of the increase in homelessness is that people were coming from EEA and non-EEA countries and immediately going on the homeless list, as opposed to the very obvious reason for the explosion in homelessness that is the ending of the eviction ban.  One can trace the increase in the numbers of homeless people from the end of the eviction ban.</p>  <p>  The real people responsible for the housing crisis are Irish landlords, developers, US and European vulture funds and the real estate investment trusts, REITs.  We need to fight for emergency action to provide decent housing for all.  A month ago I raised with the Taoiseach the case of more than 20 families in the Shannon Arms in Limerick facing eviction by a consortium of landlords that included Supermac's millionaire Mr. Pat McDonagh.  We now know that these tenants include a family from Ukraine that has been living in Ireland for the past number of years, as well as a family from Syria.  The far right wants to sow division and have neighbour blame neighbour, but the only people who benefit from this are the millionaire slumlords such as Mr. Pat McDonagh.  What we actually need is to build solidarity among neighbours and all working-class people to stand up to the landlords and refuse to be bullied out of their homes.  Some people have already been kicked out and are homeless.  Others face eviction in a matter of weeks.  However, the tenants are now organised and are resisting these evictions.  Mr. Pat McDonagh is masking his evictions as renovations and is doubling up the occupancy of apartments and reintroducing tenements to squeeze more money from them.  Scandalously, if Mr. McDonagh succeeds in making them homeless, some of these tenants could end up being put up by the State in the local hotel that he owns.</p>  <p>  Last month, the Taoiseach appealed to the landlords not to evict the families.  The landlords have not listened.  I appeal to the Minister and the Taoiseach to take action and not to speak any more empty words.  I ask them to bring the Shannon Arms into public ownership in order that the tenants can be protected and it can be used to house others in need and to invest in it to improve conditions and strengthen the community there.</p></speech>

Imagine if a few of the words in that were switched around in order that the headline stated, &quot;Migrants from countries other than Ukraine adding to pressure on homeless supports, Le Pen warns&quot;.  That would fit perfectly well.  The Minister is directly quoted in the article, and the headline does not jar in any way with the content of what he said.  Unless the direct quotes in the newspaper article are made up or false, that headline reflects what the Minister said.</p><p>The Minister and his Government colleagues have been given a number of opportunities in the House this week to step back and distance themselves from what was said.  When the Minister was asked yesterday and earlier in this debate, which I did not see it but I have listened to the comments here, there was a vigorous shaking of the head.  The Taoiseach was asked about that by my colleague, Deputy Boyd Barrett, yesterday.  People should have a look at what the Taoiseach said in reply; he completely sidestepped the question.</p><p>This is not good enough.  There is no place for comments of that nature.  The Minister and the Taoiseach should face up to that and accept that if a mistake was made, then what was said should be retracted.  Trying to shimmy out of it will not wash.  No one group of vulnerable or homeless people should be picked out in this way.  We are watching very carefully what Ministers say on this question from here on in.  There were other points I wanted to make about a situation in Cork but I have 20 seconds left and I have approximately a minute and a half of points to make on it.  I will leave it at that.</p></speech>

It is important that we say it.  I appreciate the early statements by the Ministers and by all the Deputies who have been present throughout the debate.  I would like to think that this unites the House and the country in terms of our response to a war that is now in its 71st day.  The impacts of the war are absolutely startling, if it has not long started, on our society and economy and most importantly on our role as signed-up members of the human race.</p>  <p>  I will make points as a direct response to the sort of representations to my office from constituents who wish to play their part.  Their generosity is genuine and their compassion for the people fleeing Vladimir Putin's brutal war in Ukraine is absolute.  However, they have questions and they want clarity.  They want those questions answered in a way that will ensure that they are comfortable in making sure of their generosity.  As we saw at the outbreak of the pandemic, there are, unfortunately, certain limits to solidarity.  There is often a rush for solidarity and then when things a bit tough, people get a little bit concerned or it slips out.  Whether we like it or not, the wall-to-wall coverage of the war in Ukraine will diminish as time goes by.  Unfortunately, the notion of the Russians shelling Kyiv or committing atrocities the likes of which have not been seen, if not since the Balkans war, then certainly since the Second World War, becomes normalised.</p>  <p>  My office gets questions from people who may be fortunate or in a situation in which they have a second home such as a holiday property or one they are in a position to put to use for this effort.  In some situations they might have a spare room in their home.  People who have contacted me have properties and are willing to put them forward, but they want to have clarity for their own purposes.  It is not necessarily for their own sake, it also for dealing with insurance companies in terms of the ability to inspect the properties, to have an idea when they may receive the properties back and what exactly they are signing up for.  They ask when they will get clarity and whether their offer is being accepted, under what term it is being accepted and about the registration.  I fully appreciate that the Red Cross, which is running this portal, is snowed under with offers, some of which are the most generous and genuine but which are simply not suitable for what is required.</p> <p>When these offers are submitted, some people will have questions.  They want to know that these will be answered in an open and non-judgmental way.  These people wish to have the peace of mind of knowing they will be able to refer back to their insurance companies, banks or even other family members with information, especially where the property involved is the subject of a time-share or split-ownership arrangement.  A number of extremely suitable properties are not being used now because of a lack of clarity or information.  This is because people who wish to engage in the process, but who are not absolutely sure they will be able to follow through and complete the process, are afraid there might be some pushback.</p> <p> Many Deputies have referred to the need to engage in myth-busting.  I have already started to get one or two calls to my office from people who may be on the housing list or trying to get a child into a particular school.  The practice of othering is one we have been seeing for some time.  It has been present during all my time in politics, whether here, in the Seanad or on the county council.  I refer to situations where people believe they are not getting a house, not moving up the housing list or not getting a place for their children in a school because somebody else is coming in and leapfrogging them.  This is being fuelled by campaigns of misinformation and disinformation on social media undertaken by malevolent characters who would jump on any crisis to make odious points.  We must be aware that this is happening.  I have referred many times to the open approach of the Russian Government and Russian operatives to warfare, which is not just about shells and missiles, troops on the ground, cyberwarfare and hybrid warfare; it also involves the use of the tool of misinformation and disinformation.</p> <p> Across the Continent, the level of misinformation being directed to European Union member states is evident.  I speak to parliamentary colleagues in the Baltic States and central and eastern Europe, especially those in Poland and Slovakia.  Those countries have been dealing with this disinformation and misinformation emanating from the Government of the Russian Federation and its operatives for well over a decade.  We are now starting to get a taste of it.  Horrendous mock imagery was broadcast earlier this week on Russian state television of what would happen if a nuclear bomb was detonated off the coast of Donegal and Ireland became a nuclear desert after a tsunami.  It is par for the course for the type of disinformation directed into Estonian television sets, for example, or online.  We must be aware when unknown people with multiple numbers after their handles are coming on social media and saying people are not getting places on social housing lists because everything is being given to Ukrainian refugees and 27,000 people are jumping the queue.  It is important that we target that type of misinformation and disinformation.  We must not only call it out; the Government must also take the lead in doing so.</p> <p> When talking about housing and accommodation needs, and I have mentioned this point before, the overall holistic approach to caring for our guests from Ukraine is something that deserves a continued focus in the context of providing language supports, immersion and utilising those people resident here who are from other eastern and central European countries, who may have been living here longer, as well as people from the Ukrainian diaspora.  Counselling and pastoral care are crucial for people coming from a traumatic situation who will, unfortunately, also be facing more trauma in future, whether that stems from loved ones lost in the conflict or houses destroyed.</p> <p> I also echo and want to add to the point made by the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, this morning.  We talk about rebuilding Ukraine.  Ireland and the rest of the EU need to begin the process of devising a type of Marshall plan for Ukraine.  We must rebuild Ukraine, not only to restore it to what it was before Russia&rsquo;s brutal war but to enhance it.  Such a level of reconstruction and financial support is in our interest.  It will ensure that when - and not if - Ukraine joins the EU expeditiously, that it will do so from a position where the country is ready to participate in the Union and serve in its institutions.</p></speech>

I was at the national child safety summit in Croke Park.  It was an excellent event and well done to all involved, including One in Four.  It was an enlightening experience, and this is a matter that must be addressed in the long term.  When somebody comes to us for help, the only thing we can do is to offer that help.  By the end of May, we are expecting that between 29,000 and 33,000 Ukrainians will be seeking accommodation in Ireland.  We must do what we can to support them.  I spoke about this at the parliamentary party meeting.  I am working with a group in Carlow and I am finding the generosity of the Carlow people amazing.  It is the same all across the country.  We are all aware of how good Irish people are when it comes to something like a crisis, and this is a crisis.</p>  <p>  That said, I have a few concerns.  One is in the context of bed and breakfast and hotel accommodation.  In Carlow and across the country, we have seen communities get together and do up houses and old schools because we are trying to ensure that everyone who comes here will have a place to stay.  The issue now is that this type of approach is not sustainable in the long term.  While I welcome everything that has been done, and I am conscious I missed the Minister of State's contribution, I wonder what our long-term plan is in this regard.  We need a strategy for the future.  This is not a situation that is going to go away overnight and we must ensure we have a framework in place to address this aspect.  This is important.  It is important for Irish people and Ukrainian refugees to know that we have such a plan in place.</p>  <p>  Previous speakers mentioned that when we originally talked about accommodation, people were asked to offer up houses.  People have been so good and they have done that.  I am also, though, getting phone calls in my constituency from people who are saying they tried to get in contact with someone in this regard, but no one has responded to them.  Another person rang me to say a family was living in a house the caller felt was not up to scratch.  It was felt that the house had not been checked properly and that it should have been before a family was put in to live in the building.  We are just starting to come across these sorts of issues.  In fairness to the Red Cross, which is doing its absolute best, this is an unprecedented situation.  No one was prepared for this to happen on such a scale.  We can only say to those in the Red Cross that we understand they are doing their best in this context.</p>  <p>  Regarding people with disabilities, a man contacted me through a family.  He is in a wheelchair.  Unfortunately, the accommodation he was put into was unsuitable.  In the end, the man was moved.  There was a meeting of the Joint Committee on Disability Matters this morning and one of the topics that came up was that people with disabilities fleeing war can be treated unfairly if they cannot advocate for themselves.  This is another aspect to be considered.  We must be extremely mindful of people with disabilities and of people in wheelchairs.  We must ensure, if we can, that we are able to accommodate them.  We must be mindful of this aspect too.  I contacted the office of the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  However, there is an issue in this regard.  In fairness, everybody is doing their best.  Local authorities are doing their best, and I can only sing the praises of Annette Fox of the Carlow County Development Partnership, CCDP, in the context of its social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP.  The Minister of State knows Ms Fox as well.  She is doing an excellent job.  All these different agencies are doing their best.  My point though is that it is important that there be more points of contact for people wishing to offer their homes for accommodation in places like Carlow town, Tullow, Bagenalstown or the Minister of State's city of Kilkenny.  Similar to what I said before about people who have a house or a holiday home, the problem encountered concerns trying to get the relevant information and getting it quickly.  This seems to be the biggest issue we are facing.  Therefore, I ask that we examine a system to address this issue.  In Carlow, the SICAP programme is leading this endeavour through the community.  The local authority, and I mention Brian O&rsquo;Donovan and Michael Brennan in this context, is also playing a big part regarding the issue of accommodation.  What is important is getting the relevant information out fast enough and undertaking communication quickly.  I ask that this aspect be examined.</p>  <p>  I reiterate that it is important to say we are all doing our best here and working as best we can.  I would feel more secure about the future, however, if we had a framework in place.  Hopefully, perhaps, the Minister of State might come back to us in a few weeks with a response that will provide us with more information.  I must return to the point - and there is no point in blaming anyone because everyone is doing their best - that I always feel that the provision of information seems to be where we fall down a bit.  I know the Minister of State will address this facet.</p>  <p>  The Sunday before the bank holiday weekend was Easter Sunday for Ukrainians who are members of the Eastern Orthodox Church.  They have a slightly different date for Easter.  In fairness to Annette Fox, Stephanie McDermott and all the different groups, and I do not want to mention too many people because I will always forget someone, a big event was organised.  It was lovely to see children present and playing at the event.  There was Ukrainian music.  When we were going into the room, there was food and lovely arty eggs.  It is a tradition in Ukraine to buy and craft colourful eggs for Easter.  When I was in that room, I just thought how nice it was that we in Ireland are ensuring that we make these people feel welcome.</p> <p>That is part of it, namely, trying to make sure they have their events that they need to have.  There are challenging times ahead but I know that we in Ireland will do our best and will make sure they are kept safe.</p></speech>

The destruction that is happening in Ukraine and the annexation of parts of Crimea are truly horrifying.  War crimes are taking place there, brutality, rape and genocide.  The Russian leadership will have to be held to account for it in the future.  Pictures have come out of Bucha in the past two weeks showing victims with their hands tied, their fingernails removed and obvious evidence of torture.  Women and children have been raped.  These are crimes against Ukraine and humanity.  At some future point, Ireland must be more strident in terms of expressing our its outrage at what has happened there.</p>  <p>  The recent propaganda on Russian television detailing the extermination of the population of Ireland and Britain through a nuclear attack is a further sign of the desperation of the Russian leadership as it moves to provide new threats to Western support for Ukraine's fight for democratic survival.  The Russian ambassador has repeatedly lied to the Irish people.  He should be summoned by the Government to account for the tyrannical threats of Vladimir Putin to our country and our existence.  He should also get the message that Ireland has never given in to bullying.</p>  <p>  I sincerely thank the Irish people for our collective response to the ongoing crisis in Ukraine.  Thanks are due to our NGOs, local authorities  -my own local authority in Waterford is doing an outstanding job - and the lead Departments and their officials have gone to extraordinary lengths to provide shelter for and welcome to Ukrainian refugees coming into Ireland.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs outlined that the number so far stands at 27,300 and is growing daily.  To date, 18,000 people have required temporary accommodation.  In my county of Waterford, as well as many other counties, generous homeowners have provided immediate accommodation in their houses.  In Waterford, we have refugees staying in a number of sports centres in the city and county.  I thank the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and his Department officials for expediting a property offer I brought to him some weeks ago.  Gracedieu House in Waterford will welcome the first of many guests this weekend.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage outlined the significant work being done by his Department, local authorities, the OPW and NGOs to identify additional possible property locations.  The Regional Group brought a motion before the House only in the past weeks to target the vacant properties throughout the country that are lying idle.  I welcome the Minister's decision to reform the fair deal scheme to allow properties to become available to the rental market.  The Minister also mentioned the possibility of providing modular home solutions on public lands that could revert back to the State in the future as part of temporary housing stock.  This initiative must be expedited immediately.  There is no reason to delay it.</p>  <p>  The Minister mentioned the agility of Ireland's response to the crisis.  There is probably much more we can do.  In Waterford, a number of community organisations have contacted me with a view to providing outreach activities for Ukrainian visitors.  At present, there is no designated contact person to co-ordinate such offers, although I welcome the Minister saying additional staffing is now being provided to local authorities.  Many of the visitors coming here wish to work but there is no formalised process to provide work access routes for them.  One of the biggest deficits in the country at the moment relates to haulage drivers.  Ukrainian heavy goods vehicle, HGV, licensed hauliers do not have their licences recognised here.  Ukrainian car driver licences are recognised, however.  Germany has moved to give immediate recognition to Ukrainian HGV licences and these drivers are taking up immediate employment.  I ask that the Minister speak to the Department of Transport to question why we cannot follow the lead of Germany and adopt a similar approach that would provide much-needed skilled labour to the transport and logistics sector.</p>  <p>  School access and teaching cover is a significant issue already, with some schools having taken in Ukrainian children with no English, without Ukrainian translators to help.  Teaching cover must be provided to ensure seamless integration of these children, but also to defend against a charge of disadvantaging existing pupil-teacher ratios.</p>  <p>  The issue of private pledges has been mentioned.  They have become somewhat problematic.  People may be foregoing rent on summer holiday lets that they are now reconsidering.  The potential duration of stay may be a concern for many and the introduction of tenancy rights may be in the minds of some of the 6,000 pledges now declined.  In addition, the standards demanded for accommodation provision are possibly too high in the context of many properties that have been offered.  People may be also holding off in case the Government decides to financially support pledged arrangements.  This is something the Government needs to make a decision on soon, and it needs to announce the outcome of that decision.</p>  <p>  I was glad to hear the Minister say the Housing for All programme funding is separate and ring-fenced from Ukrainian accommodation support moneys.  That being said, the labour component now required to build houses under the Housing for All scheme to cater to Ukrainian housing needs and to provide a retrofitting programme is not available in the State currently.  This fact must be recognised and policy decisions must take account of it.  Public contractors are at present refusing to quote for a large number of public sector builds.  This is because of the onerous nature of the contracts and the inability of contract programmes to allow any adequate contingency or variation clauses.  This is a significant reality that Government procurement is going to have to step up to and meet.  If I can refer again to Waterford, the Minister has put a threshold of &euro;250,000 on the affordable housing programme.  This is completely at odds with the prevailing market and the reality of building costs in Waterford.  For the local authority to deliver any house under this scheme it will have to be at least &euro;325,000.  I have discussed this repeatedly with the Minister without action with respect to moving the support level from where it is at present.  Nothing will be provided under the affordable housing scheme in Waterford.</p>  <p>  The people of Ireland have long ranked as among the most generous in the world.  Yet again we are stepping up and providing support for those who need it most.  Our response to date has been magnificent.  If this war drags on we will be called on to show continuous solidarity and generosity to Ukraine.  We must not forget what is happening in Ukraine today and that, but for the kindness of strangers and the solidarity of our friends and neighbours, it could happen in Ireland at any point in the future.  Let no one say of us that when we were needed, we were not there.  That has never been the history of this country or its people and must not ever be.  Regardless of the trials and tribulations it may bring to our shores, we must persevere.  Ireland has always shone brightest in the darkest hours before the dawn.  Let us continue to be a beacon for those who are fleeing for their lives and their children's lives from the war zones in Ukraine.</p></speech>

AsIAm, WALK and other agencies were in attendance to explain what is happening in Ukraine to children and people with disabilities and what the challenges are when they come out of Ukraine and into Ireland or across Europe.  The presentation from WALK describes how the organisation was:</p> <blockquote> 	... in touch with an organisation in Kyiv in Ukraine where they gave practical examples of how people with disabilities are disproportionately affected by the war.  For example, shelters in Kyiv are inaccessible, so people with disabilities are forced to stay at home with no level of safety, adults and children are being left in institutions to fend for themselves with little or no access to food and water, there is no essential medication for lifelong conditions such as multiple sclerosis and epilepsy, power failures where electric wheelchairs become inoperable, and we have been told stories about the experiences of people with disabilities that have died unnecessarily because they cannot hide or navigate the cities' surfaces that are now covered in rubble making them completely inaccessible for anybody with mobility issues. </blockquote>  <p>That was part of the presentation this morning.  It shows what is actually happening to people with disabilities in Ukraine.</p> <p>We are all very forgiving but I do not know how we can forgive Mr. Putin for throwing this onto the people of Ukraine, including the vulnerable.</p> <p> I am involved with agencies across Europe that focus on children with autism.  More than 100 Ukrainian children with autism have come to this country so far.  Putting them into hotels is not at all right.  They need to have safe accommodation and an environment they can get used to.  They have been through so much trauma.  A huge body of work is to be done to make sure that when we bring in people with special needs, they will be treated properly and not all in the same way.  There is an individuality problem here and we need to make sure that we deal with it.  It is a huge challenge.  We have a challenge here in any event in trying to provide services.  We must take cognisance of this when planning to take in people.</p> <p> At the meeting this morning, it very much came across that there is a lack of co-ordination at interdepartmental level in delivering disability services.  The added problem is that it is very hard to find who is in charge.  While the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, is the Minister of State responsible for disabilities, who is co-ordinating the bringing into Ireland of those with special needs?  Who is identifying those needs?  Some people are leaving Ukraine but leaving all their mobility aids behind because they cannot bring them with them.  These people are being carried into this country.  On arriving, interpreters must be got to find out exactly what medication they are on.  This is not painting a pretty picture.  It is actually cruel to have to talk about it, but the way it was presented to us this morning was very strong and simple.  We need to put a co-ordinated plan in place and make sure that we have all the support services required.  That is a challenge because we are failing to provide the services for our own people.  We must ask how we can deliver for everyone with a special need.</p> <p> The question of housing and its scarcity has been documented well here today.  As Deputy Shanahan said, there is potential in the existing vacant stock.  We should wipe out or circumvent all the planning regulations and rules.  Gateway approval is needed to spend money to do the houses up.  We need to just get on with it.  Also, we need to make sure, all working together, that we do not leave anybody behind.  We must explore every option, including in the short term.  What is short-term?  The people coming here from Ukraine say they want to go back to their own country but they will not be able to do so until it is rebuilt and there is accommodation for them there.  That will take more than a few months.  Therefore, we have a huge challenge on our hands.  We have a long-term problem in this country with services for disabilities but we now have an added challenge.  We must work together on it.  We must not treat everybody who comes into the country in the same way.</p></speech>

I wish the Ceann Comhairle and Cathaoirleach of the Seanad well in their forthcoming address to the Ukrainian Parliament.  I am aware that they will carry the best wishes and heartfelt concern of the Irish people to our Ukrainian brothers and sisters.</p>  <p>  Having listened to other speakers, I believe it is interesting that there has not been a word of criticism of the Government's approach in response to the Ukrainian crisis.  The approach has been multifaceted.  It has involved the Taoiseach, Ministers and the agencies mentioned by previous speakers, including the Irish Red Cross, which I imagine was overwhelmed at the very beginning, never having experienced the demands that exist or anything like the challenges it now faces.  It is slowly managing to get around to processing the offers of accommodation by the public.  There are also the volunteer groups and the ordinary, decent people.  We read in social and other media that if there is a call-out for food, clothing, bedclothes or other products needed in a specific locality or by individuals, the response is overwhelming, quick, warm and empathic.  The response has not just been by individuals and NGOs, however.  In my constituency, large corporations have very quietly donated significant sums to ensure a budget to secure supplies of whatever goods are needed.  The budget is not finite and I believe the offers are open.</p>  <p>  I can think of a couple of individuals in my constituency who have been part of the response.  Mick Kennedy of Knocklyon United FC is a big advocate and proponent of sport for all, including children with special needs.  Ukrainians had been arriving for only two days when Mr. Kennedy had thrown open the club and made it, its teams and coaches available to any Ukrainian boy or girl who wanted to join a soccer club and play sport.  That generosity of spirit is characteristic of people's response.  It has been replicated in my constituency by clubs such as Tallaght Town AFC and others.  I recently saw a call-out from South Dublin County Sports Partnership, which was looking for mentors, coaches, experts, clubs or teams willing to assist with accommodating Ukrainian teenagers.  Another club, St. Jude's, also in my constituency, so happened to have been one of the first to respond.  Overall, the response was overwhelming, swift and all-embracing, reflecting all kinds of sports codes within Dublin South-West.  This kind of response has featured nationwide.</p>  <p>  There are a couple of points I want to make in particular.  The Government made a big ask of chief executives of local authorities around the country to co-ordinate the volunteer response.  I want to pay special attention and tribute to South Dublin County Volunteer Centre, which is in my constituency.  The centre came to my attention initially because its volunteers have manned and womanned the vaccination centres since vaccinations began at the convention centre in Citywest.  The centre has supplied the volunteers from around Dublin South-West constituency and outside it on a 12- and 18-hour basis.  There were different shifts, with people in high-vis jackets making sure people were carefully and gently marshalled into position.  When the call came from the chief executive of South Dublin County Council stating the Government had asked volunteer groups, which in south Dublin included South Dublin County Volunteer Centre, to respond in any way they could to the Ukrainian refugee situation, they answered it.  Through a family member, I became interested and signed up.  I have completed only a fraction of the number of shifts that many of the volunteers have completed.  I have done only two to date.  They tend to be six hours long.  I am happy I applied to do them.  There is no point in my saying it is fulfilling but it has just been very interesting to watch coaches, sometimes with as few as five people and sometimes with as many as 20 or 30, arriving around the clock, including as late as 3, 4 or 5 o'clock in the morning.  The centre is manned by volunteers and also officials from the Department of Social Protection, who are present on a 24-hour basis ensuring that when accommodation is offered, the wait is not lengthy and people are dispatched around the country speedily and efficiently.</p>  <p>  Some of the people who have come from Ukraine have driven.  You can see in Citywest car park, which was built for different things, the odd car with a Ukrainian registration plate.  The following story, whose events I did not witness, was told to me by a volunteer.  It is about the arrival here of a family with a very young daughter who was still in her school uniform.</p> <p>Their town, it seemed, had been reasonably safe at a particular time on a particular day, and then clearly came under threat.  She was collected by her parents from her school while in her school uniform and they drove across central and western Europe and arrived in Dublin, with their daughter still in her school uniform.  That is the kind of story that brings home to us the horrors of war.  </p> <p> I met a beautiful man, Jacob.  He left Palestine many years ago to escape the horrors of conflict.  He found himself in Ukraine and fell in love with a Ukrainian woman.  He now finds himself in Dublin as a result of the horrors of conflict in Ukraine.  He came from Mariupol.  All of the volunteers and the Government will be familiar with all of these stories, but these are the narratives we have to keep hold of.  There are human stories at the end of each of the forms filled out by Ukrainian refugees.  Jacob has no idea about the fate of his parents he left behind.  </p> <p> Again, it is striking that when the coaches arrive there are many young girls, babies, women, mothers and sisters, yet so few men.  They are emphatically warmly welcomed.  Citywest is a temporary rest centre and is manna from heaven and a real refuge when people arrive.  There are mattresses and clean sheets and duvets, which are changed every day.  The place is looked after very well.  The food offering could be a little better and was designed initially with the intention and on the understanding that when refugees arrived they would spend just 24 hours or less there.  Some have had to spend a little longer, sometimes because of waits for accommodation.  Thankfully, they have been few.  They may be waiting for an accompanying relative to arrive a day or two days later or, indeed, a pet.  There are only so many hotdogs and packed sandwiches one can eat.  </p> <p> I pay tribute to the coach drivers, who have traversed different parts of the country in good humour while showing the best of Irishness to people who have been forced to come to our shores through no fault of their own.  I also pay tribute to the people who man, a 24-hour basis, the food truck, as well as the staff of Citywest and security people.  There is teamwork and camaraderie there.  I acknowledge the social protection staff who process the forms and the staff and passport personnel in Dublin Airport.  </p> <p> Yesterday, I told the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, of an issue that I would like the Minister to note.  People are processed really well and the system is impressive.  When people arrive in Citywest they are given a mobile phone and complete paperwork.  They are given a social security number if they arrive in Dublin Airport or Rosslare.  However, for people who arrive in Dublin Port - not many do - it does not seem to have the ability to process refugees there in the manner in which they are processed in Dublin Airport.  People are sent to Citywest and sent back to Dublin Airport to be processed.  They then have to go back to Citywest again.  Perhaps the Minister could address that.</p> <p> This has been an opportunity for volunteers to come to the rescue of the State.  They are doing unpaid work.  The Citywest venue is manned 24 hours a day, and has been since refugees began to arrive there.  Volunteers have created a database that they circulate to other volunteer centres in other counties to let them know a certain number of refugees are coming their way and are being dispatched.  I do not think the Government is organising that; it is being organised on a voluntary basis.  </p> <p> On the wider question on issues like accommodation and so on, we have to be creative and innovative.  There may be a possibility of accommodation in some of our ports, not at sea but on the water.  We can now accept that as a result of visits to Ukraine by people like my colleagues, Billy Kelleher, MEP, and Senator Timmy Dooley, that there are towns and villages which have been razed to the ground but do not make it to the news.  The damage inflicted that we have seen on television is almost beyond belief.  We now know that if the war ended on 6 May, in many cases there is simply nowhere for these people and their families to return to.  </p> <p> Therefore, the generosity of spirit that Irish people have shown will have to be extended a little longer.  Jacob, who originated in Palestine, is a barber and also has a masters degree in technology, but had not practised that particular skill in a long time.  He was offered a job soon after he arrived here.  Many people are willing and able to work.  Many others have different specific needs.  Clearly, their mental health and well-being, as well as overall health, ought to be a priority.  Many will suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder.  Many are still clearly in deep shock.  The common attribute and human demeanour they display is, more than anything else, one of absolute resilience, gratitude and warmth towards the people who are receiving them.  </p> <p> I want to pay tribute to the people in my community, who are reflective of people throughout the island, for their generosity of spirit and heart.  They show empathy in the knowledge that what we have witnessed is horrific and no one leaves their homeland for another far-off strange place by choice.  All any refugees want to do is to return to a safe and peaceful place in a timely manner.  Irish people will continue to respond to whatever demands and challenges come before them.  It is beginning to seep into the national consciousness that this is going to be a little bit more of a marathon than a sprint in terms of the demands that will be made of us as a people.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-05a.449" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1461" speakername="Michael Collins" time="15:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022050500045#VV00200"><p>Ukrainian refugees are coming here on a false promise announced by a Government that has little or no plan as to where these vulnerable people are to be housed in the long-term.  There is a feeling of powerlessness that can quickly take hold when watching awful images from conflict zones in the comfort and security of one's own home, whether that it is Kyiv, Damascus or Kabul.  It is hard to know how to respond to stories of families being ripped apart, people fleeing from being shot in cold blood or children deliberately being targeted in war crimes.</p>  <p>  All of the people coming into the country need to be housed.  It is obvious that there are not enough houses in this country to cater for them.  Even the current number is proving to be a significant challenge, with hotels and bed and breakfasts wanting their properties back and some families finding it difficult to host refugee families.  There was a real Irish housing crisis before the Ukrainian crisis ever began.  We have had a deepening housing crisis since the last financial crash in 2008-2010.  </p>  <p>  Around 10,000 people in Ireland are homeless today.  That is approximately the population of Ballina.  Approximately 120,000 are on local authority social housing waiting lists.  People are expected to wait for a home under the scheme for at least nine years, on average.  That is approximately the population of County Clare.  Approximately 7,000 people are in the direct provision system.  All in all, when one adds the numbers together one will find we already had about 137,000 people in this country, prior to the war in Ukraine, waiting for a home.  That is about the same number of people who currently live in counties Offaly and Monaghan combined.  </p>  <p>  The Government's ongoing virtue signalling in taking in refugees, when its record of providing housing is atrocious, is shameful.  The Government's response to the needs of Ukrainian refugees will, undoubtedly, follow the same failed policy route.  It is now clear that the Government has no plan or strategy to deal with the influx of refugees.  Despite this, Ministers and the Taoiseach have made sweeping announcements that Ireland will pledge to have no restrictions on the numbers entering the country.</p>  <p>  This approach is not only letting down the refugees who are fleeing war; it is also letting down our own people.  It is more of the same, with Ministers making promises they cannot possibly keep.  Deep down they know that, but continue to make the promises anyway.  The State has an appalling record when it comes to looking after vulnerable people in need of housing, and it appears that the path being paved by the Government will make matters much worse for everybody involved.</p> <p>An opportunity has been missed here.  The unfortunate Ukrainians who are fleeing the terrors of their country and coming here have not been given the opportunity to live in rural communities.  I cannot understand why that is the case.  In most situations that I see, they are being put into areas that already have serious housing issues and problems.  There was a massive opportunity for Ukrainians to be brought into small rural communities.  I do not see many of them going home in the short term because, unfortunately, it is a long-term issue for them.  These towns and villages in rural communities - there are plenty of them in my constituency - are starved of people to go to school there, for example.  They have fabulous facilities such as community halls and beautiful playing pitches or whatever for all sports but they lack people.  There are opportunities there.</p> <p> In my parish of Goleen there is a Garda station with seven rooms lying idle.  The Garda station was closed.  Why can it not be given to the community?  Why is that being made impossible?  There are plenty of community and voluntary groups in the area.  Could six people be housed in that building?  The local school would survive if that was done.</p> <p> Another issue in west Cork at the moment relates to Darrara agricultural college.  In fairness to the staff of the college, they have done superb work to make sure the Ukrainians who have arrived at the college in recent weeks are welcome.  The Ukrainians at the college have now been offered an opportunity to work.  I was contacted by a company in Clonakilty that is offering many of the individuals an opportunity to work.  They have no transport to get to the workplace, however.  That is wrong.  There is plenty of transport; it just needs a bit of organising.  I have been told that the people who have a good intention of going to work in Clonakilty, which is only two or three miles away from the college, have said they would travel by bicycle if they were given one.  That is the situation.  Transport should be provided, especially where work is available and the people in question are willing to take on the work.  Transport should be provided immediately.  The people of Darrara agricultural college are doing their level best.  They have done brilliant work to get the rooms prepared and make sure food and everything else is looked after.  However, employment has been secured for these people but they cannot get to it.  We cannot take them to work if they have to do an early shift in Clonakilty.  There are a lot of cogs not moving at the same time.  I could speak further on this issue if I had more time.</p></speech>

It has shown that the Irish people are the most welcoming in the world.  I refer to the fantastic hospitality they show to people who are in need.  That is what the Irish people are.  However, it also has shown up the failure of previous Governments in terms of infrastructure across the country.  People coming from Ukraine cannot be put into rural areas because of the lack of infrastructure there.  The people in rural areas want to welcome Ukrainians into their areas but there is no bus transport for them if they get there.</p>  <p>  As a short-term measure as we are coming into summer and in light of the number of Ukrainians who are coming into the country, would it not be possible for mobile chalets to be put into areas where there is infrastructure?  There are places available where that could be done.  Families could go to there and get their bearings before being moved to a long-term location.  At least, they would be with their own people and able to speak their own language.  They would be able to go to their own healthcare professionals.  Some Ukrainians who are coming here are doctors or nurses but their qualifications are not recognised.  There is a big problem when a person from Ukraine wants to go to a hospital because he or she is feeling sick.  There is a big language barrier and a transport barrier.  Why not have a place with a hospital where Ukrainian doctors and nurses, leaving aside that their qualifications are not recognised by the Government, can look after and help their own people?  Why has a simple thing such as that not been done?  Mobile chalets or mobile homes can be put into an area where there is infrastructure overnight.  These mobile homes are fully kitted out and they can provide for families, especially coming into summer.  Many people go to holiday homes and mobile homes in summer.  These mobile chalets are perfectly suited to areas where the Government cannot otherwise house Ukrainians who need accommodation.</p>  <p>  The Red Cross is overwhelmed with the work it has to do.  All the volunteers are overwhelmed.  There is complete chaos.  I am aware of a family that offered its holiday home for use by Ukrainians.  It contacted the Red Cross and got a phone call last Thursday week to say the Red Cross wanted to go and see the house.  The family agreed to meet the Red Cross there.  Little did the family realise that the Red Cross volunteers were on a minibus with eight Ukrainian people with their suitcases.  They were coming out to look at the house to see was it viable for them.  They took the suitcases off the bus and moved in straight away.  A person with the Ukrainians had a letter but could not explain to the householder what had to be done, and that person was there to help.  It is total chaos.</p>  <p>  The following day, I met a person whose job is to track where Ukrainian people are in order to put a map together so that where they are is known.  That person asked me if I knew where Ukrainians had been placed and asked me to notify them because some of the Ukrainians have slipped through.  They were put into houses but now it is not known where they are.</p>  <p>  To me, a simple thing that could be done is to put Ukrainians in need of accommodation into mobile homes or mobile chalets.  They would be together and feel safe and they would be in areas that have infrastructure.  They could then be placed into longer-term residential settings.  We would know where they are and that we can help them.</p>  <p>  We had to get an interpreter down to the Ukrainians who moved into the holiday home to let them know where the bus service was and everything else.  Doing so was actually put onto the people who own the house.  The volunteers had to rush back into Limerick to collect to another person to take them somewhere else and they did not know where they were going.  This is what is wrong.</p>  <p>  We are the best country.  The people of Ireland are brilliant.  They would give up their own dinner to help somebody in need.  That is what we are like.  It is complete chaos at the moment, however, because the Government will not do the simple things that people are suggesting to it.  I hate to say it but this has shown the complete failure of previous Governments in the context of the lack of infrastructure in the towns and villages in rural Ireland.  That has been demonstrated by the fact that the State is now unable to put people into areas and then keep a count of them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-05a.452" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1584" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="16:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022050500046#WW00300"><p>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this important issue.  It goes without saying that all present condemn the atrocities that have led to this situation and the aggression by a country that professes to be an international model of some sort.  The pattern of events that is taking place is the same as that which took place in a different time and a different country when the Sudetenland was gradually encroached upon by an aggressor who pursued by using threats that if interfered with, there would be a major war.  Like some other speakers, I have to make the point that it may yet fall to the international community to take more severe action to ensure that is not allowed to continue and that threats and implied threats are completely unacceptable.</p>  <p>  That said, we have to deal with the situation that is now in hand.  There are many challenges for us as we have to deal with a significant number of people whom we did not anticipate.  We did not anticipate their needs or what is happening in their home country.  It would be absolutely untoward of us not to respond sympathetically.  I am glad the Irish population has responded firmly and sympathetically.  I strongly support the attitude taken by the Government, the Ministers who have spoken in this debate and their Departments.  The challenges are manifold.  There is a challenge for the health service.  It must be provided for.  We must deal with the issues at all levels at the same time because of the magnitude of the problem.  There is a challenge in the context of the housing situation.  That challenge might be a boon in disguise.  It might be possible to utilise the system to such an extent that we can deal with the challenges even better than before.  For instance, we can utilise system-built houses that can be built readily and assembled quickly on site and in just a few days.  That can be done.  There are plenty of people around the country willing to offer sites for such accommodation at short notice.</p> <p>That possibility should be examined.  Whatever emergency arises in the course of what needs to be done to accommodate refugees must be taken on board and precise remedies put into operation to deal with it.  We must ensure vulnerable children with particular needs are looked after especially and specifically and that no effort is spared in dealing with the situation in a way that we would like to be done if we were in that situation.<br/><br/>There is nothing new about the <i>modus operandi</i>of the aggressor.  That <i>modus operandi</i>should be what motivates us most of all in our response.  We must let it be known that we in the civilised word are not going to be intimidated and cowed into a position of accepting what the powerful mete out to us.  I have every confidence in the Government's ability to deal with the situation on those grounds, including in the provision of educational needs, accommodation needs, including special accommodation needs, and so on.  Such provision can be made because the facilities are there.  For some time now, for example, we have been exporting system-built houses to other countries.  There is a strange irony in that, given we have an accommodation problem at home.<br/><br/>It is important that we deal with the situation even-handedly because it could bring about a reaction from people of all nationalities in this jurisdiction who have been on the housing list, perhaps for ten or 15 years.  We must deal with the issue in an even-handed way, insofar as we can, and pull out all the stops to make it happen, and make it happen quickly.  We are all proud of the way the Government has reacted.  Even though there are compelling issues to be dealt with in this State, many of which are converging at the same time, the Government, rightly, has responded in a positive way, recognising the needs of those who are worse off than we are at this particular time.<br/><br/>I have spoken to a number of Ministers in recent times about a particular issue.  The method of preparing accommodation should not be done in such a way that some people might escape from a particular requirement in order to facilitate, allegedly, the needs and exigencies of the time.  The Government should investigate the existence of any prior arrangements, agreements or whatever or any clashes that may have taken place in the past.  Refugees should not become the victims of any crossfire, for want of a better description, in this situation.<br/><br/>I hope we can respond in the way we always respond to a challenge.  We work best together in this country when challenged and we will never be challenged in the way we are now going to be challenged.  Let us all sit down together, put our shoulders to the wheel and try to make sure the people who are in need are dealt with in a meaningful and helpful way.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-05a.454" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1510" speakername="John Paul Phelan" time="16:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022050500047#XX00200"><p>To pick up on one of Deputy Durkan's points, he referred to the importance of how this crisis is handled in terms of the impact on both refugees and our own citizens.  In the past few weeks, I have noticed on social media, particularly WhatsApp groups, memes and jokey picture messages with an underlying, insidious element of racism, to be perfectly honest, in pitting refugees against people in Ireland who are in need of a home.  I am glad the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage has clearly outlined on a number of occasions that the funding for Housing for All is ring-fenced and separate.  The provision we are talking about in this debate must be given in additionality.  Deputy Michael Collins has left the Chamber but he is the first elected politician I have heard engage in that type of whataboutery on this issue.</p>  <p>  Irish people have responded fantastically, as all speakers have said.  There is a spirit among Irish people, going back centuries, to help those who most need it.  However, this is a unique situation for us.  Throughout our history, we have had the advantage of geography in that we are an island in the North Atlantic that has not had a big refugee crisis.  Every other country on the Continent of Europe has experienced this before.  What we heard from the two Rural Independent Group Deputies was a bit disingenuous and contradictory, with one of them saying we have great facilities in rural Ireland, including schools and town halls, before the other fellow stood up and said the past few Governments have put no investment into rural areas.  I could take him to town halls in my constituency.  At Ballinkillen community hall in Carlow, for instance, the community group has accommodated 70 people and the process has begun of moving those families into more suitable accommodate for the longer term.  The Scout Den in Kilkenny is another such facility and the same is happening at St. John of God Convent and ancillary buildings on that site.  There are others doing the same.  I do not disagree that more needs to be done but it is deeply unfair for those Deputies to come in here and trot out the single transferable speech they give on everything and condemn the Government for not being able to predict something nobody else did.  Even less than six months ago, nobody would have said Russia was going to invade Ukraine.</p>  <p>  I should have started my contribution by acknowledging the unspeakable horror that has been inflicted on the Ukrainian people by the leadership and army of the Russian state in the past number of months and stating how welcome these people are in our country.  Deputy Michael Collins said he has not encountered any refugees in his constituency who are living in rural areas.  I could take him to plenty of parts of Carlow and Kilkenny where that is the case.  I was speaking to a former Member of this House from a different county who has a building in his yard that was converted into a home office years ago.  A family of six, including a grandmother, father, mother and three children, are now living there.  It cost him some &euro;11,000 or &euro;12,000 to have that building converted.</p>  <p>  That brings me to the next point I want to raise.  How do we secure the additionality we need in terms of accommodation?  The Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, as a rural person, knows there certainly are rural areas that are too isolated and cut off and which do not have public transport links.  However, there are also plenty of rural areas in east Galway, Carlow and Kilkenny that have transport links and where there are properties that are vacant for whatever reason.  I often find it is because of title issues or disputes within families.  We have an opportunity in the next few months not only to provide accommodation for people now but to bring some of those units back into use for the future.  If the Government, rightly, is prepared to pay &euro;25,000 to &euro;30,000 for a year's accommodation in a hotel room in our capital city, it should be prepared to give &euro;10,000 or &euro;12,000 to people down the country who have a vacant property.  It might be the house down the road from them in which they were reared.  Whatever the scenario, the private individual will get good value for any grant given to renovate such properties and make them habitable.  I welcome the proposal by my colleague, Senator Cummins, for opening up holiday homes across the country.  Again, some such homes are very isolated and would not be suitable but many of the main holiday centres in the country are well served by public transport.  I think Irish people would answer a call to make such properties available.  It is all about additionality.</p>  <p>  The other possibility is former congregated settings, with which the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, is very familiar.  Many of them have been closed for only one, two or three years and it would take a very small amount of money to make them useable again.  There is a large facility in Kilkenny that could take 250 people.  I am trying to advance that but there is a bit of a wrangle between different Government agencies.  It is only two years since people lived in that accommodation, which is right on the edge of the city.  The new bus service would have to be extended slightly but it would be perfect for accommodating refugees.  There are many such facilities scattered throughout the country.</p> <p>Some are in provincial towns.  I was thinking of the ex-convent in Mooncoin.  It will never be reoccupied but it is only a few years since the nuns left it, and there is a bus route from Limerick to Waterford that goes multiple times a day and stops outside the door of the convent.</p> <p> None of us, including the Government, expected this to happen.  The Red Cross is under pressure and needs help.  I encourage the Government to do anything it can in the immediate term in terms of financial aid to bring back some of the dilapidated and vacant accommodation that could be made available as well as the former religious or formerly publicly-owned residential settings.  All of those provide an opportunity, as well as some of the holiday homes, maybe, to deliver a safe environment for our Ukrainian refugees for as long as they need it.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-05a.457" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1577" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="16:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022050500048#YY00300"><p>I welcome the opportunity to participate in this debate.  I will approach it from two angles: first, the practical angle and the angle of the title of the session and, second, more generally, the angle of our neutral role and our role in bringing peace in the world.  I welcome and pay tribute to the work done by the Minister of State's colleague and the Government in taking a hands-on approach in welcoming the refugees.  That is absolutely necessary as one of the fundamental parts of our humanitarian reaction to the completely unjustified war and Russia's invasion.  Let me get that off the table.</p><p>As for the practical matters, one cannot but put this in context.  We have a major housing crisis.  Last night I gave some of the figures for Galway.  I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, is very familiar with them.  Rents in the county have risen by 90% in recent years.  Since the trough, the period of the lowest rents, they have gone up by more than 100%.  The figures do not mean anything any more.</p><p>I will respond to Deputy Phelan.  When your slot comes near the end of a debate you get a chance to comment on others' contributions, which can be somewhat unhelpful.  I did not hear the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage say the money was ring-fenced.  What I heard him say, and what he has clearly written in his speech, is that there are separate targets in respect of the Government's Housing for All strategy and that the Government will not interfere with those targets in looking after the refugees.  The Minister felt it important to point that out.  It is not possible to give that assurance and I am leaving the refugees out of this.  We are not reaching our targets as is.  One of the points I made in my contributions this morning and yesterday related to the voluntary housing bodies in Galway, in the Minister of State's county.  They have expressed great difficulties in reaching their targets.  They just cannot do it.  That was highlighted at a meeting of the housing task force.  It is important to be clear in our language when we talk about housing matters.  The Government's reaction has brought into acute focus two things: first, the crisis which we have all been shouting about for a very long time but which has been ignored and, second, what we can do when we put our minds to it.  Suddenly we can build.  Suddenly we can look at empty houses we had left vacant all the time.  Suddenly we can act when there is a war.  That is certainly a cause for reflection.</p><p>A point was made about local authority houses that are empty.  It is unacceptable that they are empty.  They have remained empty in Galway for as long as I have been a councillor and then a Deputy.  I see the Minister of State nodding, and I welcome that, but the only response we ever got from management was that such houses were a small percentage of our overall housing.  At any given time there are 100 empty houses in Galway.  It looks bad, if nothing else.  They should be turned over in a matter of weeks and they never have been.  It is appalling.</p><p>Going back to the speech by the Minister, Deputy Coveney, we did not, unfortunately, get a copy of it, but I took a note of some of the things he said.  I could not disagree with him.  He stood on the edge of a mass grave containing 503 civilians and four soldiers - men, women and children.  He went to Bucha and saw the shocking effect of the war there.  He was asked to bear witness and he was absolutely right to have done so.  That was a very strong message to send.  When your time is limited you try to focus.  I absolutely agree with the Minister.  One could not but be touched by what we see and what the Minister said when he came back.</p><p>I want to broaden the debate, however.  I did not hear any mention of the role Ireland was playing on the UN Security Council to bring peace.  No matter how much we condemn Russia, which deserves our condemnation, we have to sit down at some stage and come to a peaceful solution.  Are we just going to keep killing and killing, led by Russia?  Are we going to keep sending more and more weapons, and for how long?  For how long can we keep taking in refugees?  As long as we can, of course, and I would be the first to push the Government to do that.  Realistically, however, what should our role be in addition to providing humanitarian assistance?  Where is our voice to say this war has to stop and we cannot keep doing this?  Who is doing an analysis as to how the war started?  The nearest I have come is an article in the Irish language.  T&aacute; alt i d<i>Tuairisc</i>, agus is fi&uacute; d'aon duine at&aacute; in ann &eacute; a l&eacute;amh.  An teideal at&aacute; air n&aacute; &quot;M&aacute; d&iacute;br&iacute;tear an R&uacute;is ar fad &oacute;n gclann idirn&aacute;isi&uacute;nta, n&iacute; chun &aacute;r leasa a bheidh s&eacute;&quot;.  Is &iacute; Fionnuala N&iacute; Aol&aacute;in an t-&uacute;dar.  She states that if we expel Russia from the international family, it will not be to our good in the long term.  That is no defence of Russia.  My condemnation of Russia goes without question.  Professor N&iacute; Aol&aacute;in elaborates on this.  This woman is the special rapporteur of the United Nations on counter-terrorism and human rights.  She happens to be from Galway originally.  She is also a professor in a university in America.  She has multiple roles and is well respected.  She condemns outright Russia's invasion but goes on to talk about ceachtanna le foghlaim, the lessons that must be learnt.  She sets them out very clearly.  The article is worth reading.  She says at the very end of it, &quot;M&aacute; bh&iacute;onn an R&uacute;is ina cadhan aonair ar fad, n&iacute; chun &aacute;r leasa a bheidh s&eacute;&quot;, that is, if we push Russia out completely, it will not be to our good.</p><p>I would draw an analogy with that.  Many people have called for the expulsion of the ambassador.  The Government has said no, that we need to keep relations with them and need to talk to them.  Yet I have not seen one single piece of evidence that we have used our voice in respect of Russia to bring some type of peace or compromise.  I fully support the investigation into war crimes and the International Criminal Court with no difficulty at all, but at what stage will our voices rise up and say, &quot;Please stop this war.  We cannot go on like this&quot;?  Europe is not playing that role.  It has now reversed policy completely.  We have not quite yet and we are giving humanitarian assistance, but Europe has reversed policy completely to provide military aid for the first time.</p><p>The EU started out as a peace project; it has now gone closer and closer to a military project.  If Members doubt me, let me just quote from a report I am making my way through.  It is a very dense report and was published only recently.  It is titled <i>At What Cost?  Funding the EU's Security, Defence and Border Policies, 2021-2027</i>.  I will give the reference to anyone who would like it.  The report's authors go on to show the cost of the militarisation that has been taking place consistently.  I actually doubted the figures and I spoke to my colleague here, Deputy Pringle, and to a woman who works with me because I doubted the percentage increases in respect of military spending and had to double-check them.  Let me give the House some of the figures, but first, let me say that the European peace facility is but one of the EU's array of budgetary instruments that form part of a multi-annual financial framework under which an unprecedented amount of money for defence and security purposes has been earmarked.  I will show Members just some of them in the few minutes I have left.  EU security, defence and military budgets between 2012 and 2027 increased by 123% compared with the previous budget round, which was &euro;19.7 billion, up to &euro;43.9 billion.  That is 123%, and that is only one percentage.  The figures go much higher than that.  EU funding for law enforcement, border control and military research development and operations is 31 times higher, at &euro;43.9 billion, than funding for rights, values and justice, which would lead to peace in the world.  The largest increase is to the European Defence Fund, which has a budget of nearly &euro;8 billion.  This is the figure I baulked at.  It has seen a 1,256% increase.</p> <p>This money, for the first time, will be used for research and development for high-tech military weaponry.  We have got the private corporations working hand in hand, spending billions of euro public money on arms development.</p> <p> Moving on to Frontex, the EU's border agency that I have spoken about on many occasions, the aim is to have 10,000 people working for that agency.  The aim is deterring and containing migrants rather than protecting them.  The agency has seen a 194% increase compared to the previous cycle and - listen to this figure - a 13,200% increase in the budget over less than a year.  We have had the retirement of the man in charge recently because the European Parliament was about to discipline or take action in relation to his behaviour.</p> <p> I will finish by going back to an t-Ollamh N&iacute; Aol&aacute;in pointing out that it is a very dangerous policy.  An t-Ollamh N&iacute; Aol&aacute;in welcomes absolutely the open policy for refugees, as I do, but she makes it perfectly clear that they are white and European or on the European Continent and we have a completely different approach when refugees are not from the European Continent and when they are of a different colour.  I raise that as a serious cause of reflection because as we speak, we have 2,000 people in direct provision who have permission to go outside.  They have the status and can go nowhere.  We are ignoring what is happening in Yemen.  We have ignored the Amnesty report on Israel in relation to Palestine and the International Criminal Court.  Of course, Israel has refused to co-operate with the International Criminal Court.  They are not part of it.</p></speech>

We are nearly three months into this horrendous war and, while the daily pictures of people leaving their homes in droves to seek safe haven elsewhere have somewhat dissipated, the reality on the ground is that it continues unabated.</p>  <p>  Over 27,000 people have arrived in Ireland from the Ukraine to date.  Nearly 18,500 require immediate accommodation but they all need help in some shape or form.  Homes, healthcare, education, transport and work; the list is endless.  This requires a whole-of-government response, and it needs to continue for the foreseeable future.</p>  <p>  It is evident from my colleagues here today that we are committed to doing the best job we can with the resources available.  Creative solutions for temporary emergency accommodation from the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, plus longer-term housing from the Minister, Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, are emerging.</p>  <p>  Maslow's theory of hierarchy of needs keeps springing to my mind.  Food, water, clothing, sleep and shelter are the bare necessities for anyone's survival.  Once a person's basic needs are satisfied, the want for order and predictability sets in.  Then a sense of love and belonging occurs which leads to the elevation of esteem and, finally, self-actualisation.  We have the blueprint right here to chart how to help our Ukrainian friends.  We must strive to assist them to reach the final point on the chart.  They have already made a long and arduous journey to reach our shores.  For many their journey is not over just yet, but it will be.</p>  <p>  It will be soon, through our concerted and co-ordinated efforts.  We must work together to realise this endgame.  Ireland must show the c&eacute;ad m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte today and every day.  We must travel the end of the journey with them, and hold their hand while they assimilate into our country until such time as they can return to their homeland and rebuild their future.</p>  <p>  As Minister of State with responsibility for disability, it is important that I also speak to those with disabilities who may be arriving into Ireland.  To put it in context, I travelled to Romania for St. Patrick's Day and I used my time to engage.  After coming home on that Friday, the first meeting I had on the following Monday morning was with the disability organisations.  I chaired a meeting that day - I think it was 20 March - of disabled persons&rsquo; organisations, disability service provider organisations and members of the disability stakeholder group alongside officials from the Department of Health and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, - indeed, the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, was also present - to discuss the impact of the war in Ukraine on disabled people in Ukraine and how best to co-ordinate our supports.  One would think, listening to one or two contributions here today, that this had not happened.</p>  <p>  The meeting provided an opportunity to share perspectives and expertise on challenges and potential solutions.  Organisations at the meeting detailed the work being done to respond to the crisis across civil society organisations, both nationally and internationally.  Both the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, and I have also met the Ukrainian and Polish ambassadors to discuss how Ireland is positioned to support people with disabilities who may arrive here.  Meanwhile, officials in the Departments of Health and Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and the HSE have continued to liaise on a number of issues.</p>  <p>  The HSE national disability operations office is working with the community healthcare organisations, CHOs, its funded disability service providers and representative bodies to manage and co-ordinate appropriate responses.  The HSE has established a number of dedicated work streams underpinning its national co-ordination efforts, including one which focuses on access to disability services.  Any initiatives should engage with this HSE work stream to ensure a co-ordinated effort.  The HSE has informed me it has agreed a pathway for disability screening and assessment as Ukrainians arrive into Ireland, while also making contact with the WHO regional office for Europe on the issue.</p>  <p>  Ultimately, regardless of diagnosis or need, Ireland will not be found wanting.  The public has demonstrated its solidarity with Ukraine.  They have offered up their most prized possessions to help.  Those who have a lot and those who have very little have all done so willingly and without calls for compensation.  We have demonstrated our capacity for human kindness.  It is in the most dire of circumstances and we all deplore the fact that it has to be given at all.  It is hard to believe that the events that have unfolded so close to what is considered western civilisation are so barbaric as to be the opposite of civil.  Let us continue regardless.  Let us offer our support and strength in this time of need, no matter how great the need is.</p>  <p>  If I can go off-script for a second, I talked about travelling to Romania.  I travelled to Romexpo, where there were 2,000 beds put up.  I met with the gentleman, Dr. Arafat, who was in charge of the Covid response and who was now in charge of the Ukrainian response, and he talked about the border and the crossings.  He talked about Moldova and the couch-surfing that was taking place in Moldova.  Dr. Arafat was talking about in excess of 100,000 people couch-surfing in Moldova at that stage and there are many times that number as we speak today.</p>  <p>  I asked how can we help and Dr. Arafat's response was clear because it is not the first time they have found themselves in Romania in crisis.  Like the Irish, they were able to mobilise and put a system in place.  Dr. Arafat said that when they need they will ask and that we will come then but at present they needed a process - the flow to take place.  They had a really good flow system.</p>  <p>  I went down to the train station to see how it operated and where the tents were up on the train stations.  You could see that weary face.  One could see the different ways broken down into four different categories.  The first was if you were on your own.  The second was if you had children.  The third was if you had an elderly parent with you, and then there was the singles.  There were tents if a person needed to take shelter.</p>  <p>  Then I went down to Romexpo, which I found quite inspirational.  I was talking to the assistant secretary in the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and to the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, about where the people at Romexpo talked about putting down the 2,000 beds and dividers between the beds, as well as the value of the washing machine.  This was because all they had come with was their clothes and if they could wash their clothes and hold onto them, those were their prize possession.</p> <p>People came to Romexpo and left clothes and food.  Even if people were not staying there, and at that stage it had not opened, individuals who were spread all around Romania could come in and pick up some clothes and some of their favourite foods.  It was like the free shop not too far from here in Dublin, and Deputy Connolly and I know about it in Oranmore and the wonderful work happening there.</p> <p> The ground-up approach in Ireland is unbelievable.  Officials, particularly those in the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, worked morning, noon and night.  I regularly talk about Ms Carol Baxter, assistant secretary general in the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  She was up at 4 o'clock one morning trying to find accommodation for people coming off an aeroplane.  She was doing that along with the day job.  She was not alone.  There were many more like Carol in that space.  I also acknowledge the work of the Irish Red Cross.  Along with the Irish Red Cross there were other groups.  One was Helping Irish Hosts, which gave support to 750 Ukrainians in 250 Irish homes.  There is also the role of the Sisters of Mercy in the convents in Loughrea and Gort.  The convent in Templemore in Deputy Mattie McGrath's area has opened its doors to support refugees.</p> <p> There is also the role of SICAP and the LEADER organisations.  I often talk about Galway Rural Development, but in places that have LEADER organisations they were available when a bus rolled in, no matter what time it was, to ensure there was an interpreter was available, to ensure women and children could be attended to and even to ensure there was some cat food or dog food for the animal that came along as a reassurance pet.  It was wonderful that the Government allowed them to bring their pets with them.  The role of the pet has been phenomenal.  In addition, the LEADER organisations mobilised communities saying they needed clothes and school books and that they needed to get clubs open.  They brought the entire community with them.  It was phenomenal.  There was also the role of the Civil Defence, county councils and the education and training boards in ensuring that education and language services could be provided.</p> <p> What I have described is not just the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth doing something or the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage doing something.  It has been completely across government, across semi-State bodies and across communities, working with open arms and receiving people into the community.  Long may it continue and long may we work together to ensure that the c&eacute;ad m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte is there.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-05a.475" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1508" speakername="Michael Fitzmaurice" time="16:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022050500050#AAA00500"><p>I move:</p> <blockquote> 	That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann:  	notes that: <blockquote> 	&mdash; as per the D&aacute;il record, the Government is in the process of drafting regulations with respect to the sale and supply of solid fuels, which are due to be signed in September of this year;<br /><br />&mdash; the Government has confirmed that the proposed regulations will not be implemented this year;<br /><br />&mdash; as per the D&aacute;il record, under the Government's proposed regulations people will not be permitted to place turf on the market for sale or distribution to others;<br /><br />&mdash; the Government has confirmed that it wishes to protect the existing rights of people who save turf; and<br /><br />&mdash; turf is an affordable solid fuel, many people are dependent on solid fuel to warm their homes, and in some counties up to 34 per cent of households are solely dependent on turf as solid fuel; </blockquote>calls on the Government to exempt from the proposed solid fuel regulations: <blockquote> 	&mdash; people who have turbary rights, Q3 agreements, fee simple rights, acquired rights, commonage rights, licensed rights, leased rights, inherited rights, familial rights or any other recognised ownership rights;<br /><br />&mdash; people who assisted the State by providing their bogs for preservation as part of the designation of boglands, and who participated in the Turf Cutting Compensation Scheme, whether they sold their bogs to the State, took compensation to buy turf elsewhere, opted to be supplied with turf by the State or moved bog under licence or turbary right; and<br /><br />&mdash; people who have historically rented or have been provided with a plot and saved turf for their own household; and </blockquote>further calls on the Government to undertake to work with the industry over a reasonable period of time to ensure that turf sold in larger urban areas via retail outlets meets the same moisture content regulations which currently apply to timber and peat briquette, thus ensuring any proposed ban on the sale of turf will not be necessary.  </blockquote>  <p>I am sharing time with Deputy Pringle.  This motion relates to the regulation of solid fuels.  I thank the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, for coming to the House.  I know he has a busy schedule.  I thank him and the Government for accepting the motion.</p><p>The reason I brought forward this motion is that over the past few weeks, as the Minister is aware, on foot of a parliamentary question being asked, there is a great deal of anxiety among the public and especially among elderly people.  When I talk about rural Ireland I am referring to people in the countryside and also to people in small towns who rely on turf as a solid fuel.  I hope this is a respectful debate by everybody because we need to find solutions, not badger each other.  I am not whining about it but I noted that in the debate over the last few weeks everybody spoke about turbary rights.  I listened to the thoughts of Government backbenchers on it and I decided to compile a motion that would clarify situations.  That is very important for people who feel there is a vacuum in the information that is required.</p><p>I will go through the motion bit by bit.  I almost know it off by heart at this stage.  The first matter that arose, which is included in the motion, was the types of ownership.  In the motion I refer to the Minister introducing regulations in September regarding solid fuel.  Turbary rights was always talked about.  I have spoken to people who had fee simple rights, freehold rights, acquired rights, family rights, leasehold rights, commonage rights on mountains and in different areas and squatters' rights.  There are ten different rights of ownership that people would have had down through the years.  Indeed, as chairman of the Turf Cutters and Contractors Association, TCCA, when dealing with the National Parks and Wildlife Service on the designation, I know it is very familiar with the different types of rights.  In fairness to it, it has recognised all those rights through the years.  Rather than civil servants writing scripts and so forth, it would be good to have a straight, open debate.  I would be obliged if the Minister would note with regard to the rights I have spoken about that they are recognised.  It is not just turbary rights, as the Taoiseach said one day.  A turbary right is just one part of a right that is involved.  Clarification is needed in respect of a lot of this.</p><p>I will move to the second part of the motion.  I come from Lisnageeragh bog and Turlough.  It is designated.  On one side of the road there are approximately 3,000 acres and on the other side there are approximately 100 acres between spread ground.  That does 80 families for all their lives.  An acre of bog would last them for about 200 years.  When the habitats directive came into force years ago the people on one side of the road were asked if they would sell their bog or move to a relocation bog if it was possible.  Unfortunately, in some parts of the country we have not been successful in getting relocation bogs.  Some people were asked if they would take turf supplied by the State.  That is done on a yearly basis up until 2025 or 2026.  Some people were asked to take monetary compensation and were asked to buy turf somewhere else.  Those people co-operated with the State.  Early on, there were some who went under licence.  That is another right that nobody appears to be familiar with.  These people got a 65-year licence if they went four or five miles up or down the road.  These were helping people with regard to the habitats directive and in respect of preserving a representative sample of bog in Ireland.  Those people are left in a vacuum at present.  With some of the media coverage that emerged, and I am not blaming the Minister, they do not know whether they are sitting or standing or coming or going.  That needs clarification.</p><p>Then there are the people who traditionally had a right of renting.  They could live in a big or small town or be out in the middle of the countryside.  They might have a wet bit of bog that they did not develop and left it there and they might rent a plot from somebody up or down the road or there might be somebody who gives them a plot.  People have been doing this for years.  They have a right of renting, but they would not have the turbary right that is talked about.</p> <p>They also need to be exempted, as I have outlined in the motion.  This is for the simple reason that we do not need to complicate matters.  We need to make sure that clear messages are sent out.  The Department needs to ensure that it specifically categorises or explains the various things with which there are no problems<br/><br/>The phrase &quot;turbary right&quot; was used to cover everything.  This panicked many people who had a freehold, particularly elderly individuals who are solely reliant on turf.  I would be obliged if the Minister clarified that he would be willing to put in an exemption for all of these people.  Such an exemption is provided for in the motion.  It would give clarity to people to know this.  In order that the Minister understands the position, I will explain that when a person rents a plot, it could be on someone else's land.  The turf is brought out and spread on the ground.  Those renting the plot look after it, turn it and foot it.  They might get someone to bring it home or they might bring it home themselves using a car and a trailer.  It all depends.  Generally, the amounts of turf involved are not large.<br/><br/>There is not a Deputy in the D&aacute;il who does not support doing as much retrofitting as possible.  As a turf contractor, through the years I have seen that as more installation has gone into houses they need to cut less turf.  In general, ten hoppers are used.  When installation goes in, we see approximately two hoppers fewer being used on a yearly basis.  This message needs to go out from here.  We are not opposed to retrofitting.  We fully support it and have done so.  We supported the Minister on smoky coal last year and on previous occasions and I want to be clear on this.  Something that needs to be understood is that many people in rural areas are on &euro;13,000 a year.  They are low-income families.  I will call a spade a spade.  I grew up beside a bog.  I was born and bred on it.  People may not be as affluent or wealthy as those in other parts of the country.  The land is not of as good a quality.  We need to put things into perspective.<br/><br/>In the motion, I speak about the Government working with the industry.  When this was announced first there was talk about a ban on the placing on the market, the distribution or selling of turf.  Anybody who understands turf and who has known about it all their lives knows there is good quality turf that has been seasoned.  People dry it and let it season.  I have listened to some of the Minister's colleagues state peat briquettes were fine.  We can have a sod of turf as dry as a peat briquette.  With no disrespect to him, the Minister will probably say that UCD and the EPA have done sampling.  What were they sampling?  We have also done sampling and have the result.<br/><br/>People can comply in the same way as they do with timber.  When the Minister introduced the rules on timber last year I was very outspoken about the problem happening throughout Ireland.  Unfortunately, bad quality timber, such as spruce, was being cut.  People might be as well burn the <i>Irish Independent</i>in the fire because it would go that quickly.  It was being cut one day, split the following day and then sold at the weekend.  That is no good.  We all know this.  It is common sense.  If we learned anything from the generation gone by we were always taught from knee high that timber is cut in January or February.  Then, as we say in rural Ireland, it is left to season.  There are more sophisticated ways to do this such as kiln drying.  It can also be put into a shed where a good breeze can get at it.  Over the summer months and into the back end of the year, it seasons.<br/><br/>I will be very honest about the tests we did.  They were done on turf that was cut last May, which is a year ago now.  The tests were done a month ago.  The moisture content was extremely good.  Something else that needs to be understood from the generation gone by is that an awful lot of people have a store and keep a supply for a year or two ahead.  There is a saying down the country that it is like flint it goes so dry and tough.  There is good quality burning in it.  This needs to be understood.  The industry will work with the Minister.  From everything I have looked at the Minister does not have to press a destruct button by saying we need to ban the sale of turf.  There are regulations and the Minister will be looking at them with regard to air quality.<br/><br/>Down through the years, we have seen the amount of coal used to keep the lights on in this country.  The EPA gave a licence to burn tyres.  There is a feeling at present, and this is being honest with the Minister, that the ordinary people are being picked on.  They are not happy about this to be quite honest.  It is not only coming from people who cut turf.  It is coming from people who throw their heads up in the air and ask &quot;Jesus, what is next?&quot;.  We look at the small fry compared with what is going on around the world.  It is very important that clear messages come out and that we resolve this matter.<br/><br/>I look at the age profile of the people I do work for.  I am grey-haired myself but they are a bit greyer because they are a bit older.  We are using an sledgehammer to crack a nut because it will phase out in its own way in the next ten to 12 years.  The next generation is going down a different route when building new houses.  Nobody has a problem with this.  After ten or 12 years we should have a system in place that is beneficial to the owners, regardless of what they are.  They are not all farmers.  The Minister must remember that in previous times when people got a council house, they got with it a turf bank, as we call it, and a turbary right, as the Minister speaks about.  They did not own an acre of land.  The old saying was that it went with the chimney of the house.  Bord na M&oacute;na built houses in County Roscommon for its workers.  Those workers had turbary rights for cutting turf.  We have to be very careful.  It is not only someone abroad in the sticks such as where I live who might have a turbary right.  It might be someone in a medium-sized town or a smaller town.  It also needs to be noted that many parents when making a will consider members of the family who need a bit of fuel for the fire.</p> <p>I again thank the Minister for accepting the motion and for coming to the House.  We need to resolve this issue because of the anxiety among the community.  Mixed messaging is not a good thing.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-05a.478" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="17:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022050500052#CCC00200"><p>I thank Deputy Fitzmaurice for his opening contribution.  The Government is not opposing this motion because I think we need to clear the air a bit.  There is a lot of confusion, fear and misinformation on this issue.  I will summarise what I see as some of the key issues.</p>  <p>  This goes back to the late 1980s and early 1990s when Dublin had a particular problem with smoky coal.  I think Mary Harney as Minister of State introduced regulations to restrict those smoky coals.  It had a profound effect.  The situation in Dublin at the time was desperate.  Anyone of a certain age will remember it.  The evidence is really clear that we saved something like 350 lives per year that were being lost at the time because of bronchial asthma and heart conditions that came with breathing in foul air.  Over the years since, we extended that smoky coal ban to other areas, cities and towns because coal is a particular issue.  This has been quoted a lot but it bears repeating.  The European Environment Agency's assessment was carried out two years ago.  Its assessment was that there were something like 1,400 premature mortalities from air pollution, the majority of which were primarily attributable to particulate matter - the small bits of soot you would hardly see.  I think the scientific description is less than 2.5 microns wide.  At that small level, they get into your lungs and bloodstream, which is why it is such an issue.  It has been recognised going back about seven or eight years.  </p>  <p>  Various Governments have been looking to go further to reduce those deaths and to initially introduce a smoky coal ban across the country.  This is so much easier because then you cannot get illegal imports and stuff coming across the Border.  You never have anything but smokeless coal in the country.  There was clear legal advice that was subject to legal challenge for fairly rational reasons because the people who were selling that product would say that the Government was addressing one element of it but was not addressing the other elements because the burning of wet wood or peat has a similar effect.  Under European law, it seems categorical that you cannot discriminate between products but must regulate across.  That was clear advice.  A series of Ministers recognised that this was not easy because when you get into the area of turf in particular, it is conflicting for a range of reasons against other public policy people who have customary rights - let us use those words.  There is a range of different aspects in this, including arrangements that have been put, such as turf compensation schemes.  It is complicated.  A variety of people have traditionally relied on their own bogs or access to a bog to be able to provide for their heating and the regulation of that is incredibly difficult.  In many ways, you would say this is not the core of the regulation we want.  The key problem is in towns, villages and cities.  Those within a house in a country area are at risk.  In particular, an open fire creates health problems for those in the house, which is something about which we must be clear, up-front and honest.  However, neighbours and others are less likely to be affected because of the greater distance between houses in the country.  However, it is a real problem in towns.  I met the EPA earlier this year to discuss another issue but it told me we have a real problem and cited Ennis.  I think there were 40 days this winter when it was above the WHO limit for a 24-hour period.  That is killing people.  Deputy McNamara would be aware that this was a real issue in his constituency.  It is not just Ennis.  There are towns and villages across the country where that applies.  </p>  <p>  In the programme for Government, we committed to extending the smoky coal ban nationwide.  Everyone knows this also meant we would have to address the issue of wet wood and turf.  We started that process a year and a half ago.  In fairness to Deputy Fitzmaurice, there has been ongoing communication throughout that process.  This discussion did not start in the past two weeks.  In the public consultation that happened in September last year and before that, we made it very clear that we were willing to take certain legal risks because there are legal risks.  The best and most legally watertight way is just to say that not a single sod of turf can be burnt.  We said that what we were going to do was regulate it at the retail level - at the commercial distribution level rather than for those who are taking turf from their own bogs or sharing with neighbours in that kind of rural tradition.  We said this was not the kind of ban we are talking about.  We are looking to regulate the commercial retail aspect of this and the Government and I are still committed to that.  There is real concern and we have listened.  We listened to Opposition Members last week in the various debates and to the Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and Green parliamentary parties.  I believe we can and will introduce something that protects the lives of those 1,300 people and is manageable in terms of those who have that traditional use of and access to a bog but regulates it at the retail level.  We cannot ignore towns because it is there where we have the real problem.  We need to work with the likes of Irish Rural Link, which I met last week, and use its boots-on-the ground capability to identify those who may have a problem in switching over and help them in every way we can to make sure this switch is made.  </p>  <p>  The Taoiseach was correct last week.  A lot of people said "Oh God, he's weakening the regulations."  He was not.  He made the obvious point that we said last September, and we had to give notice to the suppliers as well as to the customers, that from next autumn, they should not buy in or do contracts for that smoky coal because it will not be allowed and that we will introduce these regulations that address wet wood and turf in particular.  We gave a clear signal that we would do it.  The truth is that by doing it this autumn, in respect of turf, the Deputy knows more than anyone that most of the turf is in, saved and sold by the end of August.  People are saying this is the wrong time.  There is never a right time.  There is never a right time when 1,300 lives are being lost.  We are conscious that next winter will be tough but for the majority of people, particularly those relying on turf, be they out in the country and have access to a bog or an arrangement with a neighbour whereby they can get it, it will be an issue for the following year.  However, we do need to introduce regulations in the autumn for smoky coal in particular because we do not want to go through another winter, particularly if it is cold, where people die unnecessarily because of that.  </p>  <p>  We listened to the various voices.  The draft regulations were very much draft ones.  We are in the middle of a consultation process with the European Commission, which we must do.  We may have to go back and talk to it again.  We will do so because we are going to amend them listening to some of the voices and views here.  We will get that right and will introduce it in the autumn in a way that allows us to get that balance right.  </p> <p>It is a balance, but I believe it is one that legally, we cannot ignore or walk away from.</p> <p> Lastly, I would say I agree with the majority of the motion, as set out.  We hear different views on the issue.  Friends and colleagues who burn a lot of turf say that very dry turf burns quickly.  It is one of the characteristics of it.  Yes, it has a very high efficiency, but it burns up quite quickly.  People are not burning wet turf.  It does not make sense.  It does not work.  We have to go with the science.  I will be perfectly honest.  Even on the peat briquettes, I will be looking at the science to ensure that those briquettes, because of the way they are processed and burn, are below the 10 micrograms of pollution that is put out into the atmosphere.  We have to be straight about that and ensure that is the case.  I do not believe it will open up a future where we find that it is possible to burn turf.  No matter how seasoned it is, it brings difficulties.  That is a point of difference, but we will discuss it.  We will sit down, listen and engage.  That is what this debate is about.  It is why I appreciate it and why the Government is not opposing the motion.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-05a.480" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1547" speakername="Thomas Pringle" time="17:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022050500053#DDD00200"><p>My colleague, Deputy Fitzmaurice, has outlined, in depth, the very real concerns that exist on this issue, and has further outlined solutions that would go a long way to allay those concerns as they relate to the proposed regulations in the short term.  We know he has an indepth understanding of the issue, as he is someone who has toiled at the coalface - no pun intended - or turf face of this line of work for many years.  He is giving voice accurately to the thoughts and feelings of many people up and down the country here today.  Yet, I have to ask the question of how we arrived at this point.  Why, in relation to climate action initiatives, do we always appear to arrive at a similar point of conflict?  No Member of this House can rationally dispute the fact that climate breakdown is happening; that climate change is the defining issue for our country and for our society; and that it requires us all, as a nation, as a society and, importantly, as communities, to face this thing head-on.  It requires brave political decisions.  However, condemning a cohort of people in this country into poverty does not qualify as a brave political decision.  The finger-pointing and whataboutery of those on the Government benches towards the Opposition, on this issue, cheapens the discourse, and does a disservice to the issue of climate action.  It would suit the Minister and his colleagues better to acknowledge the broad support they have enjoyed from across both Houses of the Oireachtas in setting targets and embracing initiatives on climate, when they have been well-founded and fair.  It is quite simple in my mind.  Measures must be poverty-proofed.  They cannot and should not widen inequality.  They should not pit sections of our society against each other.  I take on board what the Minister has said in his response today.  That is vitally important.</p>  <p>  A just transition must be more than an empty formula of words that are trotted out now and then, when it suits.  It has to be at the centre of Government thinking on all such proposals if it is to get the buy-in and understanding of people, especially in rural communities such as Donegal, where there is still a higher-than-average reliance on fossil fuels, such as turf, to provide domestic heating.  A sustainable, affordable alternative must be put in place before the rug is pulled from under those people.  The consequence of poor policy, as we have seen many times, is to leave yourself a hostage to fortune, to climate deniers peddling glib lines and false promises of return to some bygone utopia at the expense of any chance of a future.  I passionately want that future for my children and future generations of Irish citizens. However, the Minister will not achieve his goals in the short, medium or long term if the Government continues to act like only it knows best, and that we should all just be compliant and silent to its superior understanding of what is good for us.  It does not wash with people.  The Minister must see that.  It is a demeaning way of trying to get things done.  More importantly, it is failing, and will continue to fail.</p>  <p>  Another thing that has struck me about the political discourse on this issue is the simplistic idea that this is some dastardly Machiavellian three-card trick pulled off by the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communication and the Greens over their colleagues in Government.  There has been little challenge to this empty rhetoric in the media.  Indeed, it appears to suit Deputies in Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael to let the Minister defend the Government decision on his own, in the hope of distancing themselves from it with their silence.  People are not stupid.  They can see the cack-handed, divisive, inequality-loving fingerprints of Fine Gael and the last-minute, ill-judged, back-of-an-envelope-job trademark of Fianna F&aacute;il all over this mess.  </p>  <p>  In conclusion, it is obvious to all of us in this House that we have to fully decarbonise our energy consumption, not just domestic heating, in the short to medium term.  Will the burning of all fossil fuels end? It will.  Can it be achieved unfairly on the backs of people in rural Ireland?  No, it cannot.  This Government, and previous ideological carbon copy iterations of the same, have had years to bring forward solutions on this issue.  We, in the Opposition, have consistently called for a fabric-first approach, for just, equitable and affordable solutions.  Yet, the Government has not come forward  with them.  I earnestly advocate for the Minister to go back to the drawing board and come back in here to present us with a proper solution.  In the interim, I ask him to listen to the ideas put forward in this motion by Deputy Fitzmaurice, and commit to exploring those solutions fully, as I note he said he would in his contribution.  That is vitally important, because it is a way this will be delivered.  People will but into, go along with, and accept, the decision.  They will accept other decisions that will be difficult to take in the future as well.</p></speech>

I welcome that the Government is not opposing it and is going to work with the contents of it.  I find myself in a strange position.  I am absolutely committed to tackling climate change.  It is the greatest existential threat we face, and we have to take action.  My difficulty with a lot of what the Government is doing is that it would appear to be on a divide and conquer basis.  On this occasion, there is a division between the town or city and the rural areas.  The feeling for me, and for those on the ground, taking Galway city as an example, is that urgent action is not being taken in relation to climate change.  We are not rolling our park and ride, public transport, and so on.  We took away waste management responsibilities from the county councils way back in 2001, when Galway City Council distinguished itself by working towards a zero waste strategy.  However, it was unacceptable to the Government at the time.  The Minister will remember all of that.  We said "No" to an incinerator not on the basis of NIMBYism, but on the basis of a zero waste strategy, using three bins and so on.  I say that by way of highlighting that the people are way ahead of us on so many issues, including neutrality, climate change and what is needed.  Justice and equality comes up on the doorsteps all the time.  I have never heard about anybody looking for a reduction in tax in all the time I have canvassed.  What they have asked for is services.</p>  <p>  Back to the topic at hand, what happened here is most unfortunate, to put it at its lightest.  Rather than anticipating and analysing the problem and ensuring the delivery of a just transition, as my colleague has said, through providing ways of dealing with it when the turf has to go, the Government took a hammer to it.  Now it is changing its mind, which I welcome.  We all make mistakes.  I welcome that the Government is going to look at the issue.  However, it is doing terrible damage to the climate change movement.  I know that it is about health.  I fully support the Government in relation to the elimination of smoky fuels.  The Minister talked about evidence.  I ask him to look at the analysis.  I am looking forward to the publication of the more recent analysis that follows up on the census.  I will be parochial and take Galway as an example.  The last census listed the counties with the highest proportion of households using peat central heating.  County Galway was third on the list, with 23% of households using peat for central heating.  As my colleague has pointed out to me, that figure excludes the houses that are using peat with no central heating.  The figure is astronomically high.  We are utterly reliant on peat.  I am only mentioning the one county that is third highest on the list.  There are lots of other counties.  No analysis was done, or thought given by anyone, as to how to deal with that.  I come back the point about double messages being given all the time.  I am on record as being against the carbon tax.  I make absolutely no apology for it.  It is a divisive tax and it does not serve us well in relation to climate change.  I do not think my experience in County Galway can be described as being unique to Galway.  I think people genuinely want to act in relation to climate change.  The obstacles have come from successive Governments.  Taking data centres as an example, I remember that in 2018 I was not familiar with data centres.  The women working with me downloaded the policy document on data centres.  I could not believe it.  Perhaps the acting Chairman might have a different opinion from me when he is sitting as a Deputy.  It is worth reading the document.  It gives the thumbs-up to data centres, without even a consideration of the consequences for climate change and energy use.</p> <p>That still has not been updated.  We are telling people they cannot burn turf, the one thing they rely on, and we are giving them no alternative.  On the other hand Government policy states that we should build as many data centres as we like.  I recently spoke on this in a Sinn F&eacute;in motion on data centres.  There are over 70 of them in Ireland, another eight are under construction and up to 30 more in the planning stages.  As of September 2021, data centres take up 11% of electricity in Ireland.</p> <p> I will return to the topic at hand.  What is missing is leadership and a recognition that the people are ahead of us.  There should be no division between neighbours or between city and county.  We were in this together, in the truest sense, not like was said about Covid and the solidarity.  We were together for a little while and we quickly departed from that.  We used punitive methods and divide and conquer tactics among those who were vaccinated and those who were not.  We are doing the same thing with climate change with a punitive carbon tax and stupidity when it comes to divide and conquer as opposed to a just transition, rewarding the people and giving them alternatives.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-05a.483" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1507" speakername="Darren O'Rourke" time="17:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022050500054#EEE00200"><p>I thank the Independent Group for bringing this motion.  It seeks to go some way towards filling a vacuum left by the Government when it jumped, so dreadfully ill-prepared, to announce a ban on the sale and distribution of turf.  The motion seeks to clarify what is meant by "turbary rights"; those can come in different ways and forms and the motion seeks to exempt certain identified groups.  It also calls on the Government to work with the industry to look at the standard and performance of turf and its comparison with so-called acceptable solid fuels.</p>  <p>  The fact that we are debating this motion at this stage and that it is an Opposition motion shows how Government has failed so miserably in the basic business of Government: planning; preparation; engagement; support; and communication.  Despite lots of talk about the issue of turf and lots of pontification and vilification, the truth is the Government made a hames of this and it has no one but itself to blame.  The vast majority of people using turf are living in rural Ireland, often in colder homes.  Many earn too much to qualify for the free energy upgrades and have little to no disposable income that they can put towards a retrofit of their homes, even with the 50% grant.  Even for those who qualify for the free energy upgrades, there is a two-year waiting list with a backlog of 7,000 people and Government is making slow progress towards addressing that backlog.  When the Government's half-baked plan was brought forward, devoid of the basic statistics on energy poverty and turf use and containing no proposed alternatives, people had a right to be concerned and the Opposition had a right to challenge the Government to do better.  We all recognise the need to move from fossil fuels to environmentally friendly alternatives.  That is not in dispute but the Government needs to work with people to assist them through this major energy transition.</p>  <p>  A just transition is a critical component of climate action.  It means bringing together workers, communities, employers and Government in social dialogue to drive the concrete plans, policies and investments needed for a fair and fast transformation to a low carbon economy and to ensure employment and jobs in the new economy are as decent and well-paid as those left behind.  This Government refused to accept our amendments to the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021, which would have defined a just transition and climate justice and ensured the climate action plan was drafted with reference to just transition principles.  It was a real shame that the Government refused our constructive suggestions and the resulting climate policies are weaker as a result.  The same can be said of the amendments brought forward by Deputy Whitmore on the Circular Economy, Waste Management (Amendment) and Minerals Development (Amendment) Bill 2022 earlier this week that were opposed.  The amendments sought that just transition principles would be included in that Bill but they were opposed by the Government.</p>  <p>  Most of the Government's policies are missing that key just transition element and that is a choice and decision of the Government.  The midlands was the first major area promised a just transition as the peat-burning power stations were wound down.  Unfortunately, jobs, reskilling and investment have not materialised and communities feel left behind.  They feel they were sold a pup because they were.  This is another reason the Government's proposed ban on the sale of turf went down so poorly.  It did so because those it will impact are centralised in the midlands in particular, with this motion highlighting that in some counties up to 34% of households are solely dependent on turf as solid fuel.  There is a level of mistrust that is of the Government's own making and it is important that the Government seeks to address it.  It is doing real harm to the climate agenda.  From this Government, as with previous Governments, people see failure, hypocrisy and inequity.</p>  <p>  The urgent need to tackle climate change is not in question.  We all know we need to move urgently towards a zero carbon society and economy and this will take action from individuals, businesses and the State.  The Government is failing in its responsibility.  It is high on rhetoric and low on delivery and at the heart of every scheme it designs is inequity.  Yesterday, for example, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, highlighted a 6.3% growth in energy-related carbon dioxide emissions last year.  This is extremely worrying considering we need to reduce overall emission by 4.7% each year in the first half of this decade to meet our 2030 emissions reductions targets.  Slow action and input to policies are contributing to this move in the wrong direction.  On the one hand the Minister is telling ordinary people to cut energy use while on the other hand doing nothing to curb the uncontrolled growth of energy-sapping data centres.  Data centres are already using more electricity than all rural houses combined and this is set to more than double out to 2030.  People see the hypocrisy in Government policy and action and they will not stand for it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-05a.484" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1451" speakername="Matt Carthy" time="17:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022050500054#EEE00300"><p>If we are to take the Minister's remarks on their own I am sure the vast majority of people would say they are all laudable aspirations.  When people are in government they have to be judged on the results of their words and actions and here are the results of what the Minister, the Green Party and the Government managed to do in recent weeks.  The amount of turf that will be extracted and sold in Ireland in 2021 will be significantly higher than in 2020.  That is thanks to the Minister and his actions.  Many people who have not burned turf in several years are making arrangements to get to their bogs, contacting their neighbours to look for a supply or if they use turf they are getting a little bit extra just in case.  How ironic is that?  The Green Party in government is damaging the environment.</p>  <p>  There has been an attempt to portray the debate that surrounded the Government's mishandling of the turf ban in binary terms.  It has been portrayed that the protection of peatlands is good therefore anyone who opposes any measure, regardless of how harebrained or unworkable, that has that as its stated aspiration is portrayed as a narrow-minded and populist resister of inevitable change.  The problem is that the Government&rsquo;s approach to these matters is often considered - rightly in my view - punitive, tokenistic and hypocritical by those who are directly affected.  Rather than advancing climate action, Government measures alienate many of those people who are keen to protect the environment, water quality, biodiversity and air quality of the communities they live in.  It is nonsensical to suggest there are people in some part of Ireland who are content in destroying that area in which they live.</p>  <p>  The numbers of those using turf to heat their homes have declined rapidly over a number of decades.  Why is that?  The evidence is clear; when they have an affordable and credible alternative people embrace it.  The question has to be asked, and it is a legitimate question that neither the Minister nor any of his colleagues in government have addressed, why is the Government's focus not on providing those alternatives?  Aside from the most recent debacle, the largest single driver of increased solid fuel use in recent months has been the rapidly rising cost of home heating oil.  What was the Government&rsquo;s response to that?  It was to increase the cost of home heating oil further through carbon tax hikes, not at the beginning of this year or last year but last Sunday.</p> <p>If the Minister, Deputy Ryan, was genuine in his motivation behind the turf ban being air quality, he would have been the person at Cabinet to demand that the most recent carbon tax was halted.  In fact he would have been supporting and advocating for Sinn F&eacute;in's call that all excise duties and charges on heating oil be lifted during the current cost-of-living emergency.  That single move would have done more to reduce turf use than anything he now presents in his unworkable regulations on turf sales.</p> <p> Peatlands are an invaluable natural resource that must be protected.  That is a statement of fact.  The burning of solid fuels is damaging our environment and our air quality.  That is a statement of fact that Sinn F&eacute;in recognises absolutely.  It is quite frankly insulting that Government, through its spin and favoured commentators, is now trying to accuse those of us who have pointed out that its proposals are unworkable of somehow being climate deniers or populists because we impose what are unfair and quite frankly counterproductive measures.</p> <p> While it has been rarely mentioned in the many pontifications that have filled the opinion columns in recent days, it was not lost within community discussions or in this House, in which we have mentioned it quite a number of times, that the turf debacle coincided with the approval of another data centre, one that will use the same levels of electricity supply as some small cities.  That the Green Party and its partners in Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael refused to support a moratorium on such developments, only last year, simply adds to the view that Government is more comfortable in targeting ordinary families without alternatives than it is to facing up to large corporate polluters.</p> <p> The Government assertion that climate action equates to punitive measures is disingenuous.  To say, as is essentially the rhetoric from Government, that we cannot fund climate measures unless the burden is borne by ordinary workers and families through carbon taxes is dishonest.  What actually happens?  That very same argument is then embraced by actual climate deniers.  We probably hear it in this House that anybody who supports carbon targets and climate actions at all, therefore supports carbon taxes and punishing ordinary people.</p> <p> The truth is that there is a fairer way, which is by providing the alternatives before penalising people for not using those alternatives.  Essentially that is what Government has in place now in that it is charging people for not using alternatives that do not exist for them.  Increasing the cost of petrol and diesel for those who have no choice but to drive to work, no access to public transport and cannot afford an electric vehicle does nothing for the environment.  It just makes their lives harder and likewise for those who use solid fuels.</p> <p> If the Government wants people to change, it has to first provide a mechanism for them to do so.  Most of those hardest hit by Government actions do not have such a mechanism.  They do not get the supports and benefits that are often cited as existing as a result of the carbon taxes they pay.  Government claims that a portion of the take from carbon taxes goes to agri-environmental schemes for farmers but it does not say that is actually less than the CAP funding it gave away in EU budget negotiations.  Farmers are expected to pay considerable amounts through carbon taxes but get less back in supports.</p> <p> Most working families to do not have access to 100% retrofitting grants.  Those who do will wait years for them and they cannot afford to avail of electric vehicle grants.  This is one of the sources of the unfairness.  Somebody who lives in an area that is very-well serviced by public transport and happens to have sufficient funds in the bank can get a &euro;5,000 grant from the Government towards a brand new electric car and a &euro;25,000 grant towards a deep retrofit of his or her home.  The Minister of State expects people without either the means or transport alternative to pay for it through the Government's taxes.</p> <p> If we really want to make a positive impact, funds should be delivered to where they will make the biggest impact and where they are needed most.  In the first instance, a comprehensive cost-of-living package must be delivered as advocated by Sinn F&eacute;in.  People need a break.  At a minimum Government should commit to not making necessities more expensive without alternatives.  Second, resources should be targeted at those who currently do not have the alternatives in transport or heating systems.  Third, we must recognise that far from delivering positive changes, the actions of the Minister, Deputy Ryan, the Green Party and their colleagues in government, Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, are making things worse.  We can and must pursue a better, more effective course.</p> <p> I commend Deputy Fitzmaurice on bringing forward this motion and a bit of realism to this House.  Government has indicated that it will support the motion.  However, it now needs to genuinely start listening to communities throughout this country that want to play a positive role in protecting our environment but are being hampered in doing so by this Government.</p></speech>

They have put forward, as has widely been agreed here this evening, reasonable asks of Government with regard to the turf-sale ban initially proposed by the Minister, Deputy Ryan.  One of the first things the Minister, Deputy Ryan, said when he stood up was about the amount of misinformation that has been given on this issue.</p>  <p>  Of course most of that misinformation came from Government because there was a parliamentary question reply that did not speak about commercial sale.  On 5 April it categorically stated that "a regulatory provision will be made to prohibit the placing on the market, sale or distribution of sod peat".  The reply went on to state that "persons ...[with] turbary rights ... will not be permitted to place it on the market for sale or distribution to others".  The misinformation, which came on the back of that reply from the Minister, was the T&aacute;naiste saying there would be a pause and the Minister saying that the plans would be proceed and there was no pause agreed.</p>  <p>  That was the bulk of the misinformation on this issue from start to finish.  Unfortunately we still do not have that clarity that is very badly needed.  This motion puts the Minister on notice because it will be important when he comes to look at these regulations that he considers those listed in this motion.  It is not just as simple as those with turbary rights.  We welcome the U-turn that has now been taken on these regulations that were due to come into effect in four months' time.  In that initial parliamentary question reply there was no mention of drafts or consultations.  It was a factual statement that this was happening.  Clearly that was the Minister's intention.</p>  <p>  As has been said quite often since all of this began, the fear, confusion, stress and worry that this caused in rural communities was immense.  It was handled so badly from start to finish.  I hope at the very least that a lesson has been learned by Government because we have to bring rural communities with us in climate action.  This is certainly not a way to do that.  This entire debacle also points to the need for a rural-proofing mechanism to be put in place.</p>  <p>  I welcome that the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, is working on such a mechanism and that it has been tendered and work is under way to come up with the best mechanism that can be put in place.  That will be needed not just for climate action measures but for all measures and policies in all Departments.  We need a rural-proofing mechanism to ensure that rural communities are considered when it comes to policy from any Department.  It is very reasonable for people to seek that alternatives are put in place and we do not have a situation in which things are done back to front.</p>  <p>  There is a cohort of people who either cut or use turf that would tomorrow take an alternative if it was accessible and affordable.  Certainly my generation, which is very different from the generations before us, does not take enjoyment from going to the bog.  In fact we dread it and many of us hate it but unfortunately we have to do it.  I remember growing up that the only way dad would get us to go the bog was by telling us we could bring picnic.  We would get to the bog, eat the picnic and want to go home.  That is not what my generation wants.</p>  <p>  However, there is also a cohort of people that will accept and use nothing other than turf.  I think of my granny at 90 years of age.  I acknowledge that the Minister appreciates that tradition and culture because it is very important for that generation.  The cutting and use of turf is generational.  It will naturally phase out.  There is doubt that will happen.</p>  <p>  It is absolutely shameful that we do not have a poverty strategy in place in this State in 2022.</p> <p>Whether this involves one person or 200, 2,000 or 3,000 people dying in this State every year because of energy poverty, the fact is that people are dying in this State in 2022 due to fuel poverty.  We have no strategy.  We do not know the households where people are living in fuel poverty or those households where people are at risk of fuel poverty.  The fuel allowance exists, but it is extremely limited as a support measure.  There are some households where if people get sick and must leave their jobs it will not be possible for them to access the fuel allowance if they are on illness benefit.  People on low pay getting the working family payment, WFP, which essentially tops up poor wages, cannot get the fuel allowance.  Whatever the perception might be, especially in the Government, there is no link between fuel poverty and the fuel allowance.  People receiving a certain number of payments get the fuel allowance, but otherwise there is no support for people living in fuel poverty.</p> <p> The first thing we must do therefore is to determine who is living in fuel poverty.  These are important data we do not have.  We need and should have that data if we are going to have a just transition and bring people with us.  I say that because that is what we need to do if we are going to be successful in undertaking climate action.  I call on the Government, in addition to considering everything in this motion, as important as it is, to accept also that the alternatives are just as important and so is a fuel poverty strategy.  I hope the Government will commit to going back to the table to develop and publish such a strategy.  It is so important for us to have it in this day and age, that we tackle this issue and ensure that people do not die because they are cold in Ireland in 2022.</p></speech>

Sometimes it is a shame that the schedule of the D&aacute;il is so rigid in respect of when parties or groupings have business in Private Members' time.  This motion would have been better discussed last week.  That is the case no matter what side one is on in this debate.  Anyone who listened to Deputy Fitzmaurice debate this issue on &quot;Morning Ireland&quot; a few days ago from the perspective of his experience of being a man of the bog, as he said on that programme, would have realised this is something we should have been discussing last week.  The debate got away from us last week and it became about other things.</p><p>This subject concerns the regulations and how we can move from the <i>status quo</i>, which cannot continue, to where we need to go.  We may differ on this point, but at least this motion is technical and based in the reality of what is happening on the ground in the communities on the bog being heated by the turf from those bogs.  This aspect must be acknowledged.  We must, however, move and bring people with us.  This is where the Government has failed in recent weeks and that is why this has become such a worrying issue.</p><p>The facts do not lie.  Some 1,300 die annually due to poor air quality.  There are several reasons for this, including emissions from vehicle fuel, smoky coal and the burning of turf.  We do not know to what degree each contributes, but taken together, having all these particles in the air is damaging people's health.  I just about remember the 1980s and the smog in Dublin resulting from the use of smoky coal.  Work went into reducing the use of such smoky coal in Dublin and our other major cities.</p><p>We now need an all-island ban on smoky coal because it can still be seen.  In my constituency of Dublin Fingal, coal can still be seen for sale at the side of the road in bags that we do not know the origin of.  We also do not know the standard of this type of coal.  Many people, however, believe it to be smoky coal.  This practice must stop and we need a 32-county approach to achieving this objective.  After the Assembly elections, this is something we must explore with real vigour.  I say that because this remains a problem.  In 2015, the then Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, began the process of introducing a nationwide ban on smoky coal.  It ended up running into the sands when we left, or were kicked out of, Government, in 2016.</p><p>We see, and have seen, continued resistance to doing what is needed regarding reducing particle emissions into our atmosphere and reducing our air pollution.  These are difficult decisions to make.  There is no denying this point.  Unfortunately, the approach taken by the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, has perhaps been too bullheaded and has caused this row, which has been building in recent weeks.  It need not have come to this point.  We must examine what practical solutions could have been proposed in this context.  For example, we know the homes that require turf to fire their central heating systems or just to heat those homes that do not have central heating.  One of the solutions we suggested was that we could have fast-tracked those properties for retrofitting.  We are looking at this scheme and it is still almost up in the atmosphere.  People are not seeing it on the ground.</p><p>If, however, the Government had stated that it knew turf was a poor fuel for heating homes and that this was a <i>status quo</i>that must be moved away from, while also acknowledging that people living in fuel poverty do not have other options now and therefore the Government was going to fast-track retrofitting those people's homes, that would have been the way bring people with them, but that was not done.  An ideological approach was taken.  It was absorbed by these communities and this is what has caused the fear that exists.  This has all happened in a context where there are practical solutions that could have brought people with us on this transition and got us to where we want to be.  That objective is to reduce to zero the need to burn poor fossil fuels in our homes, businesses or vehicles to enable us to live, commute and work.  This is the point we must get to.</p><p>We have talked about the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill 2021 and the globe being on fire and climate breakdown.  The reality when it comes to making decisions is that they become politically difficult.  Therefore, we must find solutions to get us through, because there is no other option.  We must stop burning turf, coal and other fossil fuels.  Other solutions exist and we must target them at the people in need of them.  The cost-of-living crisis is real.  Fuel poverty is very real.  The fuel allowance is not fit for purpose and it is not helping people where they need it.  Even if people do receive fuel allowance payments, just providing more money to buy poor fossil fuels that are going to damage the atmosphere is not where we need to be.  That is the <i>status quo</i>.  We must move forward and bring people with us.</p><p>This motion goes some way towards doing that.  We will always find ourselves at some point being on opposite sides or not being fully in agreement.  This motion is borne from lived experience.  It offers a proposal worthy of discussion.  We must see something more from the Government on this issue.  We cannot allow our war on climate change to fall at any hurdle, and especially not at this one.</p></speech>

I found it informative.  I was surprised at the number of rights and leases available to people in rural communities.  The fact that there are so many shows the complexity of this issue, as well as how intrinsic it is to rural life and to many thousands of communities across the country.  That is also demonstrated by this system having gone on for so many years and with so many different regimes having been applied to it.</p>  <p>  This is the third time I have spoken on this issue in recent weeks.  Previously, I spoke about how frustrating I found the lack of clarity regarding what was being proposed.  I said that what was incredibly frustrating was that the lack of clarity, and the concern that ensued from it, undermined the fundamental message this regulation was trying to convey.  This message concerns air pollution and public health.  A climate message is also embedded in this regulation, as is a biodiversity message.  All those environmental messages were lost.  They became tangled up in this huge political fight because of a lack of clarity from the Minister and the Government regarding this matter.</p>  <p>  I had some element of sympathy in that regard because it can be difficult to get this type of messaging across sometimes.  My sympathy, however, waned quite a lot after I read the public consultation on the development of the new solid fuel regulations for Ireland.</p> <p>I presume this is consultation the Government did on this issue.  This is the summary of the responses.  I had a quick read of it.  Interestingly, 3,500 people responded to that consultation.  I have worked for Government bodies where I have run public consultations and that is a massive number of people to engage on any topic.  That in itself highlights how important this issue is to communities across the country.  Probably the most stark thing that jumped out at me was on the third page, where the fourth paragraph notes that there appears to have been a significant level of misunderstanding regarding the purpose of the consultation and the scope of the regulatory proposals.  A large number of respondents made submissions outlining their opposition to an outright ban on all solid fuels or a ban on turf cutting, despite the fact that no such bans were proposed in the consultation documents, press releases, town hall meetings or any statements made by the Minister.  The document states that while this misinterpretation had the effect of eliciting a number of responses that were not fully relevant, it did provide some further context and understanding of certain areas of public opinion.  It goes on to talk about the different issues that were raised during the consultation, including health, fuel poverty, retrofitting, traditional cultural attachment, cultural awareness and communication.  </p> <p> The Minister was told this was going to be a mess.  It was clear from the consultation that people did not understand what he was doing or why he was doing it.  Yet he continued and because he refused to listen to the 3,500 voices of those who took time out of their day to engage in this process, it is in the first page that there was a lack of clarity and major confusion about that.  Because he refused to listen to them, we are now here at the point where we have had to debate this issue three times in the D&aacute;il.  We are in the middle of a cost of fuel crisis and a cost of living crisis.  We have a war that is waging in Europe.  We have climate and biodiversity crises.  We are about to hand over &euro;1 billion to a private healthcare entity where there is a lack of clarity about who is going to control it.  We have so many issues to be discussing yet this is the third time we are discussing this matter.  The Government was told by the public that what it was proposing was unclear.  Given it was so avoidable, I find it absolutely unforgivable that it did not listen to those people.  It is a pity the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan is not here at the moment.  He spoke earlier and said that the public consultation made it clear and that he listened to various voices.  I cannot see any evidence of that whatsoever.</p> <p> The specific issues raised by people included concerns in respect of fuel poverty, the availability of affordable alternatives to solid fuel, and that the cost of retrofitting is too high.  Strident regulation of solid fuels would constitute an attack on rural Ireland and traditional home heating practices.  Everything we have been saying, all the Members of the Opposition and in fact Members of the Government have been saying for the past two weeks, the public had already told the Minister and he did not listen.  We cannot afford to allow that to happen.  Dealing with climate and environmental crises and air pollution is going to involve many challenges.  There will be messaging and financial challenges.  People can be fearful of change.  There are many things we will need to do.  My goodness, please, the Government must listen to people when it does a consultation.  I do not see the point of spending money on a consultation.  I am not even sure if it was read by any person in government because I have not heard anyone else talking about this document.  </p> <p> I also want to mention the issue of just transition.  I welcome the fact that the Minister of State engaged with the committee on the Circular Economy, Waste Management (Amendment) and Minerals Development (Amendment) Bill 2022 and included poverty proofing and disability proofing of it.  I reiterate my disappointment that the just transition principles were not included and were opposed, as they were also opposed in the Climate Bill.  If the just transition principles had been applied in this instance, I do not think we would be here today.</p> <p> I understand that the primary purpose of this is a public health and air pollution objective.  The Social Democrats introduced a Bill last year on car idling at school gates.  It is a robust Bill and has been developed and been through the Bills process.  It is a win-win for everybody, for the environment, children's health, and for the people who will use less fuel because there is no idling.  It is also an issue that Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party have all at some point said they would implement if they got into government.  I ask that they look at those wins and move on the Bill.  As an Opposition Deputy it is highly unlikely I will get it any further than to introduce it.  I ask that the Minister of State does that.  If his objective is to have clean air, here is a simple measure he can undertake that has already essentially been approved and given the green light by his party members.  </p> <p> I also wish to reiterate the calls for a strategy on fuel poverty.  It is disgraceful that it is three years out of date, particularly in the times people are facing at the moment.  I ask that the Government moves quickly on that and gets it done.</p></speech>

Ending the cutting of turf is ending a tradition.  Irish people hold traditions very dear.  I am opposed to an immediate ban on turf cutting.  I voted against the Government's position on this issue last week.  Most of us in this House know the dangers of global warming.  The threat posed by fossil fuels must be addressed.  However, in doing so, we are obliged to take stock of the overall picture.  This cannot happen overnight.  We must allow time for people to change the habits of a lifetime and, more important, to make provisions for the future.</p>  <p>  In my native Tipperary we have a village called Littleton.  This village and community grew around the operation of the former briquette factory.  A large number of locals were employed permanently or part-time at the factory.  As part of their terms of employment the workers were entitled to turf and briquettes at a discounted price.  As an obvious result, their homes were, and most still are, heated by solid fuel, cookers and back boilers.  These households need time to adapt.  Now is not the time to force change.  Every household is under financial pressure.  Money is scarce and budgets are tight.  Ability to fund retrofits is constrained.  Grant structures for retrofitting requires the applicant to personally contribute a large sum of money.  The vast majority of households simply do not have this level of funding available to them.  Even if an applicant can meet the qualification criteria, certified tradesmen are overstretched and unavailable.  Carrying out such work is not achievable for many families within an enforced time span. </p>  <p>  Over the past weeks I have been contacted by numerous people involved in the tradition of saving turf.  One man has been cutting turf in Tipperary for over 40 years.  Down through the years his family has employed up to 50 people.  They sell turf as a single source fuel supply to in excess of 300 homes locally.  They are now dealing with the third generation of local families.  This man states that the past few weeks have been incredibly difficult for the turf-cutting business.  This is due to inconsistent messaging on the future of turf-cutting.  I want to quote him to give an accurate reflection of what he and many more are feeling at this time.  He says: "On a daily basis, I am receiving calls from customers, many of whom I would consider to be vulnerable.  They are expressing serious concerns about their ability to heat their homes.  In the context of the current economic situation, in particular wholesale oil and gas prices, if people have to refrain from burning turf, it is likely that many will be unable to obtain an economically viable heat source for their homes."  He is pleading with the Government to make this move in a phased manner to avoid a cliff-edge impact on customers and contractors.  His business has invested heavily in machinery, tools and equipment.  If a swift ban on cutting turf is implemented, it will not only affect the livelihoods of his employees, but will also write off significant investments by contractors across the country. </p> <p>He cannot be faulted for asking if the Government will offer financial support to them when their businesses are wiped out.  Equally, he cannot be blamed for worrying about his customers' ability to transition to an alternative heat source for their homes.  It is impossible to explain to people the logic behind imposing costly demands in the middle of the current economic crisis, a time when many are already deciding whether to eat or heat their homes.  The time will come when these decisions can be made, but now is not the time to take unilateral decisions that have negative impacts on vulnerable households.</p></speech>

I will give a few examples of things that should be in place and alternatives that are not available.  We all know the charging point infrastructure for electric vehicles is not in the country.  I have a constituent who sold the electric car he bought eight months ago because he could not charge it at home owing to a problem with the ESB, nor could he do so in Tuam because there is only one charging point there.  Down in Claremorris, there is also only one.  The man sold the car.  He said he would never touch it again.</p>  <p>  For about 12 years, we have been looking for a bus lane between Claregalway and Galway city.  For probably 20 years, we have been looking for a bypass of Claregalway.  I mention these points because we talk about cars idling outside schools.  Around 30,000 cars idle for about half an hour every morning as people try to get to Galway from the Tuam area, and they do so again in the evening as they try to get home.  This causes many problems for air quality and the health of our people.</p>  <p>  The warmer homes scheme is great but the delay in getting people to do the inspections and the work is up to two years.  As late as three months ago, I saw a project being carried out under the scheme.  Everything was done right except that the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland funded an oil-fired boiler to heat the place.  I believed it should have been a heat pump.  Therefore, we are still using fossil fuels and funding their use through our warmer homes scheme.</p>  <p>  A situation in my constituency, in Derrybrien, points to what can be done and what should be done urgently.  Turbines producing energy for up to 50,000 houses are to be decommissioned.  Not alone has the wind farm been providing green energy but it has also been helping us nationally to reduce our carbon dioxide emissions.  The Government is standing idly by instead of introducing emergency legislation to ensure it remains in place.  The site also has telecommunications and emergency radio assets for the area.  It benefits the local authority economically through rates and the local community through a dividend.</p>  <p>  The other issue concerns what people are heating their homes with.  Consider the number of solid fuel ranges and stoves that are still in local authority houses.  The local authorities need to replace all of them with heat pumps.  How long will it take to do that?  Will it take five years or ten?  People must not be forced out of a situation without an alternative.</p>  <p>  The grants for the retrofit scheme are fixed.  While new grants were introduced lately, much of the benefit has been eroded through inflation.  I ask the Minister to relay to the Government that we need a just transition.  Let us not try to force people into something if they have no alternative to what they currently have.  Forcing them is why there has been such a huge backlash over recent months.  It is why we are speaking about it for the third time in the D&aacute;il and why we need to bring clarity to what we are doing and understand exactly the implications of what we will do so we will not leave people in a worse position regarding heat, hot water or cooking.  It is a huge problem for many in this country.  I commend Deputy Fitzmaurice on bringing forward his proposals.  We have talked about turbary rights and licences and the history of people shifting from one bog to another.  They were given compensation to buy turf for the next ten years but all of a sudden they cannot buy it.  We have to settle this down and ensure everybody is treated properly.</p></speech>

Therefore, they rely on buying it from neighbours or others.  A study commissioned for the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, has found that, all in all, 54% of all households use some form of solid fuel to heat their homes, with 16%, or one in every six, using it as a primary source of heating.  Therefore, it is ludicrous and unscientific for the Government to announce that a ban on selling turf is needed to protect the nation and planet from the dire health consequences of burning a sod of turf.  This announcement was nothing short of bullying by a Government that has a majority for now and thinks it can get away with anything it does or says.  There has been plenty of huffing and puffing from the backbenchers of Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael since the announcement.  However, when they had the chance last week, they voted with the Government and in effect gave a blank cheque to the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, to do as he pleases.</p>  <p>  Instead of talking about this nonsense, the Minister should have been talking about an issue I have been raising consistently in the Oireachtas over the past few years, the security of our national energy supply.  Despite my best efforts, the Government has refused to address my concerns or those of the nation in any way.  I am now concerned that the Government is not acting in our national interest with regard to the security of our energy supply.  I have asked the Minister numerous times over the past few years about the officially commissioned report on the security of energy supply.  Where is it and why is it over a year late?  This is my third time asking for an answer in the D&aacute;il.</p>  <p>  We hear that fuel may be rationed if supplies are squeezed.  Let me tell the Minister of State that if this happens, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, should be brought up for gross negligence for failing to move to secure our energy in this country.  A floating liquified natural gas terminal in Cork Harbour would immediately improve additional security of supply.  I spoke at length with the Minister to have him progress this plan with a man from west Cork.  Where is the plan?  Has it been thrown in the bin?  What about progressing the carbon-neutral development off Barryroe?  It is being kicked around and political posturing interferes with its progress.  Why has it been stalled?  It has the potential to create 1,200 jobs locally, bringing &euro;3 billion into the economy.  More important is its potential to make us totally energy independent, stopping us importing fuels when we have them on our own doorstep.</p></speech>

I listened last week to some of the people who got airtime to talk about burning wet turf.  That is the same as pouring the pot of tea into the car and hoping it will run on it.  That is the type of nonsense the Government has got airtime for.  Then we heard about "mining" turf.  That is as much as the Government knows about turf.  It is as much as it knows about poverty.  I spoke last week about people who count the number of briquettes in a bale.  There are 22.  The people were putting so many aside so they could heat their house in the way they could afford or to heat the water because they have no other fuel supply.</p>  <p>  The biggest polluters in this country with regard to fuel are the local authorities.  The biggest polluters in this country when it comes to sewage in our waterways are the local authorities.  Who does the Government help all the time?  It pumps money into the local authorities.  When people want to build a house for themselves on their land, which they may have been left, in Limerick and other counties, they are charged &euro;6,000 or &euro;7,000.  They must supply their own water and sewerage but if they do something wrong, they are fined.  Despite this, the Government and local authorities are the biggest polluters and the Government is doing nothing about it.  Again, who does it target?  It targets the people in the counties who do not have any infrastructure such as gas lines.</p> <p>The Government told the people it would give them &euro;200 off an ESB bill.  Why does the Minister of State not stand up here and tell them the truth?  It gave them &euro;200, less the 23% VAT which goes back into the Government's pockets.  That is the truth.  It could not even tell the people the truth about what it was going to give them at escalating prices.  Everything that the Government does seems to be flawed and against people outside of towns and cities outside of Dublin.  That is what it does.  It is a city-based Cabinet.  A total of 80% of the Cabinet is city-based.  It does not understand Ireland outside of Dublin.  There is no transport, sewerage or proper water supplies.  It is a failure of this Government and previous Governments because we have no alternatives.  If it wants people to change because of the environment, it should give us the alternatives.</p></speech>

I have listened to statements made during the debate blaming the media, Opposition Deputies and everybody else instead of the Government holding up his hands and saying it got it wrong, and seriously wrong.  It shows the arrogance and the fact the Government thinks it can walk over people in rural Ireland and fool people.  It will not wash.</p>  <p>  The ban on the commercial sale of turf will be strongly resisted.  I do not think the Government realises the anger that is out there.  It is encroaching on people and this is an overreach.  It is telling people how to heat their homes.  A small percentage of people are affected.  Next, the Government will be telling them what to eat or how long to run a shower for.  Is this for real?  If the Government is seriously worried about the deaths it maintains are caused by fossil fuels, why is it not concerned about the 3,000 deaths caused directly or indirectly by fuel poverty?  That is the reality.  It is a fact.</p>  <p>  The Government is disconnected from the people.  It is arrogant in trying to ram through something that has been strongly resisted in rural Ireland and strongly opposed by me and other Rural Independent Group Deputies.  We will continue to stand with the people in our constituencies.  We will not be watering down what we are saying or anything else like some Deputies here or like the Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il rural Deputies who headed for the hills earlier today and are now probably on the run.  This is ridiculous.  It is an overreach.  To tell a small percentage of people what they should burn is ridiculous.</p>  <p>  Is the Government not concerned about the substandard buildings and accommodation in which people are living in this country?  Is the Government not concerned about the substandard conditions in which children and teachers are trying to work in our schools every day while they wait for approval from the Department of Education for new buildings?  Does that not appear on the Government's agenda?  It seems to be very selective in the research it chooses.  It has ignored research compiled by the European Respiratory Society.  It stated that living or working in cold and damp conditions causes serious lung conditions.  Has the Government ignored that?</p>  <p>  The Government needs to get real and stop trying to dictate to the people of rural Ireland all of the time.  It is out of step, out of line and out of touch, and I can tell it this will be resisted.  It will not get its way on this one.</p></speech>

I am acutely aware of recent increases in energy costs due to increases internationally and, more recently, the crisis in Ukraine.  The purpose of new solid fuel regulations is to ensure better quality and more efficient fuels will be available on the market.  Low smoke ovoids are a suitable cost-efficient alternative to other types of high polluting coal, peat and wood logs in terms of heat delivered per cent cost.</p>  <p>  Given recent research which highlights a greater dependence on solid fuels by those in energy poverty, the risk of long-term exposure to poor air quality indoor and outdoor for those in more disadvantaged socioeconomic groups and the impact of short-term high-level air pollution events, it is appropriate to consider the link between increased risk of excess winter mortality among those in energy poverty living in areas with high dependency on solid fuels.  As such, the case for further regulation of solid fuels is clear.  To improve the health of citizens, we must continue the transition away from the use of solid fuels for residential burning.</p>  <p>  There will be a targeted focus on the people these regulations impact most.  There are people on low incomes who have traditionally purchased turf because it is cheaper.  They are the people who are at most risk of fuel poverty, on whom we will focus our retrofit activity and where we will focus our social welfare supports.  The transition to low smoke fuels from higher polluting fuels should not be difficult for customers, given the wide range of alternative low smoke fuels available on the market which are now at a comparable price to traditional fuels and do not require any appliance change.</p>  <p>  Information provided by the SEAI in the most recent domestic fuels comparison of energy costs demonstrate that low smoke coal is a suitably cost-effective lower emission choice of coal in terms of heat delivered per cent.  This indicates that if a household in fuel poverty switches to a lower smoke product, there should not be an undue financial burden.  The Government also has a range of measures in place, including but not limited to the fuel allowance, to address the impact on consumers of energy costs.  These measures include budget 2022, which increased the weekly rate of the fuel allowance by &euro;5 to &euro;33 per week, so that &euro;914 was paid to eligible householders over the course of the winter.  An additional lump sum payment of &euro;125 was paid in mid-March 2022 to the 370,000 households receiving the fuel allowance.</p>  <p>  Following the enactment of legislation in early March, from the beginning of April all residential electricity customers will see the electricity costs emergency benefits payment of &euro;200, including VAT, credited to their accounts.  The national retrofit scheme includes specific measures to support householders in taking action to reduce their energy bills, including up to 80% grant funding for low-cost, high-impact measures such as attic insulation.</p>  <p>  A range of additional measures will be introduced.  They will include VAT being reduced from 13.5% to 9% on gas and electricity bills from the start of May until the end of October; an additional payment of &euro;100 to be made to all recipients of the fuel allowance; a reduction in the public service obligation levy to zero by October 2022; a targeted package of measures to enhance protections for financially vulnerable customers and customers in debt; supporting existing customers in accessing a competitive rate for their energy; and a scheme for the installation of photovoltaic panels for vulnerable customers and householders, with a budget of &euro;20 million.</p>  <p>  I made the point earlier in the debate that I do not believe people in rural Ireland are burning wet sod peat, which would be a highly inefficient and uncomfortable process.  It is the emission factors, rather than the moisture content, of burning sod peat which is the primary concern in any event.  The Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, research report, Emission Factors from Domestic-scale Solid-fuel Appliances, points to the fact that, of all the solid fuels tested, including bituminous coal, sod peat produces by far the highest level of particulate matter and nitrogen oxide emissions per unit energy loaded and produced by far the highest level of emissions per unit heat delivered.  This demonstrates what we already know and what other EPA research points to, namely, that the contribution of peat to fine particulate matter levels can be considerable, in particular in areas such as the midlands where peat extraction occurs.</p>  <p>  Sod peat is comparatively low in energy, is not convenient to handle and leaves significant ash residues.  While it is primarily a rural fuel, there is increasing evidence indicating that sod peat is being used in urban settings where it has a greater impact on air quality than in rural areas.  That is why measures are required to reduce the emissions associated with burning peat but which respect the traditional practice of harvesting turf.  To reiterate, the final regulations will not prohibit the owner of a turbary or a customary right, or a person entitled to sod peat harvested for distribution in accordance with the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme, from using or sharing sod peat.  However, we cannot encourage its use outside of rural areas where it does the most harm by introducing standards which will make no appreciable difference to the adverse effects of burning sod peat in more urban areas.</p> <p>That would be a retrograde step, especially at a time when we are seeking to increase our ambition.  Clean air is central to supporting life in all its forms and the environment on which we all depend.  It is synonymous with well-being.  Clean air and a healthy environment are also prerequisites for attracting inward investments and sustainable jobs.  Clean air benefits our habitats and wildlife and contributes to the best possible environment in which we, as a society, can live, work, grow up and grow old.</p> <p> We now have an opportunity to take a landmark leap in improving Ireland's air quality by taking the final step in removing dirty coal from our marketplace through the introduction of enhanced standards across the range of other fuels and a sensible and balanced approach to restricting the use of sod peat in urban areas while preserving traditional and local practices.  These measures are required to improve air quality and protect public health.  To reiterate, some 1,300 people are dying prematurely in Ireland due to air pollution from solid fuel burning and there are more than 16,200 life years lost as a result.  Thousands more experience a poor quality of life due to the associated short- and long-term health impacts of this form of pollution.  New regulations are a critical element of addressing this public health and environmental crisis and they will serve to improve the quality of the air we breathe and the health of the public we serve.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-05a.500" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1518" speakername="Michael McNamara" time="18:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022050500060#LLL00200"><p>I am sorry to be making my contribution after the Minister of State's wrap-up speech because there are a couple of points I would have liked him to address.  His colleague the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, in his introductory comments spoke about poor air quality in Ennis.  Of course, I share his concern regarding the very poor air quality there and the fact that it was over the legal limit for a considerable period this winter.  However, I invite the Minister of State or the Minister to come to Cloughlea with me next winter.  We will stand there and we will not hear the hum of air-to-water systems.  Instead, we will see, or might even smell, evidence of smoky coal being burned.  That is not because people in Cloughlea or Ennis or anywhere else in County Clare want to break the law.  It is not that they have a disregard for the environment and want to take the option that is more damaging to it.  It is because they do not have an alternative.</p>  <p>  Retrofitting schemes are being introduced but the constituency I represent is somewhat different from the one the Minister, Deputy Ryan, represents in terms of average disposable income and measures such as that.  I do not wish to personalise it in any way but Government Ministers speak about the amount of money they are making available for these retrofitting schemes and the amount of money a person can get back.  However, the amount a person has to invest up front in these schemes, which I support - I advocate those who can afford them to engage in them - is beyond the reach of a large and increasing number of people.</p>  <p>  I do not have a problem with the Government asking people to take more environmentally sustainable alternatives.  I have a problem with it not putting alternatives in place before it does so.  That, unfortunately, is what is happening.  I appreciate that it is a lot easier to ban something than it is to put an alternative in place.  Courts will give injunctions prohibiting people from doing something but they are very reluctant to give injunctions forcing people to do something because that is difficult to do and police.  For this branch of government, it is exactly the same.  It being difficult to do, however, is not a reason not to do it.  The Government simply has to put alternatives in place before people are penalised for not taking those alternatives.</p>  <p>  I wish to focus on another example of this, which is the abandonment of the second phase of the northern distributor road.  I recently had a meeting with the University of Limerick at which the president of the university spoke about how essential the strategic development of that area is to the future of the university, as well as that of counties Limerick and Clare and the entire mid-west.  She has no particular desire to see car traffic increase.  In fact, she wants to take cars out of the university campus and introduce more sustainable travel.  If the Minister does not want to have a road there, if there is an alternative being planned, that is great - let us hear about it and see what is being planned.  There is a railway that goes through Long Pavement and across to Parkway.  I suspect Deputy Leddin would be delighted to bring the Minister of State down to see it.  If that is not the case, I will do so.  I have heard no mention, however, of utilising that railway line and spurs off it to develop that bank of land on the Clare side of the University of Limerick campus or to remove the one-hour traffic jams through the University of Limerick and put a sustainable alternative in place.</p>  <p>  I do not disagree with the Government's analysis of the problems we need to tackle but I do not think we can do that by penalising people unless there is an alternative in place.  The Government is not sufficiently focused on putting such alternatives in place, be it in respect of sustainable travel around the University of Limerick campus or the area on the Clare side of it that it is hoped will become part of the campus.  If we are not going to have a road, let us have a new railway line, tramway or sustainable form of travel.  To say that there will be no road and the Government has no alternative, however, is simply short-sighted.  Telling people that the Government is going to ban coal but, realistically, it does not have an alternative they can afford - there is an alternative that Government Ministers can afford - is not going to achieve buy-in.  I do not disagree with the objectives of the Government but it is not going to achieve them in that way.</p>  <p>  I cannot put it any further.  I do not wish to disparage what the Government is seeking to achieve.  Smoky coal is banned in Ennis but there is a reason people continue to burn it.  It is because it is cheaper and provides more heat.  I refer to the idea that the Government is going to allow turf to be sold in certain areas with fewer than 500 people but not in other areas.  Public health is being cited.  Public health was the objective of many measures.  A differentiation such as that which has been proposed would be the &euro;9 meal of 2022.  The Government can tag on a public health label at the end of it but it is not going to achieve any reasonable objective.</p></speech>

They spoke about sod peat not being valuable for heat.  In case the Minister of State does not know - he might not come from a turf or bog area - the fact is that approximately &euro;600 heats one's house for the year.  There is no way one can do that with oil or anything else.  Turf is what people are able to use to heat their homes.  That needs clarification.</p>  <p>  All the talk about a legal challenge is a red herring, to be frank, because what the coal people will do is go to non-smoky coal.  They can bring that in, no problem.  This idea is being thrown out everywhere but the dog on the street knows what is really happening.  Reference was made to a problem in Ennis.  I heard about that problem when it was happening.  Does the Minister of State know what happened?  There were lorryloads of coal going to one part of the country and they ended up in Ennis.  The Minister of State's own Department knows that.  It is no big secret.  That is what happened with the smoky coal and the air pollution in Ennis.  We have to be upfront about it.</p>  <p>  As regards sod peat - we call it turf - this thing was brought out about wet peat.  People do not burn wet turf.  It will not burn, to put it simply.  It creates smoke but that is all one gets.  The Minister of State spoke about smoky fuels.  To get good quality turf, a person turns and foots it, brings it home and puts it in a shed to let it season.  To be frank, if the Minister of State knew anything about turf, he would know that there is no smoke from burning good quality turf that has been dried properly.  That is a fact.  Let no one say there is smoke from it.  There is no smoke from it.  If turf is not dried, then, just like with timber or any other product, there is smoke from it.</p> <p>It is basically about having a bit of common sense.</p> <p> The point has been thrown out about European agencies and about the number of people who are supposed to die in each country, allegedly, as a consequence of burning certain fuels.  Reference was made earlier to open fireplaces.  It is only the lofty people who can afford open fireplaces.  The ordinary people of rural Ireland have stoves and ranges and that is what some of them use to cook the dinner, as well as heating their houses with the back boiler.  A total of 97% to 98% of households that use turf have either a stove or range.  There is misinformation being put out about this.  We have had talk about the danger of air pollution.  The people who use turf have been using the same amount for the past 20 years.</p> <p> When we talk about air pollution, we need to talk about the diesel used by aeroplanes and at places like Dublin Port.  As Deputy Verona Murphy said, 14 million litres of diesel were used because a barrier does not go up.  We need to talk about smoky coal and diesel cars.  It is not a case of one size fits all.  If we drill down into the details, we can look at the percentage of people who burn turf and the percentage who burn it in urban areas.  If we are to go about quantifying lives lost, I would say the number would be three or four at most.  Again, we are not looking at the big fish.  Are we going to say smoking is good for you and people can smoke in our faces and we are not overly bothered about it?  Red herring stuff is being thrown about, which I do not like to see in any debate.</p> <p> We need to debate the topic properly and we need to make sure fuels are properly dried.  I agree with that, and I am the first to say it.  There is an opportunity for the Government in introducing regulations.  As I said earlier, the moisture level of peat briquettes is down by 15% or 16%.  A peat briquette and a sod of turf are made out of the same product.  It is as simple as that.  One is pressed and the other is dried naturally.  There is no reason we cannot ensure that they are comparable in terms of moisture levels.  I have said time and again that the Government does not need to use a sledgehammer to crack the nut.  All it has to do is the same as it has done with the regulations for timber and peat briquettes, which is to introduce a requirement to reduce moisture levels to 25% or less.  There is an opportunity when the regulations are coming in to ensure any products included in the distribution to large urban areas are brought under that requirement to ensure they are safe.</p> <p> Let us not be mixing up different issues.  I talk to coal merchants all the time and they say they can bring in the other type of coal once they move away from smoky coal.  There is a solution for them.  There is no big court case looming.  Instead of using a sledgehammer to crack the nut, there must be an opportunity for everybody instead of taking people's livelihood away from them.</p></speech>

It relates to what was known as the July provision and now has a new name, that is, the summer school programme for all primary schools.  I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this important matter.  Since I tabled it, the Department has published the guidelines, which is one of the issues I was going to raise.  I welcome that the guidelines have been issued.  I also welcome the sending of a letter to all principals.  I will come to the good points contained in the guidance but I have no idea why it has been issued so late in the year.  It creates huge problems for schools in terms of preparation, clarity and certainty.  Will the Minister of State give an explanation as to why it is so late in coming and an assurance this will not happen again?</p>  <p>  There are a number of positive elements outlined clearly in the guidelines and the letter to principals.  There are 11 bullet points setting out proposed improvements, including that an overseer may be appointed, a preparation time will be given and there will be an additional ten hours of paid time.  I want to highlight the positives.  There is a difficulty, however, regarding the undertaking in respect of additional pay for teachers and special needs assistants, SNAs.  I am not sure whether I am just being pedantic but there seems to be a difference in this regard between what is stated in the guidance and in the letter that went to principals.  The letter indicates that teachers and SNAs working on the programme will receive an additional week's pay for each week of the programme based on their personal rate of pay.  On page 15 of the guidelines, the position on payment rates is not so clear.  It states that overseers, teachers and SNAs who work on the programme will be paid for this work based on what they are normally paid during the year, that is, their personal rate.  The letter suggests there will be a doubling of that rate.  Will the Minister of State clarify this?  I welcome the other points set out, including that the application form will be simplified, there will be flexibility and so on.</p>  <p>  My difficulty relates to the core number of pupils in special schools and special classes who are being left out of the summer schools programme.  The Minister of State might disagree with me on this, so I will go into a little detail to explain my point.  The reason the July programme came about in the first place was not as a result of a proactive move by any Department or Government.  It came from a High Court action back in the late 1990s.  Arising from that ruling, the Department had to provide for a system that ensured children with complex special needs would not be deprived of an education for a long period during the summer, which was leading to such pupils regressing.  It was necessary to go to the High Court to get that basic recognition and out of that ruling came the July provision.  I understand a review of the provision has been under way since 2019.  Where is the outcome of that review?  It is very important that we see it.</p>  <p>  Some of the figures that have been pointed out to me in respect of the number of children in special schools and special classes who are not in a position to avail of the July provision because their schools are not providing it are truly shocking.  It is done on a voluntary basis and if schools do not opt in, there is no service.  Various people concerned with this issue have got the figures through freedom of information requests.  There should be no need to have to find out the information in this way.  A review of the July provision should be carried out each year and an analysis provided of the uptake, the feedback on how well it operated and, most importantly, why some pupils were not in a position to avail of it.  This would ensure the Department can learn from what is happening each year and that more certainty can be brought to bear on the issue.  I keep calling it the July provision even though the name has changed.</p></speech>

She is correct that this is a very important topic and I am delighted the Ceann Comhairle selected it for discussion.  I want to reiterate the importance and aims of the summer provision.  It builds confidence in children, supports pupils to re-engage with education, increases their motivation and promotes well-being.  For children at key transition stages, it helps to ensure they can move on to planned educational placements along with their peers in the coming September.</p>  <p>  Before I speak more generally about the summer provision, I will try to answer some of the Deputy's questions.  Regarding the timing, the announcement was made on 4 May, as she knows.  This is perhaps the earliest date in any year on which the details of the provision have been given.  The Deputy may be aware that I have set up a special education consultative forum, which met today with a variety of stakeholders to discuss issues pertaining to special education.</p>  <p>  The Deputy asked a related question about the review of the provision.</p>  <p>An inspectorate review of the summer provision was done last year.  That report was shared with stakeholders and was used to inform the summer programme.  We wanted to wait until that was completed.  Another one of the Deputy's questions was about the take-up of and participation in the summer provision.  Because all 4,000 schools are eligible for this summer provision, we want to encourage as many as possible to engage in it.  The Deputy outlined some of the incentives the Department has used to get schools to participate.  Some of that was based on the feedback we received from that review, including the funding, the preparation time, faster payments for the staff, etc.</p> <p> I think the Deputy also mentioned pay.  To clarify, it is a week's pay plus an extra week's pay for the staff.  Again, that is a strong incentive.  In fairness to the staff, the SNAs and the teachers have worked hard over recent years, during the pandemic and subsequently.  We do not want them to be exhausted but we do want them to avail of the summer provision work because we know how much it means to children and their parents.  That is why we are trying to incentivise them.</p> <p> We have also provided school transport.  We have special transport services.  If that service is not available, a grant will be given or the school can organise its own transport in order that we can get children to avail of it.</p> <p> There are five different elements to this.  We have the inclusion programme in primary schools, which lasts two to three weeks.  We have special classes and special school programmes.  We have DEIS as well.  Let us not forget that this is about disadvantaged children as well.  In addition, Ukrainian children will be able to avail of this programme for the very first time.  I think the schools are very excited to be able to offer this to Ukrainian children this year.</p> <p> Lastly, if you do not mind, Chair, there is enhanced funding-----</p></speech>

They are absolutely at their wits' end.  The take-up for the July provision is very low.  I do not have the time to go into the figures, but it is a very finite number of students who are in special classes and special schools.  It is not beyond our capability to provide the service for them for four weeks during the summer, but that is not happening.</p>  <p>  Let us look at the figures alone.  There are 8,108 children in special schools and 8,500, approximately, in special classes.  The number attending the July provision is minimal.  I have the figures in front of me.  I ask the Minister of State to recognise that and to let the parents feel they are being heard.  I know that the Department has set up a consultative forum, and I welcome that, but I asked the Minister of State about the review that was started in 2019.  Has it been completed?  Will it be published?  Is it available?</p>  <p>  The deficits have been pointed out by the people on the ground for whom July provision was set up.  They are losing out.  The Minister of State knows that, as does the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte.  They are absolutely at their wits' end from the time the schools close until they open.  They had to go to the High Court in the first place, and now the take-up of the service makes it impossible.  What the Department has stated in its guidelines and in the letter to the principal is that the children will be able to do this at home.  That is not possible.  They need to go out.  Summer camps and all the other things that are available to most children are not available to these children with complex special needs.  I know that personally and professionally from being on the ground, as I am sure everybody here does, so-----</p></speech>

I totally agree with the Deputy and am <i>ad idem</i>with her on one thing, which is that the families really need this service and need respite for their children to bring them on.  We gave some of this information to the Ombudsman for Children as well.  Some children with autism, for example, in special schools and special classes are no longer in those classes but in mainstream settings.  There are more children now in mainstream settings than there were in the past.  In those circumstances the provision of support is not about the location but about the level of need.  That is critical.  As I said, there are enhanced supports and enhanced funding for special schools.  Guidance has gone to schools.  It was based on engagement with management bodies and unions, and states that the schools should prioritise those with the most complex needs.  That guidance from the Department to schools has been very clear, and schools can take on as many students as they have the capacity to take on.  There is no difficulty with that.  That is really important.</p><p>The inspectorate did a review which has fed into this year as well.  We never want to take away from one category to the other.  As I said, this is based on need, not location.  We have lots of statistics.  There has been a 64% increase in special schools and special classes from 2019 to 2021, so we are making progress.  We used the feedback this year in order that we could make it a more streamlined process and make it as attractive as we possibly could.  We have doubled the funding from &euro;20 million to &euro;40 million, a 100% increase, to try to get schools to participate voluntarily in this scheme for the benefit of the parents and the children.</p></speech>

Currently, respite services for both adults and children are provided in Annalee View, a respite centre in Cootehill, County Cavan.  However, because adults and children cannot be facilitated together, the services are provided on alternating weeks, that is, adults one week and children the next.  It is not sufficient to deal with the large number of people who require respite services throughout the two counties, so there is a need for at least two centres.  Two in each county would be brilliant.  I acknowledge that Steadfast House, in Carrickmacross, provides respite as well, but there is demand for its other services.</p>  <p>  What plans are there to expand the existing level of respite in both counties?  When Annalee View was closed for repair some years ago, for quite some time, for a while no respite services were offered at all.  Then Killygowan respite service was opened.  At full capacity it could facilitate only five people.  I think during Covid that number was reduced to two.  Again, it operated on an alternating basis, with children one week and adults the next.  When Annalee View was reopened, why was it not designated for children, say, and the other centre, Killygowan House, kept open for adults?  So many individuals are refused respite due to the increasing numbers of individuals seeking to avail of the services.  Some have been informed that the service does not cater for those with mild or moderate intellectual disabilities.  All individuals with intellectual disabilities should be entitled to respite care if they feel they need it.</p>  <p>  In a reply to a recent parliamentary question it was indicated to me that there are plans to provide separate centres for children and adults in CHO 1.  A submission is being made for funding to support those plans.  However, the reply did not answer the question I asked, which was specifically about Cavan and Monaghan.  It gave the information for just the CHO area in general.  I want to know specifically what plans there are to provide additional respite services in those two counties and how far along those proposed services are.</p>  <p>  I receive many queries about respite services from families, and they are at the end of their tether.  These are families who have children sometimes with disabilities that are quite complex.  They were in receipt of respite services before Covid, but that has not been resumed, or certainly not to the extent that they were receiving it prior to March 2020.</p> <p>Many families need a break so that they can perhaps do some other activity with other children in the family or they just need some time for themselves.  Children with complex disabilities might need a break from the family home too.  Respite should be arranged in conjunction with the child to ensure that not only is the child properly and well cared for, but that he or she is interested in the activities provided in order that respite is enjoyable and the child looks forward to maybe going back and repeating it a few weeks later or whatever.</p> <p> I am also contacted regularly by aged parents who may have adult children with disabilities living with them.  They should be living independently but often they are on the local authority housing waiting list for houses for up to ten years and no supports are being put in.  There were moves, and that is improving, but we still have a situation where there are adult children with some complex disabilities living at home with aged parents and they both need a break - the adult needs a break from the home situation and the parents need a break.</p> <p> To repeat my questions, are what plans are there to expand existing services in Cavan and Monaghan and what is the timeframe for the expansion?</p></speech>

When I did the budget in 2021, because of the cost involved my ambition was that I would provide one respite house in each community health organisation, CHO, around the country.  We all know that each CHO could have multiple numbers of counties.  In 2022, that went to ten houses, to 11 and to 12.  I have enough funding for another respite house in each CHO again but this time I have built on it.  What I have built on it this time is three complex needs ones - two for medical complex needs and one to do with Prader&ndash;Willi syndrome, which is costing &euro;600,000.</p>  <p>  The idea here is to put a respite house into every single county.  By the time I leave Government or no longer hold ministerial office, my legacy will be that I will have built in respite houses.  I believe that we need to create capacity.  The capacity is needed.  We understand clearly from Covid one of the issues was that parents of children and adults could not access respite and in order for us to ensure that relationships last for as long as possible, we need to give the parent the night's sleep and give them regular respite.  Then, guess what?  We can keep family connectivity for the better.</p>  <p>  I met the Deputy when I visited Monaghan at the request of Deputies Niamh Smyth and Brendan Smith, and where I also met Senator Gallagher, the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, and Senator Joe O'Reilly.  I was informed by the local CHO in Cavan that the disability services provide respite for adults and children in Annalee View Respite Centre, Cootehill, County Cavan, on alternative weeks.  To be honest with the Deputy, I was quite shocked to hear that.  I was quite shocked to hear that children and adults alternatively have only one house in the entire county to deliver respite.  It is not what I would deem a fair or equitable access to services.  One house in one county does not meet the needs by any manner or means.  When I visited the primary care centre, one of the ladies within the HSE progressing disability services spoke to me at length about that.  As I say, it is something that has to be prioritised.</p>  <p>  Respite services for adults in Cavan-Monaghan catchment area are provided from Steadfast House, Carrickmacross, County Monaghan.  The Annalee View facility had previously closed due to major repair works on-site.  Following the temporary closure of Annalee View and throughout the Covid pandemic, respite continued to be provided in a new location called Killygowan Respite Centre, Cavan.  Funding was allocated in 2020 to the community healthcare organisation of Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Monaghan and Sligo to develop respite services.  The 2020 funding is required to be allocated based on assessed respite service needs across the community health area.  This year Sligo and Leitrim area of the community healthcare area have been identified as the area in which respite service developments are required initially.</p>  <p>  The question Deputy Tully has asked me is, where the house going or what is happening in CHO 1?  I am telling the Deputy it is going to the Sligo-Leitrim area, not to Cavan-Monaghan.  To be honest with the Deputy, the Cavan-Monaghan situation only came to light when I was with Deputy Smyth two weeks ago.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-05a.536" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1513" speakername="Pauline Tully" time="18:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022050500063#OOO00300"><p>The house in Cootehill actually caters for Cavan and Monaghan - it is two counties.  I accept Steadfast House cater for some in Carrickmacross as well but for children in the two counties, it is Annalee View.</p>  <p>  The day the Minister of State refers to in Carrickmacross, I was talking to some of the people in the HSE as well.  I will not name the place they mentioned but they were talking about some of the settings that are now being decongregated.  Is there a possibility that some of those could be now turned into centres for respite?  They are not suited for long-term residential purposes for all the reasons that people are better in their community but I wonder whether that could be an option because I had a conversation with someone about that.  I thought that might have been something that was on the cards.  I can tell the Minister of State privately the place they mentioned as well.</p>  <p>  I want to raise another issue that has been raised with me about whether something can be done in the case where someone, who could have been waiting for weeks or months, is offered some respite but then an emergency cases arises and the respite care is cancelled at very short notice or even in the middle of the break the person may be having.  Emergencies will arise on a continuous basis.  A man I spoke to told me that he and his wife had hardly any breaks at all before their daughter was given respite for two nights.  They booked two nights away but on the second day, they received a telephone call telling them they would have to take their daughter out of respite because an emergency case had arisen.  It was heartbreaking because they never got away for a break.  Can something be done about that as well?</p>  <p>  For adults, I hope there might be less need for respite in the long term if we have more community settings with supported independent living provided.  We will always need it for children going forward.  At the moment, though, unfortunately, we have to focus on both.</p>  <p>  I thank the Minister of State for her response.</p></speech>

I will have a conversation outside of the House about what the Deputy is saying, but she is correct.  The structure and the design of the houses I have come across perhaps do not address the needs, the challenging behaviour needs or the emergency cases that I would normally have come across.  I saw a really good house design recently in Swords.  The Talbot Group is changed with the delivery of the care there.  I describe it as the house with two front doors.  One front door caters for four or five children who have mild to moderate needs and the other front door caters for children with more challenging behaviours.  At all stages, one part of the house will always function because we always cater to those with mild to moderate needs.  Then if there is a child who needs access, whether it is an emergency case or more challenging behaviour, he or she can access the house the other way.  It meets the HIQA, requirements.  It can be HIQA-approved.  We need to look at our designs and what we are purchasing or renovating.  What the Deputy has described in relation to the decongregated setting would be a large space.  Clearly, it was HIQA-approved in the past.  In fact, the changes and the alternations, and perhaps the capacity to be able to cater to the two front doors, could possibly be easily remedied to ensure that we could have quicker delivery without having to go out looking to see where we could find a house.  In this challenging market, if there was one there already that we have decongregated, I would be asking the CHO whether we can review that and look at it to see what costings would be involved to ensure we could create that capacity.  I am aware, from the nine houses that I delivered in the 2021 budget that I put in an extra 10,000 bed-nights for children and adults, which is significant.  By the time I put in place another 12 houses this year, the Deputy will be able to see the potential capacity I will have created to support families, to support the children and also the complex cases that sometimes get forgotten about.</p></speech>

After a three-year absence of a child psychologist, I am glad to say an appointment finally was made in August last.</p>  <p>  According to the Government's A Vision for Change document, a full complement of staff, were it to be had, would comprise one consultant psychologist, which Wexford has; and one doctor in training, which Wexford has not, although there is one non-consultant hospital doctor, NCHD.  There also would be two mental health nurses, which Wexford has; two clinical nurse specialists; and two clinical psychologists, of which Wexford has one.  There would be two social workers - Wexford has one agency social worker - and one occupational therapist, which Wexford has, as well as one speech and language therapist - it has a half-time speech and language therapist.  It would have one childcare worker - we have none - and two administrative staff, which we have.</p> <p>The referrals are being rejected at a rate of knots at CAMHS in Wexford.  Basically, Arden House has done no attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADHD, assessment since December 2021.  Some 46% of all referrals are for ADHD, according to the HSE's statistics, and not one has been carried out in Wexford for six months.  I have received numerous representations from GPs who have complained that they sit down with mental health patients, be they young children or adolescents, and they spend a long time filling in arduous forms, only to have them rejected by CAMHS.  The services are just not seeing them.  I then get representations from the families who make the same complaint.  What is happening is that these children end up some weeks later in the department of psychiatry, DOP, in Waterford, having tried to take their own lives.  They are referred back by the DOP to Arden House to be seen then.  That is just not good enough in any woman's or man's language.  Families are in despair that their children are being rejected even though they are being referred by their GP.  The worst-case scenario is they try to take their own lives before they are seen.<br/><br/>What has me here today?  Before I proceed to that, I want to quote the psychiatrist, Dr. Kieran Moore, who resigned his position in CAMHS three years ago because there were no support services, from a published article he wrote.  He is a consultant paediatric liaison psychiatrist.  Basically, he was saying the HSE does one thing well and that is hire managers.  The extract states:</p><blockquote>	According to its own website: &ldquo;the health service executive (&ldquo;H.S.E.&rdquo;) in Ireland provides health and social services to everyone living in Ireland&hellip;. young and old, in hospitals, health facilities and in communities.&rdquo;  The website also says: &ldquo;The H.S.E. is required under section 35 of the Health Act 2004 to have in place a code of governance.  Governance can be defined as the framework of rules, practices and policies by which an organisation can ensure accountability, fairness and transparency in an organisation&rsquo;s relationship with its stakeholders.<br /><br />Almost every employee working in the HSE is regulated externally.  However there is no external regulation of managers. </blockquote> <p>What has arisen today in Wexford is all over national media and social media.  A clinical nurse specialist with 30 years experience, and 14 years in CAMHS, is being moved from his position in Arden House to north County Wexford at a time the other clinical nurse specialist is going on maternity leave.  Both are being replaced by what is referred to as an acting clinical nurse with two years 'experience to take care of 170 families.  I have been inundated with the distressed families who are suffering at the hands of whoever made this decision.  I plead with the Minister.</p></speech>

With regard to the last point the Deputy made, she asked if I was aware of the crisis situation in CAMHS in south Wexford where a senior clinical nurse specialist is to be relocated to another unit, leaving Arden House, Wexford, with just one clinical nurse serving a 200-patient population.  The area director of nursing, who bears overall clinical and operational responsibility for mental health nursing governance, indicates that the rotation of staff at times is part and parcel of a strategic workforce.  It is part of efforts to build the capacity for the service and to support continuing professional development for the staff.  It is also part of keeping staff motivated and rejuvenated and is an integral part of ensuring high quality and innovative patient care.  A number of such rotations have occurred in the past.  This week, these rotations are taking place in respect of both adult mental health services and child and adolescent mental health services.</p>  <p>  With regard to the south Wexford CAMHS clinical nurse specialist, CNS, the HSE has indicated that the south Wexford CAMHS CNS is moving to north Wexford CAMHS and the north Wexford CAMHS CNS is moving to south Wexford CAMHS on 16 May next.  There is, therefore, no diminution of the nurse staff complement in Wexford CAMHS.  There will be two CNS posts at Arden House and two CNS posts at Arnold House for north Wexford CAMHS.  That is the situation as set out to me.</p>  <p>  The Deputy mentioned the multidisciplinary teams.  The teams are very important and it was very difficult to get that consultant psychologist into place.  It went on for a long time.  Since I took office a year and a half ago, we have spent a long time trying to make sure that the post was prioritised and expedited.  Thankfully, it has now been filled.  I note that the Deputy went through the team.  There are some gaps.  There are 73 CAMHS teams throughout the country.  As a result of what happened in Kerry CAMHS we are doing an audit of every team in the country.  The audit is in three parts.  One part, which is independent and outsourced, is to look at the composition of all 73 teams in Ireland, the gaps in the teams and to look at governance and whether they are operating to standard operating procedures.  I will have all that data available to me.</p>  <p>  We are doing another audit, which is also independent and is being carried out by one of the universities.  We are going to talk to the children, the parents and the families using CAMHS to see what their experience has been, if they were or were not able to access CAMHS and how they got on.  That is the second part.  The third part is the piece relating to the audit of potential over-prescribing, which happened in south Kerry.  That is a big body of work.</p>  <p>  The Deputy mentioned ADHD and said that 40% to 45% of presentations are ADHD.  The HSE was clear that it only wanted to audit ADHD presentations, but I was adamant from the start that it had to be a full audit that included self-harm, suicidal ideation, depression and anxiety.  In addition, the Mental Health Commission is doing a review in parallel with this, which I also welcome.</p></speech>

The HSE is just not fit for purpose.  The Minister of State mentioned that the HSE only wanted to audit the 46% that were ADHD.  It would be easy to audit them when it is not actually seeing them.  When CAMHS has not done an assessment for six months, what is it going to audit?  The next thing it will be telling the Minister of State is that it will not do one for 12 months and it will audit that year, when there is nothing to audit.</p>  <p>  The reality is that CAMHS in Wexford has had 28 anorexic patients, but we do not have a paediatric dietician.  I have persistently asked for a full-time equivalent to be placed in Wexford.  We got no more than a half-time post, but the position has not been filled.  How long will it take the HSE to stop looking at its model of employment?  CAMHS has been telling me for two years, and saying in writing, that it is following the model set down by the HSE.  We must apply on a critical skills basis for people outside the country.  Permit employees needs to be done today; it needed to be done yesterday.  The Minister of State is sick of hearing it, I am sick of hearing it and, most of all, the patients are sick of hearing it.</p>  <p>  When it comes to Wexford, I suppose what the Minister of State said with regard to rotation would make practical sense on some level, but not in this case.  I will explain why.  The man has been in Wexford for 30 years.  He made a written complaint about the consultant psychiatrist.  I am telling the Minister of State that now, and that is at the back of this.  I am glad to hear there is an audit, because this man will not be moving on 16 May.  We will be down a clinical nurse specialist either in the north or in CAMHS in Arden House.  He is not going anywhere; he is certainly not moving.  He did not ask to move and there is no need for him to move.  There are four clinical nurse specialists in the north.  There are only two in south Wexford and one is going on maternity leave.  She has ten years' experience.  Both are going to be replaced with the lesser clinical nurse, one who is acting with less than two years' experience.</p>  <p>  I do not mean to raise my voice to the Minister of State.  I know perfectly well that she and I have come through this together.  We are both learning, but I am learning very quickly because I have been getting the same letters for two years.  I cannot stick it anymore.  It is not good enough to be providing a service in name only.  We have to show the fruits.</p></speech>

That decision is taken by the local area director of nursing, who is fully entitled to do that.</p><p>I want to make a second point.</p> <p>Over the past two years, I secured an extra &euro;97 million for mental health.  It is the largest ever budget.  I will always be looking for more when I am in this post.  There are some positives out there.  As a result of the budget I secured last year, 55 new staff were hired in CAMHS throughout the country.  One of them is the psychologist we are speaking about.  A total of 45 people were hired for eating disorder teams.  A new eating disorder team is coming to CHO 5 this year.  It will be in place towards the end of the year.  I am building them-----</p></speech>

It is for adults first and then paediatrics.  I have to put 16 in place and I will have nine at the end of this year.  It is incremental.  It is the only way we can get the staff and that is what we are doing.</p>  <p>  It is important to point out that we know CAMHS is a specialist service for people under the age of 18 with moderate to severe mental health difficulties.  It is not for everyone.  Only 2% of young people will need the support of CAMHS.  Sometimes what happens is that young people are referred to CAMHS by their GP, their family or one of the NGOs but primary care is probably more suitable for them.  They are not always accepted.  They do not always meet the criteria for CAMHS.  This is a clinical decision I cannot interfere with.  It is a decision taken by clinicians to determine whether they can give the best support.  We have seen an exponential growth in eating disorders.  When the clinical programme was devised in 2016 and 2017 it expected 60 referrals.  Last year we had 504.  Capacity is being pushed and pushed.  I am trying to put the capacity back into it.</p></speech>

It is good to be here.  I also express my gratitude to the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, for coming to the Chamber and taking the issue.  Her dedication to following through consistently on this matter must be astounding many officials in the Department, I am sure.  They would probably like to see her being reshuffled to give themselves some respite.  That is probably a sad reflection of where the Department is at, unfortunately.</p>  <p>  The governance and safeguarding report into CHO 1 published by HIQA last Friday has confirmed many of the points I have been making on the handling of the Brandon case and the subsequent Brandon report in the public domain for past year and for the past six years through my interactions with HSE management.  Importantly, HIQA states in the report, and I have reiterated it many times throughout this saga, that no fault lay with the front-line staff in the centres and that safeguarding concerns were being responded to appropriately at that level.  It is important to reiterate this.  I know the Minister of State has done so at every opportunity and it is important for the staff and the residents.</p>  <p>  As HIQA acknowledges, the problems are in areas of communication, governance and oversight of safeguarding procedures, especially follow-up and sustaining positive change.  It points to this occurring at middle management, regional and national management levels.  The one point in the report I take issue with is HIQA's assertion that this was prevalent only in the Donegal area of CHO 1.  It highlights the Sligo area of CHO 1 as something of an exemplar.  If there are problems with the identification, reporting and escalation of incidents of a safeguarding nature in the CHO 1 area, then to my mind it is hard to come to the conclusion the report did, which is that it is only in Donegal.  I believe that if an in-depth audit was carried out nationwide, it would find similar systemic failures in management, reporting and oversight, and probably not just confined to disability services either.  The previous Topical Issue debate gave us an example of this.</p>  <p>  The problems all stem from a basic resource issue.  Front-line staff are being asked to do a job for which there is often no capacity.  Budgets are dictated from the top down and woe betide the local managers who would be brave enough to raise their hand and say that they cannot do the job with what they have been given.  It is an ingrained institutionalised attitude found in management across all levels.  It is not a public sector problem; it is a management problem.  The other major institutionalised attitude found in management is to admit nothing, bury the problems at all costs and save the company first.  Sadly, this is the way it works.  It is borne out of an arrogance at senior management level and filters down through the layers unspoken, where people know that to raise their head above the parapet will do their career prospects no good.  We only have to look at the performance of the Secretary General of the Minister of State's Department at committee this week to recognise it.  It was out of touch and privileged but typical of many at that level, unfortunately.  That is the problem we see across the board.  This problem can be seen in what has happened in the Brandon case and others. We can say it looks good as a performance at a committee meeting but when it feeds down through the programme to ground level then people get hurt.  These people are constantly neglected and it is a real problem.  I know the Minister of State is active and will try to sort it out and I pay tribute to her for it.  If it were not for her and the work she has done we would not have got this far.  I would have been shouting into a vacuum and not getting anywhere.  It is important that we raise this issue.</p></speech>

If memory serves me correctly, this is our fourth time to have a Topical Issue debate on this and it is normally on a Thursday night and it is normally No. 4.  In saying that, I thank Deputy Pringle for raising this important issue for discussion and his continued work and advocacy on such issues in Donegal.  I welcome the report by the chief inspector of social services in HIQA into the governance and safeguarding in HSE-designated centres for people with disabilities in Donegal.  I welcome the comprehensive nature of the report.  It provides clear, practical indications of areas for improvement.</p>  <p>  I read the Brandon report which was not made available to the general public.  I am still calling on the HSE to make it available.  What I have seen in numerous reports that have been published is mirrored in some of what is in the Brandon report.  The overview report is the outcome of a regular programme of unannounced inspections by the chief inspector in County Donegal.  Eighteen centres were visited in January, bringing the total number of centres inspected in the period from September 2021 to January 2022 to 27.  All 27 centres are operated by the HSE.</p>  <p>  The chief inspector's regulatory programme followed an escalation of inspectors' concerns about the HSE's governance and oversight of designated centres in Donegal.  The purpose of the programme was to assess the HSE's compliance with specific regulations under the Health Act 2007.  It is important to recognise that the report found that most residents lived in pleasant comfortable environments and that the centres were managed by experienced and knowledgeable persons in charge.  It is also important to recognise that when I travelled to Donegal last October and met family members, they were more than complimentary of the front-line staff.  They asked me to acknowledge this at all times, as the Deputy has done this evening.  However, the inspections found there was poor oversight arrangements in place in the HSE in Donegal.  I wish I could say I was surprised by this but unfortunately some of these issues mirror those outlined in the Brandon report and other HIQA reports from the county.</p>  <p>  While substantially compliant with one of the three regulations inspected, the HSE, as service provider, failed to comply with two of the regulations, as has been reported to the Minister for Health.  We both received a letter late last year from the CEO of HIQA detailing the agency's serious concerns regarding safeguarding in Donegal.  The concerns raised in the letter are echoed in most of the recent HIQA reports.  This is a concern for me.  Ultimately I, as the Minister of State, need to be assured that services are operating to the highest standards for service users and that families can be reassured their loved ones are being cared for appropriately and their trust in the health service is not damaged.</p>  <p>  I took particular note that HIQA states its inspectors found the supervision and governance of centres by middle management and senior management was poor.  It is clear from the HIQA report that the HSE can be too reactive to issues instead of being proactive.  It does not appear to be a CHO-wide deficit as HIQA notes that in Sligo similar incidents do not occur.  It is quite clear that safeguarding arrangements need to be strengthened to ensure any issues that arise are identified, escalated and responded to quickly.</p> <p>A compliance plan has been submitted to HIQA by the HSE outlining plans to address the governance gaps identified by the chief inspector and improve overall safety.  I know HIQA's chief inspector has commenced an inspection programme of individual centres that will take place over the course of 2022 to verify the implementation by the HSE improvement plan.</p></speech>

I echo her calls for the HSE to publish the Brandon report even at this late stage.  Its constant excuses as to why it cannot publish it do not stand up at this stage and do not wash at all.  I think everybody knows that.  The HSE probably knows it but will never admit it.</p>  <p>  While this HIQA report is good, HIQA is not in the clear itself.  It has been compliant to a large extent with what has gone on in Donegal over the years.  I am glad to see it has come out now and is doing its job.  I hope this continues because it is vitally important.  The one thing that needs to be said and cannot be said often enough is that this is not a Donegal issue.  It is an issue for the national body.  It says in the report that it goes right up to national management.  One of the things that struck me as we were approaching the publication of the report was that what happened in Donegal was supposedly not being covered by management in Dublin but then all of a sudden when it went to Dublin, everything changed.  We must get to the bottom of what actually happened.  I am loath to think that this would be contained to Donegal because we have seen this in the past.  The Minister of State will probably remember the Morris tribunal regarding what was happening in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The response from officialdom at that time was that it was confined to Donegal and that it was only a Donegal issue.  To our cost, we saw that it did not just happen in Donegal.  We must make sure that this is not the case in the future.  National management must be addressed.</p></speech>

If one of the reasons why the Brandon report was not published was industrial relations or human resources issues because of the identification of a particular layer in HSE management, well HIQA has done it now.</p>  <p>  The chief inspector has indicated that there is an inspection programme in the CHO to verify the implementation of the HSE improvement plan and to confirm where the actions taken by the HSE are effective in delivering safer and better quality support.  I am also working with officials in the Department of Health and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth to develop some form of review or oversight of safeguarding in Donegal.  I have been open about my belief that this needs to be led by an expert, independent person specialising in social care and safeguarding who is independent of the HSE and HIQA.  My ask is that the powers that be in the HSE and HIQA work with this independent person or group or be part of the team but it will be led by an independent expert where they can share the findings of whatever reports I cannot publish.</p>  <p>  Not too long ago, Deputy Connolly stood behind Deputy Pringle and listed all the reports done on Donegal since 2015 and 2016.  By pulling all those reports together, the terms of reference can be identified.  Yet again, it would be wonderful to have the co-operation of the HSE and HIQA in terms of working with me to review safeguarding and reassure families with loved ones in centres in Donegal that not only are their loved ones receiving the best possible care but that if an issue is identified, the front-line staff working there will be supported when they identify an issue and will know how to identify issues and patterns.  For far too long, we have adopted the medical model when it comes to institutionalised care.  We need to look at the social care model, stop calling issues episodes and start understanding where that pattern came from and how to support staff but most importantly, the service user in the centre.</p>  <p>  Work is underway and I hope that with the co-operation of the Minister for Health and the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, this will be expedited.  We hope to have a framework by June.</p></speech>
