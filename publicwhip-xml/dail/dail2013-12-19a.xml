While I am always slow to accept early signals on overall statistics in this area, it is clear that there will be a significant rise in the number of deaths on the roads over the course of the year, which is of deep concern to all of us.  We have had a good process in this House of a joint approach by the Opposition and the Government, which also applied when the Minister's party was in opposition.  We want to work with the Minister to try to ensure we can reverse the trend.</p></reply>

This compares to 487 for the full year of 2012.</p><p>  The increase in this year's figures is of great concern.  It is the first reversal of the downward trend of recent years.  As the Deputy will know, the number of fatalities for 2012, at 162, was the lowest annual figure recorded since records began.  There is no clear reason for the increase or evidence that it represents a trend.  I met recently all of the bodies and agencies with responsibility for road safety, including the Garda and the Road Safety Authority, RSA, to ensure all necessary measures were identified and taken to reverse this year's situation and improve safety on the roads.</p><p>  Earlier this year I launched the road safety strategy 2013-20.  It contains 144 actions to be implemented by the various agencies involved to build on the previous strategies with the objective of improving safety, sustainably on the roads and making Ireland among the safest countries for road safety.  I am also in the process of bringing through the Oireachtas the Road Traffic (No. 2) Bill 2013 which contains measures that will contribute to the road safety improvements.  The new strategy was developed by the RSA, the principal role of which is the promotion of road safety.  I am satisfied that the RSA receives all of the necessary resources and assistance it requires from my Department in carrying out its functions.</p><p>  At this time of year I appeal particularly to all road users to be extra careful and vigilant for the remainder of the year and into 2014.  All of us who use the road have a responsibility of care to ourselves and those with whom we share the road.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-12-19a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/976" speakername="Timmy Dooley" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013121900003#A00400"><p>To be clear, I do not believe there is any issue with the strategy or the body of legislation in place.  I can only look to the words of the Minister's expert, the chairman of the Road Safety Authority, Gay Byrne, who recently stated reducing the number of deaths on Irish roads was &quot;unravelling before our eyes.&quot;  In an interview with the <i>Irish Independent</i> on 12 December he blamed the increase in the number of deaths on the roads on the decline in funding to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and creeping complacency among road users.  He labelled 2013 as a &quot;bad year&quot; in recognition of the figures the Minister outlined.  I put it to the Minister that the chairman of the Road Safety Authority is saying there is a serious issue in this regard which he is attributing to the lack of enforcement by the Garda.  Garda&iacute; will say they are doing the best they can with the resources available to them.  Is it time for the Minister to enter more intensive discussions with the Minister for Justice and Equality to ensure the necessary resources will be provided for the Garda to allow us to reverse the trend?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-12-19a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/948" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013121900003#A00500"><p>I am very concerned about the increase in the number of road deaths this year, which is up by over 20 on this time last year.  We do not know what the final figures for the year will be.  It is still a possibility that it will have been the second safest year since records began, but we do not know this for sure.  Interestingly, the number of road deaths is up, but the number of serious injuries is down.  It is up in all regions, but it is significantly down in the west, for example.  The figure for motorcyclists is up, but it is down for other road users.  It is difficult to see any clear trend in the numbers.</p><p>  The question relates to the resources of the Road Safety Authority.  It has extensive resources.  It also has significant capital reserves that it can dip into if it needs to do so.  I do not necessarily believe there is a direct correlation between the level of Garda resources and road safety.  For example, Garda traffic corps resources peaked in 2010 when over 200 people died on the roads.  I do not believe, therefore, that there is a direct correlation, but I am keen to see greater enforcement.  I always makes this point in any interaction I have with the Commissioner or the Minister for Justice and Equality.</p></speech>

Has the Minister had one-to-one discussions with Mr. Byrne recently?  Did he have an opportunity to discuss his deep concerns with him?  I recognise that the Minister is concerned, rightly so - we are all concerned - but in trying to find a solution or some path towards reducing the number of deaths on the roads has he had direct discussions with Mr. Byrne?  Has he shared with him his belief there is no direct correlation between the level of Garda resources and the number of deaths on the roads and, if so, what was his response?</p></speech>

We did discuss the issue of Garda resources and enforcement.  We are both of the view that greater enforcement would be desirable, but we both accept that garda&iacute; are under pressure in terms of resources.  We did not discuss anything in terms of a direct correlation, but I am putting the fact on the table that in 2010 there were many more traffic corps garda&iacute; and that the number of deaths on the roads was much higher.</p></speech>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-12-19a.17.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/981" speakername="Sandra McLellan" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013121900003#A00900"><p>The role of sport in Irish society is very important and somewhat undervalued.  For example, the cost of detaining one young person in Oberstown is &euro;278,000 per year.  On the other hand, when the Football Association of Ireland ran the late night street leagues, the number of call-outs decreased by 49% and the cost was a mere &euro;15,000.  The 7% cut in funding for the Sports Council is an almighty blow which will deal a further blow to the key bodies in this area.  Does the Minister believe it will set back development of sport in Ireland?</p></reply>

The range of sports involved demonstrates the depth and breadth of sporting talent in Ireland.  The performance of Irish athletes internationally both boosts the morale of the country itself and promotes our image internationally, as well as drawing tourists to Ireland from around the world.  The funding also supports the work of the national governing bodies of sport in increasing participation rates and a wide range of programmes delivered through the local sports partnerships.</p><p> I wish to ensure that all people are encouraged and given opportunities to participate in sport and to enjoy all the benefits that sport can bring through developing a healthy lifestyle, which in turn can produce an economic dividend through reducing costs to the health sector.  I am glad to note that adult participation levels are continuing to increase, as can be seen from the latest data available from the Irish Sports Monitor 2013 half-year report.  The report shows a continuation of that trend with active participation in sport increasing from 45% to 47% since 2011.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-12-19a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/981" speakername="Sandra McLellan" time="09:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013121900004#B00200"><p>I thank the Minister of State for his response.  While I welcome that it will not be a cut of 7% but will be reduced to 3%, it nevertheless still is a cut.  There has been a clear link, for which there is evidence from all over the world, between investment and success in sport.  While I grant this should not be the only metric by which one measures the value of sport, there can be no denying how victories, such as that of Robert Heffernan, have been great in lifting the nation.  However, such successes require funding that possibly will be hit by the aforementioned cut to funding.  Paddy Barnes, Ireland's two-time Olympic medalist, has stated that without more money, Irish boxing is going nowhere.  He stated:<blockquote>It&rsquo;s the Sports Council&rsquo;s fault because they need to put money into the IABA in order for them to put boxing out there... It&rsquo;s the best sport in Ireland but with the budget we get, we can&rsquo;t even afford to send the girls away to the World Championships. [That is a huge issue.] ... We're training in a 1970s gym more or less and everything has to be modernised... We need the money.  Without the money, boxing is going to stay the same as it is.</blockquote>The money of the Irish Amateur Boxing Association, IABA, is limited because the money available to the Irish Sports Council is limited.  How does the Minister of State intend to ensure that high performance programmes, such as the boxing programme, will not struggle but will continue to support key athletes?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-12-19a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1074" speakername="Michael Ring" time="09:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013121900004#B00300"><p>The Deputy mentioned Paddy Barnes, who is turning professional, and I wish him the best of luck.  Moreover, I hope he does as well as a professional boxer as he did with the Irish Sports Council, because he has received a substantial amount of money from taxpayers.  Moreover, if there is one organisation that cannot complain about the current Government, it is the boxing body.  When I came into office in 2011, the Government allocated &euro;1.2 million to make sure facilities could be upgraded nationwide.  This year, boxing received an additional &euro;1 million, apart from the money it receives from the Irish Sports Council.  Consequently, boxing is a sport the Government has supported very well.  I reiterate that I wish Paddy Barnes the best of luck and in a few years time, we will see whether he is better off than he was with the Irish Sports Council.  I know of people in many parts of this country who turned professional but I am unsure how well they do.  Nevertheless, I wish him the very best of luck.  He did this country proud and we were delighted with him.</p><p>  In response to the question the Deputy asked, the allocation to the Irish Sports Council has been cut by 3% but the overall funding to sport has been increased this year.  While one organisation may not have got what it sought, I will provide the Deputy with a few examples.  The Government has put &euro;23 million into the sports capital programme, &euro;10.3 million into the local authority swimming pool programme and &euro;15.9 million into the National Sports Campus, as well as &euro;1.74 million in current expenditure.  Moreover, the Irish Sports Council will receive &euro;42,496,000.  Overall, the total amounts to &euro;93 million, which is the greatest amount of money that has gone into sport.  These are difficult economic times and yet the Government has done very well to protect sports funding.  While I of course do not like to see any cuts in respect of sport, I always tell my colleagues in government-----</p></speech>

I wish to ask a supplementary question on the issue of rates.  Both the Aviva Stadium and Croke Park received rates bills that were five times larger than last year, with rates for the Aviva Stadium rising from &euro;437,000 to &euro;2.36 million and those for Croke Park rising from &euro;528,000 to &euro;2.112 million.  This issue affects the Gaelic Athletic Association, GAA, the Irish Rugby Football Union, IRFU, and the Football Association of Ireland, FAI, key bodies which involve tens of thousands of people throughout Ireland.  These increases will amount to &euro;3.5 million, which is a reduction of more than 50% of the funding these organisations received from the Irish Sports Council last year.  This will affect the quality of front-line services these bodies provide in respect of training and programmes.  Did the Department take into account the significant increases in rates, for which the IRFU, GAA and FAI would be liable when deciding on the cut to the Irish Sports Council?  It certainly should have done.</p></speech>

To be fair to them, they accept they are obliged to pay rates because they are competing with hotels in Dublin by hosting functions and events.  While they must of course pay rates, negotiations are taking place between the organisations and the local authority on the amount of rates payable and I believe some deals have been done.  However, I reiterate the three bodies in question will admit they must pay rates because they are in business.  They host functions and are in competition with hotels and bars, which are obliged to pay rates.  As businesses must pay rates, the sporting organisations accept they must pay rates but the amount they must pay is a matter for Dublin City Council.  Discussions are under way in this regard but I reiterate these bodies are in business and are competing with the private sector.  I might add they are doing very well, as I have attended many events, functions and dinners in both the Aviva Stadium and Croke Park.  As the private sector must pay rates, so too must the sporting organisations but I agree with the Deputy.  Negotiations are under way and some deals have been done with Dublin City Council.  However, I reiterate that while the funding provided by the Department this year to the national governing bodies and to the Irish Sports Council has been reduced by 3%, the overall budget has been increased and I am pleased with that.</p></speech>

His terms of reference were first to examine the Irish Sports Council&rsquo;s procedures with regard to conflicts of interests on the part of members of the council and to assess whether these meet the requirements of good corporate governance and second, to make such recommendations regarding improved corporate governance in the Irish Sports Council as may arise from the examination.</p><p>  Recently, I received Mr. Turpin's report and having considered it, I have referred it to the chairman and chief executive of the Sports Council in order that their observations can be taken into account before I finalise my views on what actions need to be taken on foot of the report.  Most of the recommendations are addressed to them, rather than to me or the Department.  I intend to publish the report in the new year, as well as my response to its recommendations.  I expect the appropriate recommendations to be adopted and implemented by the Sports Council and by its successor organisation, Sport Ireland.  The heads of the sport Ireland Bill, which provides for the establishment of Sport Ireland to replace the Irish Sports Council and the National Sports Campus Development Authority, are currently being finalised and will be ready for submission to the Government in January.  I will consider if there is a need to incorporate the recommendations into this legislation at that time.</p></speech>

Does he intend to publish this report as soon as the observations of the individuals concerned have been taken into account?  Second, did the terms of reference include reviewing the process by which the original investigation, which appears to have been <i>ultra vires</i>, was undertaken?  In addition, did the Sports Council seek the Minister's advice or direction before it entered into the process that ultimately was found to be illegal and in breach of the rights of the individual concerned?</p></speech>

I will publish the report once I have to hand the views of the chairman and the chief executive officer.  I anticipate so doing in the new year, that is, in January or February.  It did not look into the circumstances surrounding the investigation to which the Deputy referred because the court was clear that the Sports Council was acting <i>ultra vires</i> in carrying out such an investigation.  As for that investigation itself, I was informed by the chairman of the Irish Sports Council at the time that he intended to carry out such an investigation but neither my advice nor my approval was specifically sought.</p><p>I was certainly aware that was planned before it began.</p></speech>

The recommendations in the report I had commissioned mostly relate to the Irish Sports Council.  Two relate to my Department: one on the issuing of letters when somebody is appointed to the Irish Sports Council very clearly setting out his or her role; and the second relating to the communications between my Department and the Irish Sports Council.  Both of those recommendations will be accepted and implemented.</p><p>  I find it very inappropriate and a conflict of interest for anyone, who works for an NGB or is associated with an NGB, to participate in Irish Sports Council discussions and deliberations regarding the NGB of which he or she is a staff member or to which he or she is connected.  That makes common sense to anyone.  A person who sits on a board that is debating grant allocations to the body of which he or she is an employee or member, should certainly not receive the papers and so on.  All of that is in the report.</p></speech>

The airline continues to compete well as an independent airline and is due to start a number of important new direct services in 2014, including to San Francisco and Toronto.</p><p>  In 2012 the Government included its shareholding in Aer Lingus among the possible assets to be sold under the State asset-disposal programme, but agreed that the stake would only be sold when market conditions were favourable and if acceptable terms and an acceptable price could be secured.  However, circumstances favourable to a sale did not arise during the period of the EU-IMF support programme.  The Government remains willing to sell its stake, but I consider it unlikely that a buyer willing to offer the right price and accept appropriate conditions will emerge in the near term.  The ongoing pension deficit issue and legal challenges to the EU and UK regulatory authority decisions on Ryanair's stake create uncertainties for any potential buyer.</p><p>  The Government will continue to manage its shareholding actively, with the aim of maximising the value of the shareholding, securing dividends and encouraging new routes and additional capacity where commercially viable.  The shareholding gives the Government an important say in any proposal to dispose of Aer Lingus's valuable slot portfolio at Heathrow Airport and gives the Government the right to nominate up to three directors on the board.</p></speech>

In essence he is saying he would love to deal with it and is actively looking, but circumstances are not right at the moment to dispose of the final shareholding in this valuable State asset.  Obviously ideologically I do not agree with that in any case and not just from the point of view of the market conditions.  This was and is a key employer for thousands of people, providing a good and viable service.  Over its lifetime it has served the taxpayer well and severing any links would be incredibly shortsighted.</p><p>  The Minister referred to a number of key issues and I ask him to enlighten us, particularly on the pension issue.  The Minister will be aware that Aer Lingus management even threatened taking legal action against SIPTU for having the cheek even to organise a ballot when the union had assured management there was no question of any strike before Christmas or anything like that because of the stalemate that has been reached in the critical pension negotiations.  Has the Minister been in touch with the company on that?  Has he expressed his dissatisfaction that the management of a company in which the Government has a sizeable shareholding would behave like that towards its workforce?  Has he encouraged it to engage somewhat more given the importance of that issue to the workers and also to the future of the company?</p></speech>

When Aer Lingus was fully State-owned it was heavily loss making.  Now under majority private ownership, with 75% owned privately, it is a success story.  It is one of a few airlines in Europe that makes money.  It is profitable, efficient and pays a dividend to the State.  In my view that is proof positive that the privatisation of Aer Lingus was a success story for passengers and taxpayers.</p><p>  The pension fund is a multi-employer pension fund involving DAA, SRT and Aer Lingus, which makes the whole thing very complicated.  As with many pension funds, the problem is actually quite simple.  Over a long period of time neither the members nor the company paid enough money into the pension fund to deliver the benefits that were promised or expected.  The only solution that can ever arise to a problem such as this is for the members to accept fewer benefits than they had anticipated and for both companies to put more money into the pension fund.  That is the finding of the Labour Court and one I have endorsed.</p></speech>

First, the problem with the pension situation was not, as he identified, one of simply not paying enough.  In fact it was demonstrably poor management decisions facilitating early retirements and voluntary severance schemes over a long period of time putting strain on the scheme as well as outsourcing direct labour resulting in fewer members joining the scheme that caused the problem.  The bottom line is that the company is inadequately standing up to its responsibilities in that regard.  Instead of telling pensioners, deferred pensioners and active members of that scheme that they have to take a hit on that, the Minister might be better off telling Aer Lingus management to rein it in a bit and stop threatening and bullying its staff through use of the courts and other means.</p><p>  With regard to the history of Aer Lingus, the airline experienced losses but it was entirely profitable pre-privatisation.  Many changes had already been made and it was an incredibly viable company with substantial cash assets on its books at the time of privatisation.  The Minister's assertion that it was privatisation that turned this company around is ill informed.  Over its lifetime the company has been an incredibly successful Irish venture with a great service and an overwhelming net contributor to the Exchequer over its lifetime, and providing relatively decent, secure and up to now pensionable employment.</p></speech>

I have asked questions about whether expenses wrongly claimed by a company director that were supposed to be paid back ever were paid back.

It is statutorily independent of the Government and not in receipt of any State funding.  My Department is in regular contact with the company.  Neither my Department nor I is aware of any significant unexplained additional payment or expense, due to be returned, to executives and board members in DLHC.  As the Deputy will be aware, there is an outstanding matter in relation to the return of travel expenses paid to a former director in 2010 and 2011.  The company has taken legal action to recover the amount outstanding.  For this reason, it is not appropriate that I comment further on this matter.</p><p>  In all dealings I have had with D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour Company, as with all of the port companies within my Department's remit, I have placed considerable emphasis on my policy that it meet the highest standards of good governance.  This was reiterated in the national ports policy which I published in March 2013.</p><p>  D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour Company has confirmed to my Department that there have been no salary increases for DLHC management since 2008.  The company also advises that no bonuses have been awarded since 2009.  The company&rsquo;s annual accounts which are laid before the Oireachtas and made publically available each year disclose the fees and expenses claimed by the directors of DLHC.  The company has stated all expenses are rigorously audited by the internal auditor on a quarterly basis and that a full annual audit is undertaken by the company's external auditor.</p><p>  I am due to receive the 2013 unaudited annual accounts which cover the full calendar year of 2013 from the company by the end of February 2014.

My Department wrote to the chairperson, whose term has ended, stating that we did not accept this payment of &euro;19,877 and that it should not have been made.  When a new chairman is appointed this matter will be taken up with the new chairperson and resolved.</blockquote>That is what the Minister said at the time.  When will the question in relation to this unexplained approximately payment of &euro;20,000 to the CEO be answered?  The CEO of this small semi-State company is paid a salary of &euro;136,000 per annum, a car allowance of &euro;20,000 per annum and board fees of &euro;12,000 per annum.  As I understand it, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, ruled out by order last year the payment of board fees to executives.  Is the payment of board fees to the CEO which is no longer permitted being looked into?  This is all happening against the background of staff members being laid off, pay cuts of between 30% and 40% being sought by the company, major bullying and intimidation of staff and a crisis in the company's pension fund.  It has been suggested that while the employees' pension fund is in trouble, the gold plated pension fund for the executives is not.  I would welcome a response from the Minister on these issues.</p></speech>

It is a matter that would have to be raised with the company and the trustees.  On the issue of board fees, the CEO does not receive such fees.  In regard to the payment of approximately &euro;20,000 referred to by the Deputy, that payment related to 2011 and was made in lieu of untaken leave of 38 days.  I have corresponded extensively on this matter with the chairperson who is of the view that this will not happen again.  The reality is that the CEO had 38 days untaken leave, in respect of which he was paid.  The alternative would have been to allow him to take 38 days leave at the end of his term.</p></speech>

Will it be repaid?  The Central Remedial Clinic scandal of top-up payments which were in breach of the cap and which rightly caused uproar is under investigation by the HSE because it is a body that is within the remit of the State.  Should this not apply to all semi-State companies, including a small company such as D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour Company, the CEO of which is on a salary of &euro;136,000 per annum, which is more than a Minister is paid, a car allowance of &euro;20,000 per annum and who has also been paid an unexplained additional &euro;20,000?  The Minister can correct me if I am wrong, but as I understand it, payment in lieu of untaken leave is not permitted in the public sector.  The payment of &euro;20,000 equates to 38 days leave.  No one working in the public sector has 38 days leave per annum.  To boot, staff at DLHC have told me the CEO did take holiday leave that year.  This is strange stuff and there are a series of questions that need to be answered.  The Government needs to take a more hands on approach to ensure we know the remuneration, including bonuses, being paid to top executives of the HSE and other public bodies within the remit of the State who are paid with public money in order that we know whether they are creaming it, while ordinary employees are being shafted.</p></speech>

It does not receive any public money and is not part of the public sector.  As such, comparisons with the CRC are invalid.  The issue raised by the Deputy relates to 2011, the year in which I took up office.  As I understand it, the CEO was paid for 38 days untaken leave.  The chairman has confirmed that this practice will not continue.  Whatever about the amount paid, if any other employee had untaken leave, he or she would demand that they be allowed to take it or be paid in lieu of it.</p></speech>

The derogation expired on 31 October 2013.</p><p>  There is already an abnormal load permit scheme in place operated by the local authorities which allows vehicles that exceed statutory dimensions to operate in exceptional circumstances.  The abnormal load permit scheme is not meant as an alternative to complying with existing vehicular mass and dimensions legislative requirements.  Any attempt to undermine the intent of the scheme would result in those operators who are compliant with vehicle heights legislation being at a competitive disadvantage, while those that do not comply would benefit.  On a broader point, it would send the message that regulations set in transport matters are not serious and subject to change on foot of last minute lobbying.  This would incentivise non-compliance.  This would only serves to create greater confusion in the industry in the long term and make investment decisions within the transport industry much riskier.</p></reply>

Is he aware, as I know his colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ring is, of a company in County Mayo, McHale, which produces balers?  Because that company produces bales that are 6 in. bigger than the standard 4 ft bale, it is not possible because of transport rules for it to transport three rows of bales from the south east to the west.  There is no tunnel restriction on this route.  If this rule continues to apply, McHale's will not be used by people in that part of the country because it will not be able to transport the bales across country.  Will the Minister, in the context of this and the live export issue, review the rules and introduce a point-to-point system for these categories?</p></speech>

It is not a case of whether it is applied - it has been the law for several weeks now and I assume that it is being applied.  I am not aware of the company that the Deputy specifically mentioned, but I am aware of other companies that say they can carry bales three-high in their vehicles because they have a lower trailer and have adjusted the wheels and tyres accordingly.  They have complied with the legislation and can load bales three-high.  There is an interesting letter in the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i> from a company in Carlow specifying that it can do that because it did comply with legislation and was prepared to do so.</p><p>  The reason for this is not tunnels.  Most of these vehicles do not go through tunnels and there are only three tunnels anyway. The reason is bridge strikes of which there have been 1,200 in recent years.  Only two weeks ago, trains to and from Galway were stopped for an hour because a vehicle hit a bridge.  Only last week, we had a bridge strike in Clontarf.  Anytime a large vehicle hits a bridge, trains have to be stopped and Irish Rail has to investigate to ensure it is safe.</p></speech>

I ask the Minister to do one thing which, if possible, would assist everyone in this situation.  Currently, if someone is transporting something that is oversized, let us say from Rosslare to Ballinasloe, one must go through seven local authorities and obtain seven separate permits.  Can a streamlined application system be put in place, with a uniform fee, whereby one permit could be obtained for all the relevant local authorities?</p><p>  For example, one can get an annual licence to go through County Offaly for &euro;300, but the same licence in County Waterford would cost &euro;117,000.  There is a major inconsistency in that regard.  At the very least, the Minister should examine this matter and replicate the UK's uniform application system which is far more effective.</p></speech>

I can see the Deputy's point that it is onerous if somebody with an abnormal load must go to seven or eight local authorities to obtain permits, particularly if the rules are different in each local authority.  It is important to bear in mind, however, that the abnormal load permit scheme is in place for very large, wide or unusual exceptions, such as a wind turbine or generator.  The scheme is not something that should be used for regular loads.</p></speech>

These teams, staffed by volunteers, are called upon to operate in all weather conditions and provide a hugely important service.  As we approach the end of 2013, I want to thank them and all our volunteer rescue teams for the amazing work they do.</p><p>  My Department, through the Irish Coast Guard, administers an annual grant scheme to Mountain Rescue Ireland, the umbrella organisation for mountain rescue teams on the island of Ireland.  However, it is important to recognise that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have responsibility for the co-ordination of mountain rescue teams under the framework for major emergency management.  The Garda fall under the remit of the Department for Justice and Equality.</p><p>  In administering this grant, my Department meets Mountain Rescue Ireland and relevant statutory bodies each year to review grant requests in accordance with a framework agreed some years ago.  The grants paid to individual teams reflect the level of operations and expenditure of the teams.  It is a matter for individual teams to decide how it is spent, as each team at local level develops its own administrative and operational practices.</p><p>  In the year to date, some &euro;186,000 has been paid in grant assistance to Mountain Rescue Ireland and its constituent teams.  I am pleased to say that it has been possible to retain the grant at this level over the past few years.  I will do so again in 2014.  Mountain Rescue Ireland, as an all-island organisation, also avails of additional supports in Northern Ireland.</p><p>  I am open to considering the introduction of a capital grant scheme, as proposed by the Deputy, and will ask my officials to engage with Mountain Rescue Ireland on the issues involved.</p></reply>

I recognise the current expenditure provided by the Department of Transport, which includes &euro;7,400 to the Galway mountain rescue teams.  I also acknowledge the Department's promotion of the hiking and walking sector which is growing.  Volunteer rescue teams play an important role in this regard.</p><p>  Current expenditure is hugely important but so is capital expenditure.  I welcome the Minister's statement that he is open to the introduction of a modest capital scheme and that he will ask his officials to engage with Mountain Rescue Ireland.  Other Departments, such as the Department of Health, have access to such funding.  For example, the Galway Centre for Independent Living received &euro;50,000 for a replacement mini-bus.  I wonder if the Minister can get his hands on similar funding for mountain rescue schemes.</p></speech>

In 2007, there was a funding scheme to support national organisations in the community and voluntary sector.  There are one or two other schemes which have an arrangement with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  I do not quite know the details of that, but there are some other things they can already apply for.  However, what I have in mind, and what the Deputy is suggesting, is to allow for a certain number of minor capital grants from my Department, probably for equipment more than anything else.  That money can be spent quite quickly.  I will ask my officials to engage with such groups to see if we can do that for 2014.</p></speech>

This is a welcome project and I commend F&aacute;ilte Ireland for the preparatory work it has carried out on identifying the route and bringing it to its current status.  It offers great potential for tourism right across the country, including the potential to attract visitors to County Donegal.  It is important to use Malin Head as the starting point of the Wild Atlantic Way to attract more tourists not only to the northern part of County Donegal but to the county as a whole, thus giving it a particular identity.  I ask the Minister of State to give a commitment to doing so.</p></reply>

Budget 2014 included a specific provision of &euro;8 million to support capital expenditure associated with the Wild Atlantic Way.  The overall aim of the project is to develop a route that will achieve greater visibility for the west coast of Ireland in overseas tourist markets.</p><p>  During the second half of 2012, F&aacute;ilte Ireland together with all the local authorities along the west coast, and also the Leader companies, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and the Western Development Commission, examined a range of route options for the Wild Atlantic Way.  In November 2012, F&aacute;ilte Ireland published a route identification report, detailing a preferred route which had been identified, and sought the views of stakeholders during a month-long consultation process.</p><p>  F&aacute;ilte Ireland also held a series of seminars in every county along the west coast, to seek the views of tourism businesses and communities in relation to the preferred route.  Malin Head formed part of the Wild Atlantic Way route from the outset.  The northern start point for the route begins at Derry, where it joins the Northern Ireland causeway coastal route.</p><p>  The development of the Wild Atlantic Way is an operational matter for F&aacute;ilte Ireland, and I do not have a role in designating any particular location on the route.  However, selecting Malin Head as the natural start or end point of the Wild Atlantic Way would have excluded the north east of the Inishowen Peninsula and the western side of Lough Foyle from the route, which would not be beneficial to the tourism sector in the areas concerned.</p></reply>

It would actually help to attract tourists to the peninsula.  There is great potential for developing Malin Head as a destination in the county.  A great deal of tourism work has been done in the county recently.  For example, there has been investment in the Slieve League cliffs, where tourist numbers have increased markedly in the past two or three years.  However, we will miss out on an opportunity if we do not make Malin Head the starting point of the Wild Atlantic Way.  While linking it to the causeway coastal route makes sense, in that they must work together, setting a starting point to the Wild Atlantic Way that is simply a point on the Border represents a missed opportunity.</p></speech>

Remember the Good Friday Agreement.</p><p>  Second, F&aacute;ilte Ireland has told me that the Deputy's proposal would cut off the east of Inishowen, which would be disastrous.  Perhaps he should discuss the matter with F&aacute;ilte Ireland, as he seems to have misunderstood the route.  I hope he is not telling me that we should not have cross-Border initiatives with Derry, but perhaps we could set up a meeting with someone from F&aacute;ilte Ireland to discuss the matter with him.</p></speech>

Perhaps the Minister of State might also attend it.  I have met and exchanged correspondence with F&aacute;ilte Ireland regarding this issue.  I am raising the matter on the floor of the D&aacute;il to engage the Department.</p><p>  The Minister of State's approach is to ensure that the route works well.  His bona fides are good in that regard.  However, there has been a missed opportunity.  We must reconsider the issue, as making Malin Head the main starting point provides a great deal of potential.  In no way would it disadvantage any part of Inishowen or Donegal.  Rather, it would enhance the overall tourism potential of the Wild Atlantic Way.</p></speech>

It has told me that his proposal would exclude the east part of the Inishowen Peninsula, which I am sure he does not want.</p><p>  I do not want arguments to develop about the Wild Atlantic Way.  It is the country's greatest initiative.  It will be like the Green Way in Mayo, in that people will be talking about it for the next 30 years.  I want everyone in Inishowen, Donegal and the west and north coasts to buy into it.  This will be a great initiative for the coastline.  I was delighted that we were able to secure &euro;8 million in funding for the way in the recent budget.  We have advertised it all over the world.  People are excited about it.  We want people in Inishowen, Mayo, Sligo and Donegal to promote and explain it to tourists.  This great opportunity should not be lost.</p></speech>

The awarding of subsequent contracts is a matter for the NTA.  On 5 December and in accordance with the provisions of the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008, the NTA announced that up to 10% of publicly subvented PSO bus services would be tendered out, with the new services commencing in the summer of 2016.  Tendered services are due to commence in August of that year.</p><p>  There are a number of trade union concerns about potential tendering for PSO services.  These include the impact on industrial relations and cost savings measures within CIE at a general level and the specific implications of transfer of undertakings legislation, TUPE, and related issues.  However, it must be recognised that the proposals outlined in the consultation process are relatively modest and there will be a long lead in before any tendering takes effect.  Furthermore, it is of course open to the two incumbent companies to compete for any tendered route.  Sometimes, this point is lost.  It should not be assumed that there will be any reduction in staff numbers or that TUPE will even arise.</p><p>  Following the announcement by the NTA on 5 December, these issues need to be addressed by it and the bus companies through constructive engagement with the unions in the course of the procurement process over the next two years.  Following a meeting in recent weeks that the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, and I attended with all of the trade unions involved, including SIPTU and the NBRU, the chairman of the NTA has been asked to carry out such a structured engagement.</p><p>  The winning tenderer will be required to deliver a specified service under which the timetables, fares and standards of service will be set down by the NTA.  There will be no cherry-picking.  The State, in the form of the NTA, will be determining frequency and routes of these services.  The intention is that a better service can be procured for the same PSO subvention that is currently provided or that the same service can be provided for a lesser cost to the taxpayer.</p><p>  Regarding the Irish Rail market, the European Commission announced a package of proposals last January aimed at delivering better quality and more choice in railway services across Europe.  Among the proposals is the opening of domestic rail passenger markets from 2019 onwards.  The package also contains a proposal that would lead to all PSO contracts being awarded by means of a competitive tender process from December 2019.  The discussions on these latest proposals have not yet commenced.  The proposals are being scrutinised by my Department and the approach to be taken will have regard to the views of interested parties.  As the House will be aware, Ireland has specific rail issues, given the fact that we are surrounded by water.</p></reply>

Shortly after the privatisation of British Rail, British Government subsidies increased from &pound;1 billion in 1980 to &pound;6 billion in 2006.  Likewise, the privatisation of bus services saw similar consequences, with bus fares increasing by 40% within eight years.  Tendering on a route-by-route basis meant that there was no integration of services and the number of operators increased drastically.</p><p>  Does the Minister of State not agree that, if certain routes are privatised, the providers will be geared towards making money rather than creating a service?  Is this the way we should be going?</p></speech>

This is opening up for tendering, not direct privatisation <i>per se</i>.  This week, I met Dublin Bus and spoke with the chief executive of Bus &Eacute;ireann.  I will speak with the chief executive of Irish Rail today.</p><p>  The Deputy is right about the mixed results in other countries that underwent full privatisation of services.  How the process is managed is the important issue.  This is a modest opening up of the market, up to 10%.  Basically, it involves orbital routes in Dublin's commuter areas and some routes in Waterford city.  This is the decision of the NTA.</p><p>The way in which the service is managed will be crucial.  It is the National Transport Authority that will dictate and decide the service level, routes and frequency of services.  It will not be decided by the company that has been successful in the tender process.  That is critical and something about which we are adamant.</p></speech>

That is his job.  He has taken a decision to begin the process of privatisation.  As a member of the Labour Party, he is responsible for that act.  I do not care how he minces his words about opening up for tendering and in referring to the role of the National Transport Authority.  It is a Government decision.  The NTA is an independent agency, but when it comes to a significant policy shift such as this, the decision must be taken at Cabinet level.  Fine Gael&rsquo;s ideology has always involved the privatisation of the public transport system.  It is a decision with which I fundamentally disagree.  I agree with Deputy Mick Wallace that the privatisation of London Bus and the rail system ultimately cost the state a hell of a lot more money in an effort to get people to go back and utilise the services.  What happened was that as the companies drove to gain more profits for themselves, services deteriorated and the good work done during the years in achieving the modal shift of moving people out of their cars and onto public transport was reversed.  That is my concern about what will happen in this country.</p></speech>

By international standards, public transport services are weak, while rail services have been allowed to disintegrate.  If one lives in the countryside, the bus service leaves too much to be desired.  Most people have to have a car in order to get from A to B.  Rather than follow in the footsteps of other Governments, would the responsible Ministers not be tempted to leave their mark and do something serious in terms of investing in public transport in a major way?  What is being done is further watering down public transport services by putting some of them out to tender.  It would be positive if the Minister were to put a serious effort into improving public transport in Ireland, which is something that has not happened in a long time.</p></speech>

The PSO subsidy is in place.  Will savings accrue from it?  As far as I can see, that seems to be one of the issues involved.  Will it lead to a reduction in passenger numbers?  A significant effort has been put into Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann to increase passenger numbers and put a proper public system in place.  That has been working.  Will there be an analysis of the impact that it will have on communities?  How does one assess various routes that help people who are affected by a disability or who have bus passes?

On Deputy Mick Wallace&rsquo;s generic question, given the financial and other constraints on the Department, a considerable amount has been achieved.  Like me, the Deputy represents a rural area.  Rural transport sevices have been completely upgraded.  An entire new structure is in the process of being delivered which will further integrate public transport services.  The previous Administration wanted to get rid of them under the McCarthy report.  Previously, rural transport services were not joined up with other public transport services.  That issue is being addressed.  For the first time, the school bus service is being integrated with public transport services.  School buses travel in and out of towns and through villages and previously could not pick up anyone on the way back, even though fuel was being used and people were paid.  A recent change means that they are now allowed to pick up other passengers.  The first service to be provided is in Waterford and a new rural hackney licence will commence this week.  I urge every Deputy to promote it because it is something that has universally been welcomed.  Much work has gone into co-ordinating the services.  It takes time, but I made a commitment to do it.</p><p>  Deputy Dessie Ellis failed to acknowledge an important fact - the National Transport Authority will decide the routes and frequency of services.  Whoever wins the competition will not decide.  The NTA will decide on the service delivered to ensure the people mentioned by the Deputy, whom we wish to protect, will still have the services they require.  That is a critical point which many people do not seem to get.  The NTA will decide the routes, service levels and frequency of services for the company that wins.</p></speech>

The tier 1 ports are also designated as core ports in the trans European network - transport, TEN-T, thus making them eligible to apply for EU funding under TEN-T and the connecting Europe facility, CEF.  There is no State funding for port infrastructural development as it could be illegal under state aid rules, nor is there any capital funding available within the port or Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann for reopening the Limerick to Foynes railway line owing to budgetary constraints.</p><p>  A number of studies have been carried out by Shannon Foynes Port Company of necessary jetty improvement works and future development.  These proposals are outlined in the port's 30 year master plan, Vision 2041, which I launched last February.</p><p>  The railway line between Limerick and Shannon-Foynes port is being maintained on a care and retention basis.  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann states it needs investment in the order of &euro;10 million to reopen it for traffic.  That can only happen if it is clear that sufficient volumes of freight will be transported on it and on foot of private sector investment.  Meetings took place in 2012 between the SFPC, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and a number of potential line users.</p><p>  The TEN-T executive agency provides funding towards the cost of studies and projects under the TEN-T programme.  In November 2012 it launched a call for funding proposals which closed in February 2013.  The European Commission makes the final decision on applications.</p><p>  The SFPC submitted an application in February 2013 relating to preliminary works for the rail line reinstatement and certain jetty improvements.</p><p>My Department endorsed the application and a ministerial letter of support was included with the application.  The project is costed at almost &euro;13 million and the funding sought amounted to nearly &euro;1.3 million.  However, the application was not successful.</p><p> Shannon Foynes Port Company has since met with the Trans-European Transport Network executive agency, TENT-T, and the Commission to clarify any shortcomings in the project application.  I understand the company intends to reapply for funding under the next round expected later in 2014.  It is my intention to again issue a letter of support.</p><p> I also met with Siim Kallas, European Commissioner for Transport and the TEN-T agency on 5 December 2013 where I reiterated the Government&rsquo;s support for several of Ireland's TEN-T CEF, Connecting Europe Facility, projects.</p></speech>

Given there are three ports of tier 1 status, Dublin, Cork and Shannon Foynes, will he accept the latter is the one with the greatest disadvantages in connectivity?  Given its strategic importance on the west coast, along with its proximity to Moneypoint, Tarbert and Aughinish Island, there is a need for an overall plan for infrastructural connectivity to be developed.  I know the Minister travelled the N69 recently from Limerick to Foynes and will be aware of the poor road quality and the number of towns it passes through.  It takes a long time for hauliers and other port users to travel on the road and the traffic levels do have an impact on local communities.</p><p>  What avenues are the Department, the National Roads Authority, NRA, and the Rail Procurement Agency, RPA, looking at with private equity to deliver improved road and rail infrastructure for the port?  It is probably the best positioned port in the country with its shelter, depth and location.  No other port can accommodate the size of vessels it can.  However, it seems to be hamstrung by its road and rail connectivity.</p></speech>

Within that, there are three tier 1 ports, Dublin, Cork and Shannon Foynes.  All of them have their challenges.  Dublin Port is a great port but it is in the middle of a city and its main channel needs to be deepened.  Cork needs improved road access to Ringaskiddy.  Shannon Foynes has challenges as the N69 provides substandard access to a port of its kind.</p><p>  I see the potential for enormous growth in Shannon Foynes in the coming years.  It is a deep-water and bulk port, meaning it can carry much cargo.  However, it will need the existing road upgraded or a new road connection.  The railway to the port can be reopened if there is sufficient business to justify doing so.  The key step on that point is to secure the European funding.  I am working with the port company in achieving that.</p></speech>

There has never been an opportunity before to see a port of this importance connected by rail into the national rail infrastructure.

Limerick County Council has gone out to tender for reports on upgrades to the N69 and Adare bypass.  These will help us make a decision in this regard.  Connecting the port to the national network is not just a political priority but also a European regulatory priority because of the TEN-T CEF project.</p><p>  I am enthusiastic about the reopening of the rail connection at the port and am open to considering any potential investors.  The key point, however, that creates market concern is that it is not yet clear what cargo would run on the railway if it were reopened.  No one wants to spend &euro;10 million reopening a railway for it not to be used.  There would need to be more certainty about what bulk would be going into and out of the port on the railway.</p></speech>

It is quite incredible that in the week the Government is boasting of having seen the back of the troika and supposedly regaining our economic sovereignty that it is bringing in this new draconian measure putting taxes on our people at the behest of the same troika.  This Bill is the preparation for the privatisation of our water supplies down the road, handing them over to large multinational companies.

Bh&iacute; tuairim&iacute; ag gach taobh den Teach agus d'&eacute;isteamar leo, agus t&aacute;imid ag d&iacute;ri&uacute; ar cuid de na ruda&iacute; a d&uacute;ireadh ag an am sin.</p><p>  This Bill is the second legislative milestone in the Government's strategy for the reform of water services provision in Ireland.  The Water Services Act 2013, enacted last March, provided for the establishment of Uisce &Eacute;ireann as a subsidiary of Bord G&aacute;is under the Companies Acts.  This Bill represents fulfilment of our programme for Government commitments to introduce a fair funding model to deliver clean and reliable water, to establish a new State-owned utility to take responsibility for water infrastructure, and to advance our commitment to implement a charging system based on usage above a free allowance and a programme of water metering of all households.  International evidence clearly indicates that the metering programme will help reduce leakage and demand, cutting production by at least 15%.  That statistic is found in all the relevant literature.</p><p>  The challenges facing Ireland's water sector are not unique.  Water demand is rising, with supply becoming less secure.  Our water bodies need greater protection.  By 2030, the world is expected to need 40% more water than will be available.  We are distinct from most countries by the level of freshwater we have available.  We must turn this to our advantage by creating a world class water sector that can continue to attract water-intensive industries such as ICT and pharmaceutical and chemical industries to Ireland, as water stress becomes increasingly common elsewhere.  By 2030, our river basin management plans will have been reviewed a further three times and the quality of our water bodies will have further improved.  Environmental and economic regulation of water services must be inter-linked.  This Bill plans for the future.</p><p>  We are advancing a reform programme based on three pillars: the establishment of a public utility, Irish Water; the creation of a more sustainable funding model based on usage, including domestic charges, and the utility's access to commercial lending; and independent, economic regulation of the sector by the Commission for Economic Regulation.  The delivery of water services and new infrastructure through Irish Water, working with the local authorities, which have provided water and wastewater services with great care and dedication for over 100 years, will involve a new partnership.  It will be a partnership combining the local authorities' expertise in assets management and operations with the considerable network and utility management experience within the Bord G&aacute;is group through the service level agreements which this Bill provides for.  The establishment of a new and sustainable funding model will help to secure the level of investment required to upgrade, repair and expand our public water and wastewater infrastructure.  Increased investment, as well as securing supply and protecting our water bodies, will provide thousands of additional jobs, adding to the 1,600 jobs which are being created by the investment in the domestic metering programme.</p><p>  The Government's objective in creating the sector's new funding model is very clear; the domestic charges element will be based on fairness.  The OECD has stated that metered charges are the fairest form of water charges.  The Government agrees.  We will provide a free allowance, as well as supports for those willing to pay but unable to do so, and for those with high water usage necessitated by medical conditions.</p><p>  Independent, economic regulation of water services is critically important if we are to ensure that all water customers are protected and that the new utility delivers value for money.  I am confident that the Commission for Energy Regulation, with its reputation for independence and rigorous oversight of utilities, will protect the interests of domestic and non-domestic customers.  Its scrutiny of Irish Water's budgets and capital plans, and determination of water tariffs, will ensure that water services are cost effective and efficiently delivered.  The EPA has a proven track record of environmental regulation and its role in the oversight of Irish Water will mark continuity with its existing role in monitoring and maintaining water quality.</p><p>  I would also like to address the impact of the reforms on the local authority sector and in particular, on local authority employees.  Given the scale and complexity of change involved in this reform process, engagement with staff and their trade unions has been critically important and the Irish Water consultative group, which was put in place to facilitate this interaction, has played a vital role in moving the reform process forward and also in helping to shape key aspects of this Bill.  It is also important to acknowledge the significant achievements of the local authorities and their dedicated staff in the delivery of water services, often in very challenging circumstances.  The structures we are proposing to introduce with this Bill will ensure that their experience, expertise and knowledge will be at the heart of the new water services model.</p><p>  Irish Water and each local authority will be entering into a service level agreement.  The Bill provides that the initial agreement will be of 12 years duration, and once the first agreement comes to a conclusion, the option of entering into subsequent agreements is also provided for.  Where it is decided not to enter into a subsequent agreement, the Bill provides for the transfer of staff involved in the delivery of the service level agreement from the local authority to Irish Water.</p><p>  I would like to address briefly the reports of a special meeting of Dublin City Council which took place earlier this week.  First, it is important to acknowledge the prominent role the city council has played, in collaboration with the other councils, in providing quality water services to the greater Dublin region.  This has been critical in supporting the development of the region as a place in which to live, invest and work.  It was reported at the meeting this week that the city council would be left with substantial pension liabilities arising from the establishment of Irish Water and the transfer of water services infrastructure.  I want to put on the record of the House that this is not the case.</p><p>  Local authorities operate a public sector defined benefit &quot;pay as you go&quot; pension scheme, so as pension liabilities fall due at the point of retirement, payments are made from annual current expenditure and contributions made by staff.  The water services employees that currently work in local authorities have accrued pension entitlements already and these would be a future liability of the authorities if things remained the same.</p><p>  This Bill provides that the payment of accrued pension benefits to local authority staff who transfer to Irish Water, either now or following the termination of a service level agreement, will not be imposed on the county and city councils.  The service level agreements will provide for the payment by Irish Water of existing water services pensioners for the duration of the agreements. I want to confirm that the County and City Managers Association, which has been centrally involved in the oversight of the reform programme, has also been given very clear commitments by the Department.  These commitments address any other pension liabilities in respect of water services employees who, on the termination of a service level agreement, opt to remain in employment with a council rather than transfer to Irish Water.</p><p>It was also reported that valuable water service assets would be transferred to Irish Water without compensation to councils.  This is an unbalanced presentation of the situation.  There has been very substantial Exchequer capital investment in water infrastructure.  The Bill provides that Irish Water and the water services infrastructure will remain in public ownership; therefore, it is transferring from one publicly owned authority to another.  The Bill also provides that liabilities and loans associated with infrastructure that is transferred will also be taken on by Irish Water.</p><p> Part 1 of the Bill, comprising sections 1 to 4, inclusive, deals with standard provisions in primary legislation regarding the Title of the Bill, commencement provisions, expenses incurred by the Minister in the administration of the legislation and the definitions of terms used in the Bill.  Part 2 provides for the transfer of functions, property and staff.  </p><p> Section 6 provides that transfer day may be appointed by order by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  Section 7 provides for the transfer of functions conferred by the Water Services Act 2007 to Irish Water on transfer day provided for in section 6.  It also provides that water service functions in Parts 4A and 6 of the Water Services Act 2007 will not transfer to Uisce &Eacute;ireann.</p><p> Section 8 provides Uisce &Eacute;ireann with the power to charge non-domestic customers with effect from transfer day on the same basis the local authorities had charged these non-domestic customers before that day.  This section will have effect only up to the date of commencement of section 16 which requires Uisce &Eacute;ireann to charge customers in accordance with the water charges plan which will be subject to the approval of the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER.  The section effectively provides for the roll-over of the non-domestic water charges levied by the local authorities until such time as the CER approves Uisce &Eacute;ireann's charges next year.</p><p> Section 9 provides that the provisions of section 29 of the Water Services Act 2007 shall apply to Uisce &Eacute;ireann.  This section confers immunity on Irish Water and its employees from prosecutions arising from carrying out their functions under the Bill.  </p><p> Section 10 provides that the local authorities will continue to have powers which transfer to Uisce &Eacute;ireann under section 7 which are necessary for the performance of local authority functions under the 2007 Act.  These functions relate to septic tanks and rural water services.  </p><p> Section 11 provides that actions of a water services authority which commenced before transfer day but which are not completed may be carried on and completed by Uisce &Eacute;ireann, where this action relates to a function transferred under section 7.  This would include matters such as planning applications or environmental impact assessments, EIAs.</p><p> Section 12 provides for the transfer of the property of the water service authorities to Uisce &Eacute;ireann on a designated property vesting day or days.  These transfers will be facilitated through ministerial orders.  Property will include assets such as land, buildings, water services infrastructure, vehicles, pipes, sewers and moneys.  A provision is included for the Minister to request any information required from a local authority to enable him to decide on the making of a transfer order.  </p><p> Section 13 provides for the transfer of rights and certain liabilities, associated with the property transferred under section 12, from the water service authorities to Uisce &Eacute;ireann.  Examples of the rights and liabilities referred to would be leases, licences and wayleaves.</p><p> Section 14 provides for the transfer of other liabilities of a water services authority to Uisce &Eacute;ireann.  Liabilities transferred under this section shall be designated in a ministerial order.  </p><p> Section 15, a Government amendment in Seanad &Eacute;ireann, provides for the transfer of liabilities for losses before transfer day.  Liabilities arising in respect of civil liabilities or the recovery of damages will not be transferred.  </p><p> Sections 16 to 18, inclusive, were Government amendments approved by Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  They provide for the transfer of licences, certificates, authorisations and permits, including, <i>inter alia</i>, water pollution licences, foreshore licences and wastewater discharge authorisations.</p><p> Section 19 provides for the transfer of staff from local authorities to Uisce &Eacute;ireann.  Such transfers would take place following consultations between each individual local authority and Uisce &Eacute;ireann.  This section will apply only to local authority staff involved in the delivery of water services as part of an SLA made between the local authority and Uisce &Eacute;ireann under section 31 and will be applied only following the termination of such an agreement.  </p><p> Part 3 deals with water charges.  Section 21 provides that Uisce &Eacute;ireann shall charge each customer in receipt of water services.  The charges to be levied by it shall be calculated in accordance with a water charges plan as set out in section 22.  Uisce &Eacute;ireann will be prohibited from cutting off a water supply to a dwelling arising from non-payment of water charges.  Irish Water will be empowered to disconnect a non-domestic user where water charges remain unpaid and it will also have the power to reduce the supply of water to all customers where charges remain unpaid.  The power to disconnect a customer from a water supply or reduce a water supply to a customer will be subject to the approval of the water charges plan under section 22.  The section provides that charges will not apply for water supplied to a fire authority for the performance of its functions.  It also provides that for the purpose of charging, the owner of a premises will be presumed to be the occupier of that premises unless it is proved to the contrary.</p><p> Section 22 provides that Uisce &Eacute;ireann is to prepare a water charges plan setting out the manner and method for the water charges to be applied under section 21.  This water charges plan must be submitted to the CER by Uisce &Eacute;ireann and the CER will have the power to approve or reject the plan.  The plan will contain the charges to apply where the charges are based on the quantity of water as measured by a meter or where the charges are assessed based on a formula to be set out in the plan.  The plan must specify the charges to apply to different classes of customer and the different methods of payment for customers.  Uisce &Eacute;ireann will, in common with other utility service providers, put in a place a wide range of payment methods and options to facilitate its customers.  The section provides that water charges will apply to water supplied to a premises and wastewater discharged from a premises.  Unless agreed otherwise between Irish Water and a customer, the amount of wastewater discharged from a premises will be deemed to be equal to the amount of water supplied to the premises.  An example of the households that this approach would need to differentiate would be those in receipt of a water supply from Irish Water but which are discharging wastewater to their own septic tanks or similar systems.</p><p> Section 23 provides that Irish Water may enter into agreements with a customer for charges for the provision water services that are different from the water charges provided for under section 21.  Such agreements which will require the approval of the CER would typically apply to large industrial and commercial customers.  </p><p> Part 4 of the Bill deals with provisions relating to the governance of Uisce &Eacute;ireann and related matters.  Section 25 provides that Uisce &Eacute;ireann shall take the necessary steps to amend its memorandum and articles of association to ensure they are consistent with the Bill.  The Water Services Act 2013 set out conditions in relation to the memorandum and articles of association of Irish Water and provided that they be approved by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, with the consent of relevant Ministers.  The 2013 Act and this Bill provide that any alteration to the memorandum and articles of association requires prior ministerial approval and consent.</p><p> A copy of this speech has been circulated and if any issue arises in the debate, I will stand over it.</p></speech>

It is wholly inappropriate, disrespectful, arrogant and nothing short of shameful.  </p><p>  Like everyone else present, I welcomed the country's exit from the bailout programme last week.  I join others in paying tribute to the people who accepted the unfortunate but necessary corrections to the public finances in the past few years.  When I looked at the Taoiseach last Sunday night, I thought of how he had vehemently opposed and voted against measures contained in some budgets that were progressive rather than regressive, yet he sought to take credit for the manner in which they had been implemented and the success they had brought.  We have exited the bailout programme; Fine Gael has enjoyed success in recent polls and we are in the mouth of Christmas.  The Government believes it can do no wrong, to such an extent that it can seek to bring forward this legislation and treat the D&aacute;il and its Members with such contempt that in four or five hours it will bring through this massive legislation that has great significance for the economy.</p><p> This is a major piece of legislation that has huge significance for the taxpayer, local authorities, householders, business and industry.  Despite this and despite seeing households around the country being hit with water charges, the Government now sees the taxpayer forking out untold sums of money to fund the super quango Irish Water is fast becoming.  In the lifetime of this D&aacute;il, few pieces of legislation have been as significant as this.  However, instead of providing time for a constructive debate on the details of the Bill, the Government, led by the caring Taoiseach we saw the other night who thanked the people so sincerely and spoke about all the new charges and initiatives his Government and others had placed on them in order to arrive at the juncture at which we have found ourselves in recent weeks, is now, a couple of days later, putting this Bill before the House.</p><p> Despite the fact this Bill is of such significance and will have such a bearing on various aspects of the workings of the economy, it is treated with this sort of contempt.  Where is the sincerity in that?  Where is the caring nature of the Government now?  Where is the Government and its leader who thanked the people for the manner in which they had accepted many of the policies that had to be implemented?  The Government now wants to ram this Bill down the throats of Deputies and to provide no time for an adequate opportunity for real and informative scrutiny.  </p><p> The Government has talked blandly about political reform, but it has done nothing only abuse that terminology.  Take, for example, its efforts to abolish the Seanad and its passing of legislation last week to abolish town councils and to cull councillors.  Now again, we see this Bill being pushed through the House, another example of the record level of guillotining of legislation.  This does nothing only prove the autocratic style of governance that is evident on the part of the Government.  This style of autocratism is now being ratcheted up, as the Taoiseach and the Government think that by virtue of exiting the bailout and their advancement in the polls they are invincible and are bordering on infallible.  Its treatment of me and other spokespersons and Members of the House is nothing short of disgraceful.  It is an affront to democracy and an insult to the taxpayers, who will foot the bill for Irish Water.</p><p> I have no doubt the Minister, the Taoiseach and the Government are very much aware of the growing concern that exists in the community about their approach to water reform, but what is their response?  Their response is to stifle debate and to remove opportunities for criticism.  They are pushing this through and hoping that in the week that is in it, nobody will notice.  Sod that for attitude.  Sod that for its regard for those of us on this side of the House and for its own Members.  They too need adequate time for scrutiny of this Bill so they can be certain the proposals of the Government are adequate and meet the necessities of governance.</p><p> Fianna F&aacute;il will oppose this Bill tooth and nail.  This legislation strips away functions from democratically accountable local authorities and places them in a new Irish Water super quango created by the Government.  This entirely new layer of bureaucracy, populated as we have seen in recent months by highly paid consultants, will be funded directly by homeowners across the country.  On numerous occasions in this House when we discussed the first water Bill, I pointed out the obligation of the Government following on its commitment to complete an audit of the network throughout the country.  Instead of this glorified consultancy stimulus package, the Government is obliged to complete that audit, identify the faults and place on record a timeframe or roadmap for the network to be brought up to speed and made fit for purpose.</p><p> In addition, the House is entitled to know the costs associated with doing that, for how long those costs will be charged and the timeframe by which the system will become fit for purpose.  It is entitled, for example, to know the timeframe by which the water issues for Dublin will be addressed properly.  Only then can we honestly adjudicate on the system.  We can adjudicate only on a system that is fit for purpose and only then charge its users.  Make no mistake, Fianna F&aacute;il has no problem with the concept of water charges, but we want a system that is fit for purpose.  We want a system of which the electorate can be proud so that people will feel it is fair and will have no problem thereafter paying for it.  If the audit is put in place, the system can be then comprehensively upgraded to a standard for which homeowners, businesses and industry can pay, a system of which taxpayers as a whole can be proud.  This would be a service that could be genuinely delivered.</p><p> This Bill proposes to move powers, assets and liabilities away from local authorities and to give them to Irish Water.  The first water services Bill passed earlier this year included legislation relevant to giving effect to the setting up of Irish Water, its configuration and allowed the commencement of water metering.  Almost two years ago, I asked for the publication of the relevant papers which allowed the Government to appoint Bord G&aacute;is as the vehicle for setting up Irish Water.  Bord G&aacute;is got the contract ahead of Bord na M&oacute;na.  I make no apology for stating that I believe Bord na M&oacute;na was better placed to win that competition.  However, the Government needs to prove to me it has made the right decision.  In doing that, it needs to produce the papers that allowed it make that decision and to show the merit behind that decision.  </p><p> As I and many others have said, it was obvious that the intention of the Government, having sold Bord G&aacute;is, was to set up Irish Water in a way that would allow it to be sold down the road.</p><p>The manner in which Irish Water has been established means it will be a commercial entity with a glossy corporate identity, and much has been spent in this regard.  I have no doubt it will be a prime target for future sale, which would be a selective sale - only the best populated and most profitable networks would be sold, therefore showing disregard for group schemes and rural schemes, which is another threat to rural Ireland.  This threat is real, and even more so because when the Bill is compared to the heads of Bill produced earlier this year one can see the heads contained a number of provisions which are absent from the Bill.  The most significant issues now absent include a provision to terminate service level agreements; a prohibition on the sale of Irish Water by Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann or any part of the company; a prohibition on the sale of water services asset infrastructure without the consent of the Minister; a prohibition on the company's entering into an agreement that would result in the transfer of assets or water services infrastructure; and an entire section on environmental regulations making the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, the supervisory authority.  All of these have been deleted.  The omission of these confirms to me and others that the Government, whether by design or accident, is sleepwalking Irish Water into the shop window for future sales.</p><p> In recent months I asked the Government to inform the House about progress on the water metering programme.  I have been given no information and have been told it is an operational matter.  In other words, I was not entitled to know.  Why is this?  I am informed that only 25% of the initial target has been met.  Several weeks ago I was informed that &euro;600 million had been taken from the Local Government Fund for the establishment and workings of Irish Water.  This process began two years ago, and two weeks ago I heard that &euro;600 million had been transferred from the Local Government Fund.  This confirms that local services are not being delivered from the source from which the Government stated it was intended to deliver them.</p><p> The Acting Chairman has asked me to conclude.</p></speech>

It shows absolute and total disregard for Members on this side of the House and many Members of the Government.  We have the privilege and honour of representing those who gave us the right to represent them, and the Government is bringing forward significant legislation with total disregard for our right to question and scrutinise it so the public can be satisfied that the Government's efforts are well meant.</p></speech>

I am very disappointed that the Minister of State, who I know is a fair-minded person, is party to this.  We have been given three hours and 45 minutes to debate this Bill, which is an absolute bloody disgrace.  It is the most significant legislation to come before the D&aacute;il so far.</p><p>  The Water Services (No. 2) Bill is a Trojan horse for privatisation of essential services.  There are no safeguards in the Bill to stop it.  The introduction of these water charges, which were planned by the previous Government, is an absolute disgrace.  It was in the previous Government's national plan from 2011 to 2014 that &euro;500 million per annum would be raised, which is exactly the same figure as that projected by this Government.</p><p>  The Government's commitment to privatisation was borne out again last week with the sale of the important part of Bord G&aacute;is.  The part with the valve has been handed over to international capitalism.  Does the Minister of State not understand this?  The Government has handed over the valve and the buyers have the keys and the control.  Does the Government not understand this?  It has no right to do this.  It was never discussed in the House.  It is an absolute disgrace.  The stand-alone utility company, which has been discussed for the past two years, will be put under the wing of what has been sold off.  It is a disgrace.</p><p>  No public service or body is safe under the Government.  The Bill will asset-strip our local authorities, and this has been happening without a vote in any local authority.  Not one section 183 has gone through a local authority.  It is a disgrace.  The Government has walked over the rights of 1,600 councillors.  It is an absolute bloody disgrace.  It allows for billions of euro in assets to be given to Irish Water without a single vote.  This important Bill is being rushed through the D&aacute;il in a few hours with no time for debate.  Sinn F&eacute;in has tabled amendments, as have other Deputies on the Opposition benches, but the Government does not want debate.  It is about asset stripping.  A real debate would expose the phoney arguments the Government has put forward over the past two years on this.</p><p> Sinn F&eacute;in has been consistent in our opposition to the establishment of Irish Water and the introduction of water charges.  Does the Government know that most households are creaking under the weight of debt and stealth charges?  Does the Minister of State not realise this?  Households already pay local property tax, management fees, domestic waste charges, fire charges and many other charges, and now they are being hit with this charge.  In a cynical move, the Bill for domestic water charges will not be received until after the local elections.  The previous Government planned to introduce them in 2014 and the Government has held them back until the last quarter of next year.  The Minister of State knows why this has been done and I have told him.  The charge will be introduced after the local elections when Government councillors have their feet under the table in council chambers.  It is a move which the Government hopes will protect those who should be on the Labour Party benches but are not present.</p><p>  We have opposed the establishment of Irish Water and the introduction of water charges based on simple belief the people should not pay two, three or four times for water.  The Bill before us is a smash-and-grab of local authority assets and local democracy.  It further advances the policy of privatisation and forces households to pay for essential services for which they have already paid.  If passed into law the Bill will mean the public will pay three times: once in their taxes, a second time in funding made available to Irish Water from the National Pensions Reserve Fund, and a third time through water charges.</p><p>  Not even happy with this attack on local authority assets, the Government has further plundered money from local taxation which should go to local authority funding.  A total of &euro;600 million has been robbed for this.  This money should be for roads and services.  The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd, and the Minister, Deputy Hogan, have made much play over the past two years about the fact that people will know what they are paying for and what they pay for is what they will get.  They are on the record as stating this.  This year I paid car tax, as did million of citizens throughout the State.  I paid it for road maintenance, footpaths and lighting.  I did not pay it in order for it to be taken and handed to a stand-alone company.  Funding for water services has been cut by a massive 87% for 2014.  The same water services will now be provided by Irish Water, requiring an investment of &euro;240 million from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  This is on top of the &euro;500 million given to Irish Water this year, as mentioned earlier, from the National Pensions Reserve Fund to install meters.</p><p>The previous Deputy is correct that the Government is well below 25% of the target it set for installations.  Irish Water is stuck in the muck in many places trying to do this.  The Minister of State should do the maths - &euro;600 million from the motor tax fund; &euro;240 million from the Department; and &euro;500 million from the NPRF to install water meters giving a total of &euro;1.34 billion.  In addition, &euro;300 million in commercial water rates and &euro;500 million from domestic water rates will be generated in a full year.  That amounts to approximately &euro;2.2 billion.  That is an expensive service, which is double the current cost, but this is a scam if even there was one.  The Bill makes no mention of how much Irish Water will cost to run.  However, one paragraph in the legislation permits the company to borrow a further &euro;2 billion.  The Government needs all that money to install meters and to run the God forsaken call centre it has set up.  Not one drop or glass of water will be saved by it.</p><p> This paragraph is followed up by a commitment in the legislation on behalf of future Ministers to make grants available.  This grant does not even require a vote in the House, as a simple application to the Minister will suffice.  This is like Las Vegas and Irish Water and the fat cats running it have just struck the jackpot.  The Bill makes no mention of how much the householder will be charged.  That has been subcontracted by the Minister in order that he can hide behind the energy regulator.</p><p>  Water charges are in place in Denmark, which has a population similar to our own at 5.4 million and, in 2007, the average cost was &euro;715 per household.  This Bill does not take into account people on low income or even those currently living in poverty.  A total of 706,371 people live in poverty in this State.  Their households will be charged the same for their water as a millionaire, which is shameful and unjust.  Water charges will have an immediate and negative effect on low income families.  When poverty levels and income distribution in Ireland are taken into account, it is obvious that water charges would have a significant impact on households and their income. The Minister of State does not have to take my word for it.  According to a major report carried out by the British Chartered Institute of Environmental Health, a household spending more than 3% of its income on water charges is at risk of water poverty.  Is he aware of that?  The report entitled, Water Poverty in Wales and England, found that &quot;UK households in the lowest three income deciles spend on average 3% of their net income on water bills whereas the average spend for all households is just 1%.&quot;  The report further states: &quot;Large water bills in relation to income do have the potential for causing significant deprivation.&quot;</p><p> The Taoiseach was on television the other night expressing how grateful he was to us all, particularly those who have suffered.  They will suffer more and will find life more difficult because of what the Minister of State is doing today.  How much will the water supply be reduced by to those families?  He has not outlined this.  Will it be reduced by half or to a trickle?  Those families cannot afford water charges.  They are short of food and heat as it stands.  The Minister of State knows people in this position, as I do.  We have loads of constituents who cannot afford to heat their homes or to feed themselves properly.  They will now be denied water.  They face a trickle of water, a trickle of food and not enough heat.  That is a great lifestyle in this supposed republic.</p><p> It is shocking to think the Labour Party will stand over these tactics.  The Bill, despite international evidence, does not even attempt to protect low income families and those who are vulnerable and makes no reference to ability to pay.  We have tabled amendments in this regard but the Government will now allow us to even discuss them.  All the Minister will do is threaten to reduce water supply to a trickle for those unfortunate households that cannot pay these charges.  The amendments we intended to table would undo the worst excesses of this legislation.  We seek cross-party support to make Irish Water more accountable to this House and to protect the vulnerable from poverty.</p><p> The Government would have us believe that we are the only region in the EU in which water charges are not levied but this is untrue.  Just 90 miles up the road only a few miles from where the Minister of State lives, Sinn F&eacute;in has put its politics into action in the Northern Ireland Assembly and reversed the attempt by the British Government to introduce water rates in the North.  Despite London's best attempts at bullying the Assembly into imposing water charges, Sinn F&eacute;in Minister, Conor Murphy, ensured no such charges would be introduced.  Our alternative to this Bill is cost effective and efficient and can be implemented now.  Sinn F&eacute;in calls for the establishment of a national water sector team within the Department to oversee governance of the water sector and capital investment  in it.  It would comprise city and county managers and it would be convened and chaired by Secretary General of the Department.  My party proposes investing money from the National Pensions Reserve Fund in creating jobs that have a positive legacy and that will prevent leakage of up to 40% of the water supply and not just in setting up a call centre and putting a meter outside my door, where there is one already.  The money is being wasted on meters and instead should be invested in upgrading an ageing network. The &euro;500 million ring-fenced for water meters would fund the water conservation strategy for six years and it would be more appropriate to do that rather than invest in installing meters.</p><p> Sinn F&eacute;in supports the introduction of district metering as opposed to installing domestic water meters in every household.  It is not necessary to install a meter in every household.  District metering is used in the county in which I live.  I have outlined to the Minister of State previously that this is cheaper and more effective because usage can be monitored and it is of great assistance to local authorities in identifying leaks.  Sinn F&eacute;in calls on the Government parties, even at this late stage, to abandon their ill-fated domestic water meter scheme and instead to expand district metering.  It would be more cost effective and would ensure water leakage is detected efficiently and quickly.</p><p> Currently the water sector is managed by the 34 local authorities.  The move to Irish Water will not improve accountability or governance.  A 1890 number is available to the call centre and I told the Minister he would do this a year and a half ago.  Local authorities are accountable to their communities and this was demonstrated during the two big freezes in recent years.  We did better in this State than the administration in the North.  Local councillors were able to respond quickly with local engineers.  Local authorities are able to meet local demands and can provide solutions to emergencies working with local engineers.</p><p> Last year the Minister bulldozed property tax legislation through the house.  This Bill will have serious repercussions and it represents a huge shift in public policy, as it proposes to strip assets and charge people for their drinking water.  It is shameful that the Government would ram this complicated Bill through the House and then head off for Christmas.  The Bill should be rejected and replaced with a proper plan for the co-ordination of water services provided by democratically controlled local authorities and adequately funded by a progressive tax system.</p><p> This is akin to rural electrification but the implementation of the Bill is a farce.  We have been given three hours and 45 minutes.  We will have no opportunity on Committee State to discuss amendments.  The Government promised a democratic revolution.  While the Minister of State occupies a different part of the political spectrum to me, his party promised a democratic revolution but what we are getting is a democratic counterrevolution.  What the Government is doing is a disgrace.  The property tax was last year's Christmas present to hard pressed householders.  The legislation was rammed through the House.  Only one of my party's amendments was discussed in the House and it was rejected.  No amendment tabled by any other party or Independent Member was discussed.  The Government rammed it through and all its members then went on their Christmas holidays.  This legislation is being rammed through this year and I feel let down by the Minister of State and the Labour Party because of what they are doing.  I am disappointed by the way the House operates.  My opinion of it is poor because of how it conducts its business.  We should do things better and at this late stage the Minister of State should do the right thing, leave the House and go to the Taoiseach to tell him he will not be a party to this.</p><p>I know it does not sit easily with him.</p></speech>

They do not listen to the people of Ireland.  They prostrate themselves in the most slavish fashion before the demands of the institutions of European capital, including the ECB and the European Commission.  These institutions, in turn, subject themselves to the demands of European financial markets, international bankers, hedge funds and vulture capitalists in their pursuit of super profits.  With breath taking arrogance, this band of charlatans, masquerading as a legitimate Government, will ram through D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann - the national Parliament - water services legislation that will pile new burdens in water taxes on the shoulders of the people who are already hard pressed as a result of austerity policies.  It is another bondholders' tax introduced to pay the disastrous speculative debts for which this cowardly Government continues to bleed the people.  The Bill is nothing more than a charter to bleed new water taxes from ordinary people and to make water, a human need and a human right, a business commodity that can be bought and sold in the capitalist marketplace and privatised and handed over to multinational water companies.</p><p>  This legislation and any attempt to charge for water should be met by a nationwide boycott of this unjust tax, as was done in 1994, 1995 and 1996 to compel the Government of the day to abolish a previous tax.  This is perfidious legislation entirely befitting the bunch of charlatans from Fine Gael and the Labour Party who call themselves a Government.  Apart from these words and my vote against the Bill, I will take no further part in these proceedings because my doing so would only confer credibility on a charade and a grotesque abuse of even the remotest concept of democracy.</p></speech>

That is why it has chosen to take the equally despicable decision to ram the Bill through the House a few days before Christmas.  It is cynical in the extreme.  The Government is perpetrating a heist and trying to cover up the robbery of one of the most precious and vital resources for the people of the country in order that it can sell it to its cronies in big business who will make their money by selling it back to ordinary citizens.  The shocking backdrop is that the owner of one of the companies installing the meters is Mr. Denis O'Brien, one of the richest people in the country.  Mr. O'Brien got a write-down of &euro;110 million on the debts of a company he took over from Anglo Irish Bank.  These debts were written off and he got the contract to install the meters to charge us for water.  It is a heist and a robbery.  The Bill gives Irish Water the despicable power to reduce water supplies to people who need it to drink, wash their children and keep their homes clean.  This is one of the sickest things imaginable.  All of us know that water supplies have to be funded and financed, but the way to do this is to pay for them according to people's means through a progressive and fair tax system in order that everybody, including children, the vulnerable and ordinary people, will have access to water based on need and right.  The Government is robbing our water in order that its mates can sell it back to us at a profit.</p></speech>

A recent consultation paper from the Commission for Energy Regulation added further to the confusion about the matter.  The paper was produced under section 27 of the Water Services Act 2013 which states the commission may advise the Minister on the development of policy for the regulation and provision of water services.  The report recommends that after the transition period, Irish Water be given a free hand to determine how its services are procured.  One of the options would be to issue a public tender in which local authorities could participate.  The idea that local authorities could compete with a private entity is rubbish, given the overheads they will be carrying.</p><p>  A significant problem arises in the way responsibilities are being divided.  Responsibility for surface water and flooding will remain with local authorities.  These are costly and unpredictable tasks.  From where will the staff come when they are needed?  They will not be in the local authorities once Irish Water is established.  Local authorities will be left with a range of responsibilities without the capacity to deal with them.  The foul system is going to Irish Water, but the problems it causes such as pollution are being left with the local authorities.  In other words, the good stuff is going to Irish Water but the problems are being left behind.</p><p>  Planning functions will be separate from Irish Water.  If a new business coming into Ireland wants to build a major complex in the docklands or somewhere else which will require significant water services, Irish Water will not want to pay for them.  How will that issue be addressed?</p></speech>

If the Government really believes in the Bill, why does it not want to debate it?  It does not want to have a debate because it wants to get this piece of bad news out of the way at a time when it will receive less attention, in exactly the same way as the property tax was introduced last year.  We need to analyse what will happen to the relationship with Bord G&aacute;is.  The assets and liabilities to be transferred need to be scrutinised.  Without an income, local authorities' liabilities, including pension liabilities, will have to be funded through commercial rates, property taxes and the local government fund.  There will be unintended consequences from the fact that a first fix policy has not been implemented.  People will end up with significant liabilities if such a policy is not put in place.  We have heard nothing on that issue.  We are not being given time to debate the potential difficulties that will arise from the taking in charge of estates with pumping stations or the possibility that the laying of pipes too close to the surface will result in inadequate water supplies.</p><p>  ComReg is being given the power to decide on water charges.  This is another example of the Teflon coating we saw with the HSE, whereby functions are one step removed from D&aacute;il scrutiny.  It is the wrong way to approach this matter.  I have no problem charging for water, but an adequate free allowance is required.  We are not debating that issue today.  We have no control over prices or allowances.  The power to make decisions on these matters is being given to ComReg.  </p><p>  If the Government is convinced about the utility of this legislation, why is it insisting on ramming it through with inadequate scrutiny?  A number of issues could jump up and bite us in the future, but the Government is not even anticipating them.</p></speech>

The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd, is facilitating the legalised robbery of this important public service.  The manner in which the legislation has been constructed and the setting up of the service level agreements against the background of the recruitment embargo and the natural wastage that is occurring in local authorities means that inevitably they will not be in a position to fulfil those contracts, there will be a knock on the door and that task will be outsourced.  The reality is, in a European context, that once one commodifies and charges for a public service, there is nothing one can do to prevent a private operator from coming in and bidding for it.  Today the Government, in this incredibly undemocratic manner, is facilitating that process.</p><p>  What we have seen with Irish Water is a big conglomerate with a nice glossy image and logo, an office and a telephone line, but no attention has been given to restoring and revamping the water supply.  If the Government were to invest to fix the leaks, impose water conservation measures, etc., for which there is money available, we could have a top-class supply here.  Instead, the Minister of State is undermining it and facilitating the vultures.</p><p>  The idea that a Labour Party in Government could stand over the undemocratic way in which this is being foisted on us is an absolute insult, and the people of this country will not thank the Government for it.  The idea that people should pay for water is anathema to them.  People cannot afford these charges and they will not be engaging with the system whatsoever.</p></speech>

It further states:<blockquote>When you buy goods from a retailer, you make a contract with him.  He agrees to provide certain goods to you for a certain price.  If your purchase turns out to be faulty, the retailer, not the manufacturer, is responsible to you and must sort out your complaint.  You are entitled to a refund, a replacement or a repair. [...]<br /><br />  If you have a genuine complaint about faulty goods, you can ignore shop notices such as 'No Refunds' or 'No Exchanges'. Such notices cannot take away any of your statutory rights under the Sale of Goods Act[.]</blockquote>  I have a question for the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd.  When the Government starts charging people for water, what will it do about the people who live outside my town, Castlerea, in the Castlerea rural scheme, who are forced to drink the water I have here?  I have checked with Standing Orders and the word &quot;piss&quot; is not one of the words one is not allowed to use in this Chamber, unless directed at a Member.  The people in my area are expected to drink glorified piss and the Government is going to charge them for it.  The reality is that we are not going to pay for it.</p><p>  I have a challenge for the Minister of State today.  I will present him with this water and challenge him to drink it, and if he does not drink it then he is not drinking it for a reason, because it is poison.  It has got cryptosporidium in it.  Kids outside my town cannot even brush their teeth with this water, and the Government is going to charge them for it.  I have a present for you Minister, and I am going to give it to you now, because this is way too big to let go of.</p></speech>

It deserves far more time and in-depth discussion by everybody concerned.  I am also disappointed at the cynical way in which the introduction of charges has been arranged.  The bills will not be coming in yet as they might coincide with either the local elections or the European elections.</p><p>  I note that Ireland supports the right to water for the developing world.  It is one of a series of rights such as the right to food and the right to a roof over one's head, yet the Government seems to be taking a completely different attitude to water when it comes to this country, where, suddenly, it is a commodity to be bought and sold.   This area, and what is being proposed here with water charges, is completely profit-driven.</p><p>  I represent Dublin Central, which has had many examples of repeated flooding.  Even in the good times when we were, if one will pardon the pun, awash with money, the money did not go into the infrastructure required to protect residents' homes against flooding.  We are seeing repeated flooding, and there is also the role of the insurance companies, as has been discussed here and as I have brought up with the Minister.  The insurance companies will not provide flood cover for houses in areas that have been flooded already.  They will not even cover houses that have not been flooded but that happen to be in that same geographical area.  There is a massive piece of work that has to be done on that.  The insurance companies seem to be able to do what they like.  It appears this new board will have the power to do what it likes as well.</p></speech>

The legislating for and setting up of Irish Water, which will assume responsibility for managing water supplies, will go a long way towards ensuring that we have a sufficient and reliable supply of water in the future, particularly given the importance of water not only for our own survival but also in the areas of agriculture, fishing and tourism, and in view of the critical role it plays as a key driver in attracting foreign direct investment into the country.</p><p>  Given the establishment of Irish Water and the transfer of functions from the local authorities to it, there are a number of issues that I want to bring to the attention of the House today.  Up to now, Clare County Council has managed our water services, and it has done a good job against the backdrop of tight budgetary constraints in recent years, especially given the embargo on recruitment.  I am anxious to see that Irish Water is not restricted in the same way.  I have raised this with the Minister on a number of occasions.  I understand Irish Water has already recruited 183 staff but I ask the company to review the position in Clare and, if necessary, supplement the number of staff transferring from Clare County Council in order to ensure that our water services are maintained at their high standards.</p><p>  It is also critical that Irish Water continue to invest in the water infrastructure and that consumers are protected and have safe drinking water.  Of course, reliability is important as well.  The EPA expressed concerns recently regarding delays in the replacement of lead piping in the town of Ennis.  Phase 1 of the Ennis water mains contract included the replacement of lead pipes in the Marian Avenue, Ahern's Terrace and Linnane's Terrace areas of the town, and this has been a success.  Given that the contract documents for phase 2 of the Ennis scheme are currently being prepared, the replacement of lead pipes in the remainder of the town, including Connolly Villas, should be included in this phase, as this is important for health and safety reasons.</p><p>  We also need to progress the Ennis-Clarecastle sewerage scheme.  Commercial and industrial activity has effectively been stifled in this area given that planning permission is being refused, as the majority of lands zoned would utilise this scheme.  The Minister is anxious to progress the upgrading of the Clonroadmore wastewater treatment plant and his Department is currently examining the tenders.  I hope this can be fast-tracked as well.</p><p>  As well as the much-talked-about interconnectors from Castle Lake and Sixmilebridge to Ennis, the upgrading of the Shannon sewerage scheme is now a priority given the vile odour that residents in the Shannon are must endure, and, of course, the Kilkee and Kilrush sewerage schemes are key infrastructural projects in the county, not only because of the jobs they would generate during the construction phase but also because of their potential to attract new businesses to Clare.  I am in the process of examining whether we can progress the Carrigaholt small sewerage scheme as well.  Carrigaholt is an important seaside resort in west Clare and there is fishing off the coast.  The establishment of a sewerage scheme there is important, and I am trying to progress that.</p><p>  At a public meeting I attended recently in Scarriff, I heard that there was much concern in east Clare regarding the plans to extract 350 million litres of water every day to supplement the supply in Dublin.  The indications are that this could have an environmental and economic effect on tourism and fishing in east Clare.  There are genuine concerns, especially as the water levels are so low in Lough Derg at this time of the year, the middle of winter.  These concerns must be taken into consideration before the debate continues further.</p><p>  I have several other issues to address, but time does not permit me to do so.  In particular, with regard to metering and the application of water charges, I urge Irish Water to learn from the experience of the local property tax.  The billing system needs to be fair.</p><p>Payment methods need to be flexible.  Phased and cash payments through post offices must be facilitated.  There must be flexibility for householders and businesses with an inability to pay.  It is also important that there be clarification for community organisations, voluntary groups and Tidy Towns committees on who will have liability for the use of the public water supply when water charges are introduced.  There are a number of outstanding issues and I hope the Minister of State will respond to them.  It is extremely important that small villages and towns in rural areas, some of which I highlighted, are looked after by Irish Water.</p></speech>

I also thank the staff of all political parties, as well as the staff of the Houses for keeping this institution going and working on behalf of the people.</p><p>  The Ceann Comhairle spoke about vandalism.  The HSE service plan was published this week and it certainly was an act of vandalism in the sense that it was announced that there would be a service plan, but clearly it is a plan to reduce services on a massive scale in 2014.  This is clear when one considers the number of hospital procedures that have had to be cancelled, the fact that BreakCheck will not be rolled out for women between the ages of 65 and 69 years, a move which will affect more that 80,000 women, and that, within the plan, the HSE has had the audacity to include a figure of &euro;108 million to be realised at some stage in the future without any identification of from where these savings will come.  We are being asked to consider a health service plan that clearly is incapable of delivering services in 2014.</p><p>  The Minister for Finance and others walked in here on 15 October and published the Estimates which did not even stand up to scrutiny between the time of their publication and the publication of HSE service plan.  Within that time it was found that the savings from medical card probity measures of &euro;113 million were a figment of somebody's imagination in government.  Will the Minister agree that the HSE service plan for 2014, even before it commences on 1 January, will simply not be able to sustain any credible form of health service in the year ahead?  I have pointed to procedure and Breastcheck cancellations, the provision of fewer medical cards and a massive reduction in front-line staff, all these key issues which will put huge pressure on the HSE's ability to deliver health care.  </p><p>  In the context of publication of the Estimates, we were informed last week by the Minister of Health that the underlying deficit was &euro;199 million.  We now find in the HSE service plan that it is &euro;490 million.  Will the Minister agree two things?  First, did the Minister for Health mislead the House in the context of the underlying deficit and, second, will the Government at least do a U-turn in the rollout of BreastCheck?</p></speech>

It is not easy.  One of the issues that has been in the newspapers is the &euro;108 million in savings that have yet to be identified but which will be so identified within the context of the Haddington Road agreement.  Some have suggested the figure of &euro;108 million will not form part of the overall savings to be achieved under the Haddington Road agreement.  I want to say very clearly that this is not the case.  The amount of &euro;108 million is and always has been an integral part of the overall savings target in the health sector.  The Government expects full implementation of the Haddington Road agreement in all sectors, including health.</p><p>  On the other matters raised by the Deputy, the Minister, Deputy James Reilly, will come into the House in due course but not today, when the clarifications have been made of the matters included in the HSE service plan and----- </p></speech>

Nobody in government believes the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, no more than I on this side of the House.  The reason I do not believe him is that the Taoiseach and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform have insisted on assisting him in compiling the Estimates.  His credibility is already shattered on this side of the House, but even within the Cabinet the Taoiseach, by his own admission, has said he has to go and try to help the Minister to run the Department.  The difficulty we have is that there are unidentified savings of &euro;108 million that we are being asked to assume will not have an impact on services, but, clearly, they will have a detrimental impact on them.  If one goes through the full health Estimates and the HSE service plan, they are just not sustainable from the get go.  Clearly, they will not be capable of delivering basic services.</p><p>  We have heard time and again about the issues with medical cards, discretionary medical cards, the cancellation of procedures and people waiting inordinate time just to see a consultant.  The Minister is now saying that next year will be a challenging one; it will not be a challenging year for the Minister, Deputy James Reilly, but it will be massively challenging for the many hundreds of thousands who will need to access health services in 2014.</p></speech>

Will he now allow me the chance to do so?   </p><p>  I also avail of the opportunity to extend Christmas wishes to all Members of the House, the Ceann Comhairle and the staff, including support staff.  I would also like us spare a thought for those Members of the Houses who are unwell.  I am thinking of our own Deputy Nicky McFadden but also Senator Jimmy Harte who I believe is still in hospital.  I am sorry if I have left others out, but I would particularly like us to join together in extending the warmest greetings to both of them at this time.</p><p>  The Minister probably thought when he saw that Deputy Billy Kelleher and I were taking Leaders' Questions they would be on the same subject, but they are not.</p><p>I want to address housing need and homelessness because of the time of year.  I hope we can find some common accord on it.  On 7 February 2002, the Minister's colleague, who is now T&aacute;naiste and leader of his party, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, said in this House:<blockquote>The Government's housing policy has been a disgrace, testified to by the fact there were 26,000 applicants on local authority lists when it took office...  I estimate there are about 60,000 families on local authority waiting lists...  It is time the Minister of State, the Minister and the Government were swept from office and a Government elected which will deal with the housing crisis.</blockquote>I fully agreed with Deputy Eamon Gilmore when he made those remarks in the House.  How do the Minister's colleagues, particularly Labour Party Ministers, stand over the fact that the housing waiting list is some 90,000 families across the State, which is 30,000 family units more than when Deputy Eamon Gilmore made those remarks about the previous Government?  It is an area of great concern to many people.  The Labour Party quite rightly condemned the failure of the previous Governments to build local authority housing and its almost total dependence on the private rented sector and rent supplement in order to cater to the needs of people who could not afford their own homes.  Does the Minister accept this Government has continued with a similar approach and there has been a failure to address in a real and substantive way the housing need and homelessness that presents up and down the length and breadth of the country in our cities and towns and across rural Ireland?  Does the Minister not accept the public monies expended on rent supplement would be better employed adding to a fund to create a new public housing stock to meet the needs of our people and be part of the assets of our State to meet the needs of future generations?</p><p> Some &euro;400 million was expended in rent supplement in 2013.  There is unquestionably a need but there is not the address of some 90,000 family units across the State.  I appeal to the Minister and his colleagues in both parties in government to recognise that this is a most serious issue that needs urgent address.  At the earliest point in the new year, the Government should pledge to address it in the way it must be grappled with.  There is no excuse for the continuation of a piecemeal approach, with piddling little efforts here and there.  We need a substantial public housing building programme to meet the needs of those who have housing need.  This could be part of the generation of a new impetus in the economy.</p></speech>

He mentioned a Deputy and a Senator and perhaps there are others.  It is a sentiment I completely support and I thank him for raising it.</p><p>  I share the Deputy's concern, as does the Labour Party, about what has happened to the public housing sector, its destruction under section 5 and the reliance on rent supplement that has driven so many people into a difficult situation.  We had discussions in the Parliamentary Labour Party about the matter, as other parties have had.  Turning around the system is taking time.  The Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, and the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government are working closely together.  It is expected 5,000 units will be made available this year, which is a small sum relative to the figure quoted.  The representatives from all Dublin constituencies will be appalled at the practice in the Dublin area of local authority apartments being boarded up and awaiting maintenance while there are people who would happily occupy them and would do them up themselves.  The Minister of State is in talks with the Dublin City Council officials.  This is largely a Dublin City Council matter although other local authorities have some rented apartments.  We must get a more efficient way of utilising property that is not being properly utilised.  I will bring the comments of the Deputy to the attention of the Minister of State because we share a similar approach to the matter.</p></speech>

Would that it were the case that we have the certainty of this promise.  My colleague, Deputy Dessie Ellis, has been pursuing the matter with the Minister and his Department but we can get no certainty, facts or detail on where the apartments or houses are to be constructed.  Is there any decision on such a roll-out?  It is an inadequate figure in any event and the potential is so much greater.  The figures I have cited relate to an even larger problem because people cannot get on housing lists.  This applies to people with no income, those without a valid lease for where they live and the added problem of rent supplement, which is needed in some cases.  The increases in rent in the city, some 7.8% over the course of the year, puts people outside the qualification thresholds for rent supplement.  In this situation, many landlords do not cooperate with tenants in properly accounting for the relationship.  Is the Minister aware that the director of advocacy for Focus Ireland, someone who he knows well personally and who is a former general secretary of the Labour Party, has described the Government's promised provision of housing units as "quite clearly a totally inadequate response to the scale of the problem we've got"?  The Minister should not take it from me but from someone who embraces his own politics as warmly as any of his colleagues in the House.  Can the Minister please utilise the opportunity of this last sitting before Christmas to give people in real housing need and the homeless of our State, some real prospect that the Government will address the issue in a real and substantive way as early in 2014 as is practical?</p></speech>

We are grappling with one thing many Administrations tried to do and found very difficult, to transfer to local authorities from the Department of Social Protection responsibility for the housing supplement so that one body deals with the area.  Many have argued for it, including the body the Deputy cited.  I will bring to the attention of the Minister of State and the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government the concerns expressed and I thank the Deputy for raising them.</p></speech>

I make no apology for returning to the question of families being bullied out of their homes or legally compelled to leave by banks bailed out by the Irish people.  The Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste have refused to answer the question in recent times and I appeal to the Minister to address the question and answer it.  It is very straightforward and I appeal to the Ceann Comhairle to ensure the Minister answers the question.  For thousands of people, the fear of losing the family home is palpable and traumatic.  It is giving rise to serious mental health issues.  People fear the sight of the postman in case he or she has the dreaded letter from the bank demanding the sale or repossession of the family home.  Since I raised the issue a fortnight ago, the rating agency, Fitch Ratings, has borne out my contention that up to 30,000 families face the loss of their homes under the insolvency arrangements put in place by the Government.</p><p>Fitch puts the figure at 26,000 families on the basis of information given to the company directly by the banks.  We are talking about people on low incomes whose only asset is a family home.  They have fully engaged with lenders but have no disposable income.</p><p> This argument is widely accepted by people engaged in the mortgage distress area, such as the advocacy group New Beginnings, the free legal aid centres, the Phoenix project in Portlaoise, Grant Thornton and various personal insolvency practitioners across the country.  New Beginnings has 1,000 distressed mortgage applications from people who see no out except for bankruptcy.  Grant Thornton has a similar figure and when it studied 1,000 cases, it saw that up to 50% faced bankruptcy.</p><p> I want to ask a question I have already posed to the Taoiseach in the past couple of weeks.  Does the Minister accept there is a serious problem and there are thousands of families on low incomes, below the minimum living expenses, who cannot avail of the insolvency process and who are facing the loss of the family home?  What does the Government intend to do about that?</p></speech>

With regard to the Deputy's first question, my answer is "Yes", and I accept that we have a problem.  We have known that from the very beginning and since we came into government.  It was one of the many problems we inherited from the previous disastrous Administration.</p></speech>

As there has been a <i>de facto</i> moratorium on house building over the past number of years, there has been a significant increase in house rents, as Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in noted.  That has happened across the country and not just in the greater Dublin area, Cork and Limerick.  We are trying to ensure, through massive change in the area of insolvency and mortgages, that systems can be worked out by families and lending institutions, including the two main banks, which have been massively recapitalised by the taxpayers in this country.  That was so the banks could do what they were supposed to in this area.</p></speech>

I accept the concerns which have been expressed and although the figures are hard to calculate, they are of the order mentioned.  Under this system, it is inevitable that some people will be faced with the prospect of losing their homes because of their circumstances.  As a Government, we are prepared to look at the measures that can be adopted in that set of circumstances, where some kind of rental agreement or other form of intervention can be arrived at with institutions that in many cases have been funded by the taxpayer.

I include in this colleagues who are unwell at present.  This has been a tough year, with many contentious issues, but regardless of people's views and what side of the House they are on, we are all here to do what we think is best for the country.</p><p>  The families of Members are often forgotten and I wish them a very happy Christmas.  They are sometimes the unpaid assistants at home, answering the phone and the door to constituents with problems.  I also wish staff in constituency offices around the country a very happy Christmas.  I take this opportunity to thank Ms Gr&aacute;inne Barrett and all the staff in the restaurants, as well as Mr. Darren Brady and the bar staff, and wish them a very peaceful and enjoyable Christmas with their families.  I am sure everybody would agree we are very well looked after by all and I hope these staff will enjoy a very well deserved rest.</p><p>  To the Superintendent, the Captain of the Guard and all the ushers and service staff who provide an invaluable service to all, I say that we truly appreciate their assistance throughout the year.  I wish them a very happy and peaceful Christmas.  I also thank the staff of the Oireachtas Library and Research Service, together with the communications unit, which provide great assistance both in communicating a message to the public and in helping Members to prepare for consideration of legislation.  We are also very reassured at times by the ongoing presence of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Permanent Defence Force in and around the House, and we greatly appreciate their dedication and commitment to duty.  I hope they will have a very happy and peaceful Christmas with their families.</p><p>  Last but not least I mention the members of the press in Leinster House, who endeavour to be fair even though at times it does not seem that way to all of us.  They are doing their best in their jobs.  I wish everybody a very happy and restful Christmas and I hope to see everybody in 2014 fully refreshed and ready for what will be a very busy year.  Thank you.</p></speech>

It demonstrates an absolute lack of respect for the House, its Members and those who elected us.  It demonstrates a lack of respect for any sense of fair procedure or deliberation on the formulation of legislation.  The Bill is a very substantive and significant one, since it provides for the transfer of a range of assets and physical infrastructure to Irish Water from local authorities across the country.  There are many amendments tabled by Opposition Members.  It is very clear that the Government will not give consideration to anything at all that is said in this House on the Bill, nor will it consider any Opposition amendment.  By the nature of the order that is now before us, one question will decide the fate of the Bill if Committee and Report Stages are not concluded within the time allowed.  Approximately three hours have been allowed today for this substantial and important Bill, which was published two weeks ago.  Three hours is all we are allowed.</p></speech>

It goes to the heart of whether the D&aacute;il is relevant.  The Government said it would introduce a democratic revolution and that there would be radical political reform.  This was mentioned during the Seanad referendum debate but none of it is coming to pass.  In fact, the trend is in the opposite direction.  The Government is shutting down debate at every opportunity.</p><p>  It is also to be noticed that the Government shuts down debate on the most politically contentious  Bills, be they on the property tax, social welfare or matters such as the one in question, which concerns water charges and the transfer of water infrastructure.

Members want to properly scrutinise and examine all legislation.  That opportunity is not being presented to us.  This is an absolute sham.  I have no doubt that if the Minister, Deputy Quinn, were on this side of the House he would be totally intolerant of what is now being proposed.  I ask for consistency.  This is absolutely outrageous.  The Bill is to facilitate the imposition of water charges on householders and other water users across the State.  One thing is for sure: it does not give any details about what charges we are to face.  Without question, there will be no account taken of people's ability to pay, just as no account was taken of this regarding the local property tax.  This has far-reaching implications.</p><p>  The manager of Dublin City Council and city and county managers across the State have expressed very valid concerns about the consequences of this legislation's passage and its impact from the beginning of the new year.  We need the time to address this properly if we are to perform our role as responsible elected representatives, irrespective of the politics we represent.  I ask that the Government now withdraw the proposal on the Order Paper and take a completely different course.</p></speech>

As water services authorities, 34 city and county councils are currently responsible for the delivery and operation of water and wastewater infrastructure.  In Ireland in 2010, water services cost over &euro;1.2 billion to run, with a resulting funding gap of around &euro;1 billion after revenues from non-domestic charges has been taken into account.  At the same time, Ireland is the only OECD country not to charge households directly for the water they consume.</p><p>  This Government has undertaken to reform water services arising from commitments in the programme for Government and the troika agreement.  The Water Services (No. 2) Bill 2013 is the second piece of legislation required to implement the Government's policy for the reform of water services in Ireland, including the introduction of domestic water charges.  There has been an historic under-investment in water and ageing and poor quality infrastructure exists in some areas.  As an EU member state, Ireland has certain obligations arising from the need to comply with the water framework directive, including financial obligations.  In addition, the current economic climate and its implications for Exchequer resources also form part of the context within which funding of essential services such as water provision need to be considered.</p><p>  Ireland's drinking water supplies are under pressure from many fronts, including pollution and poor infrastructure, which affect the quality and quantities available.  In Ireland, approximately 80% of drinking water originates from surface water, rivers and lakes, and 20% from ground water.  It reaches our taps through a distribution system of public water supplies, which supplies the majority of Irish households, public group water schemes, private group water schemes, small private supplies and exempted supplies, predominantly private wells. </p><p>  Unaccounted for water is a measure of water loss in a distribution system.  The provision of a continuous supply to households in Ireland is under pressure, due in part to high levels of unaccounted for water, primarily leakage.  Water investment programmes previously focused on water and wastewater treatments to ensure compliance with European directives and consequently, water mains renewal was neglected.  As such, the water system in many parts of Ireland is leaky, inefficient and in need of significant investment.</p><p>  The latest estimates of unaccounted for water are from 2011, and range from 16% in south Dublin to 60% in Kerry.  Dublin City Council estimates the Dublin loses up to 28% of the treated drinking water per annum to leakage, down from 43% in 1998.  Significant portions of the 19th century network need to be replaced to reduce leakage further, but over recent years, only 10% of the defective mains have been replaced.</p><p>  While water loss is a common feature of water distribution networks around the world, with typical losses of between 25% and 40% - even the best modern systems struggle to get below 20% - when compared with other major cities, it is clear that improvements could be made.  To this end, under the water service investment programme for 2010 to 2012, a total of &euro;321 million was allocated nationally for the replacement or rehabilitation of defective or leaking water mains.  Ground and surface water resources are not always protected, and many are at risk from pollution.  As such, surface and ground water must be treated before being fit for human consumption.  In general, surface water supplies require more treatment than ground water.  However, some private water supplies, the majority of which are reliant on ground water, have inadequate treatment, or in many cases, no treatment at all.</p><p>  A number of public water supplies which originate from surface water are treated only with disinfectant, which is insufficient.  Drinking water quality is governed by the European Communities drinking water regulations.  These regulations prescribe quality standards to be applied and related supervision and enforcement procedures on drinking water supplies.  The water services authorities are responsible for the production, distribution and monitoring of the drinking water of the public water supplies and have a duty to ensure that drinking water intended for human consumption meets with the water quality standards.  The Environmental Protection Agency is the regulatory body charged with monitoring and reporting on compliance levels on matters of water quality in Ireland.  Its role includes assessing the wholesomeness of drinking water and undertaking technical audits on water supplies.  The drinking water supply is deemed to be safe if it meets the chemical and microbiological quality standard set out in the regulations.</p><p>  As the 2014 budget process has been prepared on the basis of the new funding structure for water services, it is important that legislation is enacted before the end of this year to facilitate the transfer of statutory responsibility.  Local authorities are not providing for the funding of water services in the conventional manner in their 2014 budget, so if the Bill is not enacted by the end of 2013, then from the beginning of 2014, the local authorities will remain responsible for the provision of services, but will have no budget to deliver those services.</p></speech>

I am very disappointed by the grandstanding and childish behaviour we have just seen in seeking attention at the end of term.  A grand coalition of opposites is opposed to reforming our outdated water services system.  If a protest was to be made, it might have been made on something more appropriate.</p><p>  I am delighted to speak on the Bill.  In combination with the Water Services Act 2013, it will implement the Government's policy on the reform of water services and is part of the programme for Government; therefore, we are committed to delivering on it and are doing so, as we have done in so many other areas.  The Bill provides for the transfer of water service functions to Irish Water from the 34 water service authorities.  Water infrastructure is, clearly, a natural monopoly and of great strategic importance; therefore it must, as the Government has indicated, remain in public ownership.  That is an important characteristic of the legislation.</p><p>  The organisation of water services in Ireland does not use the natural monopoly and the 34 separate authorities that operate water services are unable to exploit the economies of scale available.  The creation of a unified public utility should result in significant efficiencies.  The creation of Scottish Water as a unified public utility resulted in efficiencies that brought about a reduction in operating costs of almost 40%.  Clearly, there is an imperative for us to make the appropriate savings, especially in these difficult times.  There is a precedent.  This legislation is very much based on the precedent in Scottish Water - a 40% reduction in cost is extraordinary, substantial and significant.  It would be criminal not to consolidate the provision of water services and water functions when we see a gap of &euro;1 billion in the cost for the provision of water services which is not recouped.  If we can reduce that figure by 40%, it would be very significant.  The fact that the infrastructure is being kept in State ownership is something I would have thought some Opposition Members would have welcomed, rather than walking out.</p><p>  Irish Water will have an important role to play in water conservation.  Water conservation enhances the environment, protects drinking water resources and saves money.  While nobody wants extra costs to be imposed on households, the introduction of water charges will result in improved water conservation.  However, it is important that safeguards are in place to protect consumers.  Work is under way on the structure of the proposed free allowance or allocation and affordability measures that will be introduced by the Government to mitigate the impact of water charges on domestic customers.</p><p>  It is welcome that the Bill includes a prohibition on the disconnection of domestic customers.  It is very important that the word go out that this is not <i>per se</i> a fundraising exercise in terms of the imposition on domestic households but a conservation measure.  Much work should go into the determination of the free allocation that will be granted to households.  It is welcome that it will be introduced and it should be available to the maximum and be weighted in favour of those who are less well off.  Households, particularly larger ones, in areas of disadvantage should have a larger free allowance than in other areas.  We would welcome this.  I am pleased that the CER will operate to approve what is proposed by Irish Water; therefore, it will not be a single division but one that will be approved by the regulatory process.  I would like to hear the Minister's views on how this might operate and how the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government envisages it operating.</p><p>  The creation of Irish water has had the additional benefit of creating jobs through the metering programme which is well under way.  The programme has created more than 600 jobs, 60% of which have gone to people on the live register, local SMEs, graduates or apprentices.  There is a clear boost to the economy and there will be considerable employment in the course of the process once the functions are taken over by Irish Water.  The Bill also provides for both the economic and environmental regulation of Irish Water.  The CER will work to protect the interests of customers andl approve codes of practice to be adopted by Irish Water, an important requirement.  The EPA will be responsible for the environmental regulation of Irish Water and ensure Irish Water will maintain the required standards of drinking water quality and the treatment of wastewater.  The CER and the EPA will work together to ensure as much consistency as possible between the decisions and measures taken by each agency.</p><p>  The Bill will help to transform water supply and wastewater treatment in Ireland.  Unfortunately, previous Governments under-invested in water infrastructure.  It is essential we deliver the level of infrastructure we need to meet demographic, economic and environmental requirements in the future.  The development of a unified, publicly owned water utility in the shape of Irish Water will help to secure our long-term economic development and enhanced water conservation.  In my portfolio, dealing with trade, businesses are always extremely concerned about the level of water that is treated and that there is a regular supply.  Consolidating the functions, treatment and supply of water is extremely important to ensure the economy, coming out of the bailout programme, can move forward in a way that will enhance our attractiveness to businesses we are seeking to attract to the country and increase the ability of existing small and medium enterprises to expand.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-12-19a.344" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1091" speakername="John Deasy" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013121900025#X00900"><p>One of the reasons I want to speak on the Water Services (No. 2) Bill is I recently travelled to Ethiopia with Irish Aid to visit projects there.  One of the places we visited was Tigray, the northernmost province of Ethiopia, where we saw the water projects in which Irish Aid had been involved for many years.  They remember the Minister of State, Deputy Joe Costello, fondly.  Farming in parts of Tigray has been transformed by these projects.  To deal with the problem of a scarce water supply, Irish Aid has engaged local farmers in watershed management.  This involves building water collectors, small dams and terraces and planting trees, all of which help to keep water in the soil.  The work takes place across whole valleys or watersheds, raising the level of moisture captured in the soil for these communities.  The projects have made a real difference to the lives of poor farmers, not only in improving their incomes but in helping them to cope with the changes brought about by climate change.  Having witnessed the infrastructure in place and listened to the people there, the watershed rehabilitation programmes have had profound effects in a province that was the worst affected by the drought and famine that hit Ethiopia in 1984 to 1986.  The value the people we met put on the water projects cannot be overestimated.  For the people we met, a clean and plentiful supply of water has radically changed their lives.  What Irish Aid pioneered in Tigray has been replicated by the Ethiopian Government throughout the country and the World Bank has used it as a model throughout the world for similar projects.</p><p> I am not trying to make any grand statements on or comparisons between the systems in Ethiopia and Ireland, but it is worth remembering how vital a good and adequate water supply is.  The objectives behind the establishment of a new water utility here are to improve the quality and supply of water.  This is worth paying for if necessary.  We do not need the EU-IMF to impose these water charges.  I understand that in 2009 the Commission on Taxation recommended that domestic water charges be phased in and that those charges be based on usage.  We should have acted on that recommendation, regardless of what the IMF said.</p><p> Ireland's domestic water consumption of approximately 150 litres per person per day is one of the highest in Europe, but it is anticipated that the national roll-out of water meters and the introduction of domestic water charges here will reduce consumption.  I was reminded at the Committee of Public Accounts of the problems we face as a country when it comes to funding water services.  There is a huge gap between the revenue generated from local authority charges and the cost of water provision.  It cost over &euro;1.2 billion to run our water services in 2010.</p><p> Last year, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government stated that our capacity to fund future capital investment requirements from the Exchequer was severely constrained and that meeting investment needs and rising operational costs within the current funding model was unsustainable.  It pointed to the fact that increased operational costs could be offset to an extent by efficiency gains from moving to a new organisational form.  The Minister of State, Deputy Costello, mentioned Scottish Water, which transitioned from a local to a regional and then a national organisation for water services and achieved operational savings of 40% over a five-year period.</p><p> Our water infrastructure has repeatedly been described as poor or under severe pressure.  In Dublin for example, some 28% of treated drinking water is unaccounted for or lost.  The percentage of unaccounted-for water is a lot higher in other parts of the country.  In the most recent water services investment programme, &euro;321 million was allocated nationally for the replacement or rehabilitation of defective or leaking water mains.  I believe the plan is to rehabilitate the public water services infrastructure with the revenue collected from the introduction of domestic water charges.</p><p> We cannot take water services and a clean water supply for granted.  We need to raise revenue, not just from commercial entities, to pay for new infrastructure.  This legislation is unavoidable.  Nobody wants to levy additional charges on people, but there is a clear rationale as to why it is necessary.</p></speech>

I have strong views about water.  In my county currently, one in every four people cannot drink the water from the tap.  I believe, therefore, that I would be abdicating my responsibility as a public representative if I did not come into the House to express their concerns and anger in regard to what is going on in our county and in many other communities around the country.  At this time there are 30 communities around the country with a boil-water notice in place.  It is important that their issues are raised here.</p><p>  The way this House is being treated and the way this legislation is being rammed through is a disgrace.  The excuse that it must be completed by 1 January is pathetic.  It could just as easily be 1 February if we wanted, to allow for proper debate and proper consultation in the national Parliament on the issue.  A couple of months ago in the debate that took place on the Seanad we were told how important this Chamber was, but now we are being insulted with what is going on today.</p><p>  Leaving that aside, we have 30 communities where there is a boil-water notice in place and one in four people in my county cannot drink tap water.  For the past three years there has been a boil-water notice in place for the town of Castlerea.  These people face at least another 12 months of boiling water before their issue is resolved.  This is not good enough.  It is not good enough in this day and age that people must tolerate this situation.  It is not just that the water is not safe to drink.  At certain times of the year, the water coming from the taps looks more like stout than water.  The idea of people having to pay for water that they cannot use to brush their teeth is unacceptable.</p><p>  I have submitted an amendment to this Bill, but it will not be accepted.  However, it should have been properly debated in the House.  My amendment was to provide that where there is a boil-water notice in place, people should not have to pay for that water.  I hope the Minister of State will consider this proposal before the legislation is rammed through the House.  Not only would this give some acknowledgement to the people who have had to live for years with a boil-water notice, it would also put pressure on Irish Water to ensure it upgrades supplies in those particular areas as a priority.  It is not good enough that people must wait months and years before a boil-water notice is lifted from their supply.  This is not a Third World country.  We are supposed to be a first world country, but we cannot drink the water from our taps because it is not good enough.  It is a gross insult to these people for legislation to be put through the House that will introduce water charges for water that people cannot drink or use to brush their teeth.</p><p>  I do not have a major difficulty with what is proposed in the legislation, once water and wastewater services remain in public ownership and are fully accountable to this Parliament and to local authorities around the country.  It is a damning indictment of what is happening that we cannot have a proper debate here on such an important issue, on what is a basic human right.  It is imperative that the legislation include a provision to allocate an adequate unmetered allowance of water for every person in the country to meet basic daily needs.  This is not included in the legislation and that is a significant flaw.  It should be included.  People should have the right to water as a fundamental right.</p><p>  On the issue of metering, I ask the Minister of State, in his summing up, to justify the introduction of metering.  He will make the argument that the objective behind metering is water conservation, and none of us could disagree with the need to try to cut wastage or unnecessary use of water.  However, the difficulty is that one-third of homes in this country will not be metered but will have a flat rate charge applied to them.  Can the Minister of State explain how a flat-rate charge will improve conservation?  We were told this was the ethos behind metering, but if one-third of houses will not have a meter installed, how can we talk of conservation?  These houses are in rural areas.  How is the flat rate to be calculated?  Will it be based on the size of the house, the size of the household or geographic location?  How will it be calculated?  There are massive variations in the flat rate charge in the United Kingdom.</p><p>  Another proposal included in the legislation is a charge for water going in and water going out.  When we dealt with the septic tank legislation earlier this year, the Minister stated in black and white at the Oireachtas committee that there would be no charge for water going out.  However, there is specific provision for this in the initial draft of the legislation.</p><p>It is being rammed through so quickly that no one has had an opportunity to see the subsequent drafts.  In the original draft of the Bill as published, provision is made for charging for water out.  How can the Minister of State justify this when the Minister gave a categoric commitment on the public record at a committee meeting there would not be a charge for water out?  Not only will people have to pay for the water that comes out of the taps, but they will also have to pay for flushing the toilet.</p></speech>

It is not mentioned that it is specifically for that purpose, and I have a difficulty with it.</p><p>  I agree there is a need for co-ordination.  I fully accept this because I know of the difficulty in my area.  Within 15 miles we have three separate water authorities.  With joined-up thinking the level of investment required would be significantly less.  Roscommon County Council submitted proposals to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to augment its public supplies through a link to the adjoining local authority so that if the public water supply decreased or was contaminated it could borrow water from the adjacent local authority.  The Department specifically refused to allow for augmentation of supply even between systems in one local authority, never mind across county boundaries.  If the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government had lived up to its responsibilities with regard to co-ordination we would have a far more effective system in place and there might not have been a need for this agency to be established in its current guise.  It would significantly reduce the overall cost of investment, as a result of which the overall cost of producing water would also be reduced.</p><p>  On average 145 litres of water are used on a daily basis in a household.  One fifth of this is used for washing machines, one third is used for showers and baths and just under one third is used for toilets.  The discretionary amount is relatively small.  What is the scale of leakage before water comes to the householder and after it goes across the threshold?  What provision will be made in this regard?  I received a phenomenal water bill after the meter had been installed and the damage turned out to be just inside the meter.  What will happen to people in this situation?  What discretion will be provided to ensure people do not end up with phenomenal bills?  Will the meters be read regularly?  Will we have a statutory situation whereby, like electricity meters, they must be read once or twice a year and other meter readings are estimates?  People receive phenomenal electricity bills, which cause huge financial hardship for many families.  Will the same happen with water when it is metered?  Will bills be based on estimated usage?  Coming up to Christmas, will people will receive the mother and father of all bills for the previous year?  Many questions about the legislation need to be answered, and it is a disgrace that it is being rammed through and that we will not get answers to these issues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-12-19a.351" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1105" speakername="Anne Ferris" time="13:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013121900027#Z00400"><p>Whatever the extent of our water problems in Ireland, it is important to remember that they are of a different scale from the daily struggle facing the part of the world which has no access to clean water.  We are lucky in Ireland that access to clean drinking water is, in general and in most situations, taken for granted.  According to the World Health Organization, more than 1 billion people have no access to any type of clean drinking water.  Nelson Mandela, whom we remembered with such respect a week ago, rightly placed water and work together as pillars of human life in his often-quoted statement, "Let there be work, bread, water and salt for all".</p><p>  At the root of the legislation before us is a desire to ensure access to safe and clean drinking water for all citizens at all times directly from the household tap.  It is also, to return to Nelson Mandela's quote, about creating and maintaining jobs in the water services sector and in the industries and businesses dependent on a secure and safe supply of water, including hotels, restaurants, bars, garages, laundries and hairdressing shops.</p><p>  At present we have a water service which is unequal.  In parts of Ireland we have a service that cannot always be guaranteed to be plentiful or pure enough for human consumption without boiling.  Deputy Naughten mentioned his area.  In my constituency of Wicklow, no less than six water schemes have been the subject of boil-water notices for the past three months or longer, including Stranakelly and Mullans North, which are near Tinahely; Ballysallagh, near Hacketstown; Roscath; and Johnstown South and Kilbride, which are in Arklow.</p><p>  In case anyone is under the illusion that a boil-water notice is an invitation to put on the kettle, it is worth considering some of the onerous contents of the boil-water notices imposed on communities throughout Ireland.  Householders under a boil notice must boil all water before cooling for consumption, including for drinking, preparing salads, brushing teeth, sterilising babies' bottles and making baby feeds.  They are advised not to use a dishwasher as it will not heat the water sufficiently to kill the contaminating bacteria in the polluted water.  Some parts of Ireland have been under boil-water notices for several years.</p><p>  Some people in Ireland do not have a secure supply of water of any quality.  We had a flavour of this on the east coast for more than a week in early November when rivers and groundwater were at their highest and water should have been in plentiful supply, but the citizens of Dublin had limited access to water.  Water supplies in County Wicklow were also affected that week because of the ridiculous situation whereby Wicklow pays Dublin for a water supply to the north of the county even though Wicklow directly services Dublin with 15% of its water via the Roundwood reservoir and up to 40% of its water via the Liffey with no financial gain to County Wicklow.  When Dublin is without a water supply, the supply to north Wicklow is also at risk.</p><p>  For one reason or another Dublin has been without an adequate water supply on too many occasions in recent years.  A European capital city in a climate such as ours should not suffer from a lack of water in the 21st century.  Neither should it be the case that people in some Irish communities receive polluted water to their taps.  There is a problem of water supply and water inequality in the country which can no longer be ignored and must be addressed in a uniform and focused manner which can only come from a single management structure.</p><p>  I want to send a strong note of caution about the operation of Irish Water.  Under no circumstances should it ever be assumed that in voting on this legislation Members of the D&aacute;il have given a free pass to Irish Water to pass on costs to the consumer.  In this regard I welcome the oversight role of the Commission for Energy Regulation and the need for the regulator to approve any schemes of charging for water.  I ask the Minister of State to give strong consideration to instructing the regulator to exempt from any charge people with restricted or low-quality water supply.  The people of Wicklow should be allowed to use their own low-cost Roundwood water rather than be involved in any elaborate plan to bring water to Dublin from the River Shannon.  It is critical for the Minister and the Department to exercise their oversight role with regard to internal costs incurred by the new Irish Water entity.  Oscar Wilde, who drank a lot of Wicklow water in his time, commented that the British turned their wine into water.</p></speech>

The new semi-state body should be tightly controlled to ensure it does not become a gravy train in the manner of other publicly financed entities recently discussed in the media.  It is very important a tight rein is kept on the remuneration of the board and executives of Irish Water.  In this regard I urge the Ministers, Deputies Hogan and Howlin, to start as they mean to go on and immediately issue a strong directive to Irish Water on cost control.</p></speech>

We heard Deputy Naughten say that one in four people in Roscommon were without proper, clean drinking water and Deputy Ferris talking about boil notices.  This gives one some understanding of the disastrous level of water infrastructure we have.  In recent years Dublin has experienced a loss of water supply.</p><p> It must be difficult for the Minister of State to sit and watch the so-called Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, leading a walk-out from the Chamber on the Bill.  He was a Minister in the previous Administration which failed to make an investment in this critical infrastructure.  That Administration made the deal with the troika, including a commitment to introduce this legislation by 1 January 2014.  With false indignation, he led a walk-out followed by the protest before people brigade.  I find it particularly sickening that a man who sat at the Cabinet table and led the country in such a disastrous way and allowed it to go broke - the Government is picking up the pieces after such disastrous decisions - can stand up and say he will not debate.  He has run away with his toys and refused to debate the issue.  Perhaps it was too problematic for him to sit in the Chamber having realised he had sat in the Cabinets that had failed to invest in vital infrastructure and make sure there were proper pipes under the ground and a proper water supply.  This was well described by Deputy Denis Naughten who remained in the Chamber to make these points.</p><p> I am a Dublin-based Deputy and we do not have to pay for our water supply.  I sat in on the hearings of the environment committee and listened to the representatives of many group water schemes who had been paying for water for decades and they could not understand why people in urban areas were so anti the purchasing of water.  Then there were Fianna F&aacute;il, the Progressive Democrats, the Green Party or whatever other grouping Bertie Ahern used to drag around him following his private deals when he gave little benefits and bonuses to Independent Members who had backed him.  Perhaps some Independents got money for the CRC.  Have we not seen where the money ended up?</p><p> I refer briefly to the problems affecting the capital city and do not say this with a m&eacute; f&eacute;in attitude that Dublin should come first.  In Dublin 60% of all taxation is collected.  Dublin is a regional city and now stretches from Bray and Arklow on one side to Drogheda and Dundalk on the other.  The Minister of State knows the number of people who commute into the city every day to work.  The region stretches as far as Mullingar to the west.  We are competing with London, Manchester and Paris for foreign direct investment.  IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland have done well in attracting foreign direct investment that will create jobs we need and income to provide services for the people.  It is not good enough for a capital city that competes against European countries and cities to have a water emergency.  There is certainly a need for long-term planning.  We are heading into the local elections and will hear many candidates say we cannot pay for water and that they will not pay for it.  I ask them to put up or shut up.  How can we modernise the water system and have a world class infrastructure to supply water to the people?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-12-19a.361" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1033" speakername="Kevin Humphreys" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013121900028#AA00700"><p>I will be brief.  I ask the Minister for State to have discussions with Irish Water to prioritise a water supply for the Leinster area by 2020.  The last crowd failed to plan for the future.  The Government is prepared to look outside election cycles and not to be concerned with whether it is re-elected.  We are concerned about putting in place a good infrastructure that will serve the people well.  We will not have boil notices or water crises and we certainly will not walk out of the House and fail to debate.  What I witnessed earlier was a disgrace in a democracy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-12-19a.362" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1182" speakername="Terence Flanagan" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013121900028#AA00800"><p>I very much welcome the Bill.  I fully accept the principle that the polluter should pay.  The timing and introduction of the Bill is difficult considering the economic circumstances and the financial hardship families are experiencing, with budgets being tight and so on.  Price control and ensuring the consumer is not exploited through increased water charges in coming years are crucial.  Regulation and maintaining prices at a low level for the consumer are important, as Deputy Martin Ferris said.</p><p>  Ireland is the only OECD country not to charge for water.  The introduction of water charges will change people's behaviour and ensure greater conservation of water.  During periods of the year when rainfall is low, water conservation is important, particularly when demand increases because of warm and humid weather.  Internationally, up to 15% less water is used when people are charged for the privilege of having a water supply.  As an island nation, we are surrounded by water, but the treatment of water is the crucial issue.  More than &euro;1.2 billion is spent on treating water annually.  We use the same water to wash our teeth, clean our cars and flush our toilets, which is all wrong from an environmental point of view.  That behaviour will change in the future.</p><p>  It is necessary to greatly improve the water infrastructure throughout the country but particularly in Dublin, as Deputy Kevin Humphreys said.  The city has a leaky, Victorian era system and there has been under-investment in infrastructure for many years.  With money being ring-fenced to address this issue, such investment will take place in the future.  The population of Dublin is projected to increase by 1 million in the coming years and a proper water supply will be necessary to meet this demand.</p><p>  I welcome the legislation.  Consumers should not be charged if there is dirty water in their household supply and it is not drinkable  That needs to be provided for in the legislation.  I refer to what happened in Galway in the past.  Providing for the polluter pays principle is welcome.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-12-19a.363" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/971" speakername="Joe O'Reilly" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013121900028#AA00900"><p>I accept the concept of metering and payment for the supply for water from the point of view of conservation of water, the maintenance of a proper infrastructure and general equity, but as I accept the principle, it is also important to have a robust household allowance system in place.  That is provided for in the programme for Government and will be defined in a budgetary context each year.  There must be an adequate household allowance.  </p><p>  I acknowledge the location of the regional headquarters of Irish Water in Cavan town and I am proud of that achievement.  I am also proud of our county council team and former executives of the council who had an outstanding record in the delivery of water services and so on, which resulted in the headquarters being located in Cavan.</p><p>Our current team on the county council and past executives had an outstanding record in delivering water services.  I am pleased, therefore, that the headquarters will be coming to Cavan.</p><p> While I acknowledge that difficulties arise for Dublin, it is important that local authorities continue to have a role in planning and that counties such as Cavan and Monaghan will have adequate resources to provide infrastructure for the maintenance and delivery of water services.  Local democratic input is important and resources should be distributed to every corner of the country.</p></speech>

I appreciate that we have limited time but I wish to respond to the issues raised.  This Bill has to be passed by the end of this session because if it were not in place on 1 January, local authorities would have responsibility for the entire water infrastructure but would have no means of paying for it.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-12-19a.371" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1069" speakername="Fergus O'Dowd" time="13:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013121900029#BB00800"><p>I did not interrupt the Deputy in the way he is now doing.  Deputies Cowen and Stanley raised the important issues of water poverty and ability to pay.  These issues will be dealt with by the Government.  The questions about the free allowance and affordability are also important and will be dealt with in a transparent manner long before the first bill comes through the door.  As the bills will not arrive until the first quarter of 2015, there will be plenty of time in the coming 12 months to address these issues and I will ensure they are addressed.</p><p>  On the question of a code of conduct with regard to those who may have difficulties paying their bills, that will be dealt with by the CER.  The protocols that will have to be in place for water restrictions and dealing with people in arrears will be developed by the CER in a transparent and open way and will be discussed in the D&aacute;il.</p><p>  The debate in the Seanad lasted more than ten hours and we covered a wide range of issues.  An Oireachtas committee is the appropriate forum for Irish Water, the regulator and me to discuss the issues arising.  That will allow the system to be made accountable to the Oireachtas once the legislation is in place.  We are giving power to the CER to perform certain tasks and it will be consulting widely with the public and reporting to an Oireachtas committee.</p><p>  Deputy Higgins outlined his view of the process.  Any search of the Internet would show that the Cuba of Fidel Castro not only operates public-private partnerships but also has attracted foreign direct investment into the water system in Havana.  In the great Mao Zedong's country there are water charges and water meters.</p><p>  I appreciate that Deputy Wallace may not have been aware that an amendment was introduced in the Seanad to copperfasten the existing legislation, which states that there can be no privatisation.  The Ministers for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and the Environment, Community and Local Government cannot alienate their shares.  There is no way for Irish Water to be privatised.  This is a core issue for everybody in this House.</p><p>  Deputy Naughten raised the issue of leakage on the supply side.  The first fix will be free.  There will not be an additional burden in this regard.  The literature on metering around the world clearly indicates that metering conserves water by allowing for the identification of leakages that are in private and domestic parts of the supply network.  Metering also reduces water usage.  As Deputies who live in rural areas will be aware, group water schemes can attest to the significant reductions in water usage through the use of metering.  Kilmeena group water scheme in County Mayo won an award for achieving savings of up to 70%.</p><p>  Deputies Naughten and Luke 'Ming' Flanagan expressed concern about potable water in County Roscommon.  Irish Water should not be allowed to charge for water supplies that are subject to restrictions on health grounds.  This is why the Act gives the Minister power to make directions in this regard.  I have no doubt that people who do not have access to a safe and healthy supply of water should not and will not be charged for it.  County Roscommon is affected by approximately 90% of the boil-water notices issued nationally.  These notices pertain to issues such as contamination by E. coli or cryptosporidium, excess lead or copper, inadequate disinfection and nitrate pollution.  This is a serious issue, but the Act will ensure that everybody in this country has access to a potable water supply that meets their needs.  They will be charged a fair amount for their water and every household will have a free allowance.  Measures will be introduced for people who cannot afford to pay and people with health issues will also be dealt with.  The only way we can make this new system work is by ensuring it is transparent, accountable and fair.</p><p>  Approximately &euro;30 million will have to be found to improve water supplies in Cork.  The Bill will address that issue and it will also improve the water supply in the greater Dublin area.  It has been estimated that we will have to find more than &euro;500 million to ensure Dublin's water supplies are adequate to meet demand.  Demand and supply are almost in equilibrium at present, which was why water was turned off at night when a serious problem arose several weeks ago.</p><p>  Some speakers have suggested that local authorities will lose powers.  At present a business in County Wicklow is paying twice as much for its water as a comparable business in County Kildare.  There is a vast difference in prices among the 34 water authorities around the country.  We have to ensure cost convergence for the commercial world so that people will not lose out.  The charge for domestic consumption will be the same in every part of the country.  </p><p>  The issues of safety and health will be dealt with.  Major cities such as Dublin and Cork will have adequate and proper water supplies.  The system will be fair.  There is a plan to augment the water supply between the River Shannon and urban conurbations of a particular size.  This is the future for our country.</p><p>We have a great deal of water here but, unfortunately, we are not in the right place in terms of treatment, supply etc.  We are ensuring that in future in this country we will have the capacity to attract water-intensive industries.  Companies in the ICT sector, the pharmaceutical-chemical sector or the agricultural sector will come to Ireland because we will ensure this is the place to come.  I was in England recently, and last year, in the autumn, there was drought in parts of England.  We have a major role to play here in attracting industry and I am happy that this is part of this process.</p><p> The strength of the Oireachtas is not only in this House but in the committees.  As I said in the Seanad, I am happy to attend meetings of those committees at any time to discuss outstanding issues.  I have no problem with that.  Irish Water must come before the committees and so must the Commission for Energy Regulation, which is on the record as saying it wants to be proactive in its communication as soon as possible in this regard.  I hope I can answer on Committee Stage all of the questions that remain unanswered from some Deputies, but the Oireachtas committees will be a tower of strength in getting these answers, so that people can be happy that TDs, notwithstanding the issues raised today, will have the capacity and power to get the answers to those questions that remain in their minds.  I am confident, notwithstanding the pressure on all of us here because of the troika, that this is fair and equitable, and I look forward to Committee Stage.</p></speech>

It would be a huge imposition on councils if they had to continue to fund these pensions as they fund the pensions of staff from within their own resources.  Such an imposition would present a huge bill for them.  I would like the Minister of State to indicate how the matter will be dealt with.  Will the pensions bill be transferred to Irish Water or will the councils be compensated for its payment?  It is an unreasonable proposition that councils continue to pay from their scant resources the pensions of staff transferred from them.</p></speech>

The Bill provides that the payment of accrued pension benefits to local authority staff who transfer to Irish Water or Uisce &Eacute;ireann, either now or following the termination of a service level agreement, will not be imposed on city and council councils.  Councils will not have to pay.</p><p>  The service level agreement will provide for the payment by Uisce &Eacute;ireann of existing water service pensioners for the duration of the agreement.  I confirm that the County and City Managers Association which has been centrally involved at all times in every aspect of the Bill in the oversight of the reform programme has also been given very clear commitments by my Department.  These commitments address other pension liabilities in respect of water service employees who, on the termination of a service level agreement, opt to remain in employment with a council rather than transfer to Irish Water.  I hope that satisfactorily answers the Deputy's question.</p></speech>

While all of us in local authority areas in all constituencies accept the great priority of the city of Dublin in terms of population and its particular difficulties and while we are all in favour of dealing with it, we are afraid that in the process of dealing with it, without strong participation by local authorities in planning, rural areas in Cavan and Monaghan and similar constituencies will lose out in terms of infrastructure and support because of the real needs of Dublin.  We are not for a moment suggesting that its real needs should not be addressed, but we need a mechanism within legislation to ensure one is not done to the detriment of another.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-12-19a.385" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1069" speakername="Fergus O'Dowd" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013121900032#EE00200"><p>That is an important point.  Irish Water is obliged under legislation to consult with every local authority and to examine and get involved in discussions about county development plans, regional development plans and national plans.  Irish Water has given a commitment, which it will follow up after 1 January, to have meetings with local authority members around the country on a regional basis.  Each elected member will have an official of the county council working in the water services area as a contact point under the service level agreement.  There will be direct access and information for councillors.  If issues arise with regard to the plan, councillors will be consulted.  When there are problems with the water supply, councillors will receive text messages and immediate and urgent communication.  If the councillor wishes to contact Irish Water directly on its 1850 number, there will be a direct number for elected members.  They will be satisfied that they are able to communicate instantly.  Some years ago, when water supplies froze in many cities and towns, councillors had such access, and this will now continue.  I am confident that the Deputy will be satisfied with my reply.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-12-19a.386" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/977" speakername="Michael McNamara" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013121900032#EE00300"><p>I thank the Minister of State for his clarification of an issue that is of concern across the country as well as in Cavan-Monaghan.  Irish Water has adopted a policy of refusing to answer questions to councillors in County Clare.  That is my understanding, although I am not a member of Clare County Council.  It is a relatively small matter.  Of greater importance is that Irish Water will continue to answer questions from councillors in the future, so that this is not just an <i>ad hoc</i> policy.  Irish Water should be accountable to elected representatives at local level or in the Oireachtas.  In Shannon, local representatives encountered difficulty recently in getting answers from the EPA.  I would not like to see that replicated.  We all hear about difficulties getting answers from the HSE, and the aim of this Government, unlike previous Governments, is not to set up unaccountable quangos.  It is to set up organisations that provide national co-ordination but are accountable to elected representatives.  What statutory provision ensures that Irish Water is accountable and provides answers to local or national elected representatives?</p></speech>

Irish Water and local authorities will establish local points of contact in keeping with the expectations of elected representatives.  The contact point will be a local official who knows the water services.  I mentioned a hotline for councillors.  In addition to these reactive measures, Uisce &Eacute;ireann intends to develop a proactive communication system with elected representatives, including SMS alerts of operational activities or incidents, regular briefings and information on significant milestones, and proactive engagement on the development of major capital infrastructure.  The metering regional communications team will continue to be a point of contact.</p><p>  Irish Water will be required to submit an annual report that will be laid before the Oireachtas, which can debate it in the House.  If requested by Oireachtas committees to appear, Irish Water is obliged to come in to discuss issues.  I was not aware of the situation in County Clare but I will bring it to the attention of my officials.  I will get a response for the Deputy.  The key is that there is accountability through Parliament.</p><p>  Accountability also exists through the Commission for Energy Regulation.  When Irish Water produces its development plan for water infrastructure, it will provide it to the energy regulator, which must go through it line by line and examine and analyse the cost of operations in detail.  It will be a public document open for public debate and discussion.  Before the regulator makes a decision, the document will be in the public domain and everyone will have an opportunity to make comments.  It is critical that we have this level of communication.  Every indication from the regulator, whom I met yesterday, and Irish Water is that it will happen.  While the regulator's decision cannot be changed and we do not have the power to do so, the Government can direct Irish Water or the regulator to do certain things in matters of Government policy.</p><p>  I appreciate the weakness in the HSE which led to the current situation.  I am convinced by the commitments we have and by the independent regulator, who will assert independence and accountability and will be proactive in communicating and putting out information.  While the Bill will probably pass today, we have one year to get the detail of how it will work correct.  We can tease out these issues between now and then and I am confident that we will satisfy people on these points.</p></speech>

My concern is not what will happen under this Government but the legislative provision to ensure a local point of contact responsible for receiving questions and providing answers.  It cannot be something that ceases with this Government; it must be an imposition on Irish Water into the future.  Can the Minister of State point to a provision in statute that guarantees this into the future?  I am comforted by what the Minister of State proposes and I accept it will happen but I am less confident of what will happen in the future.  Members are here to provide law that pertains to the provision of water services into the future.  I would like to see it guaranteed.  Will the Minister of State introduce an amendment on Report Stage if there is no such provision?</p></speech>

In developing that plan, Irish Water shall take account of the water services strategic plan prepared under section 26 and a range of other policy considerations and, specifically, local area plans, regional planning guidelines and strategic development zones.  Before preparing an investment plan, Irish Water will be required to consult with the EPA, regional bodies in respect of whose functional areas the investment plan is likely to apply and each planning authority in respect of whose functional area the investment plan is likely to apply.  Copies of the investment plan must be submitted by Irish Water to the regional and planning authorities.</p></speech>

There is no legislative provision for elected representatives to be able to ask questions and receive answers.  If we are not elected to ask questions and receive answers, what are we doing here and what do we expect elected representatives to do in future?  We are taking away democratic accountability on water services, which rests currently with local authorities, and replacing it with no democratic accountability.  Will the Minister of State please accept an amendment to make Irish Water accountable?  Surely accountability is part of what this Government is about.</p></speech>

Uisce &Eacute;ireann will be accountable to the Oireachtas through the annual report, just like Irish Rail and other semi-State companies such as Bord G&aacute;is and Bord na M&oacute;na.  That report is laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas, so there is no question of the Deputy or anybody else not being able to come in here and ask questions of Irish Water about any issue.  The annual report will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and will be a matter for discussion.  There is no issue of the Deputy not being able to ask questions, write to this body or otherwise communicate with it.  Representatives can be brought before committees.  I do not see a problem in this respect.  As Irish Water has a development there must be consultation with other bodies.  There is no question in my mind about the body being accountable and having an acceptable plan.</p><p>  At the other end of the argument one might assume there is a problem that is not being dealt with by the Government, a Minister or the Oireachtas.  In the legislation there is power for the Minister to direct on matters of Government policy, although he or she cannot interfere in certain other matters.  That directive would only come in exceptional and unusual circumstances.</p></speech>

If the water is cut off in Scarriff, Dundalk or any other area, or if the water is discoloured, as Deputy Luke 'Ming' Flanagan pointed out so dramatically this morning, the water services engineers can be brought in before the county council to explain what is happening.  There is no such procedure for a local representative to ask what is happening with water in their area when Irish Water has responsibility.  There is no provision for a national representative to ask about this either.</p><p>  If a train does not operate between Dublin and Drogheda, a Deputy has no power to ask why it did not operate.  A local elected representative does not have that power either, and perhaps they should not have that power.  We are talking about the provision of a service as basic as water, and we are asking people to pay increasing water charges and other charges for local services.  At the same time we are asking people to pay more, we are providing less accountability, with fewer possibilities to hold a body accountable for the services provided.  Unfortunately, that is not progress.</p></speech>

I will give an example from my experience.  The Deputy's party is part of the Government but I sat as part of the Opposition for a number of years, and in that time we ensured that representatives of Irish Rail came in week after week before an Oireachtas committee in order to deal with issues like audits and other operational issues germane and important to elected representatives and the Oireachtas as a whole.  In fairness, then Senator Ross and I pursued the matter with great vigour.  It is wrong to say that Uisce &Eacute;ireann will not be accountable to the House.  As a Deputy I had every opportunity to bring officials from similar companies before committees time and again, and as a member of such a committee there was no bar to the questioning.  In fairness to the Irish Rail representatives, they came in time and again.</p><p>  Deputy McNamara's contribution has also lost sight of the fact that there is a 12-year service level agreement between Clare County Council and Uisce &Eacute;ireann.  For each one of those 12 long years, Clare County Council will be carrying on its functions for Uisce &Eacute;ireann, acting as its agent.  Every councillor sitting on an elected body in County Clare can at any meeting raise any issues he or she likes.  As I have already stated, he or she will also have a dedicated person on the county council who will deal solely with water services to answer any questions.  If the elected representative is dissatisfied with this - as is his or her entitlement - there is the option to ring Uisce &Eacute;ireann on a dedicated line.  He or she would have absolute access to all information at all times.  Uisce &Eacute;ireann must consult with all elected authorities and have due regard to the development and regional plans.  There is also a national picture.  The Deputy is wrong on all counts.</p></speech>

The Minister of State knows in his heart that what he said is true.  Deputy McNamara was wrong on one point, however.  He gave an example relating to the HSE.  While I agree there is huge difficulty in getting accountability from the HSE, at least in the legislation relating to the HSE, there is a legal responsibility on the Executive to respond to parliamentary questions.  There is no such legal responsibility in this legislation<i> vis-&agrave;-vis </i>Irish Water.  </p><p>  This typifies what has gone on here today.  There is no accountability with regard to the passage of this legislation, with only minutes allowed to ram it through.  There has been no legitimate debate on the Bill and there will be no mechanism to hold Irish Water to account once it is passed.  The Minister of State has said that its representatives can appear before the Oireachtas committee.  In the past Oireachtas committees worked far more effectively than they do now.  If one asks the members of the Committee on Health and Children if they are satisfied with the level of accountability from the HSE and they will say &quot;no&quot;.  Every single member will tell one that but the HSE has a legal responsibility, underpinned by legislation, to answer parliamentary questions. Irish Water will not have such a responsibility.  That is a fundamental flaw in this legislation and it is for that reason alone that I will be opposing the passage of this Bill.  What is going on here is a farce.  </p><p> One in four people in Roscommon has a boil water notice at the moment and I fundamentally disagree with them being charged for water.  It is morally wrong and this legislation facilitates the imposition of charges on those people.  The Minister of State said that he can direct Irish Water not to charge those people but there is nothing in the legislation that says that if people cannot drink the water coming from their taps, they do not have to pay for it.  I want that written into the legislation.  It is a basic human right and that provision should be written into the Bill - if one cannot drink it, one does not pay for it.  It is as simple as that.  It is wrong that such a provision is not being written into the legislation.  I urge the Minister to concede and accept the amendment I have tabled.</p><p>  People should have a legal right to an allocation of water for which they do not have to pay.  Access to water is a human right and people should legitimately have access to some water free of charge.  The Minister of State may say that is the Government's intention but again, there is nothing in the legislation to guarantee it.  What we have is a facilitating Bill that allows Irish Water to do whatever it likes.  It will produce an annual report and then get a nod and a wink through the committee, one day a year, but it will not be accountable to these Houses.  What Deputy McNamara has said should set off alarm bells for every single Member of this House.  If the elected members of Clare County Council cannot get answers from Irish Water today, before the legislation has even been enacted, what chance will they have after it passes when there is no provision for accountability in the Bill?  The Minister of State can give all the commitments he likes but he knows that unless it is in black and white, in legislation, it will not happen.  The Minister of State also knows that were it not for the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, many of the scandals in our health system would never have been exposed.  They were not exposed through parliamentary questions because one cannot get answers to such questions.  They were not exposed through questioning by Oireachtas committee members because answers were not forthcoming at committee meetings either.  The Minister of State used the freedom of information tool very effectively.  He was one of the most competent members of the Opposition in the last D&aacute;il because of his ability to use that particular tool.  We should, as a basic right, ensure that it is written into legislation that Irish Water has to answer questions, whether those questions are from Clare County Council, Roscommon County Council or any other council.  Someone must be answerable for the fact that the people of Castlerea, Boyle and south Roscommon cannot drink their water but could, after this legislation is enacted, be charged for that undrinkable water.  The Minister of State will stand up, no doubt, and say he intends to issue a directive to Irish Water but if it is his intention to do so, he should put it into the legislation.   That is the only way communities in Ireland will be assured of a decent water supply.  It is the one gun that can be put to the head of Irish Water - if it does not sort out water supply problems, it will not get paid.  It is the only way that I can ensure that the people in my county can drink the water that is coming through their taps.  The people of Castlerea have had to tolerate poor water quality for the last three years.  Many more will have to tolerate it for a minimum of 12 months and it is simply not good enough.  Some 90% of the people in this country who cannot drink the water from their taps are living in my home county.  It is not good enough that legislation will be enacted here that could lead to them being charged for that water even though they cannot even use it to brush their teeth.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-12-19a.454" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1184" speakername="Billy Timmins" time="14:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013121900035#HH00600"><p>I support Deputy Naughten's amendment.  I acknowledge the work the Minister of State has done in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  He is a hard working, honest individual and as Deputy Naughten pointed out, when he was in opposition he elicited an enormous amount of information from statutory bodies, not because of them but in spite of them.  That must be acknowledged but, having said that, this legislation epitomises everything that is wrong with our political system.  I deeply regret that individual Members and political parties have chosen to boycott this debate but I understand why they have done so.  I have sought debating time to discuss the Seanad referendum result, which has not happened.  I have also called for a debate on the Smithwick tribunal report relating to alleged collusion between members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and terrorist groups.  The tribunal lasted for almost decade but its final report has not been discussed in this Chamber yet.  It is a farce.</p><p>  One of the biggest political issues confronting me at the moment is that of pylons and Eirgrid.  When I attend public meetings on the issue, public representatives, both local and national, stand up and say they have no control, authority or power.  They say the pylons should not be erected, that they do not agree with it but that the mechanism to allow it developed over a period of time.  Here we are today, passing the very same type of legislation as that which allows Eirgrid to determine how it supplies electricity.  This Bill will take control and accountability away from elected representatives.  </p><p>  The basic principle of water charges is something which many Members of this House support.  There has been much discussion about the idea of a free allowance per household, with the charge set at x, y or z.  We are going to pass legislation today but no Member of this House will be able to tell any member of the public what the allowance or the charges will be.  All we will be able to say is that the legislation has been passed, Irish Water exists and section 16 or section 17 gives the power to the Minister to formulate the charges but we do not know what they will be.  Mark my words, this legislation is going to cause untold difficulty and hardship.  Even in 20 years time we will not have 80% or 90% of households metered.  Water metering was introduced in Britain a number of years ago but to date, the authorities there have not managed to install all of the meters required.  We do not have access to high speed broadband in all parts of this country yet so I do not know how we will get all of the meters installed.  </p><p>  The main flaw in this legislation is that it is giving a blank cheque to the Minister and Irish Water.  It is a pig in a poke and it is centralising authority.  One of the big selling points for the recently introduced local property tax was that the moneys raised would go to local authorities to provide local services.  What happened in reality was that &euro;600 million was signed over from the local authorities to another central agency.  No one has any control or power over this.  </p><p>It is not satisfactory that while we are talking about better local government and introducing powers to make the D&aacute;il more accountable, this Bill is handing power out of this Chamber and away from local authorities to an unaccountable body.</p><p> Another issue arises locally due to the increase in local authority rents.  Deputy Naughten stated that if the water supply is not drinkable people should not pay.  The same principle should apply to local authority houses.  If work is in progress, houses are being renovated or a scheme has proven to be disastrous - as is the case in Glen Ding estate in Blessington - that should be taken into account.  If the Minister or any staff member from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government were to go to Glen Ding estate in Blessington they would find scaffolding and plaster off the walls.  I regret to say it is like the worst estate in Calcutta although it is only six or seven years old.  Residents are being asked to pay rent and they face a rent increase.  I urge the Minister of State to use his good offices to ensure that where there are difficulties with estates local authorities right across the country will not introduce rent increases until the problems are solved.  If a local authority was inspecting a house for the RAS process or a health and safety officer was inspecting it for private rental the proprietor would be in front of the courts.</p><p> I was not present for the Second Stage debate but if I heard the statistic correctly, it was said that 90% of people nationally who have difficulty with drinking water are in Roscommon.  I do not dispute that there is a major problem in Roscommon, as Deputy Naughten has outlined the position there.  When I checked the relevant website in recent weeks I found that ten areas in Wicklow had boil-water notices.  It is difficult to believe that 90% of people who have difficulty with drinking water come from Roscommon.  I expect the range of people who have a problem with the quality of drinking water is far more extensive than that.  That is one of the reasons I am in favour of the concept of having a national water authority - because it is clear that the system we have at the moment has not worked.  However, we are putting a badly flawed concept in place today.</p><p> I will oppose the Bill not for populist reasons, because I believe in the principle of charging for the service, but because I do not agree with the lack of accountability that is inherent in the new system.  If I meet someone in the street next week I will be able to say that we passed the legislation but I will not be able to inform him or her about the allowances or the charges.  Even when the system is in place I will not have any remit and neither will locally elected representatives.  When we fight election campaigns we urge people to elect a strong voice for Roscommon or for the Boyne Valley, yet when we come to the House we are absolutely powerless.  Time and again we advocate the principle of giving power to unelected and unaccountable bodies.  I am aware of how the water system works at the moment.  Businesses do not have confidence in the concept of a meter outside their door.  They do not know how to check it or how to turn it on or off.  There is confusion about leaks.  We will probably find that the standing charge will be greater than the usage charge.</p><p> One of the selling points of the legislation for people who support it is that we are paying for the water anyway, so let us have accountability and a proper and responsible use of the water supply.  Could the Minister of State explain, in the event of a water charge being introduced, how people will be compensated, given that they are paying for the service already?  Will there be a commensurate drop in income tax or will they pay for it on the double if no reduction is forthcoming?  I would be happy to receive a note on the matter following the debate.  It was stated that if the cost of providing water were allocated to each household the annual charge would be approximately &euro;600 or &euro;700.  The information came to light during the debate in the Seanad.  We owe it to the people who elected us to clarify the position.  It is not right that we are expected to support a measure when we do not know what is involved and on which we have no assurance that in future we will be any better informed.  That is totally unsatisfactory.</p><p> I lost the Fine Gael whip earlier this year due to my stance on an important piece of legislation.  I have never been able to ascertain how the programme for Government was changed behind closed doors in spite of several parliamentary questions and requests for information.  The issue was glossed over.  It is not something in which the media or anyone else has a great interest but I feel it is a futile exercise coming to the House.  I strongly support Deputy Naughten&rsquo;s amendment.</p><p> I deeply regret that others have sought to boycott the Chamber.  When we were in opposition we did it but the difficulty is that one has to come back at some stage.  One cannot stay out forever.  The legislation before the House is indicative of the lack of accountability.  I take my hat off to the Minister of State, Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd.  He is one of the more accountable, responsible and apolitical Members of this House.  He works for the common good.  I feel for him because he must provide a front for this legislation, which epitomises everything that is bad in our system.  Elected representatives will say in halls and houses in the future that the water services are out of their control and that Irish Water has the power.  Today, we will sign off on another piece of legislation and the public will not be able to understand how it happened.</p></speech>

While I do not necessarily agree with everything they said, it is important that they said it.  I agree that the absence of Members who have been significant players in this economy and who are responsible for the arrival of the troika in the first place is regrettable.  They marched their troops out and then they marched them in for a vote and then marched them out again.  That does not make sense.</p><p>  I accept the points made by the Deputies.  I will deal specifically with Roscommon in the first part of my reply.  As I have clarified, almost 90% of the population currently affected by boil-water notices are in Roscommon.  In addition, information was provided in the note on the Burncourt and Fethard regional water supply scheme, which will address the issue of boil-water notices in south Tipperary.  With regard to Roscommon, the key points are that in November 2013 the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, approved funding of &euro;12 million for the construction of five new water treatment plants and one pumping station for the Arigna, Boyle-Ardcarne, Roscommon central and south Roscommon regional water supply schemes.  In December, the Minister approved funding of &euro;4 million for the construction of interconnecting pipework on the Boyle-Ardcarne and Arigna water supply schemes.</p><p>  Issues have been raised about the Castlerea regional water scheme.  Boil-water notices were issued in November 2009 and the HSE requested that they remain in place as a precautionary measure in February 2010.  Cryptosporidium was found in the water supply.  In November 2011 Roscommon County Council commissioned the installation of a UV disinfection system as an interim measure.  The works were completed in April 2012 and the boil-water notice was subsequently lifted.  In July 2012 Roscommon County Council took the decision to reinstate the boil-water notice as a precautionary measure as the water quality had deteriorated further and the system could not operate effectively outside a validated range.  The long-term solution for the scheme is the installation of a full water treatment plant and the amalgamation of the scheme within the Castlerea urban water supply.  The design review report was approved by the Department in April 2013 and the procurement of consultants to progress the project is under way.</p><p>  As regards the Roscommon central regional water scheme, a boil-water notice was issued on 25 April 2013.  Cryptosporidium was found in the water supply and illnesses were confirmed to the HSE.  The installation of a temporary treatment system was identified as an interim solution.  A package UV treatment plant was installed over a ten-week period.  The final cost of the works was &euro;430,055, and they were 75% funded by the small schemes programme 2013.  The boil-water notice was removed on 9 August 2013 following completion of the works, clear tests on the water supply and no further cases of illness.  The scheme has recently been approved for funding for a new water treatment plant under the four regional water supply schemes.</p><p> Regarding the Boyle-Ardcarne water scheme, a boil water notice was issued on 13 May as cryptosporidium had been found in the water supply and related illnesses had been confirmed by the Health Service Executive.  The notice remains in place as a precautionary measure as there is no cryptosporidium barrier in place.  A direction was issued by the Environmental Protection Agency to ensure a robust treatment scheme would be in place by August 2014.  The scheme has recently been approved for funding as a new water treatment plant coming under the four regional water supply scheme projects.  In addition, approval of the allocation of &euro;4 million was granted for the construction of interconnecting pipeworks.</p><p> Regarding water supplies in south Roscommon, a boil water notice was issued on 24 October for supplies from the Killeglan source as cryptosporidium had been found in the water supply and related illnesses had been confirmed by the HSE.  This is the first such incident confirmed for this water supply.  It should be noted that both sources in the south Roscommon schemes are vulnerable and considered to be very high risk for cryptosporidium contamination.  They have been added to the remedial action list.</p><p> The EPA has audited the supply and Roscommon County Council is awaiting its report.  There is ongoing communication between the HSE and the council.  A decision on how long the boil water notice will remain in place in advance of the new water treatment plant being commissioned has yet to be made.</p><p> Irish Water cannot be blamed for existing water quality problems, whether in County Roscommon, County Clare or wherever else.</p></speech>

Irish Water will be responsible for solving these water quality problems.  Its water quality standards will be subject to supervision by the EPA.  The drinking water regulations are being updated and the EPA will have powers to direct Uisce &Eacute;ireann to take actions to protect drinking water supplies.  Failure to comply will be an offence.</p><p>  I will reflect on the issues raised and discuss them in the Department.  I remind Members opposite that there are other legislative proposals to come.  There is a commitment to provide for a free allowance for households in certain circumstances.  The approach to setting charges will have to be approved by the energy regulator, but it will be fully transparent.  The Commission for Energy Regulation is independent.  It will receive the water charges plan which it will then publish and request observations on it.  At the same time, it will perform due diligence on it.</p><p>  The Minister has powers to direct Irish Water and the regulator to address circumstances such as those in County Roscommon.  There should be no charges for anyone who does not have a water supply that he or she cannot consume without boiling.</p><p>  The Minister recently approved funding for South Tipperary County Council to accept the most economically advantageous tender of over &euro;12 million for the Burncourt and Fethard regional water schemes.  As Deputy Mattie McGrath knows, the quality of water in both schemes does not meet current drinking water standards.  There are boil-water notices in place for both schemes.  The proposed works are designed to remedy these problems.</p></speech>

However, there is a slight error in the information with which he was provided.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government came to Roscommon in 2012 to announce funding for the water schemes in question.  He announced them again in 2013.  It does not make any difference who the Minister is in making the announcements.  It is usual for six or seven announcements to be made over several years before something happens.  Last year there were 40 boil water notices around the country.  Next year and the year after, there will be other boil-water notices.  The Minister has powers that can be - not shall be - used to ensure charges do not apply to consumers affected by these notices.  The Minister of State said there should be no charge for someone who could not drink his or her water supply.  I do not doubt his sincerity.  However, this time next year this will still be an issue and he could be in the Cabinet or in some other Department and not giving a damn about Irish Water.</p></speech>

Is he going to provide a legal exemption from charges for people who cannot drink their water supply - yes or no?  Is he going to legally provide for an allowance for every person in order he or she can meet his or her basic daily water needs - yes or no?  Is he going to legally ensure Irish Water will be accountable to public representatives in local authorities and Oireachtas Members - yes or no?</p><p>  There are many other issues relating to pensions, rights and the transfer of responsibilities which, by right, we should be debating, but we cannot do so because of the way the Bill is being rammed through today.  I know this is against the Minister of State&rsquo;s own principles as a public representative and that if he were on this side of the House, he would be equally animated about this issue.  As the Bill has been drafted, people who cannot drink their water supply will still be charged for it.  There is no guarantee that the allowance will be enough to meet their basic needs.  There is no guarantee that people will not be charged for flushing their toilets.  Neither is there a guarantee that Irish Water will answer legitimate questions from public representatives, be they county councillors or Deputies.  There are also issues relating to pensions, rights and the transfer of responsibilities, significant issues which have been raised by staff and the local authorities.</p><p>The difficulty is that local authorities are asking Irish Water and the Department legitimate questions, but the Minister and the Minister of State cannot answer them.  This Bill is being dealt with today because, according to the Minister of State's own officials, it has been an extremely complex piece of legislation, yet it can be rammed through here in a couple of hours without being properly debated.</p><p> I have given four legitimate reasons for not putting this Bill through today.  I urge the Minister of State, even at the 11th hour, to bring forward a single amendment to change the date from 1 January to 1 July and let us have a proper debate here.  Let us deal with these issues and let us ensure that the Bill that is brought before the House is something over which we can all stand.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, it is not a Christmas present and it has been delivered several Christmases before now.  In fact, that money has been announced and announced and announced since 1988.  When is the contract?  We will welcome the Minister - I call him Big Phil - down to Tipperary to sign that contract to install the facility.  We will even give him a hand because we have to get it before it goes into Irish Water.</p><p>  I fundamentally disagree with the whole concept of Irish Water.  The only thing I like about it is the name, Uisce &Eacute;ireann.  Other than that, we are going into the unknown and into oblivion.  As far as I can see, it is a rest home for former county managers.  There are already three of them in the agency.  They are retired and on pensions and now they have moved to Irish Water, and many more will follow.  There is no transparency at all to it.</p><p>  Why are people in my county on boil notice for seven or eight years?  They are going to be billed for water and will be expected to pay it as that it what is in the legislation.  The Minister of State might be in a different Department but we will be left with this situation.  These people will not pay.  Why should they pay for water that they cannot drink?  I know that somebody brought samples in here today.   Skeheenarinky National School is one of the oldest primary schools in the country, and it is on boil water notice.   Why is that school expected to pay?  The whole water infrastructure has been hijacked and sold off.  It will go into private hands and we will be like Bord G&aacute;is, with contractors who are not up to scratch and we will suffer for that.  It is just like the HSE and many other things we set up, with no accountability.</p><p>  I want to pay tribute to the water staff in South Tipperary County Council, especially the caretakers, who know where every stopcock and pipe is.  These new lads will not know where to find the reservoirs, not to mind a set of pipes.  Local knowledge is vital.  Under this memorandum of understanding, the Government is transferring ownership to Uisce &Eacute;ireann.  It is a lethal weapon.  Like Deputy Naughten, I appeal to the Minister of State to put this off.  I know the Minister cannot find reverse gear, but he reversed over the septic tanks issue.  The Government made a show of the whole country and made a show of itself.  Now only 29 tanks are being inspected in Tipperary, even though the Minister frightened the life out of people and told them they would not get a grant.</p></speech>

That was the biggest con job ever, and this is another one.  The Government is spinning, spinning and spinning.</p><p>  When I was boy walking home from school, I could see the great visionaries who came together to provide group water schemes in rural areas.  They do not know what will happen to their scheme now.  They pioneered the scheme, drew down the grants, collected money, did the work and maintained it since.  Now they are in uncharted waters - pardon the pun - with this Bill and do not know what will happen.</p><p>  Will there be any transparency and accountability?  I have spoken to many staff in the local authorities and they do not have a clue.  The biggest fear for staff in the service in south Tipperary is whether this will be signed before 1 January.  If it goes into the unknown, the Minister of State will be here announcing it again in four years, because this has been announced by previous Governments as well.  I announced it myself once or twice, but I learned from my mistake not to announce the granting of money when nothing happens.  We want to see the excavators on the ground the pipe laying being carried out.</p><p>  We are seeing some remedial work in the Fethard area, which is welcome.  The amount or burst pipes is unreal, but at least there were local contacts that we could call.  Will we get through now to answering machines like when we call the HSE?  Who are we going to get the information from?  As far as I can see, the Government wants to get water for Dublin from the country and to hell with those outside the Pale.</p><p>  I appeal to the Minister of State to back off from this.  It is not properly thought out.  The people who drafted it obviously had a difficult task, but it is not reflecting the views and the needs of the people.  People who are farming in my area cannot use the water because it would fail every test.  Businesses cannot use it because it is unfit for consumption - they are paying for it, yet they cannot get money to sink wells.  It is an awful situation, but it is not all the Minister of State's fault as this is ongoing.  I lay a lot of the blame at the door of the Department and the lethargic efforts it made over the years to deal with these issues.  We commission a consultant's report, send it back down to the council after six months, get another consultant's report and send it back again.  It is a merry-go-round and a money machine for consultants.  It has been hijacked by consultant after consultant.  Uisce &Eacute;ireann seems to be a rest home for retired county managers, some of them with a chequered history as well.  There will be more of them in the agency.  It is more jobs for the boys; another CRC as far as I can see.  We need honesty, openness and transparency and we need the public to have water to shower, wash and drink.  That is a basic human right and they have been denied that for years.  I appeal to the Minister of State to back off from this, and to give me a date for the turning of the sod and the contract.  I will provide the shovel and even the JCB if necessary.</p></speech>

In my earlier contribution, I did not mention the Minister, but the Dunlavin scheme costing &euro;5 million and the Ballyconnell scheme costing &euro;200,000 would not have taken place only for his direct intervention.  I would like to acknowledge that, but it still does not exonerate people from the principle of this Bill and the way the legislation is being carried out.</p><p>  I disagree with the concept of a boycott by the new troika consisting of the Technical Group, Fianna F&aacute;il and Sinn F&eacute;in.  They did not get elected to boycott the Parliament.</p></speech>

I have suffered a lot of it over the last few months when I was not able to elicit information or get explanations as to why certain things happened.  I pointed that out earlier, but I did not get elected to carry out stunts.  If people want to carry out stunts, they can go to the Gaiety Theatre, the Abbey Theatre, or the window at the bottom of Grafton Street that is hosting Joe Duffy's show.</p></speech>

They should be down with the successor of my own townsman, the late Dice Man.</p><p>  We are leaving here today and we do not know either the charge or the allowance.   Deputy Naughten has sought certain assurances.  When calculating that allowance, certain consideration should be given to families that have members with disabilities.  It should not be a simple head count, but should depend on the categorisation of people.  If people are affected with a disability, a certain allowance should be made for that.  The issue has been raised with me.</p><p>  In ten or twenty years time, this country will not be metered.  I see Deputy Bannon up there in the back benches.  He is a man with his finger on the pulse and is in touch with his people.  I can guarantee that by this time next year, he will have spent several nights in the Marquee in Drumlish trying to explain to his constituents how these charges came in.  He will explain that he had no role in it, that he has no power, and that he did not know that this was going to happen.  We are signing over power to an unaccountable body.  Let us leave out unelected; it is unaccountable.  We are the people responsible for doing it.  The Deputy has a big issue in his constituency with wind turbines, but we are doing the exact same thing, writing the same script for another body with the same principle.  We will go back to our constituents and bemoan the fact that it has happened, yet here we are participating in it.</p><p>This legislation is deeply flawed.  It is symptomatic of the flaws in this House and in our democratic process.  The D&aacute;il is not making the Government accountable.  This Government pays scant regard to the will of the D&aacute;il.  One of the difficulties of having a large majority is that the D&aacute;il has become a rubber stamp.  I previously mentioned the Smithwick tribunal report and the debate on the Seanad referendum.  Nothing has happened on them.  It falls on deaf ears.  I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for his indulgence.  This legislation will cause trouble for a long time due to the very clear and obvious flaws that have been pointed out here today.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-12-19a.479" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/986" speakername="Michael Creed" time="15:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013121900039#MM00200"><p>I am somewhat amused at the previous contributions, particularly that of Deputy Mattie McGrath, who spoke at length about the current failings of our water supply services around the country.  That is not the fault of Irish Water but of the current administrative structure we have for delivering water through local authorities.  I would be the first to accept that local authorities are in a rather invidious position.  Because of their under-funding over a long period of time they have had all the blame and none of the gain.  They do not control their own destiny in terms of putting in place proper financing for critical infrastructure.  The irony is entirely lost on Deputy Mattie McGrath who railed against control in the area of septic tanks.  Many of the boil notices are because of faecal contamination around the country.  One of the reasons for faecal contamination is because of the proximity of sources to septic tanks that are not functioning properly.  Deputy Mattie McGrath cannot have it both ways.</p><p>  There are legitimate issues about boil notices and liability for charges.  We cannot charge for a product that is not up to standard for consumption.  It would be preferable if that were in the legislation.  It is critical that the Minister state categorically on the record of the D&aacute;il that it is the legislative intent of this that there be no charge for water that is on a boil notice and is unfit for human consumption.  That must be unequivocally clear.  It is a regrettable flaw in the legislation that that is not categorically stated.</p><p>  Passing legislation in this rushed fashion is something for which we have paid the price relatively recently in the context of the property charge.  That legislation was rushed through this day last year and during the year we found flaws in it.  We keep repeating the mistakes of the past.  It is Christmas week and we said Irish Water would be operational on 1 January 2014.  We create artificial deadlines for ourselves and make bad law.  It is an issue.</p><p>  Recently I had occasion to telephone Cork County Council's out of hours service to report a break in water supply in my constituency.  A recorded message on the answering machine said customers calling about the discolouration of the water supply in the Douglas area should run their taps for a considerable period before consuming the water.  That is not a boil notice but to advise people on water meters, the purpose of which is to conserve and charge, to keep their taps running for a while is ludicrous.  Obviously, that is not an Irish Water situation but Irish Water will have to be flexible in its response to discolouration and boil notices.  We cannot charge for a service we cannot stand over.  When the Minister gets an opportunity to reply to this section and conclude the debate he must clearly state that.  Regrettably, the legislation is flawed in some respects and we are working to an artificial deadline.</p></speech>

It is in everybody's interest that we have a level of professionalism in the water services sector which would ensure we meet EU drinking water standards and quality.  It is important that this be complied with at all times.</p><p>  My concern on reading this Bill is that it is paving the way for the future privatisation of Ireland's water supply.  We sell off assets from time to time and in recent times we have sold off a number of our assets.  As a result of the sale of Eircom there are some rural areas the length and breadth of this country that have no broadband and will not see it in the foreseeable future because there is no interest and it is not profitable to those companies to deliver broadband to those rural areas.  I have highlighted this issue.  I am fearful that this could be the case with a company like Irish Water, which will be in it for big bucks at the end of the day.</p><p>  The people who tramped the roads in the 1950s and 1960s and set up voluntary group water schemes played a very significant role in the development of Ireland.  When they established a group water scheme they employed local people to administer and develop it and lay the water mains etc.  They tied in with the committees and took great interest in the development of a particular area.  In my county and the surrounding north Leinster counties we employ contractors from Northern Ireland and elsewhere to upgrade the water supply with no job opportunities for local people.  I am fearful that this work can be tendered and somebody in France, Italy or elsewhere might get a contract for the improvement of the water supply, to the detriment of the local population and local employment opportunities.</p><p>  All politics is local and I held the chair of four group water schemes in my county over the years.  I set them up, walked the roads, filled in the GW41 and GW41A forms and submitted them to the Department, and drew down the grants etc.  They were prudent operations.  Some of the good people who were trustees at that time have passed on.  It is important that we acknowledge their contribution to the water infrastructure in this country.</p><p>  The importance of water conservation cannot be overstated, especially as it was recently estimated that up to 47% of all water is unaccounted for.  We cannot stand idly by and neglect to deal with this problem.  When water is produced, cleaned, etc. somebody must pay for it.  I hope this problem will be tackled by Irish Water.  This is important.  A nationwide water conservation programme would be money very well spent.  Could the Minister indicate if we have guaranteed this program will be expanded and how successful it will be under Irish Water?  Areas of rural Ireland could be neglected and may not get the same attention as they get under the private group water schemes.</p></speech>

I have heard everything that has been said here.  It is very important that we on this side of the House reflect on what Deputy Naughten has said on those issues.  I see him smiling.</p><p>Through this legislation, the Minister has and will have the power to direct both the CER and Irish Water, if appropriate, to use this power and, where supplies are subject to restrictions, to ensure that customers are properly protected and compensated where necessary.  Also, there will be further legislation in the House next year in this regard.  Most importantly, there will be no domestic charges imposed until January 2015. </p><p> Notwithstanding all the concerns, which I acknowledge, we will have time to address a number of the issues and to clarify other outstanding issues in the legislation that is to come.  The issues can be discussed before Oireachtas committees with both the Minister and myself and with representatives from Irish Water and the Regulator.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-12-19a.495" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1020" speakername="Tommy Broughan" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013121900043#QQ00500"><p>One of my constituents, Ms Caroline Keane of the Lusk Pyrite Action Group, has expressed concern that the categorisation of structures as red, amber and green will by its very nature require evidence of deterioration before remedial action is sanctioned.  When this problem emerged in Quebec and Ontario in Canada in the 1970s and 1980s, detailed plans were rapidly developed following the collapse of a government in Quebec to implement a full-scale and systematic remediation programme instead of pursuing a legal and insurance model based on individual claims and proofs of structural damage.  The Lusk group is concerned about the operation of these categories, given that pyritic damage to a building emerges over a period of up to four decades, particularly where the necessary barrier is not constructed in the floor infill before the concrete slabs are laid.  The various estimates made by spokespersons yesterday, with 70,000 units as the highest figure, reflect the concerns that people have expressed.  I ask the Minister to clarify that issue.</p></speech>

The problem needs to be properly assessed.  I am concerned that properties assigned to the second category will be left on the long finger because funding will be prioritised to repair the most serious damage.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-12-19a.497" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1015" speakername="Clare Daly" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013121900043#QQ00700"><p>In regard to section 4(b), those who paid considerable sums, amounting to thousands of euro in many cases, on tests to confirm the presence of pyrite prior to the introduction of the new standards should not have to undergo any further testing under the scheme's criteria.  I ask the Minister to clarify whether that will be the case.  These people have spent a considerable amount of money and would be unnecessarily duplicating their efforts if they have found already that pyrite is present in their homes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-12-19a.498" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/967" speakername="Phil Hogan" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013121900043#QQ00800"><p>The cost of testing will be covered by the pyrite remediation board.  I acknowledge that the Deputy was referring to a test that may already have been carried out, but if the test conforms with the conditions set down by the board, I am sure common sense will prevail.  I am sure the chairman of the board would be satisfied that further expense would not be required.  Costs in relation to testing are covered and, needless to say, the board will be frugal in deploying its funds.  If the tests to which the Deputy referred are sufficient to prove that pyrite is present I am sure they will be taken into account.</p><p>  Section 4 provides for the critical definition of &quot;significant pyritic damage&quot;.  The house must have suffered damage before it can be considered.  In respect of a dwelling, significant pyritic damage means a damage condition rating of 1, with progression - if pyrite is evident it will progress quite quickly - or a damage condition rating of 2 established on foot of a building condition assessment carried out by a competent person in accordance with Irish Standard 398-1:2013.  If a competent person believes after carrying out an assessment that pyrite is present, he or she will proceed to administer more expensive tests.  All of those costs are covered.  Significant pyritic damage also means hardcore classified by a competent person under Standard 398-1:2013 as susceptible to significant or limited expansion.</p><p>Those are the conditions attached with regard to what constitutes and is defined as &quot;significant pyritic damage&quot;, which must be evident before an application for remediation under this scheme qualifies.</p><p> The building assessment is carried out by a competent person.  Obviously, that will show clearly whether pyrite is evident, and one then goes on to the more detailed testing that must prove the presence of pyrite in its own right.  All of the costs will be covered under the scheme.</p></speech>

Will the costs be covered if there is pyrite in evidence at all?</p></speech>

A house must reach a certain level or threshold before it can go further in the scheme.  The problem here is that there are home owners who have expended thousands of euro in demonstrating the presence of pyrite above levels that would be justified.  Do they have to undertake another test to gain access to this scheme?  Why would that be necessary?  Do they have to get a rating of 2 on the building condition assessment even though they have already established that pyrite is there and have spent thousands of euro doing that?</p></speech>

If Deputy Clare Daly's suggestion is that home owners already have a test done, we can take that into account.  If the Pyrite Resolution Board is satisfied that such a test shows definitively that pyrite is present, that should cover it.</p></speech>

He told us repeatedly, through the pyrite panel process and all the consultations, that that was precisely what he would do.  As I stated, he had it on the cl&aacute;r at this session that he would come forward with a levy on the sector.</p><p>  This scandal of pyrite-damaged homes, as I also stated last night, is reminiscent of the scale of the scandal in the banking sector.  It was incumbent on the Minister to face up to the powerful vested interests who seemed to be opposed to providing funding under this area rather than allowing it to become merely an Exchequer cost, as is now emerging.</p><p>  I repeat my call on the Minister, who has backed away.  It is a little like what the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, did with Mr. Trichet.  I do not think Deputy Noonan even eyeballed him on banking.  He says he did but I do not really think he did.  He merely backed down and did what he was told.  Unfortunately, the same is the case with this Minister.  Deputy Hogan has allowed the powerful vested interest, represented in this House, unfortunately, by his own party and, in particular, Fianna F&aacute;il, to tell this House what to do, and it is disgraceful.</p></speech>

We have received no explanation as to who was objecting to this levy and the legal reasons behind it.  I do not know whether he is in a position to elaborate.  Was it the insurance sector, the building sector or representatives of the quarries, or was it a combination of them all?  I am still baffled as to where the problem lies and I would like to get some indication.</p></speech>

The Minister indicated yesterday that should it be deemed that the decision is upheld, he will then be in a position to pursue and get back some of this money, or set up a new system of funding, presumably, that would insure those who were responsible.</p><p>  Deputy Wallace made relevant points yesterday about the insurance companies, and the Minister might clarify them.</p><p>  With regard to homeowners who have initiated legal action - to be honest, out of absolute desperation, because nobody would choose to do that otherwise - are they excluded from the terms of this scheme merely because they themselves tried to remedy this through legal action when they had no other way out?</p></speech>

If the law protects them in such a way that the Minister cannot hold these private entities responsible for their part in this pyrite issue, does the Government intend to address that weakness in the law, and if he were to do so, could it be retrospectively applied to these entities?</p></speech>

I have to get my advice from the Attorney General.  There are cases before the Supreme Court and home owners are also taking cases.  We have to await the outcome of those cases, which the Deputy, as a legislator, should know.  However, I am prepared to re-examine this matter once we know the outcome of those cases.  I had informed the construction and quarrying sectors quite explicitly all along that there would be a levy on those industries but, regrettably, because of cases in the courts and the legal advice I have been given by the Attorney General I could not proceed with that without risking home owners having to wait three or four more years for remediation because of the current backlog in the court system.  I was not prepared to allow that to happen and I asked the Government about this and, despite the difficult financial situation, it agreed with my analysis that we would provide Exchequer funding for this and try to clawback some money from the industry in the future if we could.  I thought that was quite a generous outcome and I am surprised at Deputy Broughan's negativity about this matter.  In a difficult situation, financially, I am putting the people first.</p></speech>

It would only be fair and right that the chairperson of the board would come before the joint committee on a annual basis in order to ascertain the success, or otherwise, of the scheme and adjudicate, if possible, on the issues the Minister has raised, especially in regard to outstanding litigation, the results of which may be known during the course of the year and based on those results recommendations could be forthcoming at that stage.</p></speech>

The Bill provides for the appointment of persons to the Pyrite Resolution Board, the appointment of appeals officers, the establishment of procedures for appeals to an appeals officer, the removal of a person from a board, the filling of a vacancy on the board and the circumstances under which these matters can occur.  These matters will be subject to the approval of the Minister of the day, having regard to the relevant provisions in the Bill, and I will be accountable to the House.  In addition, appeals officers are required to prepare reports on the performance of their functions, which shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</p><p>  Amendment No. 19 would have the effect of restricting the number of people who could be considered for this role and could have the unintended consequence of conflict of interest issues arising.  Professionals on the building condition assessors register would most likely be involved in carrying out assessments under the scheme and could not also be involved in hearing appeals.  The requirement in the scheme for the appeals officer to have an expertise or knowledge of fair procedures, structural or civil engineering and construction or damage caused by pyrite and knowledge of the pyrite scheme is considered to be adequate to undertake the process.</p><p>  On Amendment No. 22, the disqualification of persons adjudicated bankrupt from statutory boards is a standard provision for reasons that are well known.

It has taken such a long time to get to this stage that people who represent constituents feel it heavily.

The Bill addresses inter-country adoption and specifically the concerns of some people who have been unable to continue with the process of adopting a child from Russia because of an amendment to Russian adoption legislation which took effect earlier this year.</p><p>  The Adoption Act 2010 provides, <i>inter alia</i>, for inter-country adoptions between states that have ratified the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-Operation in respect of Intercountry Adoption.  Ireland ratified the Hague Convention on 1 November 2010.  While Russia has been a signatory to the Hague Convention since 1992, it has not ratified the Hague Convention.  During the drafting of the 2010 Act, transitional measures were put in place to deal with the change from previous adoption legislation to the new 2010 Act.  This measure, provided for in section 63 of the 2010 Act, allowed persons who held a valid declaration of eligibility and suitability before the commencement of the 2010 Act to continue the process of adoption from a non-Hague state for a maximum period of three years.  Such applicants were thus afforded an additional three-year period to complete adoptions from non-Hague countries.  The vast majority of adoptions that took place in Ireland were from non-Hague countries, particularly Russia and Ethiopia.  They were required to have completed the process by 31 October 2013.  By their nature, transitional provisions are time-limited and the Oireachtas considered that three years was a reasonable period of time to finalise an adoption that had been under way when the 2010 Act came into force.</p><p>  Deputies have been in contact with me about a particular difficulty that has arisen with the expiry of the transitional provision provided for in section 63 of the 2010 Act in that a small number of people in the State could not finalise adoptions in Russia before their existing declarations of eligibility and suitability expired.  Without a valid declaration, the adoption of a child cannot proceed.  The situation arose this year because of an unexpected change in Russian adoption legislation, which extended the period that a child in Russia must be on the national adoption database before that child is eligible for inter-country adoption from six months to 12 months.  One assumes that implementation of the subsidiarity principle was the underlying reason for the change in Russian adoption legislation.  A core principle of the Hague Convention is the need to place a child within his or her family, community or country before the option of inter-country adoption is considered.</p><p>  Since the amendment to Russian legislation and the ensuing consequences for a number of Irish people involved in the adoption process in Russia were brought to my attention, I have pursued extensive diplomatic efforts to endeavour to resolve the situation.</p><p>Applicants from other countries have also been affected and it was hoped it would be possible to achieve an administrative or legislative solution in Russia.  However, despite my best efforts and those of my colleagues, it has not been possible to satisfactorily resolve the issue and the matter has now become urgent for those people whose declarations of eligibility and suitability expired on 31 October 2013 and who wish to finalise an adoption in Russia as a matter of urgency.  The adoption of a child is always about the best interests of the child and nobody is by default entitled to adopt.  As I have stated, the adoption of a child in Russia cannot proceed without a valid declaration.</p><p> In order to resolve this matter, I am today proposing that an amendment to the 2010 Act be made to extend the period of validity of a declaration of eligibility and suitability to allow those affected by the change in Russian legislation additional time to complete their adoptions.  I propose to confine the amendment to persons who on 31 October 2013 held declarations of eligibility and suitability specific to the Russian Federation.  The Adoption Authority of Ireland has informed my Department that 23 prospective adoptive parents held declarations of eligibility and suitability valid for adoption from the Russian Federation on 31 October 2013.  I propose in this legislation that the period of validity of these declarations be extended to 31 October 2014.  As I have stated, the proposed amendment to the 2010 Act is limited to declarations in respect of the Russian Federation and in all the circumstances I believe this is a necessary and appropriate amendment.</p><p> I thank my staff and those in the Office of the Attorney General for their advice on the Bill.  Throughout the process of preparing this legislation my Department has been mindful of the State's obligations under the Hague Convention and our commitment to adhering to the standards of the convention.  The Adoption Authority of Ireland does this on an ongoing basis.  Implementation of the Adoption Act 2010 is evidence of the State's dedication to these standards and I reiterate Ireland's commitment to the Hague Convention.  Implementation of the 2010 Act has meant that Ireland is in a better position to deal with the many complex issues that arise in intercountry adoptions.  Deputies are aware of the many complex issues which have arisen since we passed that legislation, including the role of bilateral agreements which are extremely difficult to formalise and complete.  Membership of the Hague Convention is a mechanism for improving standards and the State wants to ensure child-centred adoption is at the core of all the elements of the adoption process.  We want to ensure the State continues to adhere to high standards in the adoption process.</p><p> I will now turn to the provisions of the Bill.  Section 1 provides that a declaration of eligibility and suitability in respect of the Russian Federation issued to a prospective adoptive parent and which was valid on 31 October 2013 shall be extended from that date for a period of one year and shall expire on 31 October 2014.  The section provides that any such declaration extended under this proposed legislation shall not be amended to specify any state other than the Russian Federation as the state to which the declaration applies.  </p><p> Section 2 provides for the Short Title and citation.  I have brought this amending Bill forward as a matter of urgency.  I thank Deputies for their co-operation and commend the Bill to the House.  I look forward to hearing the views of Deputies on the proposed legislation.</p></speech>

In bringing forward this amending Bill the Minister and the Government are acting in a humane and compassionate manner.  The legislation will not dilute or relax rules for intercountry adoptions.  As the Minister has indicated, the adoption must always be in the best interests of the child, the paramount consideration and concern.  The Bill addresses a particular issue that has arisen because of changes made by the Russian authorities earlier in the year.</p><p>  The only difficulty I have is the length of time it took to get us where we are.  This is an extremely short and a technical Bill, but the approximately 23 families affected had to endure four to six months of unnecessary worry and anxiety as they wondered when and if this necessary amendment would be brought before the House.  They had to engage in a high-level lobbying campaign which culminated in a particular family giving up its privacy by going on &quot;Prime Time&quot; and doing interviews with many media outlets, including the <i>Sunday Independent</i>.  They did this to try to ensure pressure could be brought to bear and this amending legislation would be brought before the House.  I take the opportunity to praise, in particular, the Fennessy family which led the charge.  I know many other families were particularly grateful for the proactive role played by the people concerned.  I wonder why this could not have happened many months ago as it would have removed much unnecessary worry and anxiety for the families affected.</p><p>  The Minister has outlined the background to the need for this legislation - the Russian authorities changed the criteria.  In June this year the Minister indicated an intention to broaden legislation on adoption as she believed it was quite conservative in nature.  I would have thought, having had additional time to bring forward this legislation, she would have used the opportunity to outline her intentions in this regard.  I reiterate my opinion expressed at the time - I am opposed to the relaxing of standards.  When the 2010 Act was framed, the intention was to achieve acceptable international standards under the Hague Convention.  We are all aware that in previous decades nothing was done and adoptions were unregulated.  That led to abuse on a large scale and resulted in a need for adoption and tracing legislation.  I know the Minister is working on this issue, but it is critical that the adoption and tracing legislation be brought before the House.  That would afford adopted citizens a basic right - to know their identity.  That legislation should be prioritised early in the new year.</p><p>  I welcome this legislation, for which we called and which we are happy to support, although it has taken too long to bring it here.  It is a good news story and I know many families will now have a much more enjoyable Christmas knowing this legislation has passed through the House.  The level of anxiety they have had endure for a number of months has been lessened.</p></speech>

I hope it will restore the necessary opportunity for the small number of prospective adoptive parents affected by the heart-breaking consequences of the changes in Russian law which are the backdrop to the problem.</p><p>As soon as those circumstances became apparent, a concerted campaign was launched by the individuals affected and the Russian Irish Adoption Group, RIAG, to explore all possible avenues for a resolution.  I commend them on their efforts.  We have all been engaged with by RIAG and the prospective adoptive parents, who have done a very solid job.</p><p> The efforts of the Minister and her Department involved high level discussions with the Russian authorities.  The Departments responsible for education and foreign affairs engaged in an effort to address what was, in essence, an impasse.  Changes to Russian family code laws, which came into effect in Russia on 3 July last had, along with existing Irish legislation, serious implications for a number of prospective adopters in Ireland.  These changes related to the period a child must spend on the federal registry in Russia before becoming available for foreign adoption.  While the deadline of 31 October loomed for many prospective adopters with pre-2010 declarations, a small number of prospective adopters who had intended having their adoptions completed by this deadline were clearly unable to do so.  This was through no fault of their own, nor was it the intention of the authorities here.  It was quite clearly a result of unexpected changes in Russian family law.</p><p> I have referred to some of the affected people.  I acknowledge not only the contribution of RIAG but also that of Pamela, Lisa and others whose names I cannot cite off the top of my head.  Those individuals with whom I have been in direct contact were very far down the road to adoption and have already been to Russia.  They have met and formed a bond with the children they plan to adopt.  Their circumstances touched the heartstrings of every one of us.  Those of us who are parents can very well appreciate the circumstances in which these people found themselves.  We were touched by the human and personal stories involved and we recognised how emotive the process was, particularly for the prospective parents, who at all times presented their case in a very honest and heartfelt way.  It is because of their approach, persistence and tenacity that they were in a position to win our collective support in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I am glad that it is with this legislation that we are concluding our work in advance of the Christmas break.  I refer to the making of this critical amendment that allows prospective adoptive parents from Ireland to proceed to complete, within the next ten months, the adoptions they have been looking forward to so very much.</p><p> The amendment to the Adoption Act 2010 will give more time to finalise adoptions that are already in progress.  I commend the Minister.  I welcome her approach to this matter.  From meetings I have had with her on this matter, I acknowledge she shared our commitment to finding a resolution that would meet the needs of the Irish prospective adoptive parents.  I ask the Minister to keep this matter under constant review to ensure possible outcomes are realised for all of the prospective parents involved.  From the Minister's introductory remarks, I note there are in the order of 23 prospective parents.  I did not realise there were so many.  The number in my mind was somewhat lower.  I wish all 23 prospective parents every success and hope this is a very happy Christmas for them.</p></speech>

We are happy to facilitate its passage.  We are all familiar with the background to it.  It has been discussed on numerous occasions with the Minister, in both the D&aacute;il and Joint Committee on Health and Children.  The change to the Russian family code came into effect on 3 July last.  The effect of the change, when taken with existing Irish legislation, related the period for which a child must remain on the federal register in Russia before becoming available for foreign adoption.  Clearly, this created great concern among the families seeking to adopt from the Russian Federation.  Those with great hopes of starting a family or adding to their family the great blessing of a new child were put under risk.  Many of us were lobbied by the families affected, whom I know were distressed and concerned.</p><p>  I commend the Russian Irish Adoption Group, which lobbied intensively to ensure the issue became known and discussed at political level and to seek a solution to this difficulty.  There were considerable discussions with the Russian authorities in this regard in order to see a resolution.  I commend those concerned on their efforts.</p><p>  It is a welcome step that the Minister has taken, and I am glad she has listened to the concerns expressed by the ordinary families and Members.  The purpose of the Adoption (Amendment) Bill 2013 is to extend the period of declarations of eligibility and suitability that apply to the Russian Federation for one year to 31 October 2014 for those prospective adoptive parents who held such declarations on 31 October 2013.</p><p>  Adoption has the potential to transform the lives of both the adoptive parents and the child.  It is essential that the highest standards are observed in adoption procedures and that there be full compliance with international best practice, both in terms of approving adoptive parents and ensuring the standards in the country of the adoptee are appropriate and in line with human rights norms.  It is wonderful to be able to offer a child the opportunity to find a new family to grow up with, to be cared for and to be looked after.  Similarly, for adoptive parents, it is extraordinarily wonderful to be able to see and start a family, particularly where it might not otherwise have been possible.  Adoption, with the appropriate safeguards, can be life changing.  That is why it would be tragic for the adoptions of the families in question to fall through.  I commend the Minister on dealing with this to the greatest extent.</p><p>  However, as Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in pointed out, a small number of prospective adoptees may yet be disadvantaged.  I ask the Minister to consider this.  While there was a deadline of 31 October for many prospective adopters with pre-2010 declarations, a small number of prospective adopters who had intended having their adoptions completed by this deadline are in a difficult position.  They will no longer be able to complete their adoptions in the required timeframe through no fault of their own but as a result of the unexpected changes in Russian family law.  This is not resolved by this Bill.  I am aware that many of the families have got to know the children in question.  They have been to Russia and they and the chidden are practically families.</p><p>  Irrespective of the size of the categories of affected families, it would be tragic if the adoptions in question were not to happen.  One should place oneself in the position of a small Russian girl or boy who has been so much looking forward to life with a new family, or in the position of a couple seeking to start a family.  It would be awful if their hopes were dashed.</p><p>  What is required is an amendment to the 2010 Act to allow for adoptions already in train to be finalised.  I implore the Minister to consider this.  That point aside, the Bill is welcome.  We support it and wish all the families who can complete their adoptions very happy lives with their new children.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-12-19a.589" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1015" speakername="Clare Daly" time="16:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013121900048#VV00300"><p>I am sharing my time with Deputy Finian McGrath.</p><p>  I appreciate the Minister's motivation in introducing the legislation.  I pass no judgment on the families concerned but believe the legislation raises a number of ethical issues and issues of social policy that I would like to explore briefly.  All Deputies know people who may not be able to have children or who have no children of their own who would desperately like to give a loving home to a child and to be a good adoptive parent.  We hear that view many times.  I appreciate the views of and know people in these circumstances.</p><p>We must, above all, look at this from the viewpoint of the child, not the prospective parent.  Adoption should be about providing homes for children and not providing children for parents.  To be quite honest, the international adoption market - and I do not use that word lightly - has become a vehicle for providing children to parents.  In essence, there are unscrupulous characters out there who are exploiting the desperation of genuine people who want to have and raise a child of their own, and they are profiting from that desperation to the detriment of the natural parents and, more importantly, the children involved.  Too often in this country we focus on the interests of adopted parents in Ireland and not enough on the children who are being taken from their own countries.  Again, I stress that I am not saying this in a derogatory manner about the couples involved in this scenario.  However, we must ask whether we will continue to change the law and write amendments for other groups of people who want to adopt from non-Hague countries.  It took us long enough to sign up to the Hague Convention to begin with.  What is the point in signing up to that convention if we are going to continue to make exceptions?  We must be very careful in that regard.  It took us almost 17 years to ratify the agreement in the first instance.  We were one of the last significant receiving countries to do so.  The ratification of the Hague Convention by certain countries has meant that the figures for potential adoptive children have plummeted.  That was the experience in China, where the number of children available for adoption dropped dramatically after it signed the convention.  Why is that the case?  Obviously some children were never really legitimately available for adoption.  There were other interests at play.  Stricter regulation is critical in this regard.  </p><p> There was a justifiable outcry about the fact that thousands of Irish children were exported from Ireland, sometimes illegally, in the 1950s and 1960s and ended up in the US.  The children we are talking about now in some other countries are the equivalent of those Irish children of past generations.  We would have wanted other people to stand up for the rights of those Irish children, and we must stand up for the rights of others now.  Quite often it is the social conditions in countries that fuel illegal adoptions.  In Ireland, for example, 97% of children born to non-marital parents used to be adopted, but when the lone parent allowance was introduced in 1972 the situation normalised completely.  There are very worrying trends emerging in countries such as America, where people are unscrupulously adopting children through the international adoption scene, which is quite unregulated.  Loopholes are being exploited and tens of thousands of children are being brought to America for adoption but are not ending up in the homes of the people who wanted to adopt them.  Some of the families involved are not being checked out properly either.  There is a distinct lack of regulation in the area and links to people-trafficking cannot be ignored.  There is much testimony from children in countries such as Ethiopia who were living with their parents when unscrupulous rogue adoption agents came to their villages and conned their parents into believing that their children would be educated in the West that the children were adopted unlawfully.  We must be very careful here.</p><p> Fair dues to the Minister, who has rushed through this legislation on the last sitting day of the year, but what about all those people who are waiting to claim their identity from Ireland?  Time is not on their side either.  That issue must be addressed.  If we are widening the market for prospective adoptive parents, we must be very careful about the regulations and must ensure that everything is done in the best interests of the child.  There is an imbalance, in an Irish context, when we discuss these issues, which is why I am making this point now.  I am not opposing the legislation, but we must be very careful.  The Deputies who are strongly lobbying on this issue must be particularly careful, in my opinion.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-12-19a.591" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1017" speakername="Finian McGrath" time="16:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013121900049#WW00200"><p>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on the Adoption (Amendment) Bill 2013.  I welcome the Bill and thank the Minister for dealing with this in a very serious manner.  I raised this matter with the Minister on 3 December and I welcome her response today.  The Bill is about ensuring justice and fairness for these children and their families.  They need safeguards, protection and stability.  Up to today, these families were living through a nightmare through no fault of their own.  The Russian adoptions they were in the process of completing before the deadline of 31 October were stopped in their tracks due to a change in the law in Russia.  Since then, these families have been doing everything in their power to raise awareness of their plight and have called on the Minister to intervene on their behalf to come to a resolution.  They were extremely worried that the children they wanted to adopt would no longer be available.  They were very worried and upset, particularly in the lead-up to Christmas.  The Bill before us on this last sitting day must be supported because it will have an immediate impact on the lives of these families.  All Members of this House should support this legislation, which resolves a personal crisis and protects the rights of families.</p><p>  In debates such as this we must always focus on the best interests of the child.  In that context, I commend and thank all adoptive parents for the massive contribution they have made to their children and to the stability of families.  We must also pay tribute to the magnificent work of foster parents, who make a huge contribution to the welfare of children in this State.  Foster families have rescued many children from crisis situations and dysfunctional families.  Children, society and the State benefit from the work of adoptive and foster parents.  Adoptive and foster families really are doing the State some service.  I have first-hand experience of both adoption and fostering in my immediate family and I have seen the massive contribution that has made to society.  I wish to pay particular tribute to the adoptive and foster parents of children with disabilities.</p><p>  I agree with Deputy Daly's point about the need to monitor adoption regulations and to focus always on the rights of the child.  We must be conscious of the fact that unscrupulous people are operating in this area.  Regulation and proper safeguards are vital in that context.  Legislation such as this should always be child-centred and should focus on the rights of children.  Many children are being exploited throughout the world and we must remember that.</p><p>  The purpose of the Bill is to extend the period of declarations of eligibility and suitability which apply to the Russian Federation for one year to 31 October 2014 for those prospective adoptive parents who held such declarations on 31 October 2013.  Section 1 of the Bill provides that a declaration of eligibility and suitability in respect of the Russian Federation that had been issued to a prospective adoptive parent and which was valid on 31 October 2013 shall be extended for a period of one year and shall expire on 31 October 2014.  The section provides that any such declaration that has been extended shall not be amended to specify any state other than the Russian Federation as the state to which the declaration applies.  That is what this Bill is about and it is important to know the details.  However, while looking at the nuts and bolts of the legislation, we must focus on couples who want to amend the Act so that they have the extra year to complete the process.  That is the key issue in this legislation.  As colleagues have mentioned, several Irish couples have come forward to outline the problem they faced in this regard.</p><p>  The Adoption Act 2010 provides for adoptions from countries that have ratified the Hague Convention or countries with which we have a bilateral adoption agreement.  I strongly support that position.  This legislation is about assisting and protecting children and families.  It is also about giving children the chance of a good, stable, warm and bright future.</p><p>I thank and commend the Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, for listening to the voices of the parents and urge everybody to support the legislation.</p></speech>

I have a number of constituents who have been affected by the Russian authorities amending their adoption legislation to include a provision requiring a child to be in the national adoption database for 12 months in advance of being placed in an international adoption database.  I accept the comments made by the Minister on this being good practice, but it has put people trying to adopt in a very difficult position.  The change meant they were unable to complete their adoptions before 31 October 2013.</p><p>  In recent months the Minister and her departmental officials have spent a great deal of time trying to find a solution to compensate for the change in Russian law.  We hope the solution will be achieved with the passage of the Bill.  By all accounts, there is a need to amend the Adoption Act 2010 by amending the existing transitional provision in section 63 to allow those with declarations of eligibility and suitability to adopt from Russia.  The granting of an additional year to do so will sort out the problem.  My understanding is that any applicant who held a valid declaration of eligibility prior to the commencement of the Adoption Act 2010 and who also held a valid declaration of eligibility and suitability for Russia on 31 October this year will be eligible for an extension of the declaration of eligibility and suitability, with the adoption to be completed by 31 October 2014.  I, again, thank the Minister and her officials for their work in devising a solution to the problem for the families involved.</p></speech>

Like Deputy John Deasy, I have a number of constituents who have been impacted on by the change in the legislation.</p><p>  I am interested in the issue of foreign adoptions, about which I have spoken in the House previously.  I have followed the debate with interest.  Deputy Robert Troy spoke about his concern in terms of the time it has taken to complete the process.  Deputy Clare Daly referred to the scrutiny in which we must engage in international adoptions.  If we get it right, no period of time is too long.  I think we have achieved this, which is important.</p><p>  I understand families were under pressure and that it is an emotive issue.  What we are really talking about is safeguarding children&rsquo;s rights.  What happened was due to a change in foreign policy by the Russian Government, which is trying to promote the adoption of Russian children within Russia.  It is perfectly entitled to do this.  What happened was that some Irish parents were caught in the cross-fire.  I am pleased that the parents with declarations will now have the additional time they require to adopt their children.</p><p>  It took us many years to sign the Hague Convention, which is important in protecting children, not just in the adoption process.  It also comes into play in the case of a contentious marriage or relationship break-up when children are taken out of the country by one or other of the partners.  It is an important international document which safeguards the rights of children.</p><p>  Foreign adoption is a difficult and loaded subject and I speak from personal experience.  I have a sister who is now 22 years old who was originally adopted from Romania in the 1990s.  It is an emotive issue both for my sister&rsquo;s family who live in Romania and my family who live in Waterford.  We are cognisant of how lucky we are to have her living with us and the sacrifices her family made.  Our laws must be reflective of the situation and ensure it is always the rights of the child that are considered, not the rights of the parents.</p><p>  I commend the Minister.  We have got the balance right in the Bill.  It is both a humanitarian approach and good law, which is important.  On the previous occasion when we had a considered debate on international adoption in this House, it was focused on Vietnam.  I accept that I am straying a little, but I would be grateful if the Minister indicated whether there was any progress in that regard.  We have a bilateral agreement with Vietnam.  Other families are also waiting in hope of establishing a family and it would be wonderful if the Minister had some news in that regard.</p><p>  I thank the parents who took the brave decision to engage in foreign adoptions.  It is not easy to go through the process.  When they met difficulty, they took it upon themselves to lobby and engage with us.  It is a good example of how politics can work.  I thank the Minister for her approach and I am delighted to say I support the Bill.  We will make Christmas very happy for some families in Ireland.</p></speech>

I have been in regular contact with one of the families affected by this issue and I am very much aware of the distress the uncertainty has caused.  It is difficult to imagine a more upsetting scenario than a family waiting to hear whether they can proceed with a planned adoption of a child with whom they have already bonded, as is the case in the set of circumstances with which I am familiar.</p><p>  I am grateful to the Minister, her staff and advisers and the offices of the T&aacute;naiste and the Attorney General for the time and effort they have dedicated to this sensitive issue in recent months.  I raised the matter on a regular basis and everyone who was involved shared my concerns on a humanitarian level and worked extremely hard to address it.  It was not easy to draw up the legislation.  It required a delicate balancing act as there were many sensitivities at play.  We needed to be conscious that whatever amendment we proposed would not jeopardise adoptions from other countries.  Drawing up such legislation is difficult at any time, but it is especially so when one is up against a deadline set by a third party, not by the Legislature.  It is doubly difficult when one has so many human concerns at play.  What the Minister and her staff have achieved is impressive.  I congratulate them on bringing the Bill to the House and I am delighted to support it.  Without being too pithy; it is, in many ways, an early Christmas present for the families involved.</p></speech>

In particular, I thank the Minister, staff in her office and officials in her Department for introducing it.  Until recently I understood 19 families were affected, but now I believe the number is 23.  </p><p>  Adoption is an emotive and emotional subject.  I remember the time when I first spoke on it ten or 12 years ago in the other House when I had come into contact with the stories of families seeking to adopt.  It brought home to me the issues involved.  I commend the Minister and her officials, in particular, because the legislation was not easy to draft owing to the possibility of unforeseen knock-on effects in other areas.  It was difficult drafting work and I commend the officials in the Department who have brought about a resolution for the 23 families involved who, through no fault of their own, found themselves in a difficult position.</p><p>Now they will have the time to complete their adoptions extended by 12 months.  As Deputy Conway said earlier, it is a humane solution to a difficult situation for those families affected.  I thank the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and her officials for the speedy nature in which they drafted the legislation and provided a solution for those families caught up in this terrible situation.</p></speech>

I also thank all Members who have received representations on this issue and conveyed these concerns to me in a detailed way over the past few months.</p><p>  I prefer to be here introducing legislation we can stand over rather than making promises at an earlier stage.  Quite a detailed examination was necessary to make this change to the legislation.  Drafting legislation sometimes looks simpler than it actually is.  When one goes into the background to changes involved in this Bill, however, one can see there are quite a number of issues to be examined.  Ireland has signed the Hague Convention, so consideration had to be given to our obligations under the convention in this legislation.</p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in and others spoke about the life-changing experience of adoption and the potentially heartbreaking consequences when it does not quite work out.  There have been dramatic changes to the nature of adoption in Ireland in recent years.  Between 2004 and 2010, there were 920 adoptions from Russia to Ireland.  Based on my contact with the Russian-Irish adoption support groups, the Russian authorities, families and the children, these adoptions seem to be very successful.  However, our signing of the Hague Convention created problems for many families adopting from Russia, Ethiopia and other non-Hague signatories.</p><p>  There is an irony that those children most in need of adoption are often in countries that may not have a central adoption authority, where systems are poor and it is difficult to arrange an adoption.  Many of these children are in institutions such as orphanages in which they have no contact with their families.  Yet when we demand certain standards and procedures - rightly so - these children do not become available for adoption.  I understand Deputy Clare Daly&rsquo;s point about the potential risks faced by children in vulnerable situations.  We have to be careful too that obstacles are not put in the way of achieving what is in the best interests of these children so that they are prevented from getting a second chance of having a family.  We must work on our bilateral arrangements and international relations to ensure children in such circumstances get a second opportunity while, equally, being aware of the potential for trafficking and inappropriate placements.  That is why the standards of the Hague Convention are so important - because they are about free and informed consent, as well as subsidiarity.</p><p>  Many countries continue to work on adoptions with countries that have not signed up to the Hague Convention but apply Hague standards.  I must point out that it is difficult to negotiate a bilateral arrangement with Haiti, Russia or Ethiopia.  Yet in these countries there are many children who need to be given a second opportunity in their best interests.  We have kept the Hague secretariat informed of our developments in this regard.  We are continuing to have discussions about how the international instruments can be applied and how we can maintain high standards.  It is about the children.  No one has the automatic right to adopt.  Everyone has to go through an adoption procedure.  It is about what is best for the child.</p><p>  I have worked closely with the advocacy groups, which have done great work in this area.  I appreciate the uncertainty the families in question have experienced.  In general, the adoption process can be very demanding on couples.  We are trying to change the length of assessment for adoption.</p><p>  Extensive diplomatic efforts were made by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, as well as our ambassador in Russia, with Russian officials on resolving this issue.  We tried to find some solution other than this change to our own legislation.  However, it did not prove possible to do that.  We also had to seek legal advice as to whether an amendment after 31 October could be applied retrospectively.  Clearly, it can be.  We had to make direct contact with the individuals concerned and get as much detail as possible.  When one is dealing with the precise way in which other countries handle adoption, it can be difficult to get the level of detail required.</p><p>  We have managed to draft amending legislation that respects our international obligations and deals with the families caught up in the changes introduced by Russia to its internal adoption legislation.  Hopefully, this Bill will allow these families to conclude the adoptions they have started.  When we were drafting this legislation - my officials, the Department and the Attorney General - our main thoughts were with those children in institutions who were available for adoption to Irish families.  I thank Members for the care and concern they have taken on this issue, as well as the support they are offering this Bill.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, in recent years we have seen a steady decline in jobs in the town and almost every week hear about small scale job losses.  In the last year alone the town and surrounding areas lost more than their fair share and a number of community employment schemes folded.  We suffered job losses in the barracks, which equated to two major industries.  There has been no new major industry in Mullingar in the past 20 years.</p><p>  In recent years the midlands region has lost jobs at Ericsson, Tarkett Ireland and Atlantic Mills, to name but a few companies.  To date, there have been no replacement jobs.  Statistics are just figures; it is what lies behind them that counts.  Job losses have a ripple effect in every community.  As a consequence, less money is being spent in local economies which, in turn, impacts on other jobs.  What is more important is the well-being of individuals and their families and the impact of unemployment in terms of loss of self-esteem, confidence and a good education, which has a demoralising impact on all age profiles.</p><p>  Mullingar is located off the motorway, less than an hour's drive from Dublin.  It has fine schools, an abundance of recreational facilities, hotels and other natural assets such as lakes - it is located in the heart of the lake county - and rivers, which make for a certain quality of life.  Above all, it has an educated, dedicated and skilled labour force of all ages, with a wealth of experience to offer any potential employer.  It has a workforce hungry for work.</p><p>  God only knows the last time IDA Ireland brought a major Industry to the town.  While we have a new IDA Ireland business park, all we have in it are the services provided and signs.  The people of Mullingar are very disappointed that they are not being considered for any new potential enterprise and baffled as they believe they have a lot to offer a major industry.  It is a very fine place in which to work.  While I understand why decentralisation did not and could not go ahead in the format proposed, there was a loss of up to 400 jobs, which was a devastating blow to the town.</p><p>  Every time I meet representatives of Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland I receive strong indications that something is in the pipeline for Mullingar.  Perhaps the Minister might provide a timeframe for when major job announcements will be made for Mullingar and the north midlands region.  We need the Government to give this part of Longford and north Westmeath urgent attention to produce employment opportunities for the several thousand who are unemployed.  The unemployment figures suggest the north midlands region, Mullingar in particular, has a higher than average rate of unemployment.  We need early clarification before the town and rural areas are drained of their population.  I ask the Government to pay very serious attention to this problem and its knock-on effects.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-12-19a.611" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="16:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013121900052#ZZ00500"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  The story of Mullingar and County Westmeath is not unlike that in the rest of the country.  Essentially, we have been in a very difficult transition.  This has been at the heart of the Action Plan for Jobs.  When we started work on the action plan process, the economy was losing about 1,600 jobs per week, but the most recent data show that the economy is now adding 1,200 per week.  That is a great testimony to the influence of enterprise and workers in knuckling down to meet the challenges presented by the crisis.</p><p>  The transformation is also reflected in County Westmeath.  The figures from Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland in the past four years highlight the transition.  For example, 405 jobs were being lost under IDA Ireland at the height of the recession in 2009.  We have since added jobs every single year:  88 in 2010, 138 in 2011 and 222 in 2012.  IDA Ireland companies have been expanding and IDA Ireland puts in a lot of effort to work with companies.  Some 70% of announcements concern companies expanding in Ireland.  It is not, therefore, all about greenfield start-ups.  Enterprise Ireland shows a similar trend of transition.  In 2009, 706 jobs were lost in county Westmeath, and 91 in 2010.  We have since added 30 jobs in 2011 and 171 in 2012; therefore, an improving trend is evident.  The purpose of the Action Plan for Jobs is to build on these trends.</p><p>  IDA Ireland seeks to market the midlands region and regional operations account for 20% of its resources.  It seeks to work in the midlands region in the so-called hub locations of Athlone, Tullamore and Mullingar.  There are 44 IDA Ireland client companies in the region and there is progress in County Westmeath.</p><p>  The pipeline for future IDA Ireland projects is built around companies looking at Ireland as a potential country in which to invest.  Between 2010 and 2012 there were 44 site visits by potential investors in County Westmeath.  In 2013 there have been nine such visits.  It is encouraging that these site visits were by new companies visiting the location for the first time and by senior executives in existing companies.</p><p>IDA works closely with educational institutes in the region in developing the skill set necessary to attract high value added employment and has invested in the physical infrastructure required to attract FDI to the region.  This included investing &euro;3.5 million in a quality flagship business park in Athlone which is now an integral part of the agency's international market programme.  IDA is also working with SOLAS to provide guidance in developing the skill sets needs of those already in the workforce who need upskilling.</p><p> The midlands possesses a number of strengths and regionally-based assets that can be harnessed to develop further the existing enterprise base and capture future opportunities.  The establishment of the local enterprise offices under a centre of excellence within Enterprise Ireland offers new potential to develop entrepreneurs within Westmeath in particular and the midlands in general.  It is the new formation.  The county enterprise board figures are not as strong.  There have been job losses in the last two years in companies supported by the county enterprise boards and we will have a big thrust in 2014 to examine entrepreneurship regionally and nationally and see how we can build the capacity of communities to establish enterprises and see them survive and grow.</p><p> I am very conscious that Deputies feel the need for a better regional enterprise strategy.  An opportunity is emerging, which I am assessing, to examine the plans of the IDA, Enterprise Ireland and the local enterprise offices in a more integrated framework to try to develop a combined strategy for enterprise within each region.  I would like to see that ambition fulfilled because one can build better collaborative networks in regions such as the midlands to exploit the skills there and ensure we present the midlands to best advantage and develop the opportunities we seek to put in place.  I thank Deputy Bannon for raising it and assure him that we are making progress in the area, but we are not satisfied with the progress and want to do much more.</p></speech>

He referred to the midlands in general.  There is a lot happening in the Athlone area and it gives an imbalance regarding the number of jobs being created.  I referred to the north midlands, particularly Mullingar and Longford, where we have not the same employment opportunities.  We need a stronger indication of the urgent need to support Mullingar and Longford regarding enterprise and jobs.  I acknowledged the major contribution by Westmeath County Enterprise Board.  It does a fine job but needs more support from the national bodies.</p><p>  I have asked both privately and publicly for a special task force to be established in the midlands to try to promote job opportunities for the midlands.  We have a very well-educated workforce in the midlands.  I was recently amazed to learn that only approximately 5% of Mullingar graduates find jobs in the town.  I do not expect 90% of Mullingar graduates to stay in Mullingar but I would like to see a higher percentage having an opportunity to do so if they wish.  This must be addressed.</p><p>  A very strong message came from Mullingar recently that it is open for business.  This was very evident in the calibre of speakers who spoke at a recent Chamber of Commerce conference at the Mullingar Park Hotel which I attended.  We need to consider the midlands because it has haemorrhaged jobs in the last ten years.  The Minister, Deputy Bruton, is not responsible for that, but there is a view in Mullingar and Longford that the IDA has done sweet damn all for the northern part of the midlands.</p></speech>

Last year, companies supported by the IDA created 222 jobs and companies created by Enterprise Ireland created 171 jobs.  That is almost 400 jobs in the exporting sector alone.  Let us not forget that part of our strategy has been to build tourism and agriculture.  Agriculture took on an additional 25,000 people this year in farming and food.  These are sectors where the midlands has a competitive advantage and we will be trying to build on the strengths of companies in the space.</p><p>  I do not believe in having task forces speckled all around the country but we need better integration of our enterprise effort in regions.  We have an IDA office, Enterprise Ireland and we will now have the local enterprise offices, LEOs, all of which will be developing enterprise plans.  There is potential to consider the integration of those plans and build relationships with the wider community to ensure we are exploiting the assets of regions such as the midlands and towns like Mullingar.  The criticism of the IDA is unfair.  Companies decide on their locations, not the IDA or the Minister.  We are in a competitive environment where we are competing hard to win projects not against competition from Dublin, Galway or Athlone but we are fighting to win projects for Ireland.</p><p>  When we win a company, it comes and decides which area best fits its needs.  It is not led by any politician or official in the IDA.  We must ensure we present our towns and regions in the best possible light and integrate our resources to make strong offers to companies which are considering investment.  That is my ambition and I am keen to develop better regional enterprise strategies that can get buy-in from the assets and agencies in the region.  We need to work on that over the coming years.  I thank Deputy Bannon for raising this.  Clearly, his impatience for more development is rightly placed and reflects my own impatience to build more job opportunities, not just in Westmeath and the midlands but nationally.</p></speech>

I am delighted to have the opportunity to raise this issue regarding the lack of community-based speech and language services for adults in Waterford city.  The post covers the rehabilitation in St. Patrick's Hospital for adults aged over 18 years in the community presenting with speech and language or swallowing impairment.  Client groups include people with acquired neurological conditions, stroke and acquired brain injury, progressive neurological conditions, Parkinson's disease, motor neuron disease and dementia to name a few.  It is a very high risk and isolated group.</p><p>  The post manages patients in their rehabilitative stages of acquired conditions, for example following transfer from an acute setting in a hospital to rehabilitation, and provides support in the community when, in best case scenarios, patients are able to return home.  It also provides a service to adults with a diagnosis of progressive conditions presenting with new onsets of speech delay, language and swallowing issues.  A service to long-term care facilities such as nursing homes and residential facilities should also be provided should this post be filled.</p><p>  This post was offered to somebody in 2011 but that person received an e-mail from the then national director of integrated services, Ms Laverne McGuinness, and the national director of human resources, Mr. Se&aacute;n McGrath, that recruitment was suspended.</p><p>To date, there has been no speech and language therapy service for the adult population in the rehab community cohort of Waterford city.  People are assessed and treated by speech therapists in the acute hospital, but following their discharge from hospital they are left with no service or support.  As the Minister of State can imagine, this must be very isolating for this vulnerable population.  The manager has recruited therapists on her team to cover urgent eating and drinking issues, but, unfortunately, this just papers over the cracks and does not highlight the need.  This particular population is the most vulnerable in society.  Not only are the majority of these people elderly, but they have associated communication deficits which do not allow them to speak or complain about the lack of service.</p><p> This for me is the striking issue in regard to this post.  We are talking about people who have lost their ability to communicate, to speak up and to engage.  We must find a solution to this problem.  It is not good enough that adults who have communication difficulties because of acquired brain injury or the onset of a neurological condition are left bereft of services.  The position in question has never been filled, despite having been offered two years ago.  The issue is not just that the position has not been filled, but that the needs of this vulnerable group in Waterford city and the surrounding area have been left unmet.  When these people are discharged from the acute section of the hospital they have no follow-up services.  This must be addressed urgently as there are currently no speech and language therapy services for this adult population in Waterford city.</p></speech>

I understand this follows on from a query raised by a speech and language therapist in respect of the circumstances surrounding an appointment that was not made.</p><p>  Waterford community services' speech and language therapy department provides services to adults and children in Waterford city and county, including to St. Patrick's rehabilitation unit in Waterford.  Adult speech and language services, including at St. Patrick's rehabilitation unit, are provided by the HSE as required, based on prioritisation of referrals within the speech and language department.  Both St. Patrick's Hospital in Waterford city and Dungarvan community hospital are integrated in terms of client care for continuing care, rehabilitation care, respite care, convalescence care and palliative care.  Clients are placed for rehabilitation as appropriate where their assessed needs are best met within both community hospitals.</p><p>  In regard to the 20-bed rehabilitation ward at St. Patrick's Hospital, there is a process in place in advance of discharge from Waterford Regional Hospital for rehabilitation.  The service has developed a prioritisation system in order to manage access equitably and consistently.  If a patient is assessed by the multidisciplinary team as having a requirement for speech and language therapy support during the rehabilitation phase, then this client will transfer to Dungarvan community hospital rehabilitation ward, which has 14 beds, where speech and language therapy is provided.</p><p>  The current staffing complement in adult speech and language therapy services in the Waterford area is one whole-time equivalent, WTE, post, with 156 new clients attending to date in 2013, bringing the total number of attendances so far this year to 391.  The current staffing complement in children's speech and language therapy services in the Waterford area is 11.3 WTE posts, with 492 new clients attending to date in 2013, with a total number of 6,230 attendances to date this year.</p><p>  The HSE is required to maximise the use of limited resources at all times within the difficult financial environment we have and the ongoing national moratorium on public service recruitment.  Where vacancies arise, they are considered within the overall context of available resources within the speech and language therapy department.  The HSE is committed to ensuring the delivery of an appropriate speech and language therapy service across the whole Waterford area.</p><p>  I have listened carefully to what the Deputy has said and to the case she has made and can only agree with her in regard to the circumstances she has described.  The need for a speech and language therapy service is clear.  The problem is the constraint on resources.  I feel very strongly about the issue of front-line staff and I would certainly support recruitment as soon as resources allow us to recruit for these necessary posts.  However, the position is as I have outlined it at this stage.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-12-19a.619" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1093" speakername="Ciara Conway" time="17:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013121900054#BBB00300"><p>I thank the Minister of State for his response.  However, I still have concerns.  The Minister of State spoke about the services that are available, but those are services in acute hospital settings, not community-based settings.  I reiterate that there are no speech and language services for those adults who are lucky enough to be allowed to go home.  The Department of Health and the HSE have asked us to look at how we care for people who are sick and infirm.  Time and again we hear about the need for these people to go home with the support of care packages.  My concern is that we have people in acute beds because of the need for assessment in regard to speech and language therapy.  This could be done at home if the post was filled.</p><p>  In a way, we are robbing Peter to pay Paul.  We must find a solution, particularly in regard to posts in the primary care area.  I know the Minister of State is a great advocate of the primary care model and that he knows it is much better for the patient and the delivery of service if it can be delivered as close as possible to where the patient resides.  Stroke is the third most common cause of death in this country, but it is also one of the most common causes of acquired major physical disability, particularly in regard to impairment of speech.  Losing the ability to speak greatly impairs a person's ability to communicate with family, carers and others.  The Irish Heart Foundation's stroke guidelines provide clear advice that following a stroke, speech and language therapy in the rehabilitation period is essential.  It suggests that after a stroke, speech and language therapy should be provided for between two and eight hours per week and as early as possible.  However, if people are discharged from acute hospital settings into the community where there is no service, these patients regress and may have to return to hospital.</p><p>  I urge the Minister of State to communicate to the Minister my dissatisfaction in regard to the lack of provision of speech and language therapy services for the adult population in Waterford city, particularly those with very debilitating illnesses.</p></speech>

She is right that I have been and remain an advocate of that approach to our health care services, frankly because I do not think there is any possibility of our ever being able to fund and manage these health services in the future, to say nothing about the immediate need the Deputy has spoken about.  If we look at the management and future of health care services, we will not be able to manage the funding of those services in acute settings, not to mention the appropriateness of how and where people are treated and cared for.</p><p>  One of the things I have done since I took up my position was to ensure that recruitment processes were under way and that appointments were made to 265 primary care posts across the board, including public health care nurses, registered general nurses and speech and language therapists.  Regrettably, there is not a speech and language therapy post for Waterford among those 265 positions, because the allocation and distribution of those posts was based on bringing each integrated service area where staffing was below the national average up towards the national average.  Those areas where staffing was already above the national average did not receive additional posts as part of that process.</p><p>  I ask the Deputy to accept that it is an earnest of my commitment to the kinds of issue she has raised that we must look to enhance and expand primary care and care in the community, particularly in regard to the ancillary supports that people need so badly.</p></speech>

People with severe and enduring mental illness can experience a range of problems which results in their lives becoming restricted and impoverished.  Difficulties arise as a direct result of the disorder, and persistent symptoms can cause distress for the individual and for those around them.  Medication can have disabling side effects, while non-compliance can lead to disengagement from prescribed treatment, causing likely collapse.  This leads to a loss of self-confidence and sense of purpose in life, institutionalisation, social isolation and housing difficulties.  This group of service users is perhaps the most vulnerable in the mental health services, and ultimately the quality of the service overall can be measured by the quality of care provided to this group.  In the past this group reflected limitations in professional appreciation of their emotional and practical needs and limited appreciation of their potential to grow and develop as individuals through and beyond the experience of severe mental illness.</p><p>  A Vision for Change, the report of the expert group on mental health policy, states that rehabilitation and recovery mental health teams should provide a specialised service for people disadvantaged by a range of problems which can develop with severe mental illness and which cannot be adequately dealt with by the general adult community mental health teams.  It is important that a process is introduced which enables disadvantaged individuals to access as independent a life as possible in social, cultural and economic terms.  A strong commitment to the principle of recovery should underpin the work of the rehabilitation team.  This reflects the belief that it is possible for all service users to achieve control over their lives, recover their self-esteem and move towards building a future life where they experience a sense of belonging and participation.  Many of this group experienced substantial distress resulting from persistent symptoms, institutionalisation and loss of selfhood, and require individualised specialised interventions with appropriate recovery-oriented programmes.  Many could reach a level of functioning sufficient to live and enjoy a more independent life in the community.</p><p>  The needs of service users with enduring mental illness for social as well as clinical recovery is not addressed by the service provision.  Many of the vocational and training programmes which are a key component of rehabilitation and recovery do not meet the needs of service users for moving into mainstream employment.  There is a lack of adequate housing and accommodation options to enable service users move through the difficult stages of recovery and progress towards the goal of independent community-based living.  A Vision for Change recommended assigning a rehabilitation and recovery community mental health team to population groups of 100,000.  Assertive outreach teams providing community-based interventions should be the principal modality through which these teams work.</p></speech>

Positive mental health is an essential component of the Government's strategy to enhance the overall health and well-being of our population.  While mental health problems are, unfortunately, increasing throughout society, emerging awareness and associated debate surrounding these issues can only be welcomed.  A corresponding development of policies and ensuring timely and accessible services for those with serious mental illness has therefore never been more important.  In this context, the Government remains firmly committed to implementing A Vision for Change so that we have, in reality, a comprehensive, integrated, and evidence-based system of mental health services.  While this approach includes, for example, obvious areas such as promotion, prevention, and a variety of treatment services, the specific area of recovery and associated rehabilitative supports is also being progressed.</p><p>  An improved understanding of mental illness means that most people who use mental health services will recover to enjoy a good quality of life.  The inclusion in A Vision for Change of rehabilitation and recovery community mental health teams endorses the concept of rehabilitation within an overall, effective service.  Rehabilitation and recovery span virtually all aspects of mental health services, extending from continuing care to community residences, day centres and individual family supports.  More than 2,800 people with a history of mental health illness live in community residences receiving either high, medium or low-level support, depending on assessed needs.  Additional services are provided via social housing, day centre or social support networks within local communities.</p><p>  The HSE service plan for 2013 specifically identified the need to embed and develop the ethos of recovery in the mental health care programme.  The HSE will continue to strengthen this and all relevant aspects of its multidisciplinary model of care over 2014.  There are 13 consultant-led rehabilitation and recovery teams.  The national mental health division in the HSE is conducting a comprehensive review of its resources to maximise potential and address any gaps in specialist rehabilitation and recovery services.  Where specialist rehabilitation and recovery teams have yet to be provided, these services can alternatively be delivered by general adult mental health teams.</p><p>  A major direction undertaken by our mental health services since the publication of A Vision for Change is to provide services in community settings and improve access for individuals.  In this regard, a significant portion of the &euro;90 million provided since 2012 for new service developments has been directed to strengthening community mental health teams, including rehabilitation supports for adults and children.</p><p>  Recruitment of the posts approved for 2012 and 2013 is continuing.  As of the end of November, the recruitment process is complete or in the final stages for 395, or 95%, of the 414 posts approved in 2012.  Of the posts approved in 2013, the recruitment process is complete for 134, or 28%, with 278, or 58%, at various stages of recruitment.  The posts related to the &euro;35 million allocated in 2013 will continue to come on stream and are targeted to be completed in quarter 2 of 2014.</p><p>  As I have indicated, addressing the historic deficiencies of our mental health services remains a priority for Government.  The Deputy and the House can remain assured that we are firmly committed to delivering A Vision for Change, including its important aspects relating to rehabilitation services.</p></speech>

I am aware of the development of community-based mental health services.  What I am referring to is the specialised services required for those who have enduring and persistent mental illness.  A Vision for Change contains a specific recommendation on this, including an outline of the provisions required, which I do not have time to put on the record.  It is interesting that it recommends having between ten and 15 psychiatric nurses in each assertive outreach team, with a maximum caseload of 12 service users to one nurse.  This is how difficult it is to ensure rehabilitation.  It will require all staff in the mental health system who are appointed to rehabilitation and recovery services to receive training in recovery-oriented competencies and principles.</p><p>  Evaluation of the service provided to the severe and enduring group of service users should incorporate quality of life measures and assess the benefit and value of those services directly to the service users and their families.  The Minister of State referred to the appointment of posts and the allocation of &euro;490 million over the past two years, and I accept that this is the case.  I am very disappointed with the slow rate of recruitment to these teams but I understand the difficulties that have been experienced.  The planning stage by the HSE each year has been very slow.</p><p>In the first year, recruitment did not commence until October.</p><p> I would like again to voice my disappointment that the &euro;35 million promised for this year's budget did not materialise.  I welcome the allocation of &euro;25 million but the expectation was that &euro;35 million would be allocated.</p></speech>

He listed the professionals who would be associated with the team and the work that would be required of them.  Ultimately, one team per 100,000 of population would require 45 teams nationally.  I note the Deputy's comments regarding the ongoing recruitment process.  My ministerial colleague, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, has worked tirelessly to ensure resources are provided and deployed to make sure these posts are filled and progress has been made in that regard.</p><p>  The ring-fenced moneys in 2014 will enable the HSE to continue to develop and modernise our mental heath services in line with the recommendations of A Vision for Change and will allow for the recruitment of between 250 and 280 additional staff to enhance further our adult community mental health teams, child and adolescent mental health teams and specialist mental health teams, which will go a long way to redressing the historic and legacy issues in mental health service provision.  A significant amount has been achieved by the Government and, in particular by Deputy Kathleen Lynch, in that regard.  I thank the Deputy for raising the issue, as he has done on many occasions previously.  I welcome his support and his constant pressure on this issue.</p></speech>

That demonstrates the emphasis the Department is putting on the provision of broadband in rural Ireland.</p><p>  Over the past five years, the number of broadband subscriptions in the country has increased from 600,000 to almost 1.7 million.  Competition in the broadband market has begun to heat up in recent months with eircom emerging from examinership in June, UPC upgrading its current services and the recent announcement that the ESB will enter the market.  This has resulted in improved services for many urban dwellers but a digital divide is emerging between rural and urban areas.  The Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources has failed to address this matter with only 25% of homes targeted in its rural broadband scheme connecting to a broadband service.  The scheme provided no subsidy for householders who wanted to get connected; it simply put them in touch with a company that was prepared to supply it for a fee.</p><p>  EUROSTAT, the European statistics agency, found only 67% of Irish households had a broadband connection in the second quarter of 2013.  This is well below the EU average of 76%.  However, this figure is disputed, as broadband lobby group, Ireland Offline, said it is much worse.  Its spokesman, Eamonn Wallace, says the EUROSTAT figure includes mobile broadband or 3G as well as satellite broadband, which he claims should not be classified as broadband.  He says the speeds provided by 3G and satellite are barely fast enough even to book a flight.  There is an urgent need to identify blackspots.  For example, villages such as Ballinacarrigy, Ardagh, Legan, Rosemount, Castletown Geoghegan, Dysart, Monalee, Rathconnell and others in my constituency that are more than 6.5 km from a large town have no access to broadband.</p><p>  Broadband is not a luxury.  It is a critical utility for householders and businesses.  The Government talks regularly about supporting businesses in their communities.  There are many communities outside the Pale and outside county towns.  The Government needs to come forward early in the new year with a proper plan to prioritise and identify blackspots and to ensure it is attractive for broadband providers to service rural communities.  It is not economically feasible for providers to furnish broadband in these areas.  However, people cannot work from home and they urgently need access to this critical infrastructure.  I look forward to the Minister of State's contribution.</p></speech>

The State is not a service provider in this market and can only intervene in cases of demonstrated market failure.  Considerable progress has been made in recent years in both coverage and speeds of national broadband infrastructure.  A combination of private investment and State intervention, including the national broadband scheme and the rural broadband scheme, means that Ireland has met the European Commission digital agenda target of having a basic broadband service available to all areas by the 2013 deadline.  The focus must now turn to accelerating the roll out of high speed broadband.</p><p>  Current Government policy in this regard was adopted last year with the publication of the national broadband plan.  The plan commits to the delivery of high speed broadband across the country.  Delivery of this commitment is to be achieved through a combination of a State led investment in those areas where it is evident that the market will not deliver and by ensuring that the environment in right to maximise investment by the private sector.  I am pleased to advise the Deputy that since the publication of the plan there is evidence that industry is investing beyond the targets to which it originally committed.  In this regard, eircom has extended its plans for the roll out of high speed services with speeds of up to 100 mbps to be delivered to 1.4 million homes.  UPC has also increased its minimum and top speed products to 120 mbps and 200 mbps, respectively.  Additionally, mobile operators are rolling out enhanced product offerings with Meteor and Vodafone having launched 4G mobile broadband services.  Vodafone is also upgrading its 3G services to provide nationwide 3G coverage.  Other operators continue to invest and Sky has entered the broadband market, offering services over the eircom network.</p><p>  Despite these welcome developments, many towns, villages and communities, particularly in rural Ireland, will receive little of this investment and the Deputy has drawn attention to that.  It is accepted that Ireland's widely dispersed population and topography means it is simply not viable for the commercial sector to provide services in some areas.  In an effort to address the unacceptable digital divide between rural and urban areas, the Minister's Department is engaged in intensive technical, financial and preparatory work to define the scope of the State-led investment which will facilitate the widespread availability of reliable and guaranteed high speed broadband.</p><p>  In parallel, a comprehensive mapping exercise of current and anticipated investment by the commercial sector is advancing.  This exercise will identify where the market is expected to deliver high speed broadband services over the coming years and consequently the precise areas that will need to be targeted by the State-led investment.  A full procurement process must be designed and EU state aid approval must be obtained to progress this investment.  The procurement process for the approved intervention will be carried out in accordance with EU and Irish procurement rules and it is expected that it will be launched in 2014.</p></speech>

He stated: &quot;The State is not a service provider in this market and can only intervene in cases of demonstrated market failure.&quot;</p><p>I am concerned about situations where market failure is demonstrable.  Unfortunately, such failures have occurred in large parts of rural Ireland.  It is welcome that the Department is preparing proposals to address the issue.  Given the size of Ireland and its dispersed population, it is not economically attractive for service providers to supply the aforementioned villages.  However, we need to prioritise this work.  This issue has been ongoing since the first rural broadband scheme was rolled out in 2008.  At the end of 2013 too many areas continue to have poor broadband services.  It cannot simply be a question of identifying areas and telling people to deal with this or that provider.  The services need to be affordable.  I am fortunate to have opted for satellite broadband, but it cost &euro;300 or &euro;400 to have it installed and the service costs &euro;50 per month.  Many people cannot afford such a service.  When areas are identified, we need to ensure the provision is effective and affordable.  I ask the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to revert to me early in the new year with a clear timeframe for when the work will be completed in order that we can tell people when services will be delivered to them.</p></speech>

I know from discussing the issue with him that he is prioritising these matters.</p><p>  In addition to the State-led investment which will facilitate the widespread availability of reliable and guaranteed high-speed broadband, the national broadband plan also commits to a range of actions that will facilitate the more efficient roll-out of infrastructure, including addressing planning and road opening challenges, assisting in getting citizens online and more small businesses in Ireland transacting online, measures relating to spectrum policy and maximising the use of State assets, where possible.  In this regard, I am pleased to advise the Deputy that the Minister has published the ESB (Electronic Communications Networks) Bill 2013 which will provide an explicit legal basis to enable the ESB to engage in the business of electronic communications networks and electronic communications services either by itself or in conjunction with another company.  The legislation will allow the ESB to use its network infrastructure to deliver fibre services to the telecommunications market.  The potential to use its considerable network to deploy fibre will contribute to the commercial deployment of broadband services.  Through implementation of the national broadband plan, the Government is committed to ensuring all parts of Ireland will have access to high-speed broadband, with a view to ensuring all citizens and businesses can participate fully in and maximise the benefits of a digitally enabled economy and society.</p></speech>
