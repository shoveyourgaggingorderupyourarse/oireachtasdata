An extraordinary set of figures have been produced which go to the heart of undermining social cohesion in our society, as well as causing wider problems with inward investment, preparing for it and the quality of life for many people in our cities and across the country.  In short, average rents in Dublin have soared to an all-time high over the past 12 months to &euro;1,350.  Average rents nationwide are at &euro;1,077.  In Dublin, rents have gone up 12%.  In Louth, they have gone up by 15%, in Meath by 15.8% and in Kildare by 13%.  The whole commuter belt has seen significant rent increases.  In Cork, they have gone up by 14%, in Galway by 11%, Limerick by 13% and Waterford by 11%.</p><p>These are the largest rent increases ever recorded by <i>Daft.ie</i>since reports began in 2002.  This is an extraordinary crisis facing many people in our society.  Over the past several years, the Government has been bereft of any response to this growing and worsening crisis.  The impacts of it are stark and disastrous.  Ronan Lyons, the economist in Trinity College Dublin who compiled the report, made the point that it is disastrous for social cohesion and Irish competitiveness.  With the public pay and general pay rise demands, much of this is connected to the costs that people have in their everyday lives.  For people working in Dublin and in other cities as well as elsewhere, rent is now the most significant cost facing them.  This is feeding into the demands on the pay side which will feed into our competitiveness.</p><p>The big issue coming out of Brexit, where there might be some silver lining, is our capacity to attract inward investment.  That is now problematic because of the housing situation, the high level of rents and our ability to make our cities attractive to bringing in investment from such financial services companies.</p><p>It is also exacerbating the homelessness crisis because the Kelly reforms, if I may use that phrase, have not worked.  In fact, many landlords turfed out existing tenants, brought in new tenants and dramatically increased the rents.  Therefore, homelessness represents a further outcome of the rental situation.  We are now in the incredible position in which many young couples are trapped in the rental market.  It is now actually cheaper to buy a house and service the mortgage than to rent a house.  However, owing to the Central Bank rules and so on, many young couples are trapped in the rental market and cannot save the amount necessary to take out a mortgage.  What does the Government propose to do?  The report points to the need to deal with construction costs, particularly in the apartment sector, as one way of dealing with this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-11-09a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1245" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="12:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016110900004#B00200"><p>There is no doubt but that this is a problem.  It is a serious problem that is exacerbated by the circumstances of recent years.  There has been an inadequate supply of housing, and that is why the central focus of the housing action plan being brought forward and implemented now by the Minister responsible for housing is to increase the supply of houses.  This will create more opportunities for people to get accommodation and, therefore, it will address the problem of increasing rents, which represents a real problem for many.</p><p>It is accepted that there are acute pressures in the rental market now.  I have outlined one of the focus areas of the five pillars of the housing programme being put together by the Minister.  The pillars are to help families to meet their needs, to deal with affected individuals, from rough sleepers and homeless people to those in hotel rooms and bed and breakfasts, and to help young couples who are not able to avail of an opportunity to buy their own house.</p><p>I have already said in the House that the private rental sector strategy will be brought forward by the Minister responsible for housing in the next few weeks.  He has already started a serious consultation process involving a wide range of people dealing with the housing and rental sectors.  They have been invited to attend and contribute to the strategy.  The focus will be on four key areas.  The first is security.  Greater security will be afforded to landlords and tenants.  The second is supply, the objective being to maintain existing levels of rental stock and encourage investment in additional supply.  The third area is standards, which involves improving the quality and management of rental accommodation.  The fourth area is services, and it involves broadening and strengthening the role and powers of the RTB so it can provide its services more effectively and empower both tenants and landlords.  We will see a number of improvements in place before the year's end that will have to be legislatively based.  There will be new measures to ensure tenancies remain <i>in situ</i>where a landlord proposes to sell more than 20 units in a single development.  We have had experience of this already.  There are to be enhanced enforcement and dispute-resolution powers for the RTB and revised standards of accommodation in the rental sector, with new regulations to be finalised in the next couple of weeks.</p><p>The overarching objective of the strategy for the rental sector, which will be in place by the end of year, is to increase supply and support the development of a stable, strong and viable renal sector offering more choice for households and investment opportunities for providers and reflecting both the rights and responsibilities of tenants and landlords.</p></speech>

It is stated the cost is way beyond our incomes and the costs in other societies.  The cost of building is one aspect that the Government has not dealt with.</p><p>It is a significant factor in the restricted supply of apartment developments and so on across the country.</p> <p> Another issue is that of bringing vacant properties back into use.  According to the CSO's preliminary census, 200,000 houses in the private and public sectors across the country are vacant.  It is an incredible figure.  There is no strategy to incentivise their return to the market.  These are practical issues on which to focus but in respect of which nothing has been done.</p></speech>

Remember the 100,000 people who left the country because of the collapse of the financial services and because of the collapse of the construction sector.  That is why, and that is where it happened.  A T&aacute;naiste stood over here and said that we needed no more taxes because the construction sector was going to drive the whole lot for us - remember that? - and stunted the market completely.  That is the reason for it and the Deputy knows that very well.</p>  <p>  If one cannot deal with supply, one cannot deal with the upward pressure on rents.  I agree that we need more landlords and tenants.  We have to do something in respect of the cost of building.  That is why the Minister put up &euro;200 million for the opening up of sites that are currently not accessible to local authorities or private builders.</p></speech>

It is different than the traditional activity of building 100 houses and selling them on as one goes, making a profit and continuing on with that.</p>  <p>  The rental strategy will be in place before Christmas.  We had a Cabinet sub-committee meeting just this week.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, is working very hard to introduce it and I hope that everybody will give his or her views.  We need security for the tenants.  We also need responsibility for the landlords and longer term leases so that people can have that sense of security for the time ahead.</p></speech>

The Republicans now control the Senate and the House of Representatives, but the most important of these contests was the presidential election.  Mr. Donald Trump has now been elected to be the 45th President of the United States of America.  The people of the USA have spoken and the onus is clearly on the President-elect to represent all of its people and play a positive and progressive role in world affairs.  That obligation must include maintaining the positive engagement that successive US Presidents have had with Ireland.  It also means resolving the issue of the 50,000 undocumented Irish living in North America.</p>  <p>  N&iacute; f&eacute;idir linn dearmad a dh&eacute;anamh ar r&oacute;l na St&aacute;t Aontaithe sa phr&oacute;iseas s&iacute;och&aacute;na.  T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go leanfaidh s&eacute; sin ar aghaidh.  Uniquely, the Irish peace process has had the support of Republican and Democratic leaders in the House of Representatives and the Senate.  I am sure that this will continue, in particular under the leadership of Congressman Richie Neal and Congressman Peter King.</p>  <p>  I commiserate with Ms Hillary Clinton.  As First Lady, Senator for New York and Secretary of State, she was always engaged with Ireland.  Like her husband, former President Bill Clinton, she has remained interested in developing and supporting the peace process.  She has been a good friend to the people of this island and I extend my thanks and best wishes to her and her family.</p>  <p>  I will also take this opportunity to thank President Barack Obama for his engagement with the peace process.  His special envoy, Mr. Gary Hart, has made an important contribution to resolving difficulties and has been an advocate of continued dialogue.  The Obama administration facilitated the involvement of Dr. Richard Haass and Professor Meghan O'Sullivan, who chaired an all-party group on issues relating to parades, flags, emblems and the past.  I state all of this just to give the House a short insight into what the Taoiseach knows has been the contribution thus far.</p>  <p>  The key challenge for the Taoiseach will be to ensure that support for the peace process continues under the new administration over the coming four years and that the new President continues to play a positive role.  This is even more important, given the challenges of Brexit.  When does the Taoiseach intend to speak to President-elect Trump and how does the Government intend to meet these challenges?</p></speech>

I have written to both men this morning congratulating them on behalf of the Government and the people of Ireland.  I pointed out that we remembered Hillary Clinton for the work that she did during the years, with her husband, in the peace process and for being a good friend to Ireland in general.  I also pointed out to the President-elect that the Government would continue to work very closely with his new administration, as all previous administrations here had worked with whatever President had been elected in the United States.  I made the point that the changed situation in both the US Senate and Congress meant that the Republican Party would be in a position, if it so wished, to bring forward a comprehensive Bill on immigration which should be able to deal with undocumented Irish people.  Deputy Gerry Adams will recall that Senator John McCain who has been re-elected on this occasion was co-sponsor of major immigration legislation, with the late former Senator Ted Kennedy.  Obviously, we will endeavour to have that legislation put back on the agenda with the new administration when President-elect Trump sets it up.</p>  <p>  On the peace process and the support the United States has always given to it, we will start the process of making acquaintance with, and arrangements to meet, the relevant personnel in the new US administration.  We will make a request for an opportunity to speak to the President-elect.  As I said, I wrote to him and the Vice President-elect formally this morning on behalf of the Government and the Irish people.  We intend to work very closely with the new administration on the matters mentioned by Deputy Gerry Adams and others of wider import.</p></speech>

As he recounted, President Obama did try to make progress on that issue, but he was blocked in Congress.  That blocking may and, arguably, is likely to continue.  In fairness to him, the Taoiseach has raised the issue many times, as I have.  I appeal to him to persist in the time ahead.</p>  <p>  The big challenge, particularly following Brexit, is to sustain White House support for the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process.  Sinn F&eacute;in has never taken that support for granted.  Irish America is the bridge between this island and the policy makers in the White House and Congress.  That is why we engage so fully with our friends there.  They have kept faith in the quest for peace on this island and with the very legitimate and necessary objective of Irish unity.  We must all do what we can to encourage and support this work.  </p>  <p>  Alongside the plight of the undocumented Irish and whatever economic challenges new White House policies might present, there is a need to sustain and increase the very considerable contribution from the USA to the peace process.  I ask the Taoiseach to assure the D&aacute;il that this will be a primary objective of his Government and that he will go about and press ahead with achieving it consistently and strategically.</p></speech>

I am sure everybody will support the Deputy's call.  I would like to set out our range of priorities, of which the President-elect will be informed in good time before his administration is appointed.  They obviously include US support for the peace process which it has given since before the Good Friday Agreement and our continuous request that the United States deal in a substantial way with the 50,000 undocumented young Irish men and women.  There are other issues that we will set out, too.  The Deputy can rest assured that, as far as the Government is concerned, we will start very early to acquaint the new US administration with and inform it of our priorities, on which we will follow through as diligently as we can.  The Government will keep the party leaders informed of progress.</p></speech>

It took a last minute breakthrough at the Labour Court a week ago to prevent the first all-out strike by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in our nation's history.  The cost of the deal that was done to keep An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the beat will amount to much more than the &euro;40 million or &euro;50 million the Government has priced it at so far.  Disruption of more than 500 secondary schools has, thankfully, been temporarily averted but there is still no clear line of sight to the end of that dispute.  Day after day, matters get worse.  On Tuesday, it was revealed that junior doctors will ballot over industrial action if they fail to secure the return of their accommodation allowance.  Yesterday, the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, became the latest union to announce that it was proceeding to ballot on industrial action.</p>  <p>  For weeks, I have tried to put the case for mechanisms to avert ongoing industrial unrest but the Taoiseach has resisted any initiative to put the Government ahead of the curve and to maintain the very precious industrial peace in the public sector that we have enjoyed over recent years.  Repeating the mantra that the Lansdowne Road agreement is the only show in town is no longer tenable.  A queue of public sector union leaders - the people who negotiated this agreement - say publicly that the terms of the agreement have been breached.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform announced yesterday that the Government had reiterated its commitment to a collective approach to industrial relations and pay policy.  As the Taoiseach knows, that is quite different to sticking to the Lansdowne Road agreement.  The language used by Government was opaque.  I want the Taoiseach to spell it out now.  Am I right in saying that the Government has finally accepted that there is a need for a successor agreement to the Lansdowne Road agreement to be negotiated now - much earlier than the date indicated so far - so that public servants can have a clear path to pay restoration?</p>  <p>  If so, will the Taoiseach also adopt the other suggestion I have been pushing for some time now, namely, to create a discussion that is broader than pay to make sure that public servants are involved in conversations about the investment that is needed in public services because I know that garda&iacute;, nurses, teachers, doctors and public servants of all hues want to ensure that their services are maintained and enhanced as well as their own pay?  It is already very late in the day for the Government to be proactive and forward thinking on the crucial issue of public service pay but it is not too late.  Will the Taoiseach act now to prevent a free-for-all?</p></speech>

He and I had discussions previously when he was in a different position about holding lines very clearly.  In fairness to him, I have often said that he stood his ground very fast and clear.  I welcome the fact the ASTI is now in discussions and I hope that those discussions will lead to an end to some of the industrial disputes it has in respect of supervision and substitution and the money on the table for new entrant teachers.  I am glad the INMO has stated very clearly that it supports the Lansdowne Road agreement.</p>  <p>  Deputy Howlin asked me a direct question about whether I accept that there is a need for a successor to the Lansdowne Road agreement.  The answer to that question is "yes".  Do I say that it should take place now?  The Public Service Pay Commission needs to be able to start its work.  That is representative of a very broad range of exceptionally qualified people and they are entitled to look at the broader question raised by Deputy Howlin if they so wish.  This question concerns having work conducted in respect of pay, conditions and broader issues relating to any of the sectors that are in there.  We remain fully committed to the Lansdowne Road agreement and I have said this very clearly but we also need a successor to it.  The fact that the Public Service Pay Commission has already started its work is an important element here.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform does not have endless resources, no more than Deputy Howlin had.</p><p>We are not concerned only about the public sector and public services which people work very hard to provide; we have 3 million of the population, many of whom are self-employed and involved in small businesses.  Jobs were lost by the hundreds and thousands in the time of recession.  We need to strike a balance and have continued prudent management of the economy in order that we will move ahead as a country at a time when there are obviously complexities with Brexit and other issues internationally because of the economic climate.  We support taking a collective approach to dealing with this matter.  I greatly value the work that will take place with the public pay commission.  I recognise that there has to be a successor to the Lansdowne Road agreement and obviously would like the Labour Court's proposal to be reflected and voted on by the GRA and the AGSI in due course.  The Government will, of course, have to take all of these things into account.</p></speech>

However, the commitment to the public sector unions was always that as the economy improved the legislation which had formed basis on which public sector pay had been cut - the FEMPI legislation - would have to be repealed, but it needs to be done in an orderly way.  Does the Taoiseach accept this?  Does he understand it is subject to legal challenge at any time?  Without a negotiated settlement, there is a danger that the agreement might collapse entirely, that the FEMPI legislation might collapse.  I ask the Taoiseach to confirm that the cost of the Garda pay deal which was approved by the Government will be &euro;40 million or &euro;50 million and that it will be part of the published Government arithmetic.  Does he expect additional knock-on costs to be met from the published Estimates for next year?</p></speech>

He has also said there is no intention of increasing taxes to generate money to pay for it; it must come from within the public budget.</p>  <p>  On the Haddington Road and Lansdowne Road agreements, obviously the Lansdowne Road agreement allows for an initiation of a reduction and retraction of the FEMPI legislation.  That has been done in the case of opportunities for new teachers and other sectors because the Lansdowne Road agreement allows for a difference in the conclusion of discussions, depending on who is being dealt with.  In that context ,the Minister set out the cost.  It is necessary to have an orderly plan to deal with the eventual successor to the Lansdowne Road agreement and that is very much on the Minister's mind.</p></speech>

Last year the Taoiseach said that when he got to meet Donald Trump face to face, he would tell him that he had racist views and that he was a racist.  When does he think that will happen?  From what I am hearing today, the leaders of the three biggest parties in this Parliament are sending congratulations to Donald Trump when all three of them raised huge problems with things he said in the very recent past.  Speaking on radio, former Taoiseach Bertie Ahern told us we should have a love-in with a man who was a racist, a misogynist, a homophobe and many other things besides.  Rather than sending congratulations to Donald Trump, this Parliament and the people of this country would prefer if we expressed sympathy and support for every single person of colour, every immigrant, every LGBT person, every Muslim and, of course, every woman in America who is in danger of Donald Trump acting out some of his policies.</p></speech>

He has now been elected and will not change suddenly.  More in-depth analysis will obviously take place when the results are fully analysed.</p><p>It speak volumes about the neo-liberal policies that in the past few years have alienated many millions of people in America which is the richest country in the world.  These policies are quite similar to those of the Taoiseach in that the barons on Wall Street were bailed out and rescued and are now enjoying the fruits of the recovery in America.  The 20 richest people in America possess the same wealth as the bottom half of American society.  Under President Obama's Democrats administration, the level of income equality has actually grown four times faster than under President George W. Bush.  Is it not a totally dysfunctional capitalist, electoral and economic system that puts a choice before the American people of either electing a billionaire developer or a creature of Wall Street?  The inequality of which I spoke could never be tapped into by a candidate like Hillary Clinton who represents Walmart with its food banks for its own workers, who supports fracking, who refused to stand with the indigenous people at Standing Rock and who rejoinced publicly when bombs were dropped on Libya and Pakistan.  Perhaps the Taoiseach might tell us when he will be true to what he said about Donald Trump before the election.</p></speech>

By their votes at the ballot box, by the popular vote and the college vote, they chose to elect Donald Trump to be President.  I recall a comment I made in the D&aacute;il when I believe I was asked by Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett if I would agree that comments made in the heat of battle in a primary by the President-elect before he was nominated as a candidate were racists and dangerous and I said "Yes."  I listened very carefully to the President-elect this morning and the first thing he said was that it was time to heal wounds, build partnerships and work constructively with all the people of the United States and with every other country that wanted to work with him.  I have a difference of opinion with Deputy Ruth Coppinger, but in the democratic sense I was happy to congratulate her when she was returned to this House in a democracy that allowed her to say what she has just said.

Does the Taoiseach agree that it would have been much better if the anger and discontent that are clearly evident in the election result were reflected not in the election of a right-wing demagogue and populist such as Donald Trump but in someone like Bernie Sanders who, when he had been stopped and the Democrat primaries were rigged, should have gone independent and we might have had a different result today?  I want to say something about with whom we should be building bridges in America.  It is not Donald Trump who has not changed and will not change.  We should be building bridges with those who are now potentially in danger of attack following his election to protect them from the abuse, racism and misogyny he has legitimised.  We need to send a message of support to all of them, but we also need urgently to build a powerful anti-establishment alternative to cut across the hatred and division Donald Trump represents, a new anti-establishment alternative that will not be tied to the Democratic Party, a party that is pro-corporate and pro-war, but that will be a real party for the 99%.</p><p>I hope the people will organise in the US to stop Trump should he take action.</p></speech>

They have chosen President-elect Trump to be their 45th President. There is no point in assessing what might have been.  They have spoken very clearly.  They have given him the popular vote by a clear majority and the collegiate vote by a clear majority, so there is no point in wondering what might be a different result.</p>  <p>  As we are aware, democracy often throws up unexpected results, such as Brexit.  All of the pundits, commentators, polls and indicators stated the result would not be as has turned out, and the assumption by the vast majority of people was that Hillary Clinton would be elected as President.  This is not now the case.  Democracy requires that responsibility brings realism.  I am sure the President-elect, following through on his own words, will work with his new Administration to do the rebuilding, the forming of partnerships and the creating of opportunities he has spoken about not just in the US but throughout the world.  As I have stated in the House previously, the decision today is of global consequence and the Government for one, together with Members of the House, will work with the Administration in the closest way we can.</p></speech>

As the Taoiseach knows, the INMO has decided to ballot on industrial action.  What I want to bring to the Taoiseach's attention is that one of the key issues facing our hospitals is the fact there are more than 1,000 vacancies in terms of nurses and midwives, which is an extraordinary number.  After the latest recruitment drive by the HSE to address these vacancies only 85 positions were filled.  This is an incredible outcome and will impact on our ability to deal with waiting lists, waiting times and the quality of care.  The vacancies are in key areas such as intensive care, paediatrics and theatre nurses, where the turnover is significant. In short, there is a manpower issue in terms of nursing.  There is an overreliance on agency nursing.  With regard to the commitment in the programme for Government, how does the Taoiseach intend to address this core issue of 1,000 vacancies on the front line?</p></speech>

There is a pressure point here because nurses coming out of training from the 13 centres in Ireland are very much in demand because of their quality, integrity and capability, and Deputy Martin knows this.  I happened to be in NUI Galway recently at a graduation, and all 60 nurses who came through the graduation are staying in Ireland.  We have 13 centres for providing nurse training and, as Deputy Martin is aware, they are under pressure from opportunities being offered in Great Britain, the Middle East and Australia.  It is always a real challenge.  The Minister and the HSE were disappointed that they did not get the numbers they thought they might to come back, but they are working on it very assiduously.</p></speech>

Given Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin and his crocodile tears this morning, will he commit to supporting this?  The average monthly rent is now &euro;1,077.  The Government is failing those in the rental sector.  Rent certainty would put a brake on the unaffordable rent increases thousands of people face.  We have enough of lip service and platitudes.

My question relates to the housing Bill and to what the Taoiseach referred to as the comprehensive rents strategy.  Is the Taoiseach saying that rent controls will be included in the comprehensive rents strategy which he proposes to introduce in the next few weeks?  The Government needs to take a hard look at itself in terms of its housing strategy in light of, on the one hand, the highest ever annual increase in rents on record and, on the other hand, the massive increase in homelessness that was whispered out by the Department last week at the same time as only 237 social houses have been built.  Is it the Government's intention to bring in rent controls and a ban on economic evictions and to seriously invest in building social houses?</p></speech>

I call on the Taoiseach to step outside the mantra of the rhetoric he is using in his replies and tell me that he cannot stand over 51 patients on trolleys in that centre of excellence and to also tell me that the Minister for Health will visit the hospital with a view to taking a hands on approach to a solution to this problem.

The Minister for Health is visiting all hospitals.  For the information of Members he does not always advertise what hospital he will be visiting on a particular day because the story is that hospitals are moving patients because he is due to arrive.

It is stated on page 48 of the programme for Government that the Government will actively encourage payments at post offices.  Earlier today at a local post office in County Kerry a woman informed the post office clerk that she will no longer be availing of the post office's services as her jobseeker's allowance payment, up to now paid to her by cheque by the Department of Social Protection, will no longer be made to her by cheque as the Department is no longer issuing cheques.  I was informed by the Kenmare social welfare office in County Kerry that the instruction not to issue any more cheques was issued in March 2016, leaving recipients no option but to have their payments paid into their bank accounts.  This will result in the closure of post offices.</p>  <p>  The Minister has up to now been helpful in terms of listening to what I have to say about payments to post offices.  I am asking him to act in this matter.  I know his heart is in the right place but will he act accordingly?</p></speech>

I can assure him that the Government is committed to the post office network and to continued use of it.  People in receipt of regular weekly social welfare payments have a choice.  They can either have their payments paid into their bank accounts or receive them at their post office.</p><p>I have issued a directive to staff to ensure they do not actively encourage anyone to go for a bank account over the post office and the Deputy has seen that.  What the Deputy is referring to is something that occurred only in the first few weeks or around the time of the change of Government in respect of what are called casual jobseekers, that is, those who are in part-time employment who also receive jobseeker's allowance.  In those cases, the Department no longer issues cheques and instead payments are made directly into accounts.</p></speech>

The scheme was opened in 2015 but even though it was supposed to be open again in 2016, that has not happened.  I had a response from the Minister this morning in relation to 2017 and it is not very encouraging.  These people are desperate.

It met on 21 June prior to the June European Council and on 17 October prior to the October European Council.  It is scheduled to meet again in December before the next European Council meeting.  The purpose of the Cabinet committee on European affairs is to discuss and shape Ireland's strategic approach to EU engagement.  The committee will continue to work to ensure a coherent approach across all policy areas, in particular in relation to priority issues for Ireland, and to anchor Ireland's influence and interests in Brussels.  This strategic approach at EU level will continue to include engagement at bilateral level with fellow member states and alliance building with other partners.  In addition to the Cabinet committee on EU affairs, a separate Cabinet committee was established on 8 September to co-ordinate our response to issues arising from the UK decision to leave the European Union.  The committee last met on 7 November and will meet again shortly.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-11-09a.108" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1308" speakername="Paul Murphy" time="13:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016110900013#L01400"><p>Did the committee discuss the question of CETA, the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement with Canada, which has been a source of major controversy across Europe over the past number of weeks?  CETA is seen to represent TTIP in Canadian clothes.  The ISDS system is simply renamed "the investor court system" and provides corporations with the right to sue states if they interfere with the right to profit.  The race to the bottom in regulation is reflected in the establishment of a regulatory co-operation forum.  The forum will see a race to the bottom in consumer rights, labour rights and environmental rights in the interest of corporations.  The fundamentally undemocratic nature of the agreement is reflected in the fact that it is a living agreement and an ongoing committee of so-called experts will play a role in drafting regulations to the detriment of workers and ordinary people and to the benefit of big business.</p><p>It is telling that for an issue that has no popular support whatsoever in Europe or Canada, such huge pressure was brought to bear on regional governments in Belgium, including the Walloon, Brussels and German-speaking governments.  Immense pressure was brought to bear against their resistance and opposition in order to force them to accept the provisional application which has since been agreed.</p> <p> I have some questions for the Taoiseach on the sub-committee.  Did Ireland join in applying undemocratic pressure on regional Belgian governments in order to pressure them to agree to the signing and provisional application of the CETA agreement?  Has the sub-committee considered whether there is any constitutional problem with the provisional application of CETA, given that Article 29.5.2&deg; of the Irish Constitution states: "The State shall not be bound by any international agreement involving a charge upon public funds until the terms of the agreement shall have been approved by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann."?  They have not been approved by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, yet provisional application means that the investor court system now applies.  That means a charge can apply on the Irish State if, for example, it told various Canadian corporations they could not do various things they consider as going against their right to profit, which represents indirect expropriation.</p> <p> Considering the opposition and difficulty the European elites had with getting provisional application through and signing, never mind ratifying, the agreement, how does the Taoiseach feel about getting it through parliaments across the European Union?  How will it be passed by this Parliament, given that the more people become aware of what are in international trade agreements the more opposition to them exists?</p></speech>

As the Taoiseach knows, given that I raised the issue with him last week, there have been discussions with the Business Committee and so on, and a specific request from the Not On Our Watch group that 200 unaccompanied children who are in serious danger and are very vulnerable are taken in by Ireland.  There are well over 1,000 young people in the jungle in Calais.  This is against a background where thousands of unaccompanied children have disappeared, hundreds from Calais itself.  Has the sub-committee made a decision on whether it will accede to the request that we tell the French authorities we will take in 200 children?</p>  <p>  I have seen the draft motion from the Government.  It is vague and makes no specific reference to numbers, commitments or anything like it.  It is all about considering this and that.  That is not what we asked for.  Having consulted with the Not On Our Watch group, I can now signal that an amendment will be tabled in the next hour or two unless the Government is willing to make specific commitments.  An e-mail was sent to the Government stating what is required for the motion to get all-party support.  I want a direct answer from the Taoiseach.</p>  <p>  In the United States a President who plans to shut the door on children and immigrants from war zones has been elected.  A disgraceful and utterly racist policy has been articulated by the new President of the United States.  There is no time more appropriate for us to send a message in the opposite direction, namely that this country will open its arms and doors to young, vulnerable children whose lives and safety are at risk and send a message to Mr. Trump that we are not going along with his nasty vilification of desperately vulnerable people.  Will the Taoiseach tell us the position of the Government and Cabinet Committee on European Affairs on taking in 200 unaccompanied children?</p></speech>

I have a copy of the proposed draft motion.  I have not had the opportunity to consult with anyone on it, but it is ambiguous, unconditional and makes no real commitments.</p><p>It certainly does not deal with the specific request made of the Oireachtas, which is to take in 200 of these children. </p> <p> Has the Cabinet committee discussed the Government's response to the ongoing humanitarian tragedy?  A report by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees confirmed last Friday that at least 240 refugees had drowned recently off the coast of Libya.  We are almost immune to it.  We are speaking about people.  Five rescue boats were within sight of the refugees but, despite their best efforts, most of those refugees died.  The Government is still remiss in terms of its commitments, which are too limited.  We should be making a greater commitment to bringing those people to this country, but the Government has not even kept to its own targets.  In terms of the Not On Our Watch group's request, it appears to me that the Government is dodging the issue.  Will the Taoiseach reconsider and accept the imperative of taking these 200 children from France?</p></speech>

We are in the middle of a crisis.  The EU itself is in a crisis.  Brexit has been a catalyst for that and there are other issues as well, including economic, social and political ones.  Ireland needs to have a position on how we want to see the European Union evolve post-Brexit.  Our membership changes as a result of the decision of the UK to leave the EU and our relationships with other countries will have to take stock of that change.  Other countries, for example, France and Germany, are raising the old tax harmonisation agenda.  There is talk of more centralisation of powers within the European Union.  We need to speak up for what we want and how we envisage the European Union evolving.  Is it not time for us to produce a detailed White Paper on European Union policy?</p>  <p>  I have sought a debate on the EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA, for the past three weeks.  I disagree fundamentally with what previous Deputies have stated.  Trade matters for Ireland.  It creates jobs for Ireland.  Are we seriously stating that Ireland should be an isolationist Ireland on the periphery of Europe that does not want to be part of any global trade agreements?  It beggars belief that such an argument is gaining sway without any counterargument being facilitated in the national Parliament.  We need a full-blooded debate on what Ireland wants in terms of trade.  The lifeblood of small to medium-sized enterprises, services, agrifood and traditional manufacturing is trade.</p>  <p>  The Canadian deal opens up significant opportunities for those involved in the export of infant formula, beef and other products as well as those involved in software services.  It presents a great opportunity, so why the hell are people arguing that we should not create that opportunity for Irish companies?  It is always a one-way train: this must be terrible, is terrible and should never happen.  People should realise that Canada and Ireland have a lot in common.  We have similar systems and we can and will benefit from access to the Canadian market.  This is particularly so for our services sector and some of our food companies.  We need a proper, comprehensive debate in this House so that the other side of the argument is heard.  There is value in having open trade.  In the late 1950s and early 1960s, this country decided to be outward looking and to be open in its approach to trade.  The approach has been beneficial in terms of jobs and industrial policy.  It is time to state that fact.</p></speech>

Rather than having a division on the floor of the House, could we sit down to try to reach consensus?  There was a huge degree of consensus last week on this issue.  I believe the Government was party to that consensus, although it may not have been well expressed by those on the Government benches.  Let us try to get an agreement on the motion.</p>  <p>  On the Cabinet Committee on European Affairs, yesterday the Taoiseach stated that he would look for some regular mechanism to update the House, for instance, by way of a weekly bulletin or debate.

If leaders of the parties request an interim update on some aspect, we will also supply them with that.</p>  <p>  Deputy Paul Murphy raised the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA, about which Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin spoke very clearly.  I am not sure what we, as a trading nation, are afraid of in respect of having agreements that provide trade and job opportunities for hundreds of thousands of our people.  I do not know if the Deputy has been around the country but he should visit many of the smaller firms all over Ireland to see what they are doing and where they are exporting.  He should not be afraid of that.</p>  <p>  CETA was signed on Sunday, 30 October 2016.  The European Parliament must give its consent before the agreement can be provisionally applied.  I strongly support CETA and the Government strongly supported its provisional application.  We are of the view that there should be no impediment to Irish companies taking immediate advantage of the provisions of CETA which are of EU competence, including the all-important chapters in the programme on public procurement rules and tariffs.  We very much welcome the clarity afforded in the joint interpretative declaration on issues which were the subject of some disquiet and speculation.  This provides further assurances in respect of public services, labour and environmental rights and the investment courts system.  These areas have been the subject of much public debate.</p>  <p>  In addition, the investment protection and investment dispute settlement mechanisms have been specifically carved out from provisional application.  This means these provisions will not come into effect until voted for by the D&aacute;il.  Provisional application is a standard process in free trade agreements, which provides for the coming into effect of those areas over which the European Union has competence.  The full entering into force of CETA will be subject to the approval of all member states through the relevant national ratification procedures.  This means the D&aacute;il will be part of the final decision to ratify CETA in accordance with Article 29.5.2 of the Constitution.</p>  <p>  CETA will save on duty costs, as 99.9% of all industrial tariffs will be eliminated on it entering into force.  It will open up new markets and opportunities for many Irish firms and end limitations in access to public contracts.  It will open up services markets and offer predictable conditions for investors.  Irish firms will benefit from the recognition of products standards and certification, thus saving on the double testing on each country on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>  <p>  The agreement has been publicly available online in all languages since 5 July.</p></speech>

This matter, which has been raised at European Council meetings on a number of occasions, is between Britain and France.  The British Government has duties and responsibilities under the European Union treaties to take in unaccompanied minors and children where they have relatives or family in the United Kingdom.  This matter was dealt with between President Hollande and the former Prime Minister, Mr. David Cameron, on a number of occasions.</p>  <p>  The situation in Calais was completely unacceptable.  The humanitarian crisis has been dealt with to the extent that some children have been taken into Britain and the French social services are looking after the remaining children.  A case has been made for Ireland to take 200 children.  We have taken more than 100 unaccompanied children under the programme to which we signed up.  I make the point to Deputy Boyd Barrett that when we brought children here before we put them into hostels and some of them died in the care of the Health Service Executive, while others disappeared or were trafficked into the sex industry.  We will not stand for a repeat of that situation.  </p>  <p>  I understand only 28 foster parents are available.  Tusla has stated that an exceptional cost applies to this, although I do not want to talk about money in this regard.  If we do this, and we want to help, we need to have services and proper accommodation available for young unaccompanied minors.</p><p>We have over 100 here already.  Tusla has spoken about the medical, language, health and the educational requirements.  They should be in foster homes.  While this has been a terribly disappointing situation, Ireland wants to help.  We did sign on for 4,000 refugees.  There are numbers coming in already who are children.</p></speech>

I listened to the Taoiseach's comments today on that issue.  He pointed to the acceptance speech made by Donald Trump this morning and expressed the hope that Donald Trump will heal divisions in US society.  The Taoiseach has indicated it will be business as usual between the Irish Government and the US Administration.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach might be the only person in the country who believes that Donald Trump is going to heal divisions in US society.  He might be the only person in the country who puts great faith and stock in Donald Trump&rsquo;s words this morning.  I remind the Taoiseach that this is a man who has spoken of 11 million deportations from the United States over the coming period.</p>  <p>  There are some points to be made about the idea that it is business as usual.  The Taoiseach congratulated President-elect Trump.  He said that, on behalf of the Government and the people of Ireland, he was pleased to offer our sincere congratulations to Donald J. Trump on his election as the 45th President of the United States.  Those sentiments were echoed by the leader of Fianna F&aacute;il.  They were added to by a former leader of Fianna F&aacute;il who said we needed to get into a love-in with the new US Administration.</p>  <p>  They have also been echoed by Deputy Gerry Adams.  Sinn F&eacute;in projects itself as a radical left-wing party.  I doubt very much if the leader of any other party anywhere in Europe or in the world, which projects itself as radical left-wing, will be standing up today in their parliaments offering congratulations to Donald J. Trump.  Deputy Gerry Adams should not be offering congratulations to Donald Trump.  Many of his supporters will feel he should not be doing so either.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach said he is offering congratulations on behalf of the people of Ireland.  He is not offering them in my name or in the name of AAA-PBP.  I am sure many people will support me on this.  Instead, the message we would like to project today is one for ordinary American people.  It is for those who are facing mass deportations, those LGBTQ, lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans and queer, people facing attacks on their rights, and those working people who are facing attacks from an extremely right-wing administration.  We call on those working people, those immigrant communities and those minorities to resist these policies.  We offer our support to those communities and to the resistance that is organised.</p>  <p>  Earlier, Deputy Ruth Coppinger drew some comparisons between the policies of the Government and the leader of the new US administration.  I would like to make several other comparisons.  Mr. Trump has spoken about putting up a wall between the United States and Mexico to stop immigration.  There has been a certain amount of tut-tutting in the political establishment in Ireland and Europe about this and the naked way in which those points were explained by Mr. Trump at his rallies.  Is there a significant difference between Europe and him?  We have a fortress Europe policy in operation in the European Union.  We have a policy being implemented in the Mediterranean of physically blocking, stopping and preventing migrants attempting to come to Europe from getting to Europe.  Large numbers of migrant men, women and children have drowned as a result of that.  Is there a big difference in reality?</p>  <p>  Mr. Trump has spoken about punishing women who procure abortions in US states where abortion is not legal.  He was forced to qualify his comments when there was a storm of opposition to them.  However, he said it while the Administration in this country has actually done it in law.  A Bill passed in the lifetime of the last Parliament means that a woman who procures an illegal abortion in this State can, under Irish law as it stands, face a prison sentence of up to 14 years.</p></speech>

His low tax model does not go as far as the Irish Government&rsquo;s rate of 12.5%.  The Irish model has produced huge inequality, poor funding for public services and a race to the bottom.</p>  <p>  I was born in the United States of America in the state of Ohio.  This gives me a certain insight - I will not say more than that - into American politics and the attitudes of its people.  I am strongly of the opinion that if Bernie Sanders had stood as an independent, left, anti-establishment candidate in this presidential election, he could have and would have beaten Donald Trump.  It shows the need for the building of a radical, left, anti-establishment alternative.  In the United States, there is a two-party system, Democrats and Republicans.  In Ireland, there is also a two-party system which has been dominated by Fianna F&aacute;il, on the one hand, and Fine Gael, on the other.</p><p>I listened to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, and Deputy Michael McGrath when they made their speeches on the budget a couple of weeks ago.  They expressed the hope that the centre would hold.  In reality, they expressed the hope that the traditional right-wing parties would hold their grip on Irish politics.  I remember thinking that night that the points they were making and hopes they were expressing were off the mark because they underestimated the effects of the policies of recent years on the mass of ordinary people.  They underestimated the pain and anger that ordinary people feel and the mood and desire for real change among them.</p> <p> Unfortunately, Mr. Trump has tapped not only into the reservoir of misogyny and racism but also into the justified anger that tens of millions of ordinary Americans feel because of austerity politics.  The lesson in this country and others throughout the world is that the positive sentiment, the mood for change, must be tapped.  It must not be tapped by the establishment because the mood is against it.  We do not want it to be tapped by the populist right; it must be tapped by the radical left in a positive and progressive way.  It must be anti-racist, in favour of women's and workers' rights and anti-establishment.  AAA-PBP commits to redoubling its effort to building such a radical-left alternative in this country, as I am sure others will do in other countries.</p></speech>

I have just listened to a seven-minute speech with no question at all.</p>  <p>  I remind Deputy Barry that he is an Ohioan.  He is living in Ireland and is an Irish citizen.  He has freedom of movement in 28 countries in what he calls "Fortress Europe".  He can travel to any one of the 28 with impunity.  Maybe he does so.</p>  <p>  It is business as usual today.  The position now is that the new President-elect will take up office on 20 January and appoint a new Administration.  I have pointed out to Deputy Adams issues that we regard as important and a priority in our continuing business with the United States.  We have always had the support of the United States for the peace process in Northern Ireland and the Good Friday Agreement and we have had continuous discussion on the rights of Irish men and women who happen to be undocumented in the United States.  The latter has been a particular bone of contention for us for quite a number of years.  We hope the people who voted in the United States have voted for a change of influence in terms of the Congress and Senate.  Now that they will be controlled by the Republican Party, we hope they will put forward a comprehensive immigration Bill to deal with the undocumented Irish.</p>  <p>  The Deputy seems not to accept the democratic result of the vote of the people of the United States.  They voted by secret ballot and decided to elect Mr. Trump as their 45th President.  He is to take office on 20 January 2017.  I am not sure the Deputy is entitled to give out to the Americans about the decision they made.  The Deputy is elected by people, and he is entitled to be.  Everybody supports that democratic decision.  However, if the Deputy wants to give out about the people in the United States, through AAA-PBP, he should go over to Ohio, start there and campaign strongly against what he believes to be a decision that is anti-democratic.  </p>  <p>  We will work with the new Administration, just as we have worked with all Administrations over the past 50 years, in the interest of developing economic and social links between Ireland and the United States.  Circumstances are different from what they used to be.  Although we relied for centuries on help from the United States, there are now 100,000 people employed by Irish-owned companies across 50 states.  That is the kind of development we would like to see in the time ahead.</p></speech>

However, important events have taken place since the last meeting.  I refer in particular to the result of the dispute between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Government on pay.  I probably should not use the word "result" because the feedback I am getting is that the Garda ballot was far from a done deal.  There is a lot of discontent and opposition to the deal.</p>  <p>  As it stands, the State is lined up to pay somewhere between &euro;40 million and &euro;50 million extra to garda&iacute; on the basis of the recommended deal.  Of course, it will not stop with the garda&iacute;.  The nurses are pursuing a claim.  Low-paid civil servants, members of the CPSU, SIPTU, IMPACT and other public service unions will be pursuing claims now.</p>  <p>  I note the Government propaganda machine cranked into action over recent days with an attempt at what I can only describe as a divide-and-conquer policy.  The basic message that is being sent out by the Government propaganda machine is that if there is higher pay for garda&iacute;, nurses and low-paid civil servants over and above that set out in the Lansdowne Road agreement, there will be less money for the health and education services and people on social welfare.  That is a crude divide-and-conquer strategy.  It is a crude attempt to set parents against teachers, people who use the health service against nurses, and people on social welfare against public servants.  It is a disgraceful policy.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach is well aware that there is an alternative strategy that would mean higher and more decent pay and an end to two-tier pay among public servants, on the one hand, and the protection and improvement of public services, on the other.  That can be done by bringing in extra finance.  There are plenty of opportunities to bring in extra finance.  I will not detail 20 of them as we have had the budget debate but I will pick one as a simple example.  It is the idea of a millionaire's tax.  If a modest 2% tax on the income and wealth of millionaires in this country were introduced, what would it produce?  It would produce a fund of &euro;2.9 million per annum.</p></speech>

One would be able to end the two-tier pay system for young workers in the public sector and restore all the wages and benefits taken from public sector workers in the course of the austerity crisis years.</p><p>There is a clear alternative if it is prepared to tax the rich.  Of course, the Fine Gael Party is a party of the rich and will not entertain the idea of taxing them, as shown by the nudges, winks, nods, grins and laughter between the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, and the Taoiseach in the course of my contribution.  They believe my suggestion is amusing, but many people will say it is basic common sense, would be good for ordinary people and should be done.  Obviously, vested interests are impacting on Fine Gael's party policy.</p> <p> What now for the trade union movement, including the ICTU, in addressing this issue?  The movement should, first and foremost, base itself on a simple policy, that being, pursuing what is necessary for its members, those whom it represents.  Two things are necessary, the first being full restoration of all of the money taken from the back pockets of public sector workers during the austerity crisis years.  This should not be done in 2018, 2019 or 2020; effectively, it should be done now.  Second, the cost of living has increased for these workers in recent years.  I could point to motor insurance premiums and many other factors, but what about mortgage and rent payments, the second of which affects young public servants, in particular?  Not only should there be full pay restoration, but claims should be submitted to address cost of living increases.  If they can be negotiated with the Government, grand, but the Taoiseach, the Minister and those on the Government benches are taking a hard line in considering this type of idea.  If these issues cannot be negotiated, claims should be submitted.  If strikes and battles are necessary to win the justified increases, it is right to do so and we will be prepared to stand alongside public servants every inch of the way as they battle for pay justice.</p></speech>

Something President-elect Trump has in common with Deputies Mick Barry, Richard Boyd Barrett and Paul Murphy is his opposition to free trade agreements.  They are on the same page in not facilitating free trade, something on which the President-elect was strong.  This is concerning in the context of the broader international environment.  Are we moving into an era of protectionism and does the Cabinet committee on the economy and trade need to assess the international environment?  I hope the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA, will get through, but the position is now much different.  Some Deputies oppose all elements of all trade agreements.  Regardless of whether anyone likes it, the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP, is now gone.  Both candidates in the presidential election were against it.  No comment was made on the similarity between President-elect Trump's policies and those of the far left in this House.  In the case of Brexit, those who wanted to leave the European Union and the anti-Europeanism had much in common with the attitude to the Union of Deputies Paul Murphy, Richard Boyd Barrett and Mick Barry, which is interesting.  The economy is facing multiple threats.  There is a great deal of uncertainty as a result of the presidential election in America and there was a great deal of concern beforehand.  These concerns remain justified and cannot be swept under the carpet.  There is considerable uncertainty about what the new President's policies will be.</p>  <p>  As for the idea that in a normal democratic environment one would not congratulate the winner, there was a democratic contest and the transition of power is important in democracies, including parliamentary democracies.  We should always acknowledge this and not go against it.  The Presidents of the European Commission and the European Council have sought an early meeting with President-elect Trump.  The Taoiseach should support that request.  A meeting is required because the relationship between the United States and the European Union is of central importance to our economic development and the work of the Cabinet committee on the economy and trade.  Does the Taoiseach accept that there is a need to stand back and reflect on where the world is going in terms of trade policy and that the Cabinet committee should carry out some work in this regard?</p></speech>

For a long time, that was the great irritant in our affairs, in that others decided what we should do.  One does not have to agree with the outcome or the policies of those who are elected.  In Ireland and the United States Sinn F&eacute;in has argued with US Presidents, including personally, on foreign policy, particularly on Palestine, Cuba, Afghanistan and Iraq, and we will continue to do so.</p>  <p>  What steps will the Government take to support the retail sector in the light of the currency fluctuations arising from the Brexit decision in England and Wales?  Some &euro;52 million has been set aside in capital funding in 2017 to support the enterprise sector and assist Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland in responding to Brexit.  Given all of the uncertainties, difficulties and pressures, InterTradeIreland's quarterly business monitor reveals that 97% of our businesses are not ready for Brexit.  Is the Government considering providing additional supports for exporters to meet the challenge of Brexit?  Will the Taoiseach commit, having failed to do so as clearly as he should have, to building support for designated special status for the North within the European Union in keeping with the result of the vote of the people there and tailor Government policy to meet that objective?</p></speech>

Obviously, these are matters that are continuously kept under discussion.  It does Deputy Mick Barry no justice to forget the contribution they have made in the greater interests of our economic development.</p>  <p>  I have to agree with Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin that the TTIP is now dead.  Clearly, comments made during the course of the primary and presidential elections on trade agreements are, I think, already being revised to the extent of perhaps adjusting some of the agreements instead of doing them down altogether.  This is an issue to which, obviously, we will return.</p>  <p>  I also agree that, from a European and an Irish perspective, we need to look five, ten or 20 years ahead.  That is why I always say the European Union should not be afraid of the future.  It is a bloc of 28, soon to be 27, member states and almost 500 million people.  It is one of the best developed regions on the planet, capable of setting the standards and conditions that should apply to world trade for the next 50 years.  Where we need to move is to a future of prosperity, peace and opportunity.  These are things we could usefully discuss here in the context of the broader European part we have to play.</p>  <p>  Deputy Gerry Adams referred to the retail sector.  This is one of the themes and sectoral areas that will be discussed in considerable detail, North and South, in the next period arising from the all-island forum established in the consideration of Brexit.</p><p>I have discussed previously with the Deputy his views on seeking a special arrangement, status or position.  When we last discussed this matter, two issues arose, one of which was seeking an alternative, while the other was seeking special status.  To a degree, we have been recognised as being very different in the context of the Border, the peace process, INTERREG funds, PEACE funds and all of the supported activity on a cross-Border basis covering infrastructure, medical services, education and so on.  In the recent budget we were obviously cognisant of Brexit and the Minister for Finance made a number of arrangements in that context, one of which involved the retention of the 9% VAT rate for the hospitality sector.  It has had an impact in stabilising and increasing opportunities in the sector which is very important in the context of future developments.  We will have an opportunity to discuss these matters further in the House at a future date.</p></speech>

He was a native of Newbridge and came from a very distinguished military family.  He served his country with expertise, dignity and distinction.  He was an exemplary member of the Defence Forces and is a huge loss to his family and military colleagues.  He served with distinction and will be well remembered and respected for the compassion and kindness he showed to the soldiers with whom he served.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam.</p>  <p>  My question relates to the response of the Department of Defence to the report on the well-being of members of the Permanent Defence Force and the plans to address the principal issues which require attention.</p></reply>

I had the opportunity to sympathise with his wife and two children recently.  He is a huge loss to the Defence Forces, particularly the training college at the Curragh where he played a very important role as director.</p><p>The independent monitoring group was established in May 2002 to oversee implementation of recommendations arising from a report on interpersonal relationships within the Defence Forces.  Both the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers, RACO, and the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association, PDFORRA, are represented on the group.  </p><p>The third and most recent report of the group was published in September 2014.  Among its recommendations was that a climate survey be conducted within 12 months and subsequently at reasonable intervals.  A similar survey was conducted in 2008.  The aim of the survey which was conducted by the University of Limerick was to identify trends to inform best practice in human resources management and training and education within the Defence Forces.  As with the 2008 survey, approximately 11% of the workforce, in this instance, 1,055 personnel, were sampled.The key findings of the survey are grouped under topics such as work-life balance, peer support, organisational justice within the organisation, procedural justice, organisational fairness, Defence Forces integrity and supervisory justice.  The researchers who undertook the project point out that the findings of the report and its recommendations are interconnected and that caution should apply to reading or responding to any one finding in isolation. </p><p>I have reviewed the report in detail.  I have also received a briefing on the findings from the University of Limerick.  The survey findings clearly point to challenges for the Defence Forces, particularly in the areas of leadership, communication, organisational culture, the working environment and active management of personnel expectations.  However, many positives also emanated from the survey, especially regarding the commitment of personnel to the values and mission of the organisation, high levels of work satisfaction, pride in the organisation and positive views on culture and work support.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>The response to the issues raised in the report on the climate survey will be led by the Chief of Staff by way of an action plan which involves the engagement of all levels of management within the organisation. </p><p>Both RACO and PDFORRA were recently briefed by the University of Limerick researchers on their findings and conclusions.  Following that briefing, I recently met the representative associations to hear their views and listen to their concerns about the report.  At the meeting we agreed that they would be fully engaged in the response to the report and the proposed action plan through the implementation monitoring group framework, whereby they could put forward their views on appropriate responses.  The group provides a collaborative environment in which issues can be surfaced and addressed jointly by management and staff representatives.  It was also agreed that there would be a further meeting with the University of Limerick and the implementation monitoring group to further consider the findings and get behind the quantitative data contained in the report.  The associations will also attend planned focus groups, to be facilitated by the University of Limerick, to further explore the issues raised in the climate survey report.</p></speech>

It is very clear from the survey responses that Defence Forces personnel have become less happy in recent years with their working conditions.  There is a very strong perception of a lack of justice in the organisation.  It is also clear that there is a disconnect between the expectations of members of the Defence Forces and how they are met.  It is particularly disturbing that while 70% of respondents felt loyal to the Defence Forces and its values, only 23% felt obliged not to look for work elsewhere.  This means that 77% would consider looking for work elsewhere.  I understand it is the intention of the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces to engage the University of Limerick to conduct a series of focus groups with serving personnel.  When will these focus groups commence?  What is the schedule and when will a report be delivered to the implementation monitoring group?</p></speech>

I have asked him to revert to me with a plan and profile of the timelines for the focus groups.  It is important to recognise that it was very courageous and forward looking of the Defence Forces to take the initiative of conducting a climate survey and questioning their members.  The survey gave personnel, who number more than 9,500, an opportunity to express their real feelings about the Defence Forces.  There is no doubt that there are huge challenges ahead on foot of the findings of the survey.  In such a large organisation the management of expectations is a huge challenge for the leadership of the Defence Forces, but it is one that can be met.</p></speech>

It is very disconcerting to note, however, that more than 10% of commissioned officers and 25% of enlisted personnel have left the Defence Forces since the 2013 reorganisation.  There are significant gaps in capability, expertise and unit manning levels.  There are no conclusions or recommendations made in the report as to how the Department of Defence can deal with this issue.  Another key question relates to the initiatives that can be taken to mitigate the extent of voluntary exits.  It is well known that retention initiatives are deliverable at a fraction of the cost of constant recruitment and training.  </p>  <p>  I have a specific question about the 38 vacancies in the middle and lower ranks of the Naval Service.  The non-filling of these vacancies is preventing ships from going to sea and negatively impacting on the welfare, productivity and operational capacity of the Naval Service.</p></speech>

The Defence Forces have introduced a number of initiatives to improve family life for personnel, for example.</p><p>Probably one of the biggest is the rotation of personnel abroad where they can do a three-month tour of duty instead of a six-month tour.  That was one of the initiatives to help families and often young families, fathers and mothers who were separating themselves from their sons and daughters.</p> <p> I wish to meet with the representative organisations, which are the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers and the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association.  I met both organisations recently and my officials and I had a discussion with them to find out what their feelings were following the publication of the climate survey.  I will continue to interact with the organisations because they are the representatives of the people on the ground and if there is a message to come forward, it comes from the bottom up</p></speech>

He stated that they were an essential partner in the reconstruction of the Malian state and the main instrument for the reconstruction of its armed force.  Why are Irish troops providing training and mentoring to the Malian armed forces when the same army has been responsible for well-documented human rights abuses during the civil war in 2012?</p></reply>

Training is also being provided in international humanitarian law, the protection of civilians and human rights.  </p>  <p>  During my recent visit to Mali, I witnessed at first hand the significant contribution that Irish Defence Forces personnel are making to the mission.  The Defence Forces have been participating in EUTM Mali since March 2013.  Currently, Ireland is contributing 18 personnel to this mission - an increase of eight personnel over the last six months.  A total of seven Irish personnel occupy staff appointments in the mission headquarters in Bamako and the remaining personnel are based in Koulikoro Training Centre.  The mission is now completely integrated into the military training structure in Mali.  EUTM Mali is recognised as an essential partner in the reconstruction of the Malian state and the main instrument for the reconstruction of its armed forces.  Our continued participation in this mission supports Ireland's ongoing obligations to international peace and security and the commitment to maintaining the Defence Forces capabilities in international operations. </p></speech>

My question, part of which the Minister of State alluded to, concerns the role of our soldiers in mentoring an army that has been found to have carried out such a level of human rights abuses.  I note from the Minister of State's reply that part of the job of the mission is to provide mentoring in international humanitarian law and human rights.  How successful has this been?  How can it be undertaken?  Is it intended to increase the number of Irish soldiers involved in that mission?</p></speech>

If it is to be increased, I will, of course, inform the Deputy.  The strategic review of the EUTM Mali mission was completed earlier this year.  Following the review, the Council of the European Union approved EUTM Mali's third mandate in March 2016, which adopted the existing mandate and extended it by a period of two years through to May 2018.  The objectives of the third mandate are training support for the benefit of the Malian armed forces, in which the Irish Defences Forces are very much involved; training and advice on command and control, logistical chain and human resources as well as training on international humanitarian law, protection of civilians and human rights; and a contribution upon Malian request and in co-ordination with the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali to the disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration process framed by the peace agreement through the provision of training sessions in order to facilitate the reconstruction of inclusive Malian armed forces.  I witnessed at first hand what our Irish personnel are doing on the ground, specifically training the Malian armed forces, and how difficult a job that can be.  I can assure the Deputy that the job that Irish Defence Forces personnel are doing out there is crucial for the Malian armed forces and in stabilising that country.</p></speech>

Has consideration been given to the fact that Irish forces are there because the French, who were involved in many imperialist ventures in Africa over the centuries, requested that other armies go into Africa to pick up the pieces in areas where imperialist forces have been in the past?  If there is an increase in the number of Irish soldiers is requested, I ask that at the very least there would be a major debate in the House, particularly given that it would be greater than what would have been allowed.</p></speech>

I was led to believe that it would bring all the stakeholders in Kildare and the Curragh together for the greater good of the public in Kildare while improving the lot of those who live, work and have leisure time in the Curragh.  My question is based on the description that was given in the plans.  There have been two scheduled meetings that I am aware of, one on 8 March and the other on 19 July.  I inquired about the agenda and topics relating to those meetings of the forum but received rather bland answers on each occasion.</p></reply>

Membership of the forum, which is chaired by the Department of Defence, includes representatives from the Defence Forces, an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Curragh Racecourse, Curragh race horse trainers and Kildare County Council.  The forum will also consider representations from other representative groups of stakeholders and interested parties as required.</p>  <p>  To date, there have been three meetings of the forum, the most recent of which was held on 27 October.  Issues discussed have included illegal encampments, illegal parking, dumping, over grazing and the ongoing management and maintenance of the Curragh Plains.  At the most recent meeting, a number of measures were agreed by the members of the forum to assist in addressing these issues.  I am well aware of the many issues which need to be addressed in the context of the day-to-day management and use of the Curragh Plains.  Consequently, I am supportive and appreciative of the work being undertaken by the forum.  I am confident that in working together, the members of the forum will provide the resolve and expertise to greatly assist in the identification and implementation of solutions to the problems which need to be addressed. </p></speech>

I would appreciate the opportunity to see what arose from the meeting on 27 October.  I am delighted that the serious issues of illegal camping and dumping were high on the agenda.  I had asked that two issues be addressed.  I had asked that ambulance cover for jockeys riding out on the Curragh be included, but my request was refused.  Jockeys and workers in the horseracing sector experience injuries during their employment.  The other issue about suitable notification for road closures due to firing on the rifle ranges has yet to be resolved.  Has there been any discussion on those issues and, if so, have there been any achievements or resolutions to date?</p></speech>

The Deputy has raised the issues with me previously as has Deputy Heydon.  I have asked that the forum would specifically look into these ongoing problems on the Curragh plains.</p>  <p>  The Deputy spoke about the horseracing sector and horses being ridden out on the Curragh Plains.  I am not sure if that was discussed at the last meeting, but I will get back to the Deputy to let her know.</p>  <p>  The Deputy previously spoke to me about road closures around the rifle range area.  I do not want to be flippant in saying this, but this is the middle of the Curragh and residents understand that on occasions the roads have to be closed.  I have asked the Defence Forces to communicate through social media, in local newspapers and on local radio to inform the general public if they are to close roads.</p></speech>

I have spoken to many of the stakeholders involved who have great enthusiasm for developing the plains and making them a strong natural feature.  I acknowledge the help of Department of Defence officials regarding the issues I raise.  If the Curragh were designated as an NHA, it would be afforded legal protection by underpinning the existing Curragh of Kildare Acts and its current designation as a recorded monument under the National Monuments Act.  The addition of an interpretive centre and visitor points would greatly enhance the tourism potential.  Allocated parking areas would also help to reduce the random uncontrolled traffic on the plains.</p>  <p>  I firmly believe the Curragh Plains should be designated as a national park under the natural heritage area guidelines as they meet all the criteria.

There is potential for a number of quick wins that do not cost any money by updating the by-laws where necessary for the protection of the Curragh, putting in place processes for the reporting of breaches of any of the by-laws, and working with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the local authority and the Defence Forces organisation there.</p>  <p>  I believe in the development of facilities in the Curragh Plains for the use of the public.  I pass through the Curragh going to Newbridge once a week or once every ten days and I can see how important the Curragh Plains are to the public.  I would love to have such a recreational area in my county of Wexford.</p>  <p>  I take on board the Deputy's concerns, which will be registered with the Defence Forces.  I will come back to the Deputy regarding jockeys riding out.</p></speech>

Mr. Alan Shatter met representatives of the group on 26 May 2011 and on 3 February 2012.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, met representatives of the group on 14 January, 2016.</p>  <p>  In late June 2016, I indicated to the group that I am open to meeting it.  The group responded indicating that prior to any meeting it was seeking responses to numerous questions which it had raised at its meeting with the former Minister for Defence, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, in January 2016.  The group was provided with the relevant response and it subsequently indicated that it was seeking a meeting date at some time after the D&aacute;il summer recess.  I have asked my officials to follow up to arrange a suitable date and time for a meeting. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware of ongoing litigation in respect of the use of Lariam in the Defence Forces, to which the Minister for Defence is the defendant.  The State Claims Agency, SCA, is managing these claims on behalf of my Department.  The SCA has advised that 51 claims have been made by current or former members of the Defence Forces who allege personal injury as a consequence of their consumption of Lariam.  Proceedings have been served in 38 of these cases.  The State Claims Agency advised that for various reasons seven individuals did not progress their cases which were discontinued and are now statute barred.  Due to this ongoing litigation I will be limited in terms of what can be discussed at any meeting with the group.  This has been indicated to the group by my officials.</p></speech>

Hopefully, he will be able to meet the group soon even with the restrictions of possible litigation.  It was interesting that the note we got on the grouping of questions listed the branch in question as "litigation branch".  I had not seen that previously.</p>  <p>  As the Minister of State said, representatives of the group, Action Lariam for Irish Soldiers, have met former Ministers.  However, things are moving very quickly internationally.  Since the group met the former Minister, Deputy Coveney, a former chief of staff of the British Army has indicated an apology to the members who served under him.  In addition the Canadian House of Commons is holding hearings on the effects of Lariam.  One of the four demands of the campaign is the immediate cessation of the issuing of Lariam and generic drugs to Irish soldiers serving in theatre at present.  Hopefully the Minister of State will be able to give greater consideration to that in the coming weeks.</p></speech>

They had a protest during the summer at which they wanted to give me some correspondence.  Unfortunately, it was on a Saturday and as I had other commitments, I was unable to meet them.  I understand there was a briefing here in the Houses of the Oireachtas regarding the Lariam group.  I sent a representative from my office to the meeting and he advised me of the issues raised on the day.</p>  <p>  Regarding Lariam, my first priority and that of the Department and the Defence Forces is the welfare and health of the men and women of the Defence Forces, who are serving in countries where malaria is prevalent.  As the Deputy understands, malaria is a very serious disease.</p><p>I have absolutely no issue in meeting the group but the Deputy will understand I will be limited in what I can add to the conversation.  I will listen to its concerns and it is only right and proper that, as Minister of State with responsibility for defence, I do so.  I and the Defence Forces rely on the medical evidence from the chief medical officer of the Defence Forces, and on his knowledge and expertise, to make the decisions.</p></speech>

I accept that Minister of State's number one priority is the welfare of the Irish soldiers who are in the theatre, as the leaflet puts it.  The Minister of State was in Mali recently.  Perhaps he will explain if the Irish soldiers who are operating in Mali currently are receiving Lariam.  He might also disclose if he had to take Lariam when he was travelling out there.</p></speech>

I had to take the medication for three to four days before I travelled to Mali, during my stay in Mali and for a further seven to ten days after my trip, along with other prescribed medications I was advised of - injections and other medication.  That is what I had to go through, based on the expert advice I received.  There is other expert advice given for the members who are serving out there currently.  I will rely on that expert advice.</p></speech>

The advancement of the women peace and security agenda in peacekeeping operations is an area in which Irish peacekeepers have taken a very proactive role.</p>  <p>  In preparing contingents for overseas operations, significant training is provided on gender to all Defence Forces personnel.  Moreover, a gender perspective is included in the planning and conduct of all overseas military operations, something that is particularly relevant in circumstances where gender based violence has occurred.</p>  <p>  In May 2015, during a visit to Ireland, the Secretary General of the United Nations, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, observed the value in some situations of being able to call on female peacekeepers having regard to the multifaceted nature of peacekeeping challenges.  He requested that consideration be given to the contribution of women soldiers to UN operations and that Ireland might factor this into its approach to such operations.  The recent White Paper on Defence highlights the importance of UN Security Council Resolution 1325 in setting out the vital role that women can play in conflict prevention, conflict resolution, peace building, post-conflict reconstruction, reform and governance.</p>  <p>  The White Paper also contains commitments to significantly increase participation of women in the Defence Forces.  A number of projects have been identified to give effect to these commitments and work has recently commenced in my Department to this end.</p>  <p>  At the recent UN Peacekeeping Ministerial held in London, which I attended, one of the main issues discussed was improving peacekeeping, including increasing the involvement of women at all levels in overseas missions.  I contributed to the session on the participation of women in peace and security, outlining actions currently undertaken by Ireland in that area and confirming our commitment to increase the participation of women at senior decision-making and leadership levels in the Irish Defence Forces.</p>  <p>  I am delighted to say that Ireland recently appointed the first female officer to the prestigious position of officer commanding a Defence Forces contingent on an overseas mission with the appointment of Lieutenant Colonel Mary Carroll to the position in UNDOF, where she is currently undertaking.</p></speech>

On the election of Donald Trump last night I share with many millions of people across the world an anxiety about what is around the corner.  Hopefully, this anxiety is unfounded and there is no escalation in international conflict.  The UN Resolution 1325 recognises the disproportionate impact of war on women and their vital role in building peace.  For the first time, gender was made a matter of international peace and security.  That was 16 years ago.  I welcome the action plans introduced by the last Government.  We now need to know what impact these action plans have had on our peacekeeping operations.</p></speech>

There are currently 496 personnel serving overseas.  There are 20 women overseas on UN peacekeeping duties and five females are deployed on humanitarian operations by the Naval Service in the Mediterranean on Operation Pontus.  This amounts to 5.04% of the overseas personnel.  The Irish unit commander to UNDOF, in charge of the 54th infantry group is female, Lieutenant Colonel Mary Carroll.  This is the first time a female has commanded a mixed operational infantry unit on a United Nations' peacekeeping mission.</p>  <p>  In Donegal a couple of weeks ago I reviewed the personnel of the 109th infantry battalion travelling to Lebanon for service with United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, UNIFIL, in which there was a total of 21 female personnel travelling out as part of the Irish unit.  It is great for the Permanent Defence Forces that we are able to attract women into the organisation.  I really believe that women add a different dimension to the leadership and peacekeeping participation.</p></speech>

I am not sure if it is there yet but I am positive about what the Minister of State has said.  With our proud and honourable peacekeeping record, Ireland should be leading the charge in implementing UN Resolution 1325 and we should be the exemplar in gender-led peacekeeping.</p></speech>

It is a great initiative but the Defence Forces are currently working on a number of other initiatives to raise the awareness among Irish society that all roles and operational appointments are open to women.  To this end, the Defence Forces have employed civilian experts to assist with marketing campaigns and gender-specific messaging.  The Defence Forces have developed a number of family friendly initiatives for the good of the organisation that have been taken up by a large number of female personnel.  There is no doubt that women bring a different dimension to peacekeeping operations while abroad, compared to some of their male counterparts.  When one witnesses at first-hand the participation of women in peacekeeping duties when they go in to the villages and towns, and the way they are able to interact with the locals and with the male and female leaders of communities, we see that these personnel really play a very important role.  We are taking this issue very seriously indeed.</p></speech>

Until now, it has been a peaceful participant in research and development.  The proposal is to move towards funding research and development in, and creating, innovative defence technology.  The question is whether the Minister of State has indicated to his fellow defence Ministers that Ireland will not partake in such initiatives and that it is contrary to the aims of the European Union.</p></reply>

This can also enhance its strategic autonomy and its ability to act with partners".</p>  <p>  An effective EU defence technology industrial base is considered necessary to ensure member states will have assured access to supplies of defence material and services.  The European defence industry can enhance the European Union's strategic autonomy and its ability to act with partners in support of international peace and security.  In addition, for many member states, the defence sector is a significant contributor to jobs, growth and innovation and has a strong economic leverage effect.  In this context, the European Council endorsed the Commission's proposal for a preparatory action on CSDP-related research, which is seen as a test mechanism for a proposed defence related research programme.</p>  <p>  The objectives of the preparatory action are to stimulate investment in defence research and technology throughout Europe and generate the collaborative research and technology that will be required to support future capabilities.  This preparatory action may ultimately pave the way for a European defence research programme post-Horizon 2020.  Horizon 2020 is the framework programme in the European Union for funding industrial and sectoral research and development.  The programme is funded from the EU budget.  The Commission has proposed a budget of &euro;25 million in 2017 to fund the defence preparatory action and the European Parliament, on 26 October, approved this funding.</p>  <p>  I understand the individual to whom the Deputy has referred, who represents the European Network Against Arms Trade, has voiced concerns about the approved funding for the preparatory action, including the belief the European Union is subsidising the arms industry.  The preparatory action on CSDP-related research should be welcomed.  As the Deputy is aware, Ireland does not have a defence industry.  However, it does need to equip its Defence Forces with modern and advanced equipment for force protection on crisis management and peacekeeping operations.  In this regard, I should point out that one of the key issues raised by Members of this House when the Government decides to deploy Defence Forces' contingents on missions is the extent to which they are appropriately equipped with the most effective defensive equipment.  For the European Union to sustain and maintain a defence industrial capacity to deliver essential capabilities for operations, it needs to invest and develop in technologies for the future.  The funding provided by the preparatory action will go some way to securing this.</p></speech>

He has said that, with the architect, he supports &euro;100 million being spent on research and development in the coming year or two.  It is planned to spend up to &euro;3.5 billion on research and the development of military equipment.  The architect of this initiative is a special adviser to Commissioner Juncker.  He was the person who came up with the idea in 2013.  Will the Minister of State agree that Ireland will desist from encouraging any such multibillion euro expenditure package for military research and innovation and that instead the money, in line wih the European Union was supposed to do, should be spent to enhance poverty eradication?</p></speech>

The European Defence Agency was established to support member states and the Council in their efforts to improve European defence capabilities in crisis management and sustain the CSDP as it stood and was developed.  Ireland has been a strong supporter of the role of the European Union in international crisis management through the CSDP and there is a clear need to ensure that collectively it has the capability to undertake crisis management operations and that member states can commit to support operations mandated by the Council.  To this end, it is important that there be the industrial capacity in the European Union to ensure the requisite capabilities.  In many instances, we rely on European suppliers to provide the Defence Forces with the defence equiipment necessary to undertake the roles assigned to them by the Government.  When Defence Forces personnel travel overseas, we must have the best equipment available to protect our personnel.  It is important, therefore, that we partake in such initiatives.</p></speech>

That it is now lining up to spend &euro;3.5 billion on military research and development is a disgrace.  The character at the time was Commissioner Michel Barnier, a French Commissioner who had replaced Charlie McCreevy.  He has continued in the role of trying to promote the diversion of money away from poverty eradication and social services and building the European Union towards creating an arms industry which would benefit NATO.  What was said about this originally was that it must be autonomous, while showing solidarity, in particular, with the Atlantic alliance.  It is jumping to the tune of NATO and probably falls into line with what the new US President would have the European Union do.</p></speech>

However, a budget in the region of &euro;2 billion to &euro;3 billion for the period from 2021 to 2027, inclusive, has been mentioned in a number of Commission fora.  This, however, has not been agreed to by any member state.  As with the Horizon 2020 programme, it is envisaged that the defence forces research programme will be funded from member states' contributions.  On 28 October the European Defence Agency signed grant agreements worth a total of &euro;1.4 million on selected research projects to be carried out as part of the pilot project.

What is the response of the Minister of State to many members of the Defence Forces who state they did not have a face to face consultation to assess their ability to take Lariam?  In this sense, what they are stating is the State did not protect their interests and failed in its duty of care to them.</p></reply>

As I have previously outlined, the State Claims Agency is managing these claims on behalf of the Department.  The Deputy will appreciate that I cannot discuss allegations about the screening or prescribing of Lariam, where matters are the subject of ongoing litigation.</p><p>However, the military authorities have assured me that significant precautions are taken by Defence Forces medical officers in assessing the medical suitability of members of our Defence Forces to take any anti-malarial medications.  It is the policy of the Defence Forces that personnel are individually screened for medical fitness for overseas service and medical suitability to be prescribed the necessary malaria chemoprophylactic agent.<br/><br/>Malaria is a serious disease which killed approximately 438,000 people in 2015, with 90% of deaths occurring in sub-Saharan Africa, as reported by the World Health Organisation.  There are three anti-malarial drugs in use in the Defence Forces, namely, Lariam, Malarone and Doxycycline.  The United Nations recent medical support manual 2015, which is intended to serve as a standard reference document on medical support aspects of United Nations peacekeeping operations and political missions in the field, provides that anti-malarial medicines can be used to prevent malaria.  It does not make any recommendations as to which malaria chemoprophylaxis should be used but rather references the WHO international travel and health handbook for the latest information on malaria chemoprophylaxis.<br/><br/>The WHO handbook provides for a range of anti-malarials which includes Lariam, Malarone and Doxycycline.  The WHO handbook notes that there are specific contraindications and possible side effects for all anti-malarial drugs.  I am advised that Defence Forces medical policy on the use of malaria chemoprophylaxis, including the use of Lariam, is in line with these United Nations and World Health Organisation guidelines.<br/><br/><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i><br/><br/>Where malaria has been identified as a risk in a particular mission area, the choice of chemoprophylaxis medication is dependent on a number of factors, including the type of malaria in the destination, resistance to particular drugs, the profile of the traveller in terms of contra-indications, underlying health conditions, purpose of travel, etc., the duration of travel, the mission operational profile and adherence issues.<br/><br/>Mefloquine, or Lariam, is one of the drugs listed for use by the WHO in its international travel and health handbook.  Of the options available, Defence Forces medical policy has identified Lariam as the drug which in most circumstances, having regard to the nature and duration of operational deployments, minimises the risk to Irish personnel of contracting malaria in sub-Saharan Africa.  As I have previously indicated, there are specific contra-indications to its use and personnel must be individually screened for suitability.<br/><br/>Defence Forces medical policy also provides for Malarone and Doxycycline to be used in sub-Saharan Africa, in specific circumstances.  The potential usage of these alternative options is carefully considered having regard to the individual in question, the specific circumstances of the mission, the operational imperative for deployment of the individual, constraints associated with the drug and the overall risk profile.  The risk to benefit ratio is a determining factor in recommendations from the director of medical branch permitting use of these medications.<br/><br/>The choice of medication for overseas deployments, for both officers and enlisted personnel, is a medical decision made by medical officers in the Defence Forces, having regard to the specific circumstances of the mission and the individual members of the Defence Forces.  The use of, and the information on, medications is kept under ongoing review by medical professionals within the Defence Forces.<br/><br/>I assure the Deputy that the health and welfare of the men and women of the Defence Forces remain a high priority for myself and the Defence Forces.</p></speech>

He is missing the point that sworn public testimony has been given, by one member of the Defence Forces after another, in which they categorically state that the guidelines issued with regard to the prescription of this type of medication were not followed.  Defence Forces personnel did not receive face-to-face consultation and in many instances medical records, which were available to the Defence Forces and gave information of mental health issues, were not taken into account before the soldiers were prescribed Lariam.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State repeated, verbatim, the standard line we got from his predecessor, Deputy Coveney, that everything was grand and there had been an assessment but what steps he has taken to verify that what he says is the case as against the sworn testimonies of others which state the complete opposite? </p></speech>

The military authorities have assured me that significant precautions are taken by Defence Forces medical officers in assessing the medical suitability of members of the Defence Forces to take any anti-malaria medication.  I understand that to be face-to-face consultation.</p>  <p>  The first priority is the health and welfare of the men and women of the Defence Forces who are serving abroad.  The death rate figures for malaria are startling - some 438,000 in 2015 alone in sub-Saharan Africa.  That is not a risk I want to take.  I depend on the advice given to me by the chief medical officer of the Irish Defence Forces. </p></speech>

I pose these questions against the background of Ireland remaining an exception in continuing to use Lariam.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State should realise that the health effects suffered by the loyal members of our Defence Forces are real.  They include acute depression, suicidal thoughts and many cases of suspected suicide and severe mental health problems as a result of taking this medication.  Is the individualised medical risk assessment a policy paper?  Does the Department actually have any evidence that it is taking place?   Are records kept on file of the risk assessments?  How does the Minister of State square what he says with the fact that people can give evidence that their prior medical history, which was known to the Defence Forces, was not accessed with a view to protecting them from Lariam when it clearly should have been? </p></speech>

I ask the Minister of State to take it so seriously that he goes beyond the medical advice from the institution in question.</p></speech>

Each individual is screened before they go to sub-Saharan Africa to ensure Lariam is suitable for them.  If they do suffer side effects steps are taken.  If they are abroad the medication can be changed and they are screened on an ongoing basis.</p></speech>

Among its recommendations was that a climate survey be conducted within 12 months and subsequently at reasonable intervals.  A similar survey was conducted in 2008.  The aim of the survey, which was conducted by the University of Limerick, UL, was to identify trends to inform best practice in human resources management and training and education within the Defence Forces.  As with the 2008 survey, approximately 11% of the workforce, 1055 personnel, was sampled.</p>  <p>  The key findings of the survey are grouped under topics such as work- life balance, peer support, organisational justice within the organisation, procedural justice, organisational fairness, Defence Forces integrity and supervisory Justice.  The University of Limerick researchers who undertook the project point out that the findings of the report and the recommendations are interconnected and caution should apply to reading any one particular finding in isolation.</p>  <p>  I have reviewed the report in detail.  I have also received a briefing on the findings from the University of Limerick.  The survey findings clearly point to challenges for the Defence Forces, particularly in the areas of leadership, communication, organisational culture, the working environment and active management of personnel expectations.  However, many positives also emanated from the survey, especially in regard to the commitment of personnel to the values and mission of the organisation, high levels of work satisfaction, pride in the organisation and positive views on culture and work support.</p><p>The response to the issues raised in the report of the climate survey is being led by the Chief of Staff by way of an action plan which involves the engagement of all levels of management within the organisation.  RACO and PDFORRA were recently briefed by the University of Limerick researchers on the findings and conclusions of the report.  Following on from that briefing, I met recently with the representative associations to hear their views and concerns in regard to the report.  It was agreed at that meeting that the representative associations would be fully engaged in the response to the report through the IMG framework, where they could put forward their views on appropriate responses.  It was also agreed that there would be a further meeting with the University of Limerick and the IMG to consider the findings and to tease out the quantitative data in the report.  The associations will also attend planned focus groups to be facilitated by the University of Limerick to further explore the issues raised in the climate survey report.</p></reply>

The study was commissioned to identify trends to inform practice in HR and-or training and education.  I note the Minister of State's response in terms of some of the actions already taken.  However, the findings would suggest that the individual's perception and experience of the work will be dependent on a number of factors, including his or her rank within the Defence Forces, gender, tenure and the service in which he or she works and so on.  What I am seeking from the Minister of State on behalf of the Defence Forces is an assurance that this report will not be left sitting on a shelf but will inform an agenda for change and that in respect of that change an implementation plan, inclusive of targets and timelines, will be put in place and a commitment from the Minister of State and senior personnel to delivery of that plan, including progress reports in terms of its implementation, will be given.</p></speech>

I have met both representative organisations.  I have also met Defence Forces staff, including the Chief of Staff, on this matter.  I have asked the Chief of Staff to develop an action plan in response to the findings of the survey, with consideration to be given to how best we might gain a more detailed insight into the underlying issues which have given rise to the positive and negative perceptions mentioned in the report so as to inform the way forward.  I have agreed to full engagement of the representative associations in the process and to their having an input into the review and proposed action plan through the framework of the IMG.  While the response to the issues raised by the survey report will be led from the top by the Chief of Staff, management at all levels within the organisation will be required to engage with and communicate effectively, knowledgeably and frankly with the personnel with whom they work.</p>  <p>  In terms of my engagement with the Defence Forces, I talk to the people on the ground, the soldiers, who are the heart of the organisation.  It is courageous and forward-looking of the Defence Forces to take on such an initiative.  I would encourage other organisations to engage in a similar exercise.  It is important that as Minister of State with responsibility in this area I and the Secretary General of my Department and the Chief of Staff know the thoughts and concerns of all members of the Defence Forces.</p></speech>

I would expect most of those to have taken place in Shannon Airport, it being almost <i>de facto</i>a US military air base at this stage.

Since 5 February 2003, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has requested ATCP support from the Defence Forces at Shannon Airport, as required.  The number of duties incurred in the provision of ATCP support at Irish Airports to date in 2016 in respect of US military planes is 350.</p></speech>

I note the Minister of State stated in a reply earlier this year that the amount of money expended on this area was over &euro;135,000.  In essence, what we are talking about is Ireland giving over time, space and hundreds of thousands of euros, that could be better spent elsewhere, to activities that are in reality a flagrant breach of our neutrality so that the US military can be facilitated in terms of its activities abroad.  I would like the Minister of State to deal with the issue of Yemen in particular.  There is a strong suspicion that Ireland may have played a role in one of the most horrific civilian massacres in Saudi Arabia's campaign in Yemen in that it facilitated the use of Shannon Airport for the transportation of weaponry to Saudi Arabia which ended up being used to kill civilians in Yemen.  Will the Minister of State comment on the spike in aircraft activity around the NATO exercises in Poland earlier this year and on use of Shannon Airport in that regard and whether it is not glaringly obvious that our neutrality is being undermined by these activities.</p></speech>

However, the Deputy will be aware that successive Governments have made over-flight and landing facilities at Shannon Airport available to the United States for well over 50 years.  These arrangements are in line with our traditional policy and military neutrality.

While President Obama may be more handsome and accommodating than president-elect Trump it is nonetheless the case that under President Obama, $115 billion worth of weaponry was sold to the Saudis.  We know that aircraft refuelled mid-air at Shannon were <i>en route</i>to Saudi Arabia.  Shannon Airport in that sense had a role to play in the destruction of Yemen.  The Minister of State did not in the context of his reference to our traditional neutrality mention that our traditional neutrality involved garrison troops in Cold War Germany who were not on their way to active combat or their holidays.  This is not a two or three times a day occurrence through our airports.  I would welcome a comment from the Minister of State on the spike in landings.</p><p>It went from about 19 in June to approximately 32 per month earlier in the year and around the time of the NATO exercises in Poland.

The establishment which will be led by the USA, Germany, the United Kingdom and Canada will comprise four multinational battalions of 1,000 troops each.  Ireland's co-operation with NATO is conducted through Partnership for Peace.  The primary aim of our PfP membership is to enhance the Defence Forces' interoperability with other professional military forces for the purpose of engaging in UN-authorised peacekeeping and peace support operations led by the United Nations, the European Union or NATO.  Participation in Partnership for Peace is fundamental to Ireland being able to meet its obligation to provide professional peacekeepers for international crisis management and peacekeeping operations mandated by the United Nations.  The deployment of the Russian deterrent force is related to NATO's mutual defence capacity.  As a matter of policy, Ireland does not participate in mutual defence arrangements and, as such, will not be participating in the Russian deterrent force.</p></speech>

At the NATO Warsaw summit in July this year the establishment of an enhanced forward military presence in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland was announced.

The establishment of multinational battalions of 1,000 troops each will be led by the USA, Germany, the United Kingdom and Canada.  On 26 October these four allies set out their plans for the battalions they will lead.  Other allies, including Denmark, France and Italy, have also indicated that they will send troops.

It was not meant to provoke a war.  While it did not provoke a war, it provoked a stand-off which lasted for years.  Is the Minister of State concerned that the deterrent force will be on EU soil?  If there was to be a clash, Poland could trigger the Lisbon treaty's mutual defence clause as France has done on foot of the attacks on its soil in recent times by ISIS and those intent on dismantling Europe.

The purpose of the scheme is to provide a means for the determination of claims and proposals from the associations relating to remuneration and conditions of service.  The representative associations have been to the fore in advancing the interests of their members in this regard, bringing them into line generally with the pay and conditions available in other public service employments.  The conciliation and arbitration scheme includes access to independent adjudication.  In addition, there is a framework which facilitates the associations' engagement with the official side in talks parallel to those taking place between the ICTU and the official side at national level.  This parallel process was successfully operated in respect of last year's rounds of discussions facilitated by the Labour Relations Commission on an extension to the public service agreement, 2013 to 2016, which led to the Lansdowne Road agreement.</p>  <p>  I have recently received representations from PDFORRA seeking to have access to the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court made available to them in the event of future legislative changes to provide An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with access to same.  I am advised that the proposals in relation to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na being granted such access will require detailed legislative changes.  I remain satisfied with the arrangements in place for the Defence Forces and have no immediate plans to make changes.  However, in the light of PDFORRA's representations, the matter will be kept under review, including in the context of the arrangements to be made for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></speech>

Accordingly, the representative associations PDFORRA and RACO<b></b>cannot be affiliated to ICTU.  The basis of the prohibition is that it would be inappropriate to apply the provisions of the Industrial Relations Act 1992 to members of the Defence Forces.  The taking of any form of industrial action would be irreconcilable within the military service.  This is a long-standing policy position that has been taken by respective Governments since the foundation of the State.

Claims have been made by Army rangers and Defence Forces chiefs that have been upheld in the courts, but have not yet been honoured by the Department of Defence.  The armed forces suffered the same impositions as the rest of the public service, including pension levies, pay cuts and pay inequality.  Their conditions compare unfavourably to those of the Garda, but they have even fewer rights when it comes to giving any kind of expression to the savaging of their living standards.  </p>  <p>  My office was astonished to be told that members of the armed forces are even prohibited from discussing issues relating to their working conditions with the Deputies.  Why is that?  I want to say to any soldier, sailor or member of the Air Corps that he or she can talk to my office in confidence.  </p>  <p>  In its submission to the public service pay commission in late August, the AAA specifically called for civil and trade union rights for the armed forces.

I do not meet those from management level alone, rather I meet those from all levels of the organisation.  I encourage members of the organisation and the Irish Defence Forces, if they have issues of any kind that they want to discuss with me, to do so.  I met PDFORRA and RACO on numerous occasions.  A number of issues the Deputy has raised with me were not raised with me directly since I was appointed Minister of State.

It took place around a flurry of NATO-related activity.  A statement was issued following the meeting, which referred to accelerated practical co-operation between the EU and NATO.

The Secretary General of the Department of Defence represented me at the meeting.  The meeting included a working session which focused on EU-NATO co-operation and, in particular, on the ongoing work to present concrete options for implementation of the joint EU-NATO declaration signed in July 2016.  The Secretary General of NATO, Mr. Jens Stoltenberg, attended this session. </p>  <p>  The declaration highlights seven key areas where the EU and NATO can further strengthen co-operation.  They include countering hybrid threats; broadening co-operation on maritime security and migration; expanding co-operation on cyber defence; developing coherent, complementary and interoperable defence capabilities; facilitating a stronger defence industry and defence research; stepping up co-ordination on exercises; and supporting countries in building their defence and security capabilities.   They represent practical areas of co-operation in support of international peace and security, international crisis management operations and the protection of civilians.  Progress on developing a set of proposals in these key areas, which will be agreed by the EU and NATO Councils, was discussed during this session.  The HRVP, Ms. Federica Mogherini, and the Secretary General of NATO will report to the respective Councils in December on options to implement the EU-NATO declaration for their consideration. </p>  <p>  Importantly for Ireland, the EU-NATO declaration confirms that future co-operation will fully respect the decision-making autonomy of both organisations and will not prejudice the specific character of the security and defence policy of any member state.  As this is already embodied in the declaration, there was no requirement at the recent informal ministerial meeting for the Secretary General in the Department of Defence to raise the issue of Ireland&rsquo;s neutrality not being compromised by EU-NATO co-operation.  Officials in my Department will continue to monitor closely proposals that emerge under the key areas I mentioned.</p></speech>

It seems to be the case that whatever NATO wants it gets.  It is a little bit Irish, in terms of what other people would understand the definition of neutrality to be.  Is the Minister of State concerned, for example, about the fact that a NATO warship docked to refuel in Cork harbour at the weekend?  It was manned by Dutch soldiers who were armed with high velocity rifles.  Is it acceptable practice for NATO warships to be refuelled in Ireland while engaged in operational work?  Is this what we talk about when we refer to enhanced practical co-operation?</p>  <p>  My problem is that the Government never seems to refuse any type of military activity.  It seems to be the case that NATO is gearing up its aggression against Russia, for example.  Do we want some form of conflict?  Will Ireland be going along with the EU's new global security strategy?  Does the Minister of State agree with the statement on the strategy that soft power is no longer enough?  Is this the direction in which we are going?  Are we sleepwalking, despite our protestations, into a situation of becoming a minor power in the evolution of NATO across the EU?</p></speech>

I can assure her that there are no such plans.  Ireland's co-operation with NATO will continue to be conducted through the Partnership for Peace process.  There has been no change in the policy on Ireland's engagement with NATO or deploying troops to NATO-led missions which require that the mission be UN mandated and have the approval of the D&aacute;il and Government.</p><p>The Government's 2015 review of foreign policy and the White Paper on Defence confirm that Ireland will continue to maintain a policy of military neutrality that is characterised by non-membership of military alliances and non-participation in common or mutual defence arrangements.</p> <p> The only relationship we have with NATO is through Partnership for Peace, which was launched in January 1994 as a means of outreach to new democracies in central and eastern Europe and as a way to promote stability and strengthen relationships through the promotion of practical co-operation.  Since Ireland joined Partnership for Peace, it has been joined by both states that wish to become NATO members and states that do not.  Partnership for Peace includes the neutral or non-aligned states of Finland, Sweden, Austria and Switzerland.  Ireland became a member of Partnership for Peace and of its political counterpart, the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council, in December 1999.</p></speech>

To date, the reality is that our neutrality has not stood in the way of Ireland's participation in the ever increasing militarisation of Europe.  The Minister of State did not comment on the fact that a NATO warship with Dutch military personnel onboard was openly engaged in activity and refuelling in Cork harbour last weekend.  It is an Irish solution to an Irish problem to say that we are neutral yet, at the same time, we do not stand in the way of the massive number of military aircraft that pass through our so-called civilian airports on the way to perhaps refuel aircraft in Saudi Arabia, to decimate people in Yemen or destabilise the Middle East.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State states that we are neutral but the reality is that everything we have done has been done to facilitate NATO.  Will we be going along with the EU's new global security strategy?  What does it mean for us?  We do have a strategic link with these countries.</p></speech>

I put it to the Minister for Social Protection that there is ongoing discrimination against those who have taken time out of their careers to care for children, elderly family members, etc.  The practical reality of it is that women are impacted.  Since I was elected, women have been calling to my office to tell me of their shock on realising that the payment they will receive from the State on turning 66 years of age will be considerably lower than they had planned.  There are many injustices in life and many of the stories I have heard are significant.  One lady, on her 66th birthday, realised she would receive &euro;152 rather than &euro;233 a week, a significant shortfall of approximately &euro;80 a week.</p>  <p>  What is the country saying to those who selflessly put their careers on hold in order to stay at home to care for their children or elderly parents?  They are providing vital social services and doing the State a huge service.  In many cases, they are caring for those vulnerable members of society who may otherwise have ended up in care and costing the State considerably more than &euro;80 a week.  I recently spoke to another lady who is losing &euro;30 a week because she worked for two weeks before she became a stay-at-home mother and then subsequently returned to work.  She is facing her retirement years on her own and is being penalised financially for caring for her family.  If she had not worked for those two weeks prior to raising her family, she would now be financially better off.</p>  <p>  Another lady started working in 1966.  There were years when she had more than 80 contributions, but only 52 of them are counted.  She took time out to raise her children, but her average contributions were calculated over the period 1966 to 2015.  As a result, she has an average of 25 contributions per year.  She receives &euro;196 instead of &euro;230.  To add insult to injury, when the pension increased by &euro;3 she received &euro;2.60.  She will be insulted again in springtime when she does not receive the full &euro;5 increase.</p>  <p>  So far, it has generally been women that have been affected by this anomaly.  How can we move forward in encouraging an equal place for women in the workforce when such open discrimination takes place?  This type of inequality cancels out family-friendly policies that may be in place.  The Minister for Social Protection must reform the manner in which these pensions are calculated.  We must value the contributions these women have made to society and ensure they are not penalised and confined to poverty on retirement.  There are many more of these cases.  I hear of them on a weekly basis.  The Minister must reform the manner in which the contributions are calculated.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-11-09a.281" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="15:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016110900029#BB00700"><p>Expenditure on pensions, at approximately &euro;7 billion, is the largest block of expenditure in my Department.  It represents some 35% of all expenditure.  Demographic change alone increases this by about &euro;200 million each year.  Maintaining the value of the State pension is critical to providing a basic income for pensioners and protecting older people from poverty.  For this reason, the Government is committed to increasing the State pension at a rate greater than the rate of inflation every year.</p>  <p>  The State pensions system comprises a number of schemes based on criteria such as contributions paid, income need and other factors.  These ensure that people have an adequate standard of living in old age.  The non-contributory State pension is means-tested and funded from general taxation.  PRSI contributions are not taken into account in calculating the value on this pension.  It is based solely on means.</p>  <p>  The contributory State pension is another scheme.  It is assumed the Deputy is referring to this pension.  It is funded through the Social Insurance Fund.  Contributions go in from PRSI paid on income and funds go out in the form of benefits such as maternity benefit, paternity benefit, illness benefit and, of course, the State pension.  Income must match or exceed outgoings for it to be sustainable.  Therefore, recognising credits or other non-monetary contributions is problematic as people want their pension and benefits paid in cash and not credits or recognition.  The rate of payment is related to contributions made over the years into the Social Insurance Fund.  As such, those who have paid more into the fund are more likely to receive more out of the fund under the scheme.  This is known as the contributory principle.  What is paid out is linked to what is paid in.</p>  <p>  The actuarial review of the fund in 2012 confirmed that the fund on balance and taking everything into account provides better value to female rather than male contributors due to the redistributive nature of the fund.  Put simply, women tend to pay less into the fund but tend to live longer and thus are able to claim more</p>  <p>  Entitlement to the contributory pension is calculated by means of a yearly average calculation, where the total contributions paid or credited are divided by the number of years of the working life.  Payment rates are banded.  For example, someone with a yearly average of 48 contributions will qualify for a full pension, whereas someone with a yearly average of 20 may qualify at the 85% rate.</p>  <p>  The State recognises those with caring roles to qualify for a contributory State pension.  The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme makes qualification for the contributory State pension easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme was introduced in 1994 and allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age or incapacitated people to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes.</p><p>Given the valuable nature of the State pension, contributory, those who qualify under the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme still need to fulfil the eligibility requirements for the scheme and have at least 220 paid contributions over the course of their working lives.  This means they must work for approximately ten years during the course of their life, full time or part time.</p> <p> Where someone does not qualify for a full rate contributory pension, he or she may qualify for a means tested non-contributory pension, amounting to 95% of the maximum contributory rate.  Alternatively, if the person's spouse is a State pensioner, the most beneficial payment available to him or her may be an increase for a qualified adult, which amounts to up to 90% of a full contributory pension. </p> <p> Work is under way to replace the yearly average system with a total contributions approach.  Under the latter, the rate of pension paid will more closely reflect the total number of contributions made, rather than when they were paid.  The position of homemakers is being carefully considered in developing the scheme.  While it is expected that this approach to pension qualification will replace the current scheme from around 2020, this is a significant reform and considerable legal, administrative, and technical components will need to be put in place prior to its implementation.  As with any change in rules, there will be winners as well as losers.</p></speech>

The Minister's statement that those who pay more into the pension fund are more likely to receive pay-outs under the scheme is not necessarily correct.  Under the averaging system for pensions, specifically the measure introduced by the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Joan Burton, a person who enters the social insurance system just before his or her 56th birthday and pays stamps for ten years will be entitled to a full pension, whereas many of those who pay stamp contributions amounting to 20 years, albeit over a longer period, will be entitled to less than a full pension.  It is patently unfair that a higher pension will be available to a person who has made fewer contributions than others.</p>  <p>  Women who have spent a large portion of their lives providing a socially vital service are being doubly penalised.  Not only do they not have recourse to a private pension entitlement for the period in question, but they are also being denied a full State pension.  The homemaker's scheme introduced by the Fianna F&aacute;il Party in 1994 must be reviewed and a feasibility study done on extending eligibility to years spent caring for children before 1994.  The Government must also consider the possibility of amending the calculation method used in respect of the contributory pension.  Consideration should be given to disregarding past payments, thereby altering the date on which an individual is considered to have entered the workforce.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-11-09a.284" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="15:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016110900030#CC00300"><p>There are two aspects to this issue.  The rules we apply to working out a person's contributory pension entitlement are gender blind.  As such, it does not matter whether an applicant is a man or woman because the same rules apply to both genders.  While it is less common, men also have caring roles.</p>  <p>  The Deputy is correct that there are gender gaps.  However, as the independent actuarial analysis shows, when one takes everything into account the gender gaps tend to benefit women more than men because the former tend to live longer and are paid more from the pension fund as a result.  Moreover, they generally pay less into the fund because they tend to work fewer years, often at lower pay rates.  Some people want gender gaps to be closed when it would benefit one gender to do so, while conveniently overlooking such gaps when they benefit a different gender.  I am not accusing the Deputy of adopting this position but it is the case that others are conveniently gender blind, depending on which gender is affected by an issue.</p>  <p>  The only way to completely eliminate gender gaps would be to have different rules for men and women and I would not like to take such an approach.  In fairness to the Deputy, she has not proposed such an approach.  I acknowledge, however, that the pensions system needs to be reformed because it is based on working patterns that no longer exist in the modern economy.  We are trying to replace the averaging system with a new system known as the total contributory approach, under which the main criterium will be the number of contributions a person makes, rather than when he or she makes them.</p>  <p>  The Deputy is correct that it is unfair that a person can work for the final ten years before retirement age and receive a full pension, while a person who works for 15 or 20 years over a 40-year period may not receive a full pension.  The difficulty is that any change will create losers and winners.  It is in the nature of these things that one only hears about the losers when they discover they have lost out.  Before introducing a reform, I want to have a detailed analysis done of all the individual cases in order that we can have a profile of who will be the winners and losers in the event of a change.</p></speech>

The Minister for Health will be aware of the serious difficulties that have faced patients and staff at University Hospital Galway, UHG, in recent years.  I will not go over all the challenges again, save to say that it is among the worst performing hospitals in terms of accident and emergency waiting times and inpatient and outpatient waiting lists.  This week, UHG enters its seventh week of code black due to overcrowding and doctors and nursing staff at the hospital stated today that overcrowding is endangering the lives of people in the region.</p>  <p>  In response to a parliamentary question I tabled recently, the Health Service Executive informed me that since 2006, capital expenditure at the Galway University Hospitals Group has exceeded &euro;109 million.  I do not expect the Minister of State will know how many additional beds this investment provided but the HSE informs me that the number of beds available in the two hospitals in the group, namely, UHG and Merlin Park Hospital, has decreased by 157 since this investment was made.  The capacity of both hospitals declined from 812 beds in January 2006 to 655 beds as of October this year.  In the meantime, the population has increased substantially, from 4.2 million in 2006 to 4.7 million this year.  The ageing population has also increased significantly.  Furthermore, UHG has been designated a centre of excellence for major specialties such as oncology and cardiology in the meantime.  This means the hospital is supposed to provide expert care in serious cases for approximately 800,000 people living in an area extending from County Donegal to County Clare and eastwards as far as Athlone.  </p>  <p>  Additional beds are required.  The new 75-bed block nearing completion will provide few new beds as other wards will need to close to facilitate access to the new block.  In addition, every time a new extension is built at University Hospital Galway, car parking space is removed.  The psychiatric unit under construction is being built on the staff car park.  There are unapproved plans for a badly needed accident and emergency unit which will, in all probability, eat further into the space available for car parking.  It is a simple fact that UHG is in the wrong place and finds itself unable to cope.  It is astonishing that there are only 73 inpatient beds in Merlin Park Hospital.  I understand most of these beds are occupied by long-stay geriatric patients.  Merlin Park Hospital is located in a vast complex encompassing approximately 150 acres of State owned land.  At this critical point, is it not clear that we need a new hospital on this vastly under-utilised site?</p></speech>

A number of ongoing initiatives are under way aimed at increasing capacity in University Hospital Galway.  Under last year&rsquo;s winter beds initiative, 30 new beds opened at the hospital in early 2016.  As Deputy Naughten pointed out, a 75-bed ward block is nearing completion on site and is due to open during 2017.  This ward block will provide new inpatient accommodation at the hospital.  In addition, I am advised by the HSE that consideration is being given to retaining one of the existing wards as escalation capacity.  An acute adult mental health unit under construction at the hospital is expected to be operational by 2017. </p>  <p>  The programme for a partnership Government contains a commitment to progress the ongoing design and planning phase for a new emergency department for University Hospital Galway.  I confirm that a business case for this project has been submitted to the HSE and is being considered by its estates division.  University Hospital Galway is fully engaged with the national patient flow improvement project as one of the pilot sites for this programme of work.  The HSE advises that the hospital has been working at all levels to improve patient flow and experience and has recently recruited an emergency department assistant director of nursing for patient flow as part of the emergency department escalation task force actions.</p><p>I am also advised staffing has been increased in the emergency department where a total of 54 full-time nursing positions are in place, including newly appointed clinical nurse managers.  Several vacancies are still being filled.</p> <p> Staffing is being increased across the health service as a whole.  The number of consultants employed has increased by over 100 while the number of nurses, including student nurses, rose by over 680 from the end of September last year to the end of September 2016.</p> <p> The winter initiative from 2016 to 2017, published in September, has provided &euro;40 million in additional funding for the winter preparedness initiative.  The key deliverables of this initiative are directed towards reducing overcrowding pressures in all hospitals in the winter months.  The winter initiative is driving a range of measures to support timely discharge of patients from all hospitals, including the provision of additional aids and appliances, as well as increased access to transitional care beds, home care and home help packages.  This facilitates patients who need extra supports in being discharged back to their homes and communities.  </p> <p> The winter initiative includes several measures which specifically benefit the western region.  University Hospital Galway is a focus site for the 2016-17 winter initiative and has, therefore, been scheduled to receive six extra home care packages per week for the duration of the initiative.  Winter initiative measures also include the imminent expansion of a community intervention team in the Galway and Roscommon areas.</p></speech>

I accept that significant advancements have been made in the quality of care provided at University Hospital Galway since 2006.  However, the Minister of State will accept that the crisis facing the hospital is one of capacity, not quality.  There can be little criticism of the standard of care provided for patients in Galway once they are admitted.  We are extremely fortunate to have an outstanding team of clinicians and nurses at the hospital who are doing an exceptional job in exceptionally difficult circumstances.  The greatest challenge facing us, on which the Government will be judged, is one of access to treatment and having sufficient capacity in hospital to meet increasing demand.  The figures for bed capacity and capital spending show that we are not meeting that challenge.  The University Hospital Galway campus has reached developmental saturation point.  The terms of the Galway city development plan and spatial constraints on the site mean no more beds can be delivered.  Any further capital spending on the site would be a waste.  Up to &euro;18 million was spent on a 75-bed ward block due to open next year.  However, two wards will close as part of the development, meaning that it will not provide a single extra bed.  The problem is that University Hospital Galway has the longest waiting lists in the State and, typically, the highest number of patients on trolleys, but we cannot increase capacity on its current campus.  Will the Minister of State, therefore, agree that the solution to the crisis lies away from the existing site?  Will she agree that future capital investment should be so focused, rather than spending millions of euro on new infrastructure which will offer no additional beds and no hope to the tens of thousands on hospital waiting lists?</p></speech>

It is important that we do everything in our power to accommodate and keep people away from hospitals when possible.  In the coming months, at this time of the year, there will be an increase in the number of beds needed.  Consideration has been given to retaining one of the existing wards at University Hospital Galway to deal with escalating demand.  The business case for the design and planning phase of a new emergency department has been submitted to the HSE and is being considered.  Several vacancies will be filled, which will obviously ease pressure.  The &euro;40 million in additional funding for the winter preparedness initiative will help to ease it, too.</p>  <p>  As Minister of State with responsibility for older people, I know that work is under way in my section to develop a more formalised and structured approach to home help services, which, again, will help to relieve some of the pressure exerted by delayed discharges, not just within University Hospital Galway but also across the board.</p>  <p>  I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  Every effort will be made to relieve the pressures she has described.</p></speech>

I also have received correspondence from the Minister and the Department in response to a parliamentary question on this matter.</p>  <p>  I am making a case for a third classroom at the school in question.  Previously, the school had boys from junior infants to first class.  Since a change of status in 2013, the school now has boys and girls from junior infants to sixth class.  Accordingly, it finds itself in urgent need of additional accommodation and classrooms.  To ensure it will be prepared and ready to offer its pupils a safe and healthy environment, it has been looking at future projected enrolments.</p>  <p>  In June 2014 the school was granted a new classroom, as the existing classroom for the second teacher did not meet the Department's size requirements.  The school also had communal toilets.  From a child protection point of view, the board of management was not happy with junior infants pupils using toilet facilities with sixth class pupils.  In its previous application to the Department the school flagged that it needed two new classrooms.  Its enrolment numbers for 2017 and 2018 will be 68 and 77 pupils, respectively.  An application for a developing post will be provided for the Department as soon as a staffing schedule for next year is published.</p>  <p>  The school is in the middle of building the second classroom and its principal acknowledges the support the school has received from the Department in that regard.  The board of management will also convert the two existing smaller classrooms into a learning support room which will also act as a library and a resource room.  Next year, accordingly, the school will need a new classroom for its third teacher.</p>  <p>  The school has examined the records and baptismal certificates in the parish of Stradbally.  Taking into account school leavers, the expected total number of pupils attending will be 68 in 2017, 77 in 2018, 84 in 2019 and 99 in 2020.  This will involve a 100% increase in the current number of pupils by the end of 2020.  The school is requesting funding from the Department for the purpose of building the additional classroom to ensure it will be in a position to manage the increase in the number of pupils adequately.  There are also two preschools in the area, as well as an after-school club.  The school expects enrolments to grow steadily in the next five to ten years.</p>  <p>  The school is appealing to the Minister to work with it as it plans for the future.  It genuinely acknowledges the support it has received up to now from the Department.  It is looking at current and future needs and trying to plan for the future.  In so doing it is asking for the Department's support.  Will the Minister outline if he will be able to work with the school and what can be done to accommodate its future needs because of the additional projected enrolments?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-11-09a.293" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="15:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016110900031#DD00500"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  Generally, the main point about demographic pressure is that we are catering for 20,000 extra places every year which puts much pressure on the system.  There are ways of deciding where extra places are needed which look at planning issues.  It needs to look at schools in a whole neighbourhood, not just individual schools.</p>  <p>  In 2015 the Department approved devolved funding for Our Lady of Mercy national school, Stradbally, County Waterford, to construct a mainstream classroom.  Responsibility for delivery of the project was devolved to the board of management and the board accepted the conditions associated with the grant in February 2016.  I understand the project has since been put out to tender.</p>  <p>  I am aware that the school has operated as a two-teacher school for several years.  It anticipated that enrolment numbers would grow to a level that would warrant the appointment of a third teacher.  The Department approved the provision of an additional classroom on this basis.  However, enrolment numbers did not materialise as anticipated and the third teacher was, therefore, not appointed.</p><p>The school, however, expects enrolments to grow in the future and is advancing with the provision of the classroom approved in 2015.  It has since submitted, on Wednesday, 2 November 2016, another application to the Department for additional accommodation.  The application will be considered and a response conveyed directly to the school authority as soon as the assessment process has been finalised.  I note the numbers and will convey them to the building unit.  I am sure they are included with the application.  In 2012 the enrolment was 38.  It was the same in 2013.  It increased to 49 in 2014 and has pretty much remained at that level in recent years.  It was 50 last year, or up by just one.  It has been relatively stable, but, as the Deputy said, it is anticipated that it will grow.</p> <p> The building unit will be in touch with the school on the back of its most recent application which, as the Deputy said, is to covert two existing mainstream classrooms into a learning support room and a library.  That application may have an impact on the school's existing classroom accommodation.  It is a very recent application, having been made only a couple of days ago.  We will, in consultation with the school, assess the proposal and respond to it.</p></speech>

In general, I support the overriding objective that every child, including children in this catchment area, have access to a physical school place.  I acknowledge that the application was only received by the Department on 2 November.  I act fast, as does the school, but so, too, does the Minister.  I hope he will be able to give this application due consideration.  This is an example of a school that is planning for the future in a forward-thinking way.  I imagine that the Minister wants schools to do this and work constructively with their elected representatives and others to ensure current and future demands are met.  In that regard, the school is obviously doing the right thing.  It has made the application, but it has asked us to convey directly to the Minister the fact that there will be an increase in the enrolment number next year.  It expects further growth in future years.  It is trying to plan ahead and avoid getting caught in circumstances in which, as the Minister said in terms of the overriding objective, accommodation will not be sufficient to meet the demand.  I acknowledge that the application was only made recently.  I appreciate that the Minister and his officials will have to consider it in the context of many other demands being made.  Perhaps, if there is positive movement in the short term, the Minister might communicate this to all local Oireachtas Members.</p></speech>

A doubling of the size of the school represents a significant expansion.  The Department, without knowing the details of circumstances locally, will have to consider capacity in other schools and where pupils are being drawn from.  There is a matrix of criteria that the Department uses in assessing applications.  As stated, it will be in touch with the school directly to assess the proposal.</p></speech>

The average rent has increased by 11.7%.  As the Minister knows, that is way out of line with the consumer price index and any construction price index.  In fact, it is now cheaper to service a mortgage than it is to rent.  A mortgage for a three-bedroom house in Dublin 5 would cost approximately &euro;1,287 per month, whereas the equivalent rent would be &euro;1,500 per month.  People's weekends and nights are filled looking for accommodation.  Many of them are working.  We are not just talking about people in receipt of rent supplement.  When they do a deal with a landlord verbally, he or she frequently and increasingly gets back to them on the telephone to state another two or three individuals or couples are offering &euro;200 or &euro;300 more for the accommodation.  While there are very many good landlords, it is now apparent that groups of landlords are squeezing unfortunate tenants for as much as they possibly can in the way of rent increases.</p><p>It is not enough for the Government to stand idly by.  It has been in office for over six months, before which there was a long gestation period.  Nothing has been done since the former Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, put in place a structure requiring the holding of rents at a certain level for two years.  This is about market failure.</p><p>The Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, has very strong capitalist views which he has frequently expressed, but, even according to the theory of capitalism, if there is total market failure, that is a reason for the state to intervene and seek to regulate the market.  The only way to regulate the market is to introduce rent certainty, rent control and longer leases, as is done in many other European countries, that is, give tenants an opportunity to have security of tenure, particularly where they have children because children settle into local schools and avail of local services and make friends.  The alternative is to continue with the failed Irish model which involves a one or two-year lease, on the expiry of which people must go on the move again.  In current circumstances it is genuinely difficult for people to find a rental property in the area in which they have chosen to settle.</p><p>I represent Dublin West which has one of the highest proportions of tenants in the State.  I am all too familiar with the fact that, as the banks move in and take back more buy-to-let properties, the tenants must find another place to rent.  They may have to move to another county and find other schools.  The Minister must intervene to regulate this runaway market that is causing so much misery.</p></speech>

As she knows, there are acute pressures in the rental market.  These pressures are being driven by a number of factors, including rising demand, a lack of supply and the high costs that some indebted landlords face in servicing their loans.  These stresses are confirmed by the latest data from the <i>Daft.ie</i>rental report.  The report shows that rent asking prices rose nationwide by an average 11.7% in the year to September 2016.  In Dublin annual rental inflation is running at an average of 12.1%.  Strong rent inflation is also seen in the Dublin commuter counties.  These increases are placing huge pressures on tenants, particularly those who are seeking new accommodation.</p><p>The problems in the rental sector are undoubtedly part of a bigger issue.  Ireland is in the midst of a housing supply crisis and shortage.  The problems caused by high rents reflect, and are reflected in, the other issues facing the housing market, those being, not enough homes for first-time buyers, increased demand for social housing and unacceptable levels of homelessness.  While many factors contribute to these problems, the one common to all of them is the prolonged and chronic lack of supply of new houses.  This is borne out by the <i>Daft.ie</i>figures on supply.  There were fewer than 3,700 homes available to rent nationwide on 1 October, with just over 1,400 of those in Dublin.<br/><br/>The best way to reduce and stabilise rents in the long term and benefit the entire sector is to increase supply and accelerate delivery of housing for the private and social rented sectors.  Rebuilding Ireland, the Government's action plan on housing and homelessness, aims to increase and accelerate housing delivery across all tenures to help individuals and families to meet their housing needs.  It sets out more than 80 actions that the Government is taking through new policy and legislation, significantly increased funding and innovative measures in the budget to achieve that aim.  Pillar 4 of the action plan commits to developing a comprehensive strategy for the rental sector by the end of the year.  I hope that we will have a new rental strategy by the middle of December, one that will try to balance the competing policy asks of, on the one hand, the need to help the people about whom the Deputy talked, namely, those who are finding themselves priced out of the market by rental inflation, and, on the other hand, to ensure that we do not shut down society by placing the dead hand of regulation on the market in our attempts to address what is a short-term to medium-term problem for many.<br/><br/>The Deputy called me a capitalist, but I am a pragmatist first and foremost.  I see a problem and it is my job to try to fix it.  As the Deputy knows, the previous Government took measures last year.  They have had some effect, but they are not enough.  We need to do more.  We are examining the various ways in which we can introduce new approaches to address the dramatic rental increases in many parts of Ireland while, most importantly, encouraging an increase in supply.  Otherwise, we will continue dealing with the symptoms of a supply deficit indefinitely.  That is something that we cannot allow.<br/><br/>We have not been building houses in sufficient numbers for the past seven or eight years because the property market collapsed and the banking sector with it.  As those sectors re-emerge, we will see increased supply.  We must encourage that in a sustainable way while also taking other actions, given the pressures that many tenants face.  There will be moves in that direction in the new strategy, which she will see in a few weeks' time.</p></speech>

When there is market failure, the Government must move in.  Deputy Coveney cannot wash his hands of this matter as the Minister with responsibility.  Like the previous Government, of which I was a member and a T&aacute;naiste, the Minister has proposed a series of measures to build new homes, but he must acknowledge that it takes time to build even a rapid-build house.  By the time that planning, site location and other issues are sorted, rapid-build houses can cost nearly as much as traditional ones and take much longer to build than was first outlined in the information provided to us.</p>  <p>  Without taking away from the necessity to build new homes, the Minister must recognise that will take a long time.  There will be a two-year to four-year gap before supply can catch up with market availability.  In the meantime, the victims of an ever greedier cohort of landlords - not all landlords are like this and we have many good ones - are being placed under pressure by people who are making a bonanza out of renting to people who need to rent.  I grew up in a rented house, so I can speak from childhood memory.  The Minister could travel to Donegal and talk to voters and families in the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's constituency.  Security of tenure was something that people in 19th century Ireland fought for and achieved.  Unlike in most other parts of Europe, though, that security is significantly absent from the Irish property market now because of an ideological approach to the rights of the landlord versus the rights of the tenant.  Will the Minister redress this situation?  He will find no solution without doing that.</p></speech>

I can be accused of much, but I do not wash my hands of problems.  I have responsibility for the housing market, people who are homeless and implementing an ambitious housing and homelessness strategy for the Government.  A piece of the jigsaw that is not fully filled in yet is a rental strategy, which we have committed to having in place before the end of the year.</p>  <p>  There is considerable detail in the five pillars of our housing strategy.  The only pillar that does not have as much detail as we would like is the rental pillar.  For this reason, we need to address in the coming weeks some of the issues in the strategy that the Deputy has raised.  We are holding broad consultations to get the balance right.</p>  <p>  I will not wash my hands of this matter.  We will be taking risks from a policy point of view.  They will be managed risks in terms of making policy choices that we believe will improve the situation.  What I do not want to do is make a bad situation even worse by introducing regulations that will stop the relatively small amount of building that has happened to date and the potential momentum to build many more rental properties.  We must keep the momentum going.</p>  <p>  I take the Deputy's point that all of this takes time.  Even rapid-build houses cannot be built overnight.  In the meantime, we have a broken market and I want to fix it as quickly as possible through increased supply first and foremost.  We can provide supports and reassurance to the landlord and the tenant, both of whom are under stress at times.  There is a significant number of tenants, particularly in the Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway areas where there is considerable pressure.</p>  <p>  The House will debate whether we got the strategy right in some detail when we publish it in a few weeks' time, but we will make every effort to get the balance right so that, in two years' time, we will be discussing a market that is coming back towards equilibrium in terms of supply and demand instead of needing more emergency-type debates and measures because of a fundamental supply deficit that will exist indefinitely.  We cannot have the latter.</p></speech>

The Bill specifically states: </p><blockquote>The Government shall be collectively responsible for the protection, management and maintenance of the public water system.  The Government shall ensure in the public interest that this resource remains in public ownership and management.</blockquote><p>I am also pleased that the Government has decided not to oppose the Bill and has allowed it to proceed to Committee Stage without a vote, although it is important to say that such a vote would have been comfortably carried.</p><p>This Bill, which was drafted in conjunction with the Right2Water campaign, does not belong to me or to any other politician or political party.  It belongs to people in communities across Ireland, as does the water it protects.  The Bill&rsquo;s progress thus far is a reflection of the power of a movement, the largest in the history of the State, and one in which many of us in this House have had the privilege to participate.  At the same time, there were many here who simply did not get the message of Right2Water, who did not understand its significance or the scale of its support.  The Right2Water campaign was about much more than water charges.  It was a movement against austerity and the politics that underpinned it and it showed that everyday people can change society when they get active and organised.  First and foremost it was a mass movement by ordinary citizens against what they correctly saw as the first steps towards the privatisation of water services.  </p><p>The amendment proposed in this Bill gives voice to that central demand, that our water services should remain in public ownership and, I stress, public management.  The latter is a very important part of the Bill.  It was drafted by Treasa Brannick O&rsquo;Cillin with the assistance of senior counsel, S&eacute;amas &Oacute; Tuathail.  It places responsibility on this or any future Government to ensure that both the ownership and management of our water remains in public hands.  Placing the amendment in Article 28 of the Constitution gives a guarantee to the citizens of this State that the public water system will not be privatised.  This is the proper place for the amendment, alongside areas such as health care and education, befitting of the importance of water to life and society.</p><p>I must make clear that this amendment does not deal with group water schemes.  By specifying the public water system as its concern, it does not seek to bring citizens&rsquo; private water schemes, or systems built for private use within the remit of the Government.  Furthermore, the amendment does not intervene into the legislative framework.  It does not seek to abolish water charges or Irish Water.  Although I maintain my opposition to both, that is a battle for another day following the report by the expert commission.  The amendment will, however, guarantee that the Irish Government is responsible for our water and its management, from the bodies of water connected to the provision of public water, to all systems from collection to distribution, including waste water systems.  If it is passed, these will be the sole responsibility of the Irish Government.  No Government can sell them off or pass on the management to for-profit companies.  This will be a victory for everyone in this country who believes that water is a human right and not a commodity.  This amendment will also be a blow against privatisation.  In England and Wales today, because of the privatisation of water, 23.6% of people live in a state of water poverty.  Private water bills have sky-rocketed by more than 300% since the system was privatised while 19 private water companies make annual profits in excess of &pound;2 billion.  This situation must not be repeated in Ireland.</p><p>  Ireland has had its share of nightmare privatisation experiences.  We have an unprecedented homelessness crisis in this State today which is directly attributable to the selling off of public housing stock and the turning over of housing, lock, stock and barrel, to the market.  Then there is the case of refuse services, privatised after a similar attempt to introduce charges, which has resulted in sky-high rates, bad wages and conditions for workers, a lockout and increases in illegal dumping.  All of this is before we get to the case of Telecom Eireann and Eircom, where an essential public asset was sold off at a cut-rate price.  Our telecommunications system was starved of investment, leaving the public lacking in the infrastructure needed to build a modern economy.  </p><p>This is not the only damage done by privatisation.  It has also played a key role in corroding the public sphere, the ties that bind us together in society.  Given recent events in America there will be a lot of discussion in the coming days about the crisis of democracy and why people are so angry.  It would be a mistake to have that conversation without talking about what has changed so fundamentally in our economies in recent years.  It is not only the fact that people&rsquo;s jobs, wages and services have been cut, but also the philosophy that underpins this, namely, the belief that the market is the best way to produce and distribute goods.  This philosophy has been used to shrink the terrain of public goods in our economies.  This is an attack on democracy because when smaller and smaller proportions of the economy can be owned in common, fewer and fewer decisions can be made in common.  The people are disempowered.  We need to respond to this with a defence of the common, the part of society that we, the public, own and share.</p><p>Water provision is at the forefront of this battle.  </p> <p> Being realistic, I understand there are likely to be attempts to dilute the wording of the Bill on Committee Stage.  The best defence against this is maintaining the vigilance of and the pressure exerted by the Right2Water movement which have secured the passage of the Bill to this Stage.  The movement comprises everyday activists and trade unions such as Unite, Mandate, the CPSU, OPATSI, the TWU and my own, the CWU.  I was very pleased when we received support for the Bill from the country's largest trade union, SIPTU.  To Members of this House and the Seanad, all I will say is there is only one thing they need to believe, that is, the public water system should remain within public protection, ownership and management and should not be sold off to private enterprise for the pursuit of profit.  If they can agree with this idea, we call on them to support the Bill as it stands without making any change to it.</p></speech>

For want of a better term, Irish Water is another version of the HSE and literally outsourcing just about anything it has on its table.  It is carving up the country.  We have Aecom in the Dublin area, EPS in the Cork area, Veolia in Kilkenny and Glan Agua in Galway.  Between the four of them, they are literally taking over water provision in Ireland.  They are designing, constructing and operating facilities.  Of course, the money is to be made in operating facilities, which I am sure is not news to the Minister.  If people are paying through the Government, it will cost a fortune now that we are allowing Irish Water, a version of the HSE, to arrange how water and wastewater services are organised in Ireland.  </p>  <p>  There are huge problems.  Some of the companies are incredibly big and will do what they like.  I will mention one of them.  Veolia has just won a 20-year design, build and operate contract with Irish Water which includes an &euro;18.4 million upgrade of wastewater infrastructure in County Donegal.  In May it won a 27-month design and build contract in Cavan.  The water treatment plant in Athy, County Kildare is operated by it under a 20-year design, build and operate contract.  It was the operator of Ireland's largest biomass power plant in Killala, County Mayo.  It was to meet the total biomass fuel requirement in the vicinity, with biomass to be brought from the United States, landed at Dublin Port and transported by road across the country.  The project has run into the sand because it does not make any sense.  I would like to see some transparency on how the whole thing was set up.  Was there a tender process?  It was a gift to foreign corporations from the State which is about to produce dirty energy, the production of which will be subsidised by the people of Ireland.  It was to be expensive.  US investors were guaranteed a price well above the level in the wholesale market available to unsubsidised generators.  What a disaster we have have at Ringsend.  Celtic Anglian Water, a subsidiary of Anglian Water in the United Kingdom, is being allowed to print money because of its contracts and seemingly Irish Water can do nothing about it.  Celtic Anglian Water has Irish Water over a barrel and can charge whatever it likes.  There is mayhem.  The Minister should take a close look at what is happening in Ringsend.  I would like him to come back and tell us that everything is grand because I have information from inside the industry that things are far from it.  There are huge problems.</p>  <p>  Before Irish Water was established, we had the local authorities taking the same route.  What Irish Water amounts to is a red tape version of what we had in place around the countryside with several layers on top.  Bureaucracy has flourished under Irish Water which has increased the amount of red tape no end.  The Minister should tell me I am wrong.  Is Irish Water getting huge companies to design, build and operate plants and giving them 20 to 25-year contracts to complete the project?  We are giving them powers that will be almost uncontrollable in the years to come similar to the powers Celtic Anglian Water has in Ringsend.  Veolia which is not even the biggest in the country but which will probably become the biggest because it will probably gobble up some of the others in the near future is involved in the energy and transport sectors.  It had to sell off its transport operation in Israel where it was introducing transport measures in the Occupied Territories.  Palestinians, however, were not even allowed to use the transport system.  Veolia had received so much bad publicity that it had to pull out of it.  It is all over the shop in the United States where it has been thrown out of several cities for bad practice and introducing cost-cutting measures at the cost of quality and because of health concerns.  Somebody in the United States said recently that if one wanted to describe what Veolia got up to, it would come in, rape one's water company and leave with money bags.  It is to take over water services in this country unless we get rid of Irish Water and the Government takes a direct role in it.  Inserting this measure in the Constitution will be a waste of time if we go down this route.</p></speech>

We have the prospect on a global scale of super profits being realisedon the back of what is a necessity to sustain life.  Anybody who glances even superficially at what the Government has done in the establishment of Irish Water could come to no other conclusion but that Irish Water is the precursor to an organisation or institution to privatise the water supply because anything else does not make sense.  Why, in God's name, would anyone bother, given the lack of economies of scale, installing individual water meters unless they had a plan to define the source of supply in order that they could charge for it and, ultimately, privatise the service?  The prospect of our vital life-sustaining water supply being handed over to private hands is very real.  In that sense, the idea of constitutional change to protect the water supply and maintain it in public ownership is critically important.  If we were to do this, we would find ourselves very much on the side of people globally who have had to engage in battles similar to those engaged in by the Irish population to protect water.  </p><p>The reality is that on the issue of water privatisation globally the tide had turned precisely at the time when we in Ireland were moving in the opposite direction.  Many cities are returning water services to public control.  We know that a report by the Transnational Institute-Public Services International research unit and the Multinationals Observatory suggests 180 cities and communities in 35 countries, including in places such as Buenos Aires, Johannesburg, Paris, Berlin and Kuala Lumpur, have re-municipalised their water systems in the past decade.  We know that the European Federation of Public Service Unions found clear signs that municipalities in a number of countries across Europe were continuing to move towards re-municipalising rather than privatising water services.  We know that services in the United Kingdom are being brought back in-house because outsourcing has proved to be inefficient.  The <i>Financial Times</i>suggested local authorities had grown sceptical about the savings outsourcing could deliver, as well as fearing a backlash against private companies which were making large profits from taxpayers.</p><p> If the Minister and his colleague could tone it down it a bit, it would be helpful; it is hard to speak here at the same time.</p> <p> By 2011, some 80 out of 140 councils in the UK had brought back local services on the expiry of private contracts.  This has been driven by an economic failure of the private model.  The reduction in costs and greater efficiency of in-house services has been a major factor in taking many of these services back into public ownership.</p> <p> While I do not have time to develop the points, it is commonly known that Corporate Watch in the UK investigated the finances of 19 water and sewerage companies in England and Wales, and found that about a third of the money spent on water bills goes to banks and investors as dividends.  People pay &pound;2 billion more per year or &pound;80 per household than they would if water services were publicly owned.  Six companies are avoiding billions of pounds in taxes by routing profits through tax havens.  We know that the CEOs of 19 water companies in England and Wales were paid about &pound;10 million in salaries and bonuses.</p> <p> Basically privatisation is a bad model for public services, critically for life-sustaining ones such as water; that has been demonstrated the world over.  It has wreaked havoc everywhere and it results in increased charges, lack of public accountability, higher operating costs, worse services, and a loss in jobs in the water industry, not to mind a deteriorating infrastructure at precisely the time when our infrastructure needs to be developed.  Any cursory examination of any of the areas where water has been privatised would vindicate that.</p> <p> There are no market-based solutions to the crisis of water services and no market-based solutions to climate change or environmental crisis.  In fact, if we want to protect our water we need to ensure the market is excluded from its provision.  It is not just a case of the Bill enshrining water in public ownership, but the management of our water supply must be maintained in public ownership through local authorities and State bodies, and not outsourced to organisations such as Capita, as we have seen in the UK.  The enshrining of the management as well as the ownership of our water supply publicly are equally important.</p> <p> I believe the people have spoken on this.  They have a deep desire to keep our water supply in public ownership.  We are an island nation that gets a lot of rain.  We know it costs money to deliver our water, but it is a public service that should be available to all based on need and not on the money in individuals' pockets at the end of the day.</p></speech>

The debate comes at a critical time in our collective deliberations on the future of domestic water charges and how we fund domestic water services into the future.  Any discussion that informs that debate is welcome.</p>  <p>  I understand and appreciate the intention of the Bill before the House, which seeks to underline public ownership of our public water system.  While the Bill has not undergone the necessary consultation or deliberation required to establish whether providing additional constitutional protection can, or should, be provided to the public ownership of our public water infrastructure, the Government will not oppose it on Second Stage.  However, for the reasons I will outline in the course of my contribution, it is imperative that the Bill undergo the necessary deliberation and scrutiny at pre-legislative stage to ensure that its intention or wording does not run the risk of unintended consequences.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge the sincerity of Members from all sides of the House on the need to give public reassurance on this issue.  Everybody here wants public water infrastructure that serves the needs of the citizens and businesses of this country.  Everyone here, I believe, wants this to be achieved through public, not private, ownership.</p>  <p>  Members have been proposing a constitutional amendment that guarantees future public ownership for some time.  I have consistently said that I am open to considering workable proposals that provide the necessary certainty on this issue.  Three similar Bills seeking a constitutional amendment on water infrastructure have been published this year.  We may disagree over how to fund water services, but we share a common view on the State owning this vital public service.  Not once have I heard a dissenting voice in this House or in the Seanad on the issue.  There are issues regarding tendering certain jobs, processes and functions, but there is general agreement on the core issue of public ownership.</p>  <p>  To address public and political concerns, the previous Government, of which I was a member, legislated twice to reassure the people that Irish Water and its infrastructure would not be privatised by a future government.  The Water Services Act 2013 prohibited the shareholders of Irish Water, comprising me as the relevant Minister, the Minister for Finance and the board of Irish Water, from alienating their shares.</p>  <p>  In 2014, the Government introduced a further safeguard in the Water Services Act 2014.  Any privatisation or part-privatisation of Irish Water, through alienation of any ministerial share in Irish Water to anyone other than another Minister, cannot be initiated unless three specific conditions are met: both Houses of the Oireachtas pass a resolution approving such a proposal; the prior approval of a majority of voters in a plebiscite is obtained on the proposal, in other words the public would have to vote; and the Minister must then initiate legislation to privatise Irish Water or alienate any share held by the Government.</p>  <p>  Existing legislation, therefore, already provides a statutory prohibition on the disposal of Irish Water and its water services infrastructure.  The question for this Oireachtas is therefore whether the legal safeguards already in place need to or can be further strengthened through an appropriate amendment to our Constitution.  Some speakers this evening have stated that Irish Water was designed to be privatised.  I know that is not the case and it was never the intention of the previous Government to do that.  That is borne out by the legislation we have passed since the setting up of the single utility.</p>  <p>  Although I am supportive of any additional measures to safeguard public ownership of the public water system, I also recognise the complexity of a constitutional amendment.  We should not assume this is a simple matter.  The Constitution is the fundamental legal document of the State.  It usually does not explicitly recognise the structures of the State that operate below our key institutions.  These structures, such as the education and health systems, or the country's energy and road networks, are usually prescribed in legislation.</p>  <p>  An additional complication to any constitutional recognition of public ownership of water infrastructure is the proposed wording.  It is challenging to construct an appropriate amendment given the various categories of ownership of water services infrastructure in the State.  Among those that might experience unforeseen circumstances are infrastructure funded by the State but operated by private group water schemes, or boreholes located on privately owned land.  Seeking to enshrine such property in public ownership through a constitutional referendum inherently risks having unintended consequences that could impinge on individuals' constitutional rights to private property.  I accept what the Deputy said in her opening statement that that is not the intention of the Bill, but we need to tease out some of those issues in committee.</p>  <p>  Owing to these complexities, the Government, in consultation with the Attorney General, in seeking to bring certainty to the future ownership of the public water system, has legislated twice to protect its public ownership.  We have given reassurance to the public that they will own the infrastructure that provides us with water services - the most basic and fundamental of services for homes, businesses, social services and communities - unless they, the public, decide otherwise in the future.  I, therefore, reserve my position to bring forward a Government amendment to the Bill on Committee Stage.</p>  <p>  I take the opportunity of this debate to acknowledge the strong sense of public service that has always defined those who have worked in water services.  This spirit of dedication to the public endures in the water sector of today.  Whether it is staff of local authorities, custodians of water services for over 100 years and now partners of Irish Water, or those who work directly for the national utility, those responsible for water services delivery have always strived to provide our citizens with a quality service.</p><p>I acknowledge that there have been problems in our water infrastructure, associated predominantly with underinvestment and an inadequate national approach to planning and investment for many decades.  Yet staff in the sector, and in the group water sector with its strong voluntary dimension, have always shown great dedication to serving the public.  We have seen this again and again in times of emergency such as recent flooding and storm events.  Staff continue to operate plants and maintain our national assets in difficult circumstances, often without adequate funding.  Employees of Irish Water, as well as those who have installed meters on its behalf, have worked with great professionalism in sometimes very hostile environments.  Not only is the water system publicly owned, but the employees, whether they be local authority or Irish Water, have always shown a commitment to meeting the needs of the public.  They too are an important national asset and this is something which is sometimes lost in the debate.</p> <p> Once again I thank Deputy Collins and her fellow signatories for bringing forward this Bill.  I accept the spirit with which the proposal is made and for that reason I and my Government colleagues will not be opposing the Bill at this Stage.  Given the legal and technical issues I have outlined, I must stress again the need for careful consideration of the proposal and its wording between now and its scrutiny at prelegislative stage.</p> <p> I offer the Deputies who are bringing forward this legislation, if they would like to take it up, the expertise of the Department with regard to looking at the potential flaws that may be in the wording, and I believe there may be some.  I know the Deputies have named the legal people who drafted the proposed legislation; perhaps they have got it right or perhaps not.  Let us not underestimate the challenge of putting a referendum question together.  For a start, a referendum costs the State some &euro;20 million.  If one looks at the history of referendums in Ireland, we can see that they are complex and often the debate ends up being about something very different to the question that is actually being asked.  We need to have a robust discussion on whether or not it is necessary to take it to a referendum if there are other ways in which we can have the same effect which is to reassure people that there is no privatisation agenda or route here.  I am happy to have that discussion in an open and frank manner and I look forward to that discussion taking place on Committee Stage where we can tease through all the issues and get it right collectively.</p></speech>

My party and I were always committed, and remain committed, to water services and waste water services and the infrastructure network of both being retained in public ownership.  This was reaffirmed and stated categorically in our confidence and supply arrangement with Fine Gael when we agreed to facilitate the formation of Government.  There was also a commitment in the pathway programme put in place to resolve the whole issue around the future financing of the water network and system as a utility and that Irish Water would remain as an entity in public ownership and that it would have statutory responsibility to the House with regard to the measurement of various qualities and aspects of the delivery of that service.  That being the case, and acknowledging the thrust, sentiment and goodwill associated with those who have brought this Bill forward, it is our intention to work with it to seek consensus in the Chamber to assure the public that Members of the D&aacute;il will, if necessary, amend the Constitution to ensure these facilities, services and networks remain in public ownership for all time.</p>  <p>  There were some options open to us when considering the Bill and its implications, and there was a thought process around the three options.  One option was to reject the Bill by reasoned amendment which would mean voting against it.  The reason for this were the issues around private wells and group water schemes.  Earlier, the proposer made reference to the fact they had refused to move into that realm so that it would not become something that might be challenged legally in the future.  I respect their intentions in this, but we must be conscious of the fact that while many group water schemes are in private ownership, they access water from a public source.  That is a contradiction that needs to be ironed out.  As the previous speaker said, because of the new Standing Orders that are in place, and because the Bill is coming from this side of the House, it has to go for prelegislative scrutiny rather than to Committee Stage.  I acknowledge the commitment of the Minister when he said he will make the relevant expertise available to the proposers to assist them and to amend the Bill, if necessary, for it to achieve the desired result and consequence that we all want to see.  The Minister's offer is welcome and I want to state that publicly.</p>  <p>  The other option was to reject the Bill and highlight the existing legislation which, as strong as it is, could be strengthened to further reassert the belief among all Members of the House in a commitment to retain these facilities, services and network in public ownership.  As the Minister said, a Bill would need to be passed by both Houses and then a plebiscite would need to be held for this to be allowed to be taken into private ownership, if that were the result.  One could, for example, insist on a two thirds majority.  In separating the whole issue around the charging mechanism and the ownership issue, I accept there is broad support among the public for the network, services and facilities to be retained in public ownership.  If the public can only be assured of this sentiment, as being the sentiment of this D&aacute;il, and to preclude anybody doing otherwise in the future, then maybe a referendum is possible.  For the reason outlined previously and by virtue of the fact we can go to prelegislative scrutiny, we can help and assist the proposers in framing this in such a way that it has universal approval.  There is no doubt, because of the issues around group water schemes, etc., there are some reservations, fears and worries which must be expressed.  Ultimately, we must reserve the position on this issue until the process of prelegislative scrutiny and Committee Stage has moved on to a point where there is universal support and we have addressed those concerns, worries and issues.  Then I and my party would have no problem agreeing with the principle, pursuing the principle, bringing it back to the House for final approval and allowing it to go to a referendum.</p>  <p>  I do not know where the figure of &euro;20 million associated with holding a referendum comes from, and maybe someone can give me some scientific evidence that is the case.  I remember that figure was bandied about at the time of the Seanad referendum.  It was said that it was nearly more expensive to hold a referendum on keeping the Seanad than to keep the Seanad.  Maybe a member of the Government might enlighten me as to the scientific basis for throwing out the figure of &euro;20 million.  Maybe holding a combination of referendums, as could be the case in the coming year or two years, would be a lot cheaper.  This could be stated also rather than leaving it out in the ether that the figure is &euro;20 million.</p>  <p>  I commend those who are party to the Bill and their intentions, goodwill and sentiment which are shared by the rest of us.  In the spirit of the previous speakers, I reiterate that there is every opportunity available to us through the various stages that follow to arrive at a consensus and a conclusion whereby we are safe in the knowledge that if it goes to a referendum, it will not lead to guaranteeing of ownership of our forests, Coillte, our bogs, extraction rights or gas pipelines.</p><p>We do not want to get into this realm.  I assure the Deputy of our support for the Bill and the thrust and sentiment associated with it.  We will vote in favour of it.</p></speech>

I welcome the legislation and commend those who brought it forward.  Notwithstanding the Water Services Acts in place and the safeguards they provide, there is distrust among the public about issues such as the ownership of Irish water and other aspects of public property.  Anything we can do to facilitate this is welcome.  My colleague mentioned the cost of referendums.  I was on the Oireachtas commission at the time of the referendum on the Seanad and I recall a figure of approximately &euro;13 million being discussed as the cost of the referendum.  The practice of recent years, given the number of referenda we have, is to pool together certain issues.  Deputy Madigan has proposals on divorce she wishes to put forward, and if the legislation on those was passed it would require a referendum and there may be others also.  These could be pooled to reduce the cost.</p>  <p>  It is not lost on me that the Government, while accepting Second Stage, is facing the reality that it would have lost tonight because we support the Bill.  It would also have lost on the amendment tabled last week on Deputy Tony McLoughlin's Bill on fracking.  Rather than lose it has chosen to accept Second Stage, with very carefully used language which provides for a potential attempt by the Government to amend the Bill at pre-legislative scrutiny stage or on Committee Stage.  With regard to the spirit of introducing pre-legislative scrutiny as a stage in the process, it worries me that it is to undermine the independence of Parliament in trying to bring forward legislation or legislative change.  This would be wrong.  While there might be very many negatives in some people's eyes regarding the make-up of the current Parliament it has served to give Parliament a little more of an input to the running of the country.  In the past, no matter who was in Government, Parliament was merely subservient to the Cabinet of the day but now, because of our numerical situation, it is a little different.  I hope that pre-legislative scrutiny will not be abused in a way to undermine the will of the House and the will of the sum of parts of the 158 Members of the House rather than the will of officials and Cabinet Ministers of the day, because this would be very much a retrograde step.</p>  <p>  I support the public ownership of our water system.  While I appreciate that my colleague, Deputy Cowen, does not want to see forestry and other aspects been pulled in under this, it certainly would not be the intention.  Speaking personally, I feel that if we wanted to go back as far as the hydrocarbon legislation which governs our approach to natural resources offshore, we could very usefully revisit this entire area in terms of how we go about realising the value of these resources and their ownership, in terms of us licensing them out and others taking the spoils with additional taxation measures being the only revenue to us.  This is something we could revisit.</p>  <p>  I would not rule out dealing with the issue of ownership of our forestry and various other resources of the State, speaking from a personal perspective.  The parties will have their own positions on this but it is worth looking at these aspects.  We all remember what was an opportunity for everybody in Ireland to benefit from the markets with the much promoted flotation of Eircom or Telecom &Eacute;ireann, or whatever its then name was.  Many of us participated in it.  With the benefit of hindsight we see the flaws in doing this.  We see the disaster it has become and the fact that as a nation which never had a full suite of infrastructure in terms of the utilities to which people are entitled.  As things now stand, effectively the people are at the mercy of commercial entities which may or may not decide to provide infrastructure, technology or whatever in a particular area. This is something of which we need to be cognisant.</p>  <p>  When governments or states are involved in commercial entities there may at times be an argument to look at public private partnerships or part flotations, but when it comes to key utilities and key natural resources the public is entitled to full and guaranteed ownership of all of these.  As a result, I am very supportive of any such measures and I am happy to support the Bill before us this evening.</p>  <p>  The cost issue was rightly pointed out by my colleague Deputy Cowen.  We could be prudent on this.  Following whatever improvements can be made to strengthen the Bill and strengthen the assurance to the members of the public that it is theirs and it can never be taken off them, if a referendum is the outcome it would be positive.  Perhaps it could be pooled with some of the other legislative proposals already before the House or about to come before the House so we could consult the people on a number of issues at the same time, thus reducing the cost.</p>  <p>  I hope, notwithstanding the Minister's kind words in support of the spirit of the Bill, the pre-legislative scrutiny stage will not be abused in favour of forcing a Government position and will honour the spirit and intentions of the Members of the House who support this today and ensure that ultimately we will see the absolute copper fastening of the public ownership of the utility.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-11-09a.317" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1225" speakername="Thomas Byrne" time="17:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016110900038#MM00300"><p>I am delighted to be here to support Deputy Collins's Bill and the principle of it.  I am very glad Fianna F&aacute;il is supporting it.  Two years ago almost to the day, I an my colleague, then Senator Darragh O'Brien, put forward a motion in the Seanad calling on the Government to initiate legislation to provide for a constitutional referendum to enshrine the ownership of Irish Water to the Irish people in perpetuity.  At the time, the Labour Party grouping in the Seanad rightly rebelled the Government Whip and joined us.  The motion was passed in the Seanad, one of the few times a cross-party motion involving all parties and none managed to be successful in the Seanad.  Certainly it did not have a chance in the D&aacute;il at that time.  This is the background I come from, this is what I want and this is what I believe in.</p>  <p>  Between one thing and another after the motion was passed, the Labour Party, in fairness to it, played a key role and the legislation was tightened.  In truth, even without this Bill, and every party here agrees, it would be almost impossible to privatise Irish Water but I agree with the principle of enshrining it in public ownership simply because of that very slight chance that some decision would happen in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann to privatise it.  The chances of it politically and practically speaking are almost zero.  Even Deputy Collins would probably accept this as we stand.  I very much support the principle of the Bill, the principle of holding a referendum and the actuality of holding a referendum on this issue.</p>  <p>  Perhaps it was to the surprise of Deputy Collins that we are supporting the Bill.  One of the reasons we are supporting it is because we have a record on the issue and we want to continue it and implement it.  In her surprise, she changed the debate slightly and is asking us to support the exact wording she has tabled.  Her wording is good but I am not happy now with the wording I tabled two years ago because it is slightly wrong.  Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien and I worked on it together, along with Seanad colleagues at the time.  The wording I tabled two years ago would have benefitted from wider consultation, even though it was abundantly clear what the principle was.  There was absolutely no doubt about the principle of what I was putting forward but when I looked at the wording, and I am a solicitor by profession, I thought I could tweak it.  I have not given this wording huge study because we are speaking about the general principle of it, but it would benefit from everybody examining it.  Perhaps it will not be improved upon but perhaps it will.  We will all have views on it.  The Government, the Attorney General, the parties, Deputy Collins, her colleagues and Fianna F&aacute;il will have an opportunity to look at this.</p><p>There are issues.  For example, Irish Water owns the sewerage system but it is not covered by the wording of the Bill.  However, I do not want to stand in the way of a referendum, and I want there to be a referendum on this issue so I come to the debate in that spirit.  I am delighted that this has been brought forward but I worry that some people see the issue as an opportunity for conflict, although I do not refer to Deputy Joan Collins in this respect.  For the first time ever, the D&aacute;il is coming together to allow this principle to go through in respect of water.  Deputy Collins has done us a service by bringing together her thinking and that of colleagues, including myself, and we finally seem to have a point in relation to water on which everyone agrees.  Nobody wants to privatise water and we have taken a huge step forward.  We have all worked on this and I am glad to have played my role in getting a motion passed in the Seanad two years ago.  It will happen and other referendums will have to happen.  Deputy Madigan's proposal is probably a no-brainer but it will also have to be looked at carefully.  We will probably have a series of referendums on a single day.</p> <p> Although people probably regard the proposal to retain Irish water in public ownership as a no-brainer, people have contacted me to ask if it enshrines charges in the Constitution.  People are suspicious of the entire political system and they ask all sorts of obscure questions whenever, for example, a treaty is put forward at European level.  People wonder if there is a hidden agenda in putting this forward and I have had to assure them on Facebook that there is not.  Let us work together on this in the spirit in which it was brought forward and in which many of us have worked to promote this idea over a number of years, and let us do it properly.  We have seen a Government proposal amended in this Oireachtas, when a flaw was spotted in the process of a constitutional referendum.  There was toing and froing in the case of the eighth amendment and I am sure Deputy Joan Collins is not happy with the wording that was agreed.  There was a history to it, however, so this has to be done really carefully.  Nevertheless, we are supportive of the Bill and of retaining water and the sewerage system in public ownership.</p></speech>

I also thank the Minister, Deputy Coveney, for what was a really constructive contribution.  Those of us who have brought forward this Bill do so sincerely but we do not think we have all the answers and we are conscious of the fact that others, while they share the intentions of the Bill, have concerns, as the Minister and Fianna F&aacute;il Members outlined.  We in Sinn F&eacute;in would very much like to take up the offer of the advice and expertise of officials in the Department.  We will have an opportunity through the prelegislative scrutiny and committee process to find the best way to ensure public ownership of water is given the strongest protection possible.</p>  <p>  This Bill, which 38 of us signed, is not just the work of a small number of Deputies in this House but is the expression of hundreds of thousands of people in the Right2Water movement.  In response to those mobilisations the trade union movement brought together the political pillars of that social movement to engage in a discussion of policy formulation prior to the last general election.  The open dialogue that took place among many groups of people who would be in conflict over other issues came up with the Right2Change policy platform, at the centre of which was a set of core policy principles with regard to water: water is a fundamental human right that people should have access to on the basis of need and not on ability to pay; it should not be subject to the profit motive, the free market or commodification; and in order to ensure that every individual and family has access to the water they need for life water, as a natural resource and in its delivery through the water and sanitation system, should be fully retained in public ownership.  In addition, the entity delivering the services needs to be fully accountable to the D&aacute;il and, ultimately, to the people.  The view of those who have signed this Bill is that constitutional protection is the strongest possible protection that can be provided and we support the Bill on that basis.</p>  <p>  There are some people who say we do not need this as there is no intention on the part of the current Government to privatise water services, and the Minister echoed these concerns.  However, significant sections of our water services are already undergoing privatisation, and this was as true under previous Administrations as it is today.  There are a total of 115 operate, build and design contracts at 232 different sites.  The contracts will continue for 15 years and the taxpayer is on the hook for some &euro;1.4 billion, an amount that could increase depending on what happens into the future.  That is a concern to many on this side of the House.</p>  <p>  There are also people who do not trust the Government on this issue and do not believe it when it states it does not want to privatise services.  Even if we accept the Government at its word it does not mean a future Government, with a majority in this House, could not seek to privatise either the resource or the system of delivery.  Given all those doubts, constitutional protection is the strongest form of protection.</p>  <p>  The Minister also outlined the existing levels of protection, particularly section 2 of the Water Services Act 2014.  While Deputy Thomas Byrne is right that this is strong enough legislation, it can be changed - it does not have to be enacted and a majority in a future Oireachtas could remove those protections and proceed to privatise part or all of our water and sanitation services.  That is why a constitutional amendment is far stronger and a far better protection.</p>  <p>  The other big worry people have is that there is undoubtedly a desire on the part of the European Commission to encourage, to incentivise and, in some cases, to insist on the privatisation of water and sanitation services, as it has done in a number of member states because it believes it is the best way to deliver those services.  It does not insist on it until taxpayers and governments substantially invest in the services until they are brought into a position of profitability, and then they can sell them on.  Even if future Governments did not want to privatise water, the concerns would remain in the shape of the Commission.  I have some sympathy with the people in group water schemes and private well owners but those issues can be adequately teased out in prelegislative scrutiny and on Committee Stage to the satisfaction of all.</p>  <p>  Everybody believes water should remain in public ownership and the view of those of us who signed this Bill is that the strongest possible protection for that objective is to be gained through a constitutional referendum.  I will take at their word all Deputies who support or refuse to oppose this Bill today.  Let us sit down and engage constructively on Committee Stage to design the best possible constitutional amendment.  If we can do it with cross-party and Independent support, all the better.  The public will reward us for it and I am very encouraged that nobody who has spoken so far is opposing the Bill.</p></speech>

Legislation aside, people believe access to water is a fundamental and basic human right and they are reluctant to take at its word a Government that tells us it is committed to the public health service while at the same time channelling taxpayers' money into the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  That is privatisation which is not good for public services.  I am sure, therefore, that the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, will understand why there is a deficit of trust on this issue.</p>  <p>  It is welcome that every Member who has contributed to the debate so far has spoken in favour of a constitutional amendment to ensure the strongest possible protection of water services and address the real concerns expressed by citizens in advance of the last general election.  There are many Right2Water representatives in the D&aacute;il.  We were elected on a number of platforms, one being the protection of water services from what people saw as a real threat of privatisation.  They fear the intent was to privatise water services.  They rightly have that fear.  </p>  <p>  It is welcome that the Labour Party supports the Bill.  I recall my constituency colleague, Deputy Brendan Ryan, telling me in advance of the general election that there was no need for a constitutional referendum on this issue because the legislation in place was strong enough, a view which I did not support at the time.  As I said, it is welcome that the Labour Party is supporting the Bill and that there is cross-party support for it.  It is important that we act on it and that we ensure the protection of water services provided for therein is as strong as possible.</p></speech>

In 2014 I brought forward the Thirty-fourth amendment of the Constitution Bill, the intention of which was similar to that of this Bill.  At the time I asked that a referendum be held on the issue on the same day as the same-sex marriage referendum.  The provision of an additional ballot paper on that day would have copperfastened the ownership water services as a public asset.</p>  <p>  The biggest concern people have is that water services will be privatised.  We all remember what happened to Telecom Eireann, now eir, in the 1980s.  It was fattened, modernised with taxpayers' money and sold off by the Government to vulture capitalists.  The rest is history.  We lost control of that service and do not want the same to happen to Irish Water.  Two years ago, when I tried to have my Bill introduced and passed through this House, the then deputy leader of the Labour Party and Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, told me that it was not needed and that the legislation in place would not be changed because none of the other parties in the D&aacute;il at the time wanted that to happen.  From what has happened in the United States, we know that things can change overnight.  Insertion of a clause into the Constitution is the only way to guarantee water services will not be privatised.  We do not want to see happen here what is happening in Detroit with water services or in parts of Britain where private companies are charging poor households sky-rocketing prices for water.  The Bill is a step in the right direction.</p></speech>

This is a good Bill.  It is essential and flows naturally from the mass movement we have seen in the past few years in response to water charges as conducted by this and the previous Government.  I believe the Bill will be passed.  My understanding is that Fianna F&aacute;il and the Labour Party support it.  I also heard positive mutterings earlier from the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, which indicates that there is a good chance the Bill will be passed, which I welcome.</p>  <p>  In 2013, at the launch of the Right2Water campaign, we heard contributions from invited speakers from France and Germany who were members of citizens' movements which at the time, in Germany, were struggling to invoke the re-municipalisation of water services in Hamburg and Munich and, in France, had achieved it in Paris.  Control not only of the provision of water services but also the management and supply of water is a fundamental issue because, as has been said many times, one can live without food for many days but not without water for very long.  Water is central to life.  More than 90% of every living organism is made up of water.  Water is hugely impacted on by climate change and the industrialisation so-called civilisation has been wreaking on the planet.  This is an issue that should be addressed in the context of a wider approach to how we deal with our natural resources.  </p>  <p>  This attempt to stop water services from being privatised is crucial.  We all know what happened when other countries privatised water services, including in Britain.  When Margaret Thatcher privatised the supply of water in the 1980s, there were outbreaks of serious illnesses across Yorkshire and on the outskirts of London.  Following the privatisation by South Africa of its water services, TB was rampant.  While there have been outbreaks of cryptosporidium here and other poisons have been found in the water supply, it is clear that such outbreaks become a much greater and intractable problem when services are in private hands.</p>  <p>  While I do not wish to open old wounds, I would like to focus a little on the make-up of the commission on water charges.  The commission comprises many prominent individuals from private water companies in different parts of the world, including Mr. Bill Emery, director of Ofwat, which is presiding over a privatised water system.  It is a real tragedy and a shame that there is not one representative of the Right2Water movement in the commission, a movement which brought out hundreds of thousands of people many times to march, protest and organise at a local level against water charges and the privatisation of Irish Water, a movement that has seen the vast majority of the population engage in what is probably the biggest boycott since the insertion of the word  "landlord" into the English language in the 18th century.  It is a shame that the Right2Water movement is not represented properly in the commission.  </p>  <p>  This legislation is only the beginning.  We have a way to go because, following the passage of the Bill, a referendum will have to be held.  This is the continuation of the ongoing fight to retain public services in public ownership.  Far from it being the end of the story, it may only be the beginning.  We do not want water services to be in the hands of global vulture corporations.  They belong to the people.  We hope the model to be brought forward will spread throughout the globe and be adopted by other societies.</p></speech>

We heard it said last year in the D&aacute;il and the year before when the issue of water charges was being debated that nobody in this House had ever intended to privatise or supported the idea of privatisation of water services.  It is clear that the intention of Fianna F&aacute;il and the troika, carried on by Fine Gael and the Labour Party, was to privatise Irish Water.  We first saw the installation of meters, at a cost of hundreds of millions of euro, to charge for water usage.  This was followed by the introduction of charges, which is always a precursor to the sale of any commodity, and the establishment of Irish Water, with its bonuses, directors, CEOs and so on.  What else was it but a model for privatisation?</p>  <p>  The previous Government would not agree to what is being proposed in the Bill.  The furthest it went was to agree to holding a plebiscite which would not have the same scope as a referendum.  Any Government or entity that believes in privatised health care would privatise water services.  A Government that believes people should pay to be well would have no qualms about charging for water.</p><p> We support the Bill because of there is a bigger picture.  This Bill would not stop water charges being reintroduced or remaining because one could still charge for water within the framework of a public water company.  Some countries have that.  Indeed, there were some trade union leaders who supported water charges and favoured the likes of this Bill.  In fact, we were told on the radio today that Mr. Jack O'Connor led a revolution for this Bill.  Mr. O'Connor was completely out of the movement against the water charges.  Some of them introduced this to distract from the central issue of water being charged for.  Water charges have been sunk for only one reason and that is the non-payment and protest movement against them two years ago.  It was a protest movement on a local scale and a national basis.  The ongoing advocacy of non-payment was critical to making the charging of water unviable.  One cannot privatise something that is not paying for itself.  Financially and politically, the charges were made unviable by that very important call from some people within the anti-water charges movement.</p> <p> It is funny that Fianna F&aacute;il is willing to support this Bill but was unwilling to support a motion that would abolish water charges.  I wonder why.  This is the most basic issue they must be seen by their voters to support.  I say to Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael, the Labour Party and the Independents who support water charges that they will try to reintroduce them at their peril.  Good luck with it if they do.</p></speech>

The Labour Party supports fully the retention of water services in public ownership and is absolutely opposed to the privatisation of the public water service.  The Minister has said that in the last Government we put forward two Bills, one in 2013 and one in 2014, to ensure that a plebiscite would be required for any Government in future to privatise the service.  That was strong legislation, but clearly there is still a distrust.  A couple of people who have spoken already have talked about the distrust of Governments and politics.  We have seen plenty of that in the last couple of days in the American election and, indeed, in Britain as well in regard to Brexit.  We recognise that there is a doubt in the public mind that the water infrastructure will be kept in public ownership.</p>  <p>  The Minister referred to the fact that there have been three pieces of legislation already on this, but the Labour Party has proposed a Bill through my colleague, Deputy Willie Penrose, which goes beyond water to cover the electricity and gas transmission and distribution networks as well as the public water supply and waste water treatment services.  The Bill provides that all those services shall be maintained in public ownership.  We published the Bill some time ago.  We believe that the provision must extend to other networks, including gas and electricity because we saw the Eircom debacle, which was a lesson to all of us that we need to ensure that we protect our public infrastructure with regard to vital services.  We have some concerns about the Bill before the House, one of which is that waste water treatment services are not specifically referred to in the Bill.  Having said that, we absolutely support the spirit of the proposal and welcome the fact that it will go to pre-legislative scrutiny and that there is an offer of the services of the Department in terms of addressing the issues that may arise in terms of having an appropriate Bill to put before the people in a constitutional referendum.</p>  <p>  In the last few days, Irish Water has put out a proposal on the Dublin water supply.  More than half of those who have spoken in the Chamber on this debate live in the Dublin area.  One of the reasons for setting up a central utility for water, which the Labour Party supports because the service is so important, was to deal with leakage but also the fact that the greater Dublin area is going to run out of water.  It has less than 2% spare capacity whereas any capital city ought to have 10% to 15% spare capacity.  I strike one note of caution although I note the matter will go to public consultation.  There is real concern in the mid-west at how removing water at the Parteen basin from the Shannon River and its tributaries and lakes might affect the environment in the mid-west in particular but also further north.  Those concerns must be taken on board in terms of the consultation.  While there is a real concern and need to do something about the Dublin water supply, if this proposal is implemented, any decision to release water and store it for Dublin should be made in the mid-west region and not in Dublin.  In other words, Dublin should not be able to take water whenever it wants it.  It should be released whenever there is an excess capacity within the Shannon and its tributaries and lakes.  I wanted to put that on the record because I have not heard anybody talk about it in the context of the debate.</p></speech>

It would have put a lot of things into perspective.  Billions of euro have been spent putting the infrastructure into the ground.  Having said that, I still claim that we need one authority over water for the simple reason that multiple authorities have not worked down through the years.  It is not popular to say, but I have seen in my area that problems and upgrades are addressed much more quickly than they ever were before.</p>  <p>  People must remember that we can talk about water as long as we want, but at the end of the day the regulations relating to water are growing in number.  Various regulations are coming out from Europe and they are harder to meet and result in higher costs.  It comes from the sky and goes into a lake or river but when one has to treat it, it costs money.  The one thing I do not condone is wasting water.  In this whole debate on water, the group water schemes throughout the country have been completely forgotten.  If something is being done on water, those people must be protected.  They do this on a completely voluntary basis in those areas nationally where people pay for a certain amount of their water.  Local people in local communities do a great deal of work but their money was cut.  The subvention needs to be restored and the infrastructure must be protected.</p>  <p>  Taking water from the River Shannon is being mooted.  As with wind, gas or electricity generation, there is no problem providing water for every part of the country.  It is not something we are putting our hands around and minding.  However, investment should be made in return in those areas from which resources are being taken.  Let the following be clear to every politician in the House, given the projected cost if bringing water to Dublin of &euro;600 million to &euro;700 million.  Given the amount of infrastructure needed around the country, whether it is within budgets or in a charge, we must face the fact that &euro;3 billion to &euro;4 billion must be invested in our water infrastructure over the next number of years.  Politicians need to address that situation and get real about it.</p></speech>

I fully agree with these sentiments in the Bill and believe they should be added to the Constitution.  Water is critical for all life, and clean, accessible and readily available water is essential for any modern society.  It should not be a commodity which is for sale on the open market.  That does not mean that clean and freely accessible water should be taken for granted.  Water requirements for our people now and into the future need to be respected, appreciated and protected by the Government.</p> <p> Retaining water services in public ownership is essential and the Bill will guarantee this, should it or another Bill be successfully incorporated into our Constitution.  Water is an essential resource and, luckily, it is freely available in Ireland.  It should be metered and its usage measured.  A generous volume should be provided free of charge, but excessive use should have a cost.  This will encourage conservation and realistic use of our water.</p> <p> Care must be taken to ensure that public ownership of water is placed in our Constitution in a clear, unambiguous and comprehensive manner.  We need to be sure that whatever is inserted into our Constitution does what is intended to do.  The debate on Irish Water has been heated and, for many reasons, often confrontational over the past nine months.  By ensuring that water in Ireland is constitutionally protected from privatisation we will take some of the confrontation out of future debates, which is to be welcomed.  It is only through calm, rational debate that the best outcome for our water management structures will be reached.</p></speech>

I compliment Deputy Collins on bringing it forward.  I wish to declare an interest.  Part of a business in which I am involved does some work for Irish Water.</p>  <p>  In 2013 I introduced a Private Members' Bill, the Water Services (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill to amend the Water Services Act 2013.  It sought to make provision for Irish Water to be fully subject to freedom of information legislation, which it is not but must be.  It also sought the creation of a dedicated independent ombudsperson to resolve the disputes, which are many and varied, relating to Irish Water.  Such a change must be made.  The most important aspect of the Bill was to make provision for Irish Water to be a fully public owned entity which would be prohibited from entering into a public private partnership.  We know where such an approach has led us in many cases.  While I support such initiatives for road building or whatever, I do not support them for such a valuable resource and asset as water.  I would still like to see those objectives achieved and that is why I will support the Bill.</p>  <p>  Our water supply must be protected with the firmest possible guarantees.  A constitutional amendment to protect the water supply is best suited to achieving this goal.  I opposed, with all my might, the construct of Irish Water developed by the former Ministers Phil Hogan and Deputy Alan Kelly.  An entity should look after water, but Irish Water was too big and the process was too rushed.  The wrong people were appointed to the board and they lacked expertise.  Why were people involved in group water schemes not included?  The volunteers about which Deputy Fitzmaurice spoke should have been included.  When I was in school I saw people digging with shovels and machines, laying pipes, finding sources and maintaining water services, something which continues to this day.  Such people have been lost in the debate.  Farmers and householders have problems with wells being polluted.  Who will support them?</p>  <p>  I am disappointed there is no reference to health in the Bill.  Each person should be entitled to a certain amount of water per day for sanitation and human consumption for free.  In order to avoid waste any water consumed above that level should be metered and charged for.  That system makes sense to everyone.</p>  <p>  There are people in the country who do not have water.  As a buachaill &oacute;g I remember drawing water with a horse and cart.  I am not, as someone described me here some time ago, a Neanderthal.  I am 58 years of age and drew water from rivers to cattle with a horse and cart, buckets, barrels and everything else.  It was hard work.  It is a wonderful resource to be able to turn on a tap and have a water supply available.</p>  <p>  Councils have been dismissed as if they never did anything.  They had water sources, treatment plants and good caretakers to look after the major task of providing water.  One could ring them when there was a break in service.  People contacted us and we were able to get it sorted.  Now we have a monstrosity that is not fit for purpose.  It is a case of jobs for the boys and is bungling from one issue to another.</p>  <p>  There will be a battle in Tipperary, Offaly and other places to take water from the Shannon to Dublin.  Water is required for Dublin, but it should get its house in order and fix the 40% or 50% of water that is wasted underground through leaks.  That is reprehensible and unacceptable.  Why would a decision be made to plough up the middle of the country and destroy perfectly good farms near houses through the use of blunt instruments such as compulsory purchase orders in order to lay pipes?  I have no problem with infrastructure being provided, but I have a problem with water being taken to places that will not stop wasting it.  The same applies to all houses.</p>  <p>  It cost &euro;590 million to fit meters.  They are wasted underground and will never be used.  People should be encouraged to fit meters in their houses near electricity meters or somewhere they can be read in order to assess the level of water they are using and whether they have leaks.  There should be a carrot-and-stick approach to encourage people not to waste water.  It is a valuable resource - I will not call it a commodity because it is not.  We are entitled to water, but it is not an infinite resource.  It has to be collected, treated and pumped using pressure, and services must be provided and maintained.  There must be some encouragement to stop people wasting water.</p>  <p>  A former water caretaker in Fethard, County Tipperary calls me on a weekly basis.  People are abusing him because a leak has been happening on his private property since last Christmas and we cannot get Irish Water to fix it, at a time when we are talking about encouraging water conservation.  Thousands of gallons are being lost through leaks every week.  Irish Water has such high levels of bureaucracy that one cannot get anybody to fix leaks.  Householders are not home and waste is going on in front of people's eyes, beside a shop.  They see the waste on a daily basis, while at the same time we are trying to encourage them to save water and mind a valuable resource.  The system is farcical in the extreme.  Irish Water needs a lot of housekeeping and reorganisation.</p>  <p>  As I said, we need a lot of soul searching and respect for landowners and householders in Tipperary, Offaly and other counties through which a pipeline will be laid.  We need the issue to be dealt with sensitively and not to have the bullying approach of Irish Water.  We had such an approach from the former Ministers Phil Hogan and Deputy Alan Kelly.  I accept the Minister and his colleague are sensible and understanding and hope they will accept the Bill and enshrine in legislation that Irish Water can never be privatised.</p></speech>

I have said repeatedly in the House that this is not just about water.  There are many reasons for the unrest.  One of the major issues was the view that there was a group of people that appeared to be a golden circle and benefitted from the hardship imposed on ordinary citizens.</p>  <p>  At the heart of that view was a mistrust of the Government.  For example, there are still unanswered questions about the water meters contract.  The ongoing Cregan investigation into Siteserv is a case in point.  We have only recently learned that there will not be an interim report and the earliest report we will receive is the final report in December next year.</p>  <p>  The fear that some very powerful individuals may be waiting in the long grass for the opportunity to gain control of any entity responsible for water in this country is very real.  People have feared that from the word go.  I am sure we can recall the Irish Water marketing strategy and a certain individual who constantly referred to us as customers.  Essentially, people felt they were being turned from citizens into customers and an entitlement or right was being turned into a commodity.</p>  <p>  A fudge is not enough.  People need to know that their water supply, that most fundamental of requirements, will not at any stage in the future find its way into the hands of a golden circle which is privy to comfortable deals and inside tracks.  Reassuring people that water will forever more remain in public ownership is a demand that the Government cannot and should not ignore.</p>  <p>  I note the Bill is not being opposed.</p><p>However, we need to have a clear commitment that this will not end up buried in a committee and that there will be a referendum.  People will be very angry if this is a way of massaging the situation and moving it into a space where the Government does not have to deal with it.  That is critically important.</p></speech>

The Bill is the result of people power.  It shows that when we stand together we can and will be successful.  I thank everyone who marched and mobilised as well as those who put pressure on their local Deputies, those who opposed Irish Water meter installers in their towns and villages and those who refused to pay the unfair double taxation that were water charges.  We would not have got this far without them.  I have a word of caution, however.  We must be wary of any attempt by the main political parties - Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il and indeed the Labour Party - to amend the wording of this Bill or to water it down or to long-finger the Bill and put off the referendum.  This legislation is crucially important.  It will maintain water in public ownership and prevent privatisation.  There remain two vitally important issues that we need not to lose sight of and must work on: the abolition of domestic water charges for good and the abolition of Irish Water.  People power and the Right2Water campaigners throughout the country will be successful on these issues as well.</p></speech>

This is a fundamental issue for our future.  Water is a precious natural resource and we must look after it.  We have a responsibility to use it wisely.  A fundamentally important aspect to the necessary new approach to the management of the resource is to have it stated in our Constitution that it is our water supply and that it is not a commercial product and never can be.  I commend Deputy Collins for proposing the Bill and am glad that other parties are signing up to it.  The initial Right2Water campaign across Europe centred on the issue of who owns our public water supply and how it is viewed.  Is it to be viewed as a basic right or as a commercial product?  We see it as a basic right.  People should get a basic allowance for free to meet their everyday needs.  Water should be measured and its use monitored and there should be a charge for wasteful use.  This has to start from first principles and there should be a referendum guaranteeing public ownership of water.  This is an important first step.  I look forward to the referendum.  The debate we will have at that time may help us come to terms with the issue of water.  We would be taking responsibility for it and putting it into our Constitution that it is our resource to use as we see fit.</p></speech>

It is welcome that it is not being opposed and that it is being supported by Fianna F&aacute;il.  I think there is cross-party agreement that the water system should remain in public ownership and that it is a strategic asset.  The argument put forward by the last Government when many of us pushed for this was that it would never privatise the water system.  I agree.  I do not think the current Government would privatise it.  However, as the events of last night show, sometimes we do not know who will be running a country.  Unexpected people may end up running countries and they may have very different views to those of the current Government.  It is not just a matter of trusting the current Government.</p>  <p>  Ideally, we would not use the Constitution for this sort of specific issue.  For example, the ESB is not protected in the Constitution.  However, water has a unique position as a result of the level of public opposition to the charges and the genuine fear of privatisation as well as foreign meddling in domestic affairs.  The then president of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, wrote to the late Brian Lenihan in the context of Ireland's bailout and stipulated that there was to be two structural reforms.  One was that we would charge for domestic water use.  It is extraordinary that any central banker would do that, but it is telling of the foreign meddling in Ireland's water supply and how we govern and pay for it.  In this case, therefore, we need fully, permanently and totally to protect the public ownership of the Irish water system via an amendment to the Constitution.</p></speech>

I warmly congratulate Deputy Collins on her great perseverance and determination in bringing forward the Bill to ensure that the national water supply and infrastructure will remain forever, as the amendment would provide, in public ownership and management.  Deputy Collins was a leading candidate who stood on the Right2Change platform in the February general election.  A key commitment of that platform, supported outstandingly by the Mandate and Unite trade unions, was to abolish water taxes and ensure through a referendum that our water services infrastructure remains always in the ownership of the Irish people.  I am proud to stand beside Deputy Collins on the Right2Change programme and am delighted that her Bill to amend the Constitution will, hopefully, be accepted by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann this week.</p><p>As a Right2Change elected representative, I have always strongly opposed water taxes and charges.  I have supported the Right2Water campaign since it sprung from our communities.  The people-powered Right2Water campaign against water charges and taxes is powerfully based in my constituency of Dublin Bay North.  Valiant campaign groups throughout Dublin Bay North, such as Ayrfield Says No, Edenmore Says No, Clare Hall Says No and Raheny, Darndale and Coolock Say No, led the struggle against metering and the refusal to accept water taxes on already hard-pressed households.  Hopefully, the final abolition of those taxes will be given a huge boost by the adoption here today of the Thirty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Water in Public Ownership) (No. 2) Bill 2016.</p><p>Many of us here, including some so-called Independent members of Government, were elected by the people on an anti-water charges platform.  I have never heard any of our 158 Deputies express a desire to privatise water though many have been complicit by setting up the structures, in particular Irish Water itself, and allowing it to become more possible via the establishment of that national company and the installation of meters.</p><p>I am aware that the expert commission on domestic public water services is said to be currently examining the future funding models for water provision and the commission is due to present to the special Oireachtas committee by the end of this month.  However, the work of the commission is only another exercise in kicking the can down the road, which is so typical of this minority Government.  Its terms of reference are restrictive and unclear.  In reality, it is another device to frustrate the will of the people so clearly expressed in the general election, which is that they want water taxes on households abolished and our water services infrastructure retained forever in public ownership.</p><p>Deputy Collins&rsquo; Bill amending article 28 of the Constitution is a simple yet important Bill.  The Bill would allow us to put the question to the people via a referendum on whether or not they want to protect and maintain our national water supply infrastructure, a vital natural resource, in public ownership and management and whether or not they want us to ensure that future generations will not have to worry about water being turned into a commodity and privatised.  There seems absolutely no reason for any Member of the House to vote against such a modest yet critical proposal.  The electorate will overwhelmingly vote in favour of keeping water in public ownership once this Bill progresses through the Oireachtas and we have the referendum.  Even the small number of those who were not opposed to water charges would be opposed to the possibility of our water becoming a commodity and a cost for households.  A poll earlier this week by <i>journal.ie</i>showed how profoundly opposed the Irish people are to any privatisation of our public water system.</p><p>Privatisation of water services in many countries has been a total disaster.  The Thatcher era saw water being privatised in the UK in 1989, a move that has produced ongoing problems and controversy.  When such a vital resource is commodified, it leads to cut-offs for non-payment, a practice the English had to bring to an end with the introduction of legislation in the 1990s, as well as increasing prices and tariffs and massively growing profits.  In the UK, water charges increased nearly 50% in real terms in the first decade of privatisation.</p><p>In the same period, the operating profits of companies such as Anglia Water, which did some work for Dublin City Council and other local authorities, and Scottish Water increased by nearly 150%.  Above all, investment suffered following privatisation.  The so-called water regulator in Britain, OFWAT, has been severely criticised, especially for allowing the United Kingdom's sewer network to be run down without investment in refurbishment.  As <i>The Guardian</i>newspaper reported last year, there has been a strong kickback against privatisation of water, not only in OECD countries but across the world from Buenos Aires to Berlin.<br/><br/>Since the disastrous privatisation of water in other jurisdictions includes public private partnerships, management and lease contracts, it is important that Deputy Joan Collins's constitutional amendment includes a reference to &quot;the protection, management and maintenance of the public water system&quot; and that all of these elements of the national water system remain in public ownership and public management.<br/><br/>I commend my colleague, Deputy Joan Collins, on bringing this important Bill before the House.  I am pleased to support it and welcome that it is unlikely to be opposed by the Government or Fianna F&aacute;il Party.  I urge the Government to ensure it passes as soon as possible.</p></speech>

I am delighted to have an opportunity to contribute to this debate.  I pay tribute to my colleague, Deputy Joan Collins, whom I am proud to sit beside.  The Deputy has pushed legislation and brought it before the D&aacute;il, and she appears to have secured cross-party support for it.  I note, however, that when I expressed delight some weeks ago about the passing of Second Stage of legislation on fracking, I was accused by some of being innocent on the basis that the Bill would be buried.  We will not allow the anti-fracking Bill or this constitutional amendment Bill to be buried.</p>  <p>  We all lived through the recent general election when the three main issues raised were housing, health and water.  As I have stated repeatedly in the Chamber, I am tired of people on the right accusing those of us who offer a different vision and different approaches of being negative.  I have never been negative and have put forward positive solutions, as Deputy Joan Collins has done in this Bill.  The Deputy is responding to the movement on the ground which begged us to lead and show a way forward.  That movement was not negative either, although it has been described as being against water charges and so forth.  My experience of people on the ground is that they are begging the Government to lead and create a society in which they can participate.</p>  <p>  If anything is to be learned from last night's presidential election in the United States, it is the utter failure of the Democratic Party to analyse the reasons people were turning against the system in their millions and towards a man who should not have been supported.  The message that came across during the recent general election here was that the Government was completely out of touch with people on the ground.  Members of the public asked us to provide services in return for their taxes. </p>  <p>  The Government takes a patronising attitude that people need to be punished if they are to conserve water.  I have cited previously a pilot project in Galway which demonstrated that people did not need to be punished to encourage recycling.  Those involved in the project recycled up to 70% of waste and diverted 56% on a weekly basis from landfill.  They did so without any sanctions or reward but simply because they wanted to participate in recycling for the good of the environment.  Similarly, most people I know want to conserve water.  The Government cynically provided and subsequently withdrew a &euro;100 conservation grant.  I have asked what measures the D&aacute;il has taken to show leadership on water conservation.  For example, what positive programme has been rolled out to tap into the people's energy and desire to conserve water? </p>  <p>  I live in Galway city and for 17 years as a local councillor, I observed the water system being starved of funds.  Despite a 40% leakage rate, funding was not provided to address the problem.  I do not, therefore, subscribe to the mantra that we did nothing because we repeatedly asked for funding to deal with problems locally and it was repeatedly refused.</p>  <p>  Throughout this debate, people have feared that water services would be privatised.  We heard weasel words from the Government and politicians that water would not be privatised.  We are calling the Government's bluff by asking it to support the Bill.  It has indicated it will do so but this support must extend to ensuring the passage of all Stages of this simple Bill to amend the Constitution in order that water remains in public ownership.</p>  <p>  In 2010, the United Nations declared water a human right.  It seems that we often know the price of everything and the value of nothing, as was evident in the absence of proper debate on water and water conservation.  I proudly support the Bill.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-11-09a.340" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1264" speakername="Damien English" time="18:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016110900044#SS00300"><p>I thank speakers from all sides who participated in this debate.  This has been a positive, passionate and engaging discussion on an important issue.</p>  <p>  I reiterate the point made by the Minister that we do not doubt the sincerity of Opposition Deputies, including Deputy Joan Collins, in seeking a constitutional amendment to protect public ownership of the public water system.  While the Government is not opposing the Bill at this Stage, due to the complexities of the issue and proposed wording of the amendment, I stress again the need for careful consideration of its contents following this debate.  The Minister outlined some of the complexities involved in amending the Constitution to recognise public ownership of the public water system.  We do not typically enshrine policies on infrastructure and State bodies below the fundamental pillars of the State, namely, the Executive, Judiciary and Oireachtas, in the Constitution.  To do so would be novel and we must, therefore, tread carefully in respect of any proposal to hold a referendum. </p>  <p>  The legislative provisions currently in place ensure public ownership of the national water system into the future.  I am not aware of any political party or Member of either House who does not want public ownership of the water system to be maintained.  As I indicated previously, the Government remains open to considering any workable proposals which could further reassure members of the public that our approach to the public ownership of Irish Water and its assets will not be changed.</p>  <p>  As I stated, I accept Deputy Joan Collins's sincerity in introducing the Bill.  Having listened to Deputy Stephen Donnelly and others both inside and outside the D&aacute;il, however, it appears they do not realise that legislation is in place to prevent any Government from privatising Irish Water.  Deputy Collins is aware of this because she has done her homework on this issue but other Deputies do not seen to realise that legislation is already in place. </p>  <p>  Deputy Donnelly referred to the United States presidential election and the possibility of a Government being elected which no one had foreseen.  If a Government landed out of the sky tonight, it could not privatise Irish Water without consulting citizens in a plebiscite because this is provided for in legislation.  While most of the Deputies present are aware of this, I am surprised Deputy Donnelly and many other Deputies are not aware of it because it is clearly stated in law.  It is for this reason that the Government has indicated it is not sure whether the Bill is necessary.   </p>  <p>  Water issues remain contentious and highly political.  While I accept the sincerity of the views expressed by Opposition Deputies and understand that public concerns persist about the future ownership of water infrastructure, it should not be lost on the House that the Opposition has invested more effort in a proposal to protect ownership of the public water system than it has on proposals to improve the public water system and water services for citizens. </p>  <p>  Deputy Catherine Connolly referred to a waste recycling project in Galway city and made a number of good suggestions in that regard.  However, apart from a great deal of discussion and aggro, Deputies have made few proposals on water conservation.</p>  <p>  The Government produced an ambitious strategy - perhaps it was over-ambitious in the context of the timescale involved - to establish a single national utility to achieve a national approach to water services delivery and infrastructure provision.  We established economic regulation of the utility with the result that Irish Water's expenditure and budgets are being independently scrutinised and efficiencies and improvements achieved.  This strategy has produced a funding model designed to end the old approach of providing extra investment in good times and inadequate funding during less favourable times.  We need a funding model that provides continuous, increased and sustainable funding of the public water system to put an end to the unacceptably high leakage levels.  At present, 47% of all water produced lost in leaks, nearly 40,000 people were subject to boil-water notices last year, 45 urban areas have raw sewage discharged straight into water bodies and some 830,000 people are dependent on some 115 water supplies that are in need of remedial action.</p><p>Yet the Government has received little support from across the House in addressing these issues through putting the national utility in place, implementing a regulatory framework that ensures service improvements and efficiencies, introducing a legislative framework that provides for the long-term infrastructural service delivery planning and devising a financial model in which there is direct link between use and funding of a service.</p> <p> We do hear, however, complaints about Irish Water, along with wild statements about the metering programme and Irish water operations.  I have listened to endless condemnation of water charges.  The catch-all statement of providing more investment through direct taxation has never been matched with any detail about how this is to be achieved.  In the Seanad, I have asked for views on Irish Water&rsquo;s 25-year strategic plan, its business plan to 2021 or its capital investment programme.  I have asked repeatedly for Members in both Houses to read those plans and to give us their thoughts on them.  However, I never get them.  I heard speeches again tonight from Members who do not realise what the law states about the ownership of the utility.  For the months ahead, will Members take time to read some of these plans and examine the results of Irish Water?  It is fine if they do not agree with them but we should tease them out.  Not reading them does not help debate in this House.</p></speech>

Did it hear praise for its improvements to water supplies which posed contamination risk for 220,000 people?  Was there any mention of the 48.5 million litres of water, the equivalent to the daily water needs of 450,000 homes, saved through Irish Water's first-fix repair scheme by the end of the first quarter of this year?  This is usually met by silence by those decrying the high level of leakage in the system.  Neither do I recall much endorsement of Irish Water's work in trying to reduce exposure to lead in drinking water pipes, including its work on informing 34,000 households of likely lead piping in their homes.</p>  <p>  After the commission publishes its report this month, it will go to committee.  When it returns to the House in the spring, can we debate the facts?  I have no problem with genuine opposition.  However, facts are facts.  Can we recognise where there have been some improvements?  The full information must be entered into the debate, not just this aggro, total opposition and blindness to some of the good results achieved by Irish Water over the past several years.  All I am asking for is a fair and logical debate over the months ahead.</p></speech>

It is important we keep separate the single issue of the ownership of water from the wider water charges debate.  There are concerns about the ownership of water.  The 1916 Proclamation declared "the right of the people of Ireland to the ownership of Ireland and to the unfettered control of Irish destinies, to be sovereign and indefeasible".  To me, that says our resources are owned by the people for the people.  Equally, the Democratic Programme, passed by the First D&aacute;il, stated "sovereignty extends not only to all men and women of the Nation, but to all its material possessions, the Nation's soil and all its resources".  In other words, the sovereignty of the people extends over the natural resources of the country, which also includes water.</p>  <p>  We know there are many problems relating to water such as boil water notices, leaks, poor pipe network, problems with sewage, insufficient supply at times, not to mention the overabundance we saw last winter.  These are part of the bigger debate with charges.  This is a simple Bill on ownership.  Ownership of resources, like water, is part of the wider agenda on economic, social, cultural rights.  The Constitutional Convention, of which I was a member, voted in favour of holding a referendum on the strengthening of economic, social and cultural rights, which includes water.</p>  <p>  Many international commentators are astonished the privatisation aspect has had so little debate here.  There are examples of disastrous consequences on communities abroad where water was privatised.  In Britain, more than one in five live in water poverty, as a result of the British selling off their water supply in the 1980s.  A report from the Transnational Institute research unit reported many countries and cities have remunicipalised their water systems over the past ten years.  It stated problems of private water management, from lack of infrastructure investments to tariff hikes to environmental hazards, have persuaded municipal authorities to go back to public ownership.  It pointed out that co-operation between public services has been the most efficient way of improving water services and promoting the human right to water.</p>  <p>  This Bill&rsquo;s narrow remit is simple and straightforward.  I accept there are issues regarding ownership relating to group water schemes and for farms and families who have their own water supplies.  These can all be debated on Committee Stage.  It is positive the Bill will go to Committee Stage.</p>  <p>  T&aacute; s&eacute; t&aacute;bhachtach anois taca&iacute;ocht a thabhairt don phrionsabal go mbeidh an Rialtas go l&eacute;ir freagrach as an gc&oacute;ras uisce poibl&iacute; agus go bhfanfaidh an acmhainn seo faoi &uacute;in&eacute;ireacht phoibl&iacute; agus faoi bhainist&iacute;ocht phoibl&iacute;.</p>  <p>  Privatisation just does not work.  It means corporate profits at the expense of people.  It means raised prices, denial of access to water to those who cannot pay and reductions in the workforce.  There are countries where privatisation has not worked.  Since the millennium development goals were announced, 768 million people still lack access to clean drinking water, 2.5 billion people are without safe sanitation and 3.5 million people die annually from water-related diseases.  The contributing factor to this has been privatisation and not leaving water in public ownership.  I acknowledge the work Irish Aid does with its water programmes which are in the control of communities.</p>  <p>  The test is are we committed to keeping water in public ownership.  I do not believe legislation is enough on its own.  Governments and legislation can change.  We need to look at a constitutional aspect of the right to water.  I acknowledge the work Deputy Joan Collins has done in keeping this issue alive and in bringing this Bill to the House today.</p></speech>

It is an important Bill which has been reflected by the Minister offering pre-legislative access to it.  I will not put down red lines yet.  However, we need to progress this quickly and not see it buried in the legislative process.  Under the new politics arrangement, ten weeks are given for Committee Stage.  I would like that timeframe to be kept to as close as possible with this Bill.</p>  <p>  Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan made the point that Governments and legislation can come and go.  A Government could be elected at the next election with a huge majority, like the previous one, and change existing water ownership legislation without any recourse to the people or Opposition Deputies.  Multinationals and wealthy people do not come and go.  Instead, they plan for ten, 20 and 30 years down the line about where they want to make their money, where they are going to invest and what governments will allow them open their markets to access public services.  That is their plan and we know that.  None of us are idiots in that respect.  There is a real and crucial need to put public ownership and management of our water supply into our Constitution.  If Ireland had water meters and charges in place when the troika came in, it would have forced us to privatise our water supply, like it has done in Greece and Portugal.  Putting this into our Constitution protects us from this and states we will not accept such a move.</p>  <p>  Then the debate can come out of this because people do not trust this Government or the EU, as reflected in the Brexit vote.  It is down to the whole idea of being told what to do.  People are fearful of this.  We need to protect essential public services.  This is the first step to that.  I would welcome if all Members got stuck into this and developed the best legislation out of it.  Article 28 should be amended to make this and successive Governments responsible for the maintenance of the water supply and vindicate the right of the people to have access to treated water.</p><p>No one has a problem with there being one entity.  That is not the issue; people just do not believe Irish Water will stay in public ownership and they believe it will be privatised.  It is set up to be privatised. </p> <p> I thank the Deputies for their support.  The management part is key.  If any entity is to be set up, the Government must be responsible for overseeing it.  It is really important that it not end up like Aer Lingus, for example.  The Government had a certain share in the airline but this was sold off in the interest of somebody else.  All of a sudden we had no public airline in Dublin. </p> <p> Let me make one point on the pipeline from Shannon.  This issue has been arising for a while.  I do not know how much it will cost.  It could cost millions or billions to bring a pipeline from Shannon to Dublin to serve the greater Dublin region.  I have continuously raised in the D&aacute;il a point that seems to have fallen on deaf ears.  If the money were spent on fixing the 35% of pipes in the ground that are carrying treated water, it would go along way towards sending water to taps rather than into the ground.  If we retrofitted all our homes and businesses to ensure treated water would not be going down our toilet bowls and that rainwater and water from other types of systems would be used, we would save millions of litres of treated water.  These are the issues we must debate.  Rather than taking a resource from the people along the Shannon, the prospect of which inspires fear among them, we should fix the leaks where they happen and retrofit all our homes.  We should use the money to do this rather than to address other aspects.</p> <p> I look forward to Committee and Remaining Stages and to the Bill passing through the Seanad and coming back to the D&aacute;il.  We will have what I propose because people are demanding it.</p></speech>

For a parent working for 40 hours per week on the minimum wage and with one child, his or her pay is increased by &euro;4 per week.  The family income supplement will be cut by &euro;2.40, from &euro;87 to &euro;84.60.  This implies the Minister has done nothing for those families on low incomes who rely very much on this payment.  The Minister, Deputy Varadkar, might let is know whether it is still Fine Gael policy to abolish the family income supplement.  In the general election campaign, it was proposed that the working family payment would replace this.  Is that idea now scrapped?</p><p>We welcome the increase of &euro;5 in the disability allowance and the decision to grant medical cards to all children in receipt of the domiciliary care allowance.  I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, on achieving that.  There was no provision for an increase in the domiciliary care allowance payment, however.  As the Minister of State will know, the cost of living for people with a disability, especially children, is much higher.  That argument is indisputable.</p><p>The universal child benefit has a major impact on poverty in Ireland.  It goes to all parents and is simple to administer.  It is universal in nature.  Like all other child-related payments in this budget, no increase was provided.  I hope the Minister will seek to address this next year.</p><p>An issue the Minister could also address next year is child benefit for those in second level education who have turned 18 and who have not finished their leaving certificate yet.  If there are financial pressures at home, there is a disincentive for teenagers not to remain in secondary education if they turn 18.  There are also major costs associated with the last year of school.  Qualification for child benefit could end after the school year.  Those concerned could be allowed to finish their education.  A gesture like this would make a real difference for many families in meeting school costs. </p><p>With inflation now increasing, the Minister provided no extra money for meeting the costs of parents with school-going children.  Across six payments that help families with young children and directly address child poverty, there was no increase in this budget.  With regard to child benefit, the domiciliary care allowance, the qualified child increase, the back-to-work family dividend, the family income supplement and the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance, the Minister did nothing.  One must ask what this Government has against children. </p><p>There was one measure to help children.  We welcome the extra &euro;5.7 million for school meals but the Minister might outline where that extra funding will be used.  Will schemes already set up in schools be able to expand?  We are told the money will fund meals for 50,000 additional children.  Will it be for breakfasts, snacks or lunches?  I hope the funding will be used to extend the scheme in DEIS schools and to facilitate the provision of breakfast clubs in other schools from September 2017.  As the Minister will know, those schools that do not offer the school meals already have issues with access to canteens and preparation areas.  Has the Minister any plans to ensure all DEIS schools will offer the meals programme?</p><p>It is disappointing for many older people that the increase in the pension will not come into effect until 10 March.  We had to wait a number of weeks to get the date.  The budget did nothing to increase the living-alone allowance or provide an increase to the fuel allowance, with the cost of coal, peat briquettes and many other forms of fuel increasing.</p><p>On the eve of the budget, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross, and his Independent Alliance colleagues were in a last-minute strop seeking the restoration of the bereavement grant.  It looks like he was not able to deliver on that despite generating a lot of heat and headlines in advance of the budget.</p><p>Deputy O'Dea and his party, Fianna F&aacute;il, also generated a lot of headlines in the summer.  That was, of course, until the Minster for Social Protection, Deputy Leo Varadkar, snookered him by implementing Labour's pre-budgetary proposal for increases in all weekly social welfare increases.  I recall Deputy O'Dea calling in August for a lot more than a &euro;5 increase in the old age pension.  He said making changes for lone parents was a priority for Fianna F&aacute;il in the budget.  He might let us know where he now stands on this. </p><p>  I was and am of the view that the changes and reforms affecting lone parents were totally premature in an environment where the child care issue had not been addressed and where job opportunities were limited.  Transport opportunities were certainly curtailed.  The issues pointed out in a recent independent evaluation report need to be addressed without delay.  Outcomes are different from those anticipated.  Let us accept the reality.  If there is an error or mistake, it should be addressed, and we should ensure that anomalies and unintended consequences are addressed without any further delay.</p><p>In the interest of accuracy, I must put on the record that Labour provided a bigger increase for pensioners in 2016 than that provided in the Fianna F&aacute;il-Fine Gael budget.  When one adds up the figures announced in the budget, it is clear that pensioners have been sold a pup.  Taking into account the increase in the Christmas bonus from 25% to 75%, the &euro;2.50 per week increase in the fuel allowance and the weekly &euro;3 increase, Labour in government ensured the average older person benefited by a total increase of &euro;336.10 in 2016.  Let us compare this with 2017.  The 10% bump in the Christmas bonus and a &euro;5 weekly pension increase from 10 March will be worth a total of &euro;240.60 for the average older person.  Fianna F&aacute;il spent a lot of time calling last year's increase an insult.  It should let us know whether it believes the smaller increase this year is also an insult?</p><p>As a spokesperson, I have always focused on widows and widowers.  No budget has done very much for them over the years.  Widows comprise a long-forgotten group in social welfare terms.  They are at increased risk of poverty, and no person wants to find herself in that situation.  In future budgets, the Government in power might consider how the household benefits package and other key supports could be extended to widows under the age of 65.  Very often, they may find they have lost the main breadwinner.  They may have two or three young children and experience a significant loss of income and additional responsibilities at a time of vulnerability.  We should be exploring ways of ensuring the benefits of the household package are available to them at this critical time.  I would like to see this. </p><p>I welcome that the Minister accepted the Labour Party proposal to provide the back-to-education allowance at the full rate to those aged under 26.  I ask him to clarify his intention to continue to address youth unemployment and to implement the youth guarantee. </p><p>Let me turn to JobPath, Seetec and Turas Nua.  The Minister will be aware that the roll-out of JobPath is ongoing and that it is causing significant distress in communities across the country.  I have a number of examples to hand.  I have received many complaints and queries about the impact of JobPath on community employment schemes, as has my colleague and party leader, Deputy Brendan Howlin.  The schemes are taking all the people.  There will be nobody left in community employment in rural areas.  I refer to people want to gain valuable skills and receive training.  I have questions about how Seetec and Turas Nua go about their business.  They are under contract in the Department.  It is time the Minister told them to pull in their horns.  Could the Minister confirm whether it is covered by law that a person who has been referred to JobPath may not apply to participate in a community employment scheme?</p><p>People should have that option.  Turas Nua operates in the south east, including Wexford where my party leader, Deputy Brendan Howlin's office has received numerous complaints about its operation.  We are discussing vulnerable people, but there seems to be a one-size-fits-all approach.  There should be a bespoke option that suits people's skills and attributes.  Compelling them into positions for which they are not suitable knocks them back rather than helping them to advance.  People are being expected to turn up for interviews and jobs, even though they do not have the life or work skills to do what is being asked of them.<br/><br/>A lack of sympathy and compassion is being displayed by those operating this compulsory element of attendance for JobPath opportunities and other job activation measures.  They are not opportunities; rather, people are being forced to accept whatever jobs become available.  Dignity and respect must inform all job activation measures where people are compelled to attend.  It is demoralising and having a different outcome than was heralded.<br/><br/>A number of people have contacted me about the operation of Seetec across the midlands.  I have numerous examples of its <i>modus operandi</i>in my constituency, with which I take issue.  For example, a number of people, particularly women, who are older than 60 but under 62 years of age, the cut-off point, have effectively been notified of the requirement to attend courses that are incompatible with their life skills.  Some are over 61 years of age, have limited education, worked in various jobs as shop assistants and cleaners and are still seeking that type of work.  They are located in remote rural areas with no transport of their own.  One lady only has a bike and is 8 miles from Mullingar, but there is no public transport available.  The people concerned must find a way to attend the courses.  If they do not, their social welfare payments are docked.  This is State-backed bullying and harassment of the worst kind and a stop must be put to it without delay.<br/><br/>Seetec and Turas Nua are results driven.  It is my understanding they are paid on the basis of outcomes, but that should not be the case.  The experience of applicants and their levels of satisfaction with the process should be the basis for any payment.  In my experience, that means the companies would get damn all.  It is time to review the process.  A contract is involved, but these operators do not allow qualified people in their areas, particularly rural areas, to participate in local CE schemes where they acquire on-the-job training, evaluation and practical skills.  Instead, they are prevented from participation in the community employment scheme by regulation or otherwise when selected for JobPath scheme participation.  It is a bureaucratic monster that should be beheaded without delay as this approach is no longer required.  It is wrong and does not accord with the principle of decency or encourage people to embark on schemes that are suited to their life skills and abilities, especially where they are over 60 years of age.  I have no compunction in saying these companies should be told to pull in their horns.<br/><br/>A major issue is the victimisation of women under the social welfare code in terms of their entitlement to a contributory pension.  This arises where a woman's contribution record commenced on the date she entered employment and she had to leave later because of State policy, for example, the marriage bar or other reasons.  She returned to employment 20 or 25 years later, but the calculation of her average contribution has a severe and negative impact because it extends over her entire working life, that is, from the date on which she first entered employment.  This anomaly must be addressed because it is being visited on people unfairly compared to others who entered employment for much shorter periods at later dates.  This problem could be solved by imputing a credit for those who were compulsorily removed from the workforce because of the marriage bar which was State policy and so on.  They are entitled to this change which would increase their average contributions and entitle them to receive a pension at higher rates.  They should not be deprived in this way.  I hope the issue will be addressed sooner rather than later.<br/><br/>When an industry is under pressure, it is important that we try to help it.  This is particularly the case where the pressure is as a consequence of Brexit.  The mushroom industry is under severe pressure.  At one time there were approximately 600 growers, but that number has dropped to approximately 60.  They employ many people in rural areas where job opportunities are limited.  There are a number in my county, but they are being wiped out.  One of the first casualties of the United Kingdom's decision in June on Brexit and the consequential fluctuations in sterling was the mushroom industry.  Four significant farms have gone and more will follow.  More than 90% of farms' mushrooms are exported to Britain.  The Minister of State can see the problem.  It is clear that the impact on the industry is serious and will wipe it out.  It is important that temporary assistance be rendered to this exposed industry to help it get to over this problem and secure its future.  If it gets over it, it will undoubtedly survive.  For example, there could be a temporary reduction in employer's PRSI from 8.5% to 4.2%.  This measure was implemented successfully in 2012 and 2013 for other industries.  We must show some ingenuity if we are to protect jobs, get people over the hump and retain employment at a time when the industry is under pressure.<br/><br/>Regardless of whether we like the idea, the level of pension coverage must be addressed.  The matter has been studied.  For example, the former T&aacute;naiste and Minister, Deputy Joan Burton, initiated a review.  Some 48% or 49% of people have no pension coverage.  This will become a major issue.  When we are young, we do not look ahead to our mid-60s.  It never means much.  When we raised this issue many years ago, organisations that represented employers, in particular IBEC and ISME, were against a mandatory contribution scheme, but in expressing that opposition they did not represent the views of many small employers or employees we met on the ground.  There must be a mandatory scheme.  One has operated in Australia and another is being adopted in the United Kingdom.  It works.  If people want to opt out, fair enough, but otherwise it should be mandatory.  There would be auto-enrolment.  It should not be the case that people who retire experience a significant drop in income because they have no pension entitlements.  People have found themselves in this serious position.<br/><br/>A cross-party group is examining the compulsory age of retirement.  Numerous people have asked me when it will be addressed for those who reach retirement age and want to continue in employment.  It would be done on a voluntary basis.  If people want to continue in employment beyond the mandatory retirement age in the public service and their health allows them to do so, we should give them that option.  If they do not want to avail of it, grand; let them retire at that age, but many people with a great deal of experience are being forced out of the workforce.  Just the other day I read that garda&iacute; were being forced out of the workforce when they had much more to give and wished to do so.  People should have the choice.  We have entered an era in which, if people want to continue, we should allow them to do so.  There should be no regulations to force them to leave.</p></speech>

In some media circles the budget became known as the &quot;fiver budget&quot; because of the &euro;5 per week increase for social welfare recipients.</p><p>The budget is actually misnamed because social welfare recipients will receive less than a fiver. The increase comes into effect on 10 March and when one averages a &euro;5 increase from that date out through an entire calendar year, it comes to less than &euro;4 per week or &euro;3.95 to be precise.  That is some contrast with the proposed increase for Deputies of &euro;104 per week.</p> <p> Last year TV3 broadcast a programme called "D&aacute;il on the Dole" in which three Members of this House, Deputies John Halligan, Catherine Byrne and Willie O'Dea appeared on our television screens for a number of weeks spending time in the company of constituents who were trying to survive on social welfare payments.  If the programme did anything, it showed how difficult it is for people to survive on social welfare payments.  I am sure that in the run-in to a general election, that was very useful public relations for the Deputies concerned but it would seem that not only the Deputies themselves but the parties to which they are connected learned little from the experience.  The parties to which those Deputies are affiliated are the Independent Alliance, Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il.  Rather than transform the lives of people who are trying to survive on social welfare, we have the most meagre of meagre increases.  In our opinion, it is an insult to people trying to survive on social welfare payments.</p> <p> I want to consider the cases of three groups in my contribution this evening, namely lone parents, carers and young unemployed people.  The rules were changed for lone parents last year by the Fine Gael, Labour Party Government.  Lone parents' allowance was only to be paid to lone parents with children up to the age of seven.  Lone parents with children aged between seven and 14 were told that they could qualify for the family income supplement but only if they worked at least 19 hours per week.  This has proved very difficult, if not impossible, for many lone parents because of the challenge of getting children off to and collected from school.  Given the time of school runs, how does one fit that in with a working week of at least 19 hours?  For those lone parents for whom that has simply been impossible, the family income supplement is beyond reach.  These already struggling lone parents have been plunged even deeper into poverty.  </p> <p> Over the course of the last year, many lone parents and their representative organisations have made this poverty trap known to Ministers and Government Deputies.  They have gone to their clinics and told them their stories, met them on the streets and given them information.  They have also phoned into radio programmes and have put their message across in many different ways.  What has the Government chosen to do in this budget?  It has chosen to effectively ignore the information from lone parents and the pleas they have made.  It has kept in place the same unjust system which has pushed so many lone parents even deeper into poverty in the last year.  No doubt Government Ministers will say that there is a child care package which can be of assistance.  However, 0.2% of GDP in this country is spent on child care which is only one quarter of the OECD average of 0.8%.  Someone with two children spends 40% of household income, in many cases, on child care costs which is in sharp contrast to the OECD average of 13%.  Indeed, it is the second highest percentage in the OECD.  The child care package in the budget falls well short of what is needed for lone parents .  The Government then compounds the situation by giving them not a fiver, but &euro;3.95.  It is no surprise that the Single Parents Acting for the Rights of Kids, SPARK, organisation which represents the interest of lone parents and was set up by them has been particularly vocal in lashing this Government and this year's budget.  Indeed, it is well within its rights in doing so.</p> <p> There are 200,000 family carers across the country.  They are, in some respects, Ireland's unseen workforce.  They contribute more than 6 million unpaid hours of care each week and they save the State approximately &euro;4 billion each year.  They too are to receive a fiver or, in reality, &euro;3.95.  One particular statistic shows the real approach of this Government to carers.  The current average waiting time for new carer's allowance applications to be processed and payments to be made is 40 weeks because of cuts and because they are not being dealt with as a priority.  That is a shocking situation.  This Government is not taking care of our carers and I would warn that if it does not do so, those carers will take care of the Government at the next election.  </p> <p> I wish to make a number of points about young unemployed people.  In some ways the greatest insult in this budget is the one meted out to them.  They do not receive &euro;5 per week or &euro;3.95, averaged over the year.  They receive &euro;2.70.  They are cut out from all the other groups; they are a special group who will receive even less.  The Peter McVerry Trust put it well when it said, "this will send a message to young people that Government does not value them".  That is very true and truer again when put in the context of other conditions that young people face and other obstacles that the Government has put in their way.  One in eight young people in this State under the age of 30 are trying to survive on the minimum wage.  In fact, 40% of all persons on the minimum wage in this State are under the age of 30.  </p> <p> The policies of this and the previous Government forced 30,000 people to emigrate last year.</p><p>It was due to the policies of the previous Government, but they have been carried on in large measure by the Government.  The situation of young teachers who started in their profession between 2011 and 2016 and were forced to accept lower pay rates than their colleagues has not been addressed.  Before the Minister of State tells me that there is a 22% increase on offer if the union comes into the Lansdowne Road agreement, the issue has not been addressed.  There would still be two-tier rates.  One cannot have a little equality.  </p> <p> Of course, we face the same situation with the young unemployed.  I have heard the Minister say people do not have to be young to be unemployed and that training and education places will be made available.  Does he not realise a large number of unemployed persons have already been through the education and training system, including the third level system, are highly qualified and now face this Hobson's choice?  It is particularly damning that in recent weeks one after the other homeless agencies have warned the Government that the low rates of social welfare payments available to young people have been an important factor in the rise in the level of youth homelessness.  That is extremely important information.  Perhaps the Government overlooked it in the run-up to introducing the budget, but it seems that was not the case because, despite the information being put in front of it and argued cogently by the homeless organisations through the media and in society, it chose to ignore it.  Despite the fact that low rates of social welfare payments are such an important contributory factor to the rise in the level of youth homelessness, the Government is carrying on regardless and the real insult is that young people will receive an increase of &euro;2.70, while everyone else will receive a fiver or &euro;3.95.  </p> <p> There has been a lot of talk today about the result of the US presidential election.  The rallies organised in football and baseball stadiums earlier this year by a candidate who I think had the potential to defeat Mr. Donald Trump if he had stood as an independent left-wing candidate, Mr. Bernie Sanders, were attended by 10,000, 20,000, 30,000 people or more.  They listened to his message which was sharply critical of Wall Street and a system run by billionaires.  He spoke about the need for ordinary people to fight and challenge that system.  It is very striking and interesting that the biggest cohort at the rallies were what were termed "millennials", people under the age of 30 or 35 years.  They were the biggest supporters of the Sanders campaign, which is an indication that young people and the newer generations who are being given a vision of society in which they will be worse off and have a lower standard of living than their parents are developing attitudes that are critical of the system and capitalism - you reap what you sow.  Policies such as this will politicise young people in this country also.  What happened in the United States where young people flocked to hear the Sanders' message can happen in Ireland with people looking to the left for radical change to challenge the system.</p></speech>

Some sectors of society have been failed in the social welfare system and not been protected, as they should have been.  The examples I will give of the people who are discriminated against the most are of those who did not cause the crisis or benefit from the so-called boom, yet they are the ones who felt the harsh brunt of austerity and are living in poverty.  I will list some figures and discuss in further detail the two groups which have been discriminated against the most.  They are young people and one-parent families.  In 2009 jobseeker's allowance was &euro;204.30.  In 2017 it will be &euro;193 for those aged over 26 years, &euro;102.70 for those aged between 18 and 24 and &euro;147.80 for those aged between 25 and 26.  The minimum loss for a jobseeker is &euro;11, but for those under the age of 25 years, the loss of income is significant.  If someone is aged 25 years, the loss is &euro;56.50, but if they are under 24, it is &euro;101.60.  This mirrors the discrimination for newly qualified teachers or nurses in terms of pay equality.  What we are saying is if that someone finds himself or herself unemployed, he or she will be discriminated against in rates of social welfare payments payable and that if he or she starts a job in the public sector, he or she will face pay inequality.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately, the country does not just discriminate only against young people.  Lone parents and their children have shamefully been let down by the Government.  We cannot tackle the level of child poverty if we do not address the cuts inflicted on one-parent families.  The rates of child poverty among children living in households headed by one parent are a national disgrace and it is important to look at them.  The rate of consistent poverty among children in Ireland is 11.2%.  When we look at this headline rate in detail, we see that the poverty rate among children headed by a lone parent is 22.1%, while in a two-parent household with fewer than four children, it is 7.9%.  If we are to make any attempt to tackle the level of child poverty, we must address the poverty traps and barriers faced by lone parents, but nothing was done in the budget.  When we look at the cuts inflicted on lone parents, it is clear that no other sector of society was hit as hard.  Much has been said about equality proofing, but it was always known that the level of poverty among lone parent families was significantly higher than in the rest of society.  What the previous Government, of which the Minister was a member, did and the Government continues to do is politically proof rather than equality proof budgets.  By this, I mean that it decides what it can cut that may not prove damaging politically to it.  Lone parents were an easy target because the Government could falsely stereotype and stigmatise them under the guise of labour activation measures.  There was no discussion of the fact that at the time 60% of lone parents in receipt of the one-parent family payment were in receipt of a reduced payment as they were in part-time employment or participating in a community employment scheme.  There was also no discussion of the barriers, particularly when it came to child care and other supports needed, faced by them.  The Government portrayed them as a group that needed to be activated.  </p>  <p>  In looking at what has happened to lone parents it is important to list the cuts made.  In 2009 the one-parent family payment was &euro;204.30.  In 2017 it will be &euro;193.  The  qualifying age of children was reduced from 18 years to seven.  In 2009 the child benefit payment for one child was &euro;166.  In 2017 it will be &euro;140.  The back to school allowance payable for a child in primary school was cut from &euro;200 to &euro;100, while the allowance payable for a child in secondary school was cut from &euro;305 to &euro;200.  These are just the headline figures.  The worst measure inflicted on lone parents involved the changes made to payments and entitlements.  Contrary to the mantra that lone parents needed to be activated, it was those already working who suffered a financial loss.  The Minister's claim that 3,000 lone parents are better off because of the changes is false and misleading.  If any lone parent was to increase his or her working hours, of course, his or her income would go up, but what the Minister has failed to address is the fact that if he or she had increased his or her working hours prior to July 2015, the financial gain would have been bigger.</p><p> The Minister also fails to acknowledge the thousands who had a huge reduction in income, and that those already working 19 hours on FIS suffered a loss despite the increase in this budget of the income disregard to &euro;110.  This is &euro;37.50 below what it was prior to the cuts.  It is important to note that the &euro;147.50 it was prior to the cuts had been the same rate since 1997 when it was introduced.  There was never a gravy train for lone parents but a series of failed policies and rather than address them the previous Government, of which the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, was a member, cut them further and brought in policy changes restricting their access to third level education and giving a financial loss to working parents.  I see nothing in this budget that restores any loss to these parents.</p> <p> Prior to the budget the Minister was made aware of problems with maintenance payments.  The transition from the one-parent family payment to job seeker's transition payment did not take into consideration the "liable relative" legislation.  The Department wrote out to thousands of liable relatives to tell them that they had no further obligation to the Department to pay.  Despite this having been brought to the Minister's attention through a petition from lone parents, he has not dealt with it.  Indeed, his response was insensitive to any woman who escaped domestic violence, saying they must prove their abuse.  Local Intreo offices are informing parents if they do not seek maintenance their payment will be cut.</p> <p> It has also been brought to the Minister's attention that deducting 100% of maintenance payments from rent allowance was causing great difficulties for many parents, especially for those where the maintenance is not being paid, or not paid on time from ex-partners.</p> <p> The Minister, like previous Ministers for Social Protection, went for headline changes.  If he was really interested in tackling inequality for our youth or child poverty among lone-parent families, he would have listened to the groups who had been pleading with him to make genuine changes.</p></speech>

They congratulate themselves on an extra fiver in social welfare in the budget.  However, changes in our welfare code across the board are still resulting in inequalities and injustices.  I endorse what my colleagues said about the lone-parent's allowance, the carer's allowance and the discrimination against young people.  I want to talk about another injustice that has fallen under the radar.  I highlight the changes in the system for contributory pensions introduced over recent years.  These changes and scrapping the State transition pension have taken a lot more money from the pockets of our pensioners and old than the amount by which it is proposed to increase their pensions.</p>  <p>  At an overall cost to the State is &euro;170 million, the new rates for contributory pension will be &euro;238 at the top for those under 80 and &euro;248 for those over 80.  The non-contributory pension is &euro;227.  Therefore an entitlement to a State pension at 65 has been removed for thousands of working people because the State transition pension was abolished in 2014.  While I understand the argument made earlier on that people should be allowed to work longer if they so wish, this is a forced situation.  For many workers where the State tells them they are not entitled to benefit until they are 66, their contracts of employment state that they must retire at 65 and for that year they must seek jobseeker's allowance.  Furthermore, the introduction of the new method of calculating how a retiree can qualify for the maximum contributory pension - this is complicated - means a reduction in the level of State pension for many newly retired people compared with what they may have expected.</p>  <p>  The number of bands used to calculate the entitlement has now expanded to six.  The required yearly average contributions have changed such that many will now find their pensions lower than the expectations they had.  Increasing numbers of people are failing to reach the required yearly average contribution to be entitled to any form of a contributory pension.  One band was effectively replaced with three new bands.  The justification for this was to reward those with greater yearly contributions, but it has simply punished those with less.</p>  <p>  For example, before 2012 a person with 20 to 47 average yearly contributions got the second category of contributory pension.  Now a person with 20 average yearly contributions falls into the fourth category and is therefore penalised.  These changes since 2012 mean many of those qualifying for contributory pension, which are still rising because of demographics, are qualifying for reduced pension entitlements.  The differences in payments for old-age pensioners who fall foul of this is considerably more than a fiver a week on which Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Independents are congratulating themselves.</p>  <p>  These changes will save &euro;50 million in 2017, rising by &euro;10 million annually.  The State pension transition payment was abolished saving &euro;137 million.  This money is taken from the pockets of those pensioners affected.  It is shocking.</p>  <p>  Many women now retiring, who may have worked consistently for decades before retiring, find their pension is significantly less than they may have expected.  This is partially explained by the home-making rules and by discrimination against woman who raised their families in the years that were removed before 1994.  While years spent out of the workforce since 1994 for the purpose of raising a family and children can be discounted against the overall number of years that the calculation is based on, for the generation of women who had to leave the workforce before 1994 to raise a family, the years they spent raising their children is not discounted against the overall number of years used when calculating the pension entitlement, in other words the years from when they first entered the workforce to the year they retire.</p>  <p>  This effectively makes it impossible for this cohort of woman to meet the criteria for getting the maximum contributory pension of 48 yearly average contributions or even to get between 30 and 40 for the next bracket in the scheme.  The rates applying to the categories are as follows: the top rate is &euro;233 a week; in the next category for those with between 40 and 47 yearly average contributions it is &euro;228; for those with between 30 and 39 yearly average contributions it is &euro;209 a week; and for those with between 20 and 29 yearly average contributions it is &euro;198.  I know it is complicated.  God help me, I worked for hours trying to get my head around it after many questions to the Department and very helpful officials working with me.</p>  <p>  These women have to work longer to get the contributory pension, often in very difficult and physically demanding jobs.  It is impossible for woman who left for a period of time to raise their children in the late 1960s and 1970s to effectively reach a full contributory pension.  This is the argument here.</p>  <p>  I will mention the cases of two women, Lillian and Jean, who left their jobs in the late 1960s to get married and rear families, as people did in the day.  Through the 1970s and up to the mid-1980s they spent their time as homemakers.  Having worked from the mid-1980s right up until this year - a continuous period of 30, 32 or 33 years, they will now get a State contributory pension of &euro;209 a week rather than the &euro;230 they expected.</p>  <p>  I signal my intention to table an amendment to the Social Welfare Bill to go some way towards correcting the injustice to that cohort of women.  My amendment proposes to make this scheme available to any woman who had to leave the workforce regardless of the years - prior to 1994 and subsequently.  This is a blatant injustice and many pensioners find themselves living on reduced State pensions despite having worked and contributed in full for years.</p>  <p>  I reiterate that the cost to the State of the extra fiver a week is &euro;170, but this is being wiped out by penalising women, such as Jean and Lillian, who worked full-time for more than 30 years from the mid-1980s until 2015 or 2016.  It is not fair and is a kick in the face for those hard-working women, who have now retired and realise that they are not worth their salt to the State.</p></speech>

To delay such necessary changes until December 2017 is unacceptable and the package does not deal with all of the issues raised by the self employed who, as has been repeatedly pointed out in this Chamber, are the backbone of employment in the State.  I also welcome the reversal of cuts to pharmacists, the introduction of the paternity benefit, the partial restoration of the Christmas bonus, among other positive provisions.</p>  <p>  I deplore, however, the utter failure by the Department to do what it should be doing.  One area in which the Department does very well is in combatting fraud, having had the Garda and Revenue on the roads in Galway with regard to tax fraud, although it only consists of a minor fraction of the overall budget of over &euro;19 billion.  One of the main functions of the Department is to advise the Government and formulate appropriate social protection and social inclusion policies.  I believe the Department, the Government and, unfortunately, the Minister have utterly failed to deal with that.  If they had looked at any of the research available they would realise that inequality is deepening and the gap between the rich and the poor - which is repeatedly quoted from this side of the Chamber - is not a clich&eacute;; it is actually happening.  Consider the recent reports from Social Inclusion Ireland, the Think-tank for Action on Social Change, TASC, or the National University Ireland Galway, which I have downloaded and read, with regard to lone parents and the detrimental effect of driving lone parents, 90% of whom are women, into the workforce.  It has actually made them poorer.  The Minister of State did not introduce that measure - unfortunately it was the Labour Party - but he has done nothing to rectify it in this budget.  Notwithstanding one line on page 28 in the annual report from the Department of Social Protection, that income inequality is largely unchanged, the Department has utterly failed to advise the Government on policies that might address that inequality.</p>  <p>  Social transfers keep half of the Irish population out of poverty.  There are 1.6 million people who receive a social welfare payment and when qualified adults and children are included, almost 2.1 million people benefit from the payments.  That amounts to almost half of the Irish population who would be at risk of poverty without social transfer payments from the Department of Social Protection.  They are the figures from the Department.  Further, there is any amount of up-to-date independent research which confirms that we have a most unequal society with the gap continuing to widen.  I ask the Minister of State to look at that.  I am not here to complain or to be negative.  I am here to pressurise the Government to change the policy that would save the taxpayer money in the end.  If we lessen the divide we will have a healthier society and a wealthier society.  TASC's 2016 report Economic Inequality in Ireland has 18 indicators and on each one they show that economic inequality is worsening in Ireland.  They are policy decisions.  The report says "As has been demonstrated internationally [and repeatedly], a rising level of economic inequality such as we are experiencing in Ireland, jeopardises the sustainability of the recovery, both economically and socially".  This is something I can never understand.  For perhaps the third time in the last two weeks I use the word "naive" about myself, but I simply find it difficult to understand how Government cannot understand where different policy decisions will result in a better society for most of us, and therefore save money in the long term.  For example, Ireland has levels of almost 20% functional illiteracy.  This figure has been static for a very long time and yet there are absolutely no measures for it in this Social Welfare Bill.</p>  <p>  One of the most direct measures for helping poverty is to increase the direct child benefit, but there is no increase here whatsoever.  The lone parents, 90% of whom are women are being pushed also.  The whole theme through this budget is absolutely anti-women with regard to the 90% of lone parents who are women, with regard to the gender gap in pensions and with regard to carers.  The Anti-Austerity Alliance, AAA, made reference to carers.  I totally agree with the AAA's concerns around the lack of increase for carers.  The startling figure of over 60% of the current budget for the provision of services for older people goes towards long-term residential care.  While 60% of the budget goes to long-term residential care  only 4% approximately of the population who are aged over 65 live in residential care.  A policy decision has been made to fund one side and the other side, the carers who are saving the State an extraordinary amount of money, do not even get a &euro;1 increase.  These are policy decisions that are happening all the time and I have a real difficulty with them because it would save money in the long term if we did it differently.</p>  <p>  I will now turn to the issue of domestic violence and the figure I have quoted repeatedly - some &euro;2 billion - which is the cost to the economy on an annual basis as a result of our failure to deal with it.  Not only are we failing to deal with it, year after year we have actually reduced the money available to the organisations that specialise in helping people who have been subjected to domestic violence.</p>  <p>  There are many other points I can make but my time is limited so I will mention just one or two other matters, one of which is JobPath.  Deputy Penrose has already spoken about this.  It has also been my experience in Galway that this new JobPath - under Seetec and Turas Nua - is the subject of the most serious concerns.  If one looks at Connemara, where community employment schemes provide essential services in a rural area, people cannot be found for those schemes because they have no choice but to go to the private company Seetec.  I have raised this, as have other Deputies, and we do not get an adequate answer, or we get no answer from the Minister.  I would hope that with the Minister of State's particular interest in the area of disability he might look at this.  We should have learned from JobBridge and we should have learned from how these private companies operate in the UK, but when each Deputy raised this with the Minister he dismissed our concerns, told us that it was going to be done differently in Ireland and yet we have seen absolutely no details in that regard.</p>  <p>  My final point relates to rent and how policy decisions again are costing the taxpayer money.  In Galway city the Intreo building - an extraordinary building that was not built for social welfare - was a property owned by the city council in Galway for the people of Galway.  It was given over for a project that ended up in receivership and rather than the Government getting any social dividend from it, they are now paying over &euro;500,000 per year, year after year, for a rented building in Galway city.  This is only one of the buildings that social welfare, through the Office of Public Works, is renting year after year.  This is an absolute waste of money.  The question must be asked; what social dividend did Galway city or county, or any other city, receive from NAMA as a result of all the banks we bailed out.  As I speak there is a building in Galway, previously used by Anglo Irish Bank, which has remained empty while the city council must rent premises; the library and the social welfare buildings in Galway city are rented.  This is absolute money down the drain that could be going to essential services.</p></speech>

I also welcomed the increase from 75% to 85% in the Christmas bonus payment.  Of course I would like to see the bonus fully restored because I know it is a huge help to social welfare recipients at a very expensive and stressful time of year.</p><p>In my pre-budget submission to the Ministers, Deputies Noonan and Donohoe, I called for a more significant increase for pensioners of at least &euro;7 per week, a further increase in child benefit by at least &euro;5 more per child per month and an increase in family income supplement thresholds by at least &euro;5.</p> <p> I am a member of the Budgetary Oversight Committee of the D&aacute;il and I argued in my pre-budget submission that the estimate of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council and the ESRI of a fiscal space of &euro;1 billion could be significantly expanded.  In addition to ensuring that due levels of corporation and income taxes would be paid to the Exchequer in 2017 through reforms of the Finance Act provisions and greater resources for Revenue, I proposed a number of new revenue raising measures, including the introduction of a wealth tax, an increase in stamp duties on shares until we adopt a financial transactions tax, and I welcome the fact that ten of our EU partner governments are about to proceed with this, and a third rate of income tax for incomes above &euro;100,000.  In the event, the fiscal space was expanded, but only to &euro;1.3 billion.  I recognise that an important portion of this was allocated to the Department of Social Protection.</p> <p> The core aim of any social protection Minister, including the incumbent who is not here this evening, should be at least to restore the pre-crash value of social protection benefits and assistance.  This was a key target of my independent proposals to the Ministers, Deputies Noonan and Donohoe.  Even with the &euro;5 a week increase in sections 6 to 8, inclusive, 18 and 22 of the Bill and a further partial restoration of the Christmas bonus, the total social protection budget in still effectively capped at &euro;20 billion to 2020.  The Minister of State, Deputy McGrath, has obviously agreed to this capping of the social protection budget.  This budget, of course, represents 35% of total State expenditure and includes spending of &euro;19.854 billion this year on our pensioners, citizens with disabilities and other most vulnerable citizens and families.  Social protection expenditure spending is due to rise to &euro;19.9 billion in 2018 and to just over &euro;20 billion in 2019.</p> <p> The most vulnerable citizens in society suffered most in the eight or nine austerity budgets since late 2008, and the very small partial restorations of some payments in 2016 and 2017 do little to restore the economic well being of these citizens and families.  In particular, I believe a higher value must be placed on carers as without them the cost of providing care for our elderly and our citizens with disabilities would increase hugely, although specific figures were not provided to me by the Government.  Through parliamentary questions I asked about the cost of financing care.  The Minister, Deputy Varadkar, did indicate in the reply to a parliamentary question that a &euro;7 a week rise for all State pensioners would cost in the order of &euro;215 million per annum and that a further &euro;5 a week increase for all other categories of social insurance and social assistance was estimated last July to cost about &euro;207 million in a full year.  The very minimal package the Minister and the Minister of State would have needed would have cost at least &euro;422 million, but this was not achieved by the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, or any of his colleagues.  I also asked for increases in child benefit rates by at least &euro;5 a week and for increases in the family income supplement.</p> <p> A crucial element of the social protection budget, of course, is the Social Insurance Fund, now standing at almost &euro;10.855 billion or &euro;8.988 billion net of the total &euro;19.6 billion social protection budget.  I would welcome a response from the Minister of State in his speech to the current standing of the Social Insurance Fund and the extent to which it is in surplus or has moved back into surplus.  The fund has recovered from the devastating deficit at the worst period of the crash after 2008, and I noted in the figures given to us by the Minister on budget day that the net fund shows a 4% increase for 2017.  I also note the social assistance estimate has declined by 1% over 2016.  These figures remind us that a huge percentage of the social protection budget comes from workers' weekly contributions.  Neoliberal economists and journalists always harp on about a &euro;20 billion social protection budget while conveniently ignoring the role of the Social Insurance Fund to which workers and their families contribute.  In reality, the two most recent Governments have relentlessly suppressed the social assistance budget to under &euro;12 billion and now have it down to &euro;11 billion, with terrible consequences for the most vulnerable sectors of society.</p> <p> I welcome the extension of services to all payers of social insurance, including those provided for in section 3, with regard to paternity benefits for class S contributions, section 4, with regard to invalidity benefit and section 9, with regard to dental and optical benefits for employed and self-employed recipients.  Section 16 on the inclusion of the transitional period for Romanian and Bulgarian nationals who pay social insurance is also a generous provision.  It is unfortunate the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, is not here because I want to take this opportunity to condemn his recent dangerous rhetoric of trying to pit different areas of Irish society against one another.  He tried to set the garda&iacute; striking for the basic restoration of their pay against the general public and later social protection payment recipients against public servants such as teachers.  Both interventions were singularly unhelpful and create a damaging narrative as part of the fear-mongering divide and conquer tactics that show the worst in politics on what the Minister of State will agree is generally a sad day for politics in our world.</p> <p> As I have illustrated, the framing of the social protection budget and the construction of the other key budgets of public service provision for our schools, hospitals, security services and civil services is not a zero sum game.  Restoration of income for the nearly one third of our people, the 2.1 million people to whom Deputy Connolly referred, who depend on social insurance and social assistance payments is crucial.  They are entitled to full restoration while the Minister of State holds his role in the Government.  I believe the resources are in our economy to fund a truly fair and humane social protection budget while also ensuring that key public service professions are properly paid and resourced, including the Civil Service.  Whatever about the competition for the leadership of Fine Gael, these attempts to set off different categories of society against each other are singularly unhelpful.</p> <p> I welcome the partial restorations, which will benefit approximately 1.5 million people, but I note they are not scheduled to come into effect until mid-March 2017.  As I have previously said, this date should be brought forward to the beginning of the year and commence in January 2017.  I hope that sections 18 and 22 will be amended in this regard by all the parties in the House in this regard.  I hope the Minister of State brings this back to his colleagues in Fine Gael.  These payments assist the most vulnerable in our society and despite our social protection system, Ireland continues to experience high levels of poverty.</p> <p> I will give an example of which the Minister of State is well aware.  The excellent Brother Kevin Crowley of the Capuchin Day Centre in Smithfield, who has been doing invaluable and sterling work in our city centre for years, reported recently that demand for the service is now at the highest it has been in 50 years.  Weekly volunteers provide some 600 hot dinners to individuals, families and children, and 1,700 food parcels per week are distributed on Wednesdays.  This has increased dramatically from before the recession, when they used to provide about 400 per week.  This is happening on the watch of the Minister of State as he is a member of the Government.  We can clearly see incredible levels of poverty in this regard.  </p> <p> I echo the comments made by Deputies Gino Kenny, Br&iacute;d Smith and Catherine Connolly on the treatment of lone parents and the draconian changes made by the previous Minister, Deputy Burton, which are still having a very detrimental effect on lone parent families, 60% of whom experience at least one form of deprivation.  I also echo Deputy Smith's comments on the gross discrimination against women workers when it comes to retirement.  The anger people feel after rearing a family for 20 or 25 years and spending 20 or 25 years in work, when they find their pensions are far lower than what they expected, has been brought to our attention.  It is clear the 1994 scheme needs to be examined.</p> <p> A key challenge to the structure and minimal payment levels of our social insurance and social assistance welfare system is that we should look again at the concept of a basic income.  Earlier this year, a referendum was held in Switzerland in which a significant portion of the population voted for a basic income.  Countries such as Finland and the Netherlands are exploring the concept that every citizen, every child, woman and man, would have a basic income.</p><p>Fr. Sean Healy and Social Justice Ireland have run strongly with that idea and it always has been a proposal of the Green Party.  Perhaps the Minister can have a look at the proposal again for our own country, to get away from the idea of providing income for a deserving poor and move towards being a country where we have a fair, egalitarian distribution for all our citizens.</p></speech>

All sections of society were hammered during the recession and the fact that the Minister is giving &euro;5 here and there and increasing jobseeker's allowance for young people under 25 by &euro;2 shows where society has gone.  People will never see the full restoration of what they received before the recession in their pay packets or social protection payments because the recession has pulled money out of the pockets of ordinary people while the wealthy get richer.  When the Minister of State in the House, Deputy Finian McGrath, was on this side of the House he would have had such ideas and would have echoed those sentiments.  There has to be a different concept of how society is run.  Brexit and what has happened in the USA - and may happen in other countries - are an indictment of people's frustration about how they have been disrespected and disenfranchised.  The system that has maintained itself for the past 20 years cannot do so any more yet trade deals are being put in place that may affect people's public services even more, by allowing businesses to challenge Governments if they wish to reverse decisions that affect profits, such as decisions to increase minimum wages.</p>  <p>  Social protection could have alleviated the problems faced by lone parents without costing too much money.  SPARK attended a committee meeting yesterday morning and its representatives made the general point that Ireland has worryingly high child poverty rates.  The overall consistent poverty rate in Ireland is 8% but for children it is 11.2%.  According to a SILC report of 2014, when breaking the rates down by household composition a different picture appears and the consistent poverty rate for children in lone parent families is 22.1%, while it is 7.9% for two-parent families with fewer than four children.  Any discussion about reducing child poverty must, therefore, focus on children in lone-parent families and two-parent families with fewer than four children.</p>  <p>  All people under 18 are legally seen as minors and the policy that forces a parent with sole responsibility for raising a teenager to work full time is not in the child's best interest.  A lot has been written about changes to one-parent family payments, which now stop once the youngest child turns seven.  People put out the line that this is in accordance with international best practice and point out that, internationally, parents can lose support when children turn three or five.  However, although parents are expected to seek training or a job before the child turns seven, once they do so the financial and other supports available to enable their participation cease.  In the UK a lone parent working 12 hours a week is entitled to working credits.  They can breach the benefits caps and are entitled to higher housing benefit to reward them for working but that is not even being looked at in this country.  Work is seen as a route out of poverty but for lone parents in Ireland the infrastructure is not in place to ensure work pays.  The recent changes in Ireland cut the income of parents working for 20 hours on the minimum wage by 17% in many cases, due to rules around rent supplement and high child care costs for many lone parents.  This loss means they are financially better off not working and that is the irony of the policies that were put in place in the past number of years.  Far from encouraging economic independence, this policy is trapping lone parents into long-term social welfare dependency.</p>  <p>  Changes to one-parent family payments has exasperated lone parents looking to access all levels of education.  In the programme for partnership Government there is a commitment to publishing recommendations from an independent report commissioned to identify the barriers to success in higher education for lone parents in advance of budget 2017.  The report has not been published in the timeframe agreed and the barriers will remain in place for at least another year.  Lone parents accessing ETB and SOLAS courses have been forced to drop out or face financial losses.  Lone parents are paid a training allowance instead of a primary social welfare payment when doing these courses.  Many courses operate on a clock-in basis and any time missing or late attendances result in a financial penalty.  This system does not accommodate the dual role of a lone parent.  Many courses start at 8.30 a.m., which does not facilitate a lone parent who has to drop a child at school.  If parents have to stay at home to nurse a sick child they lose a full day's pay, likewise if they must bring a child to a dental or medical appointment.  A lone parent who participates in these courses is paid a minimum of &euro;15 per week for child care out of the weekly qualifying child increase of &euro;29.80.  This requires a significant investment in the course but the risk that they lose money when a child is sick is unfair and an additional barrier which is forcing lone parents out of training at a time when Intreo offices are pushing them into a course.  The irony of these situations is unbelievable.</p>  <p>  Lone parents on rent supplement have no access to higher education unless they transfer to the back-to-education allowance, BTA.  However, they cannot receive the maintenance portion of SUSI if they are on the BTA.  The SUSI grant is completely necessary to support the additional transport and child care costs associated with attending college and, in effect, a lone parent's access is determined by his or her housing status and this is discriminatory.  The Department of Social Protection has confirmed that lone parents on jobseeker's transition can do postgraduate studies but in practice local offices are suspending payments for those who are studying at postgraduate level and this has to be addressed.  Parents are being told they must stop studying or forfeit payments.  The purpose of the policy was to encourage activation and it is therefore essential that all Intreo offices are fully aware that lone parents are entitled to study while on jobseeker's transition.  In my own area of Ballyfermot, a young woman went in to collect her JST last Friday but she is doing a masters course and was told she would not get the JST until the course was stopped.  We intervened to say it was allowed but she was nearly a week without money in her pocket, which is absolutely outrageous when a person is already on a low income.  All Intreo offices should know the rules and regulations around payments.</p>  <p>  It is important to give an overview of what is happening to lone parents.  They were targeted during the recession and the austerity and they were picked off, one by one, as were people with disabilities who could not fight back to oppose the cuts.  I hope that, as happened with the Right2Water campaign, there will be people organising on the streets and there will be real change so that we do not have the same tired politics of which people are resentful.</p></speech>

In particular, the almost &euro;5 across the board increase in social welfare payments is a positive move given the reductions over many years in those payments.  The increase in these payments is indicative of an improved economy.  I welcome the extension of eligibility to invalidity pension, treatment benefits and paternity benefits to persons who are self-employed paying class S PRSI.  In regard to farming, I welcome the partial disregard of GLAS income in the context of means testing for the purpose of social assistance payments and farm assist payments.</p>  <p>  I would like to put a proposal to the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, to which I hope consideration will be given.  There are people who would like to return to work and retain their jobseeker's allowance or other forms of social welfare payments.  This is particularly relevant to people who want to work as carers in their communities.  Currently, a person who works for an hour or two per day as a carer loses a full day's jobseeker's benefit or other social welfare payment in respect of that work.  I am asking that consideration be given to a reduction in the daily payment rate to reflect the number of hours worked.  In other words, taking a notional working week of 35 hours, a person who works for two hours per day three days per week as a carer or in any other employment would, instead of losing three days' worth of social welfare benefits, lose only six hours of their 35-hour entitlement in terms of benefit.  The reduction would be proportionate to the number of hours, rather than the number of days, worked.</p>  <p>  Many care providers are experiencing difficulty recruiting carers to work in their local communities.  This curtails the services that they can provide.  If the reduction was based on the number of hours, rather than the number of days, worked, it would encourage people to return to the workforce.  It would also improve the mental and social standing of individuals if they were allowed to care for people in their communities .  Obviously, this would also be of benefit to the care provision agencies and, additionally, it would reduce the Government's social welfare payments bill.  I accept that there would be a need for a limit to be set in terms of eligibility and so on but if reductions were based on the number of hours, rather than the number of days, worked, then people who are concerned about their communities and, in particular, elderly and disabled individuals within those communities would be willing to return to work as they would not stand to lose a substantial portion of their social welfare benefits.  I would ask that consideration be given to that proposal if not in the context of this Bill then in future legislation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-11-09a.374" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1319" speakername="Michael Healy-Rae" time="19:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016110900054#CCC00200"><p>There are elements of this Bill that are to be welcomed but there are also aspects about which I am concerned.  I am sure the Minister of State is also concerned about them.  For example, self-employed people have been let down badly over many years by successive Governments.  Not enough was done for them at the time of the crash.  People who were providing much needed employment were left with nothing for themselves and they could not even access financial assistance.  These people worked tremendously hard to create jobs for themselves and others.  I am referring not to massive contractors but to people who created jobs for family members or their neighbours, something that is extremely important in every community.  People who are self-employed create jobs for themselves and for other people.  I acknowledge that measures have been introduced that will open up access to benefits for them which, up to now, have not been available to them.  However, more must be done for these people in the future.  One of the biggest talking points in the constituency I represent in the aftermath of the announcement of the budget was the increase in pension and other social welfare payments and why recipients of those payments would not get the increase until next March.  While an increase of &euro;5 per week is a step in the right direction, it is not enough and recipients should not have to wait until next March to get it.</p>  <p>  With regard to dental benefits, I have been campaigning on this issue for many years.  I have always held the view that investment in dental care is an investment in the future because if people look after their teeth from an early age, it will save us money in the long term.  I welcome the reintroduction of the dental benefits scheme but more needs to be done in that regard also.</p>  <p>  In the context of farming families, everybody currently engaged in farming is struggling, be they involved in dairy, beef or sheep farming.  Farm incomes - as a result of a combination of reasons - have never been worse.  While I welcome the changes in respect of farm assist, which, again, are a step in the right direction, more needs to be done.</p>  <p>  On lone parents and the incentives for employment and education assistance, lone parents are struggling on a daily and weekly basis to meet the high cost of living.  The &euro;5 increase which many people are to receive will be negated by the high cost of home and car insurance.  People entitled to the &euro;5 per week increase will have to pay at least &euro;5 or more on increased home or car insurance costs.  Another issue of concern is the high cost of education.  Parents are being asked by schools to make voluntary contributions towards the upkeep of facilities.  I know that not every school is asking for these contributions and I do not apportion any blame to those schools that are asking for them because it is not as if they are not doing something useful with the money.  They would not ask for this money if they did not need it for the running and upkeep of school facilities.  This is a major concern.  Another concern is the high cost of school transport, particularly for parents who have a number of school-going children.  The cost of sending children to school in terms of books, transport - if they have to pay for it - and uniforms is a savage expense on struggling families.</p>  <p>  With regard to the rent allowance caps, this issue of rising rents was discussed during Leaders' Questions.  The question that arises is whether an increase in rent allowance caps would lead to further increases in rent.  I would not want that to happen.  However, owing to the low level of available property for rent in Ireland, rents are increasing.  While nothing can be done about that until such time as the report on the issue has been completed, serious consideration will have to be given to increasing the rent allowance caps.  I am not asking that the Government do anything extraordinary or increase the caps too much because that would only lead to rents increasing further.  As I said, I would not like that to happen.  At the same time, I am dealing on a daily basis with single people, couples and families who cannot find properties to rent within the rent allowance caps applicable to them.  These people are unable to find properties that conform with the regulations and stipulations set out in the current scheme.  I call on the Minister to take a serious look at this issue, which is causing awful problems.  People are trying to do their best.  Obviously, the availability of more properties to rent might help calm matters in the context of the rising cost of rents.  Rents in Dublin, in comparison with the rest of the country, are scandalous but that is obviously a supply issue.</p>  <p>  I welcome the fact that the Christmas bonus is being increased to 85%.</p><p>Obviously, I would have liked to see it go to 100%.  I hope it will happen at the next budget as it should.  I know that is what the Minister of State wants.</p> <p> Rural Deputies are acutely aware of people living in rural locations who did away with landline phones when the telephone allowance was cut and relied on their mobile phones instead.  However, in doing so they lost their connection to Neighbourhood Watch schemes and alert systems, leaving them vulnerable.  They decided that they could not afford to keep the landline phone without the telephone allowance.  It is a serious and important matter which must be looked at because the safety and protection of our fine elderly people living in rural and urban locations must be thought of at all times.  They are the people who built up this country and we should take care of them today.</p> <p> I cannot praise highly enough the work that is carried out in rural social schemes the length and breadth of this country.  Of course, I welcome the extra 500 places, but while it sounds like a lot, in the context of the size of the country it is not.  That is another thing that could be looked at and we do not have to wait until the next budget to do so.  The people working in those schemes are making a valuable and important contribution.  More spaces are needed.  If these people are going to be paid a social welfare payment and if they want to get on a scheme, do valuable work, get out in the morning and do jobs in their communities, is it not something to be welcomed?  It should be encouraged because anything a person will do in the course of the day is better than doing nothing.  If they are helping and contributing whether in a local football or GAA field or in a town through Tidy Towns, it is great business that should be encouraged.  The more people can be put on a scheme if that is what they want, the more welcome it is.  Another issue is eligibility to get on a scheme and the length of time a person can stay on a scheme.  If a person wants to stay on a scheme and the work and space is there, I do not see why that should not be encouraged.  I do not see why people should not have that place.  Money invested in that type of work is beneficial in the absence of full-time sustainable jobs.</p> <p> Any time we study caring for the elderly, it is right and proper to focus on keeping people at home, which is, after all, the most cost-effective way to care for them rather than to have them in a community hospital or, more expensively again, an acute bed in a larger hospital.  The best place for a person where his or her medical condition allows is at home.  We can never praise those who provide care for elderly, sick and disabled people enough.  They are providing a great service and saving the State a great deal of money.  They are being kind to a person in his or her own home which is the place he or she will be happiest.  If a person could finish his or her time in his or her home, is it not a great deal better than to be in any hospital setting?  That is not to say that our community and general hospitals do not provide great care where a person does have to finish his or her time there and we are very grateful for that work.  However, if we can ensure that our carers receive allowances that encourage them and make it feasible for them to care for elderly, sick and disabled people at home, it should be done.  It saves money every day of the week and is simply a better system.</p> <p> There is only so much money in the pool at the end of the day.  At any time, a Government must make decisions.  However, I always ask in relation to budgetary matters that people think of the elderly, sick and disabled and young people and try to help all sectors of society in a fair and proper fashion.  We should not leave people behind as has happened in the past.  In future budgets, we want to protect those people who are vulnerable and take care of them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-11-09a.376" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1320" speakername="Danny Healy-Rae" time="19:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016110900055#DDD00200"><p>Self-employed sole traders who have paid thousands of euro and, previously, punts in tax who find their work runs out for a while cannot access any social welfare payments for at least 12 months during which there is no money coming in.  It is very unfortunate.  It is very unfair when one thinks of all the tax they have paid and the people they have, in many instances, employed.  If some source with which they were trading goes out of business, they may find themselves in a very vulnerable situation.  Sole traders and people who work for themselves take very little out of their companies.  They try to improve their companies by building them up and putting more into them, but all of a sudden a market or source of work may deplete with the result that they are left in a very vulnerable position.  A couple contacted me recently where the husband's very good line of plumbing work simply ran out for a while.  The wife rang me because they were hungry and had no money for food.  It appeared they were going to have to sell some of his equipment but if that happened, he would be unemployed forever.  He could never put that kit together again.  They were tided over for a short while, which is all people want.  They want some facility or to qualify for social welfare while things are bad until they get back on their feet again.  It is the same where people are sick, which happens as well.</p>  <p>  It has been stated that social welfare schemes are to be extended to the self-employed, particularly the extension of eligibility for the invalidity pension.  This is long overdue and we campaigned for it for many years.  The self-employed do not want to be out sick but over the years many have come to my clinics who were in bad shape and in tears.  They were very hurt that they could no longer work due to illness, but they had little or no support.  I have seen no mention of extending eligibility for illness benefits to the self-employed and I am curious to know how it will work in reality if they have to have been unable to work for one year to qualify for invalidity pension.  What supports will be available to them in the short term and during the one-year qualifying period?  I would like to hear more on this.  Clarification is required because these people have paid their share and are as entitled as everyone on PAYE to get some assistance when they find themselves in vulnerable situations.</p><p> Another issue with social welfare is that in some instances, a few days' work becomes available but it may be difficult to get people to do it.  There are people in receipt of social welfare who would like to work for a few days, weeks or months but are afraid to do so because they know it is only short-term and it will be difficult to re-enter the social welfare system.  They have families and dependants and cannot take the risk of going to work.  Many people think those in receipt of jobseeker's allowance or other social welfare payments do not want to work but that is not true.  If they were able to work for a short time they would do so but they are afraid they will not be able to re-enter the social welfare system and that their dependants or children would be hungry.  Something needs to be done to address this matter.</p> <p> I mentioned home help and the fair deal scheme to the Taoiseach a number of weeks ago.  Elderly people may need home help in the mornings or evenings to get them in and out of bed but service providers are not inclined to provide such hours.  Instead, they suggest such people need to be in nursing homes for long-stay care and should not be in receipt of home help at all.  There is no problem in providing the fair deal scheme for such people but what I ask is for the Minister for Social Protection to provide the fair deal scheme for people living at home.  If the money is in place, it will help the same people, namely, those who want to stay at home but cannot get home help.  There should be some discretion as to how the money is spent rather than insisting it can only be given to elderly people who go into nursing homes.</p> <p> The fair deal scheme is not a fair deal for farming families.  In fact, it is a very lousy scheme.  If a member of a farming family has to go into a nursing home, the farm and dwelling are both taken into account in the valuation process.  Over three years, at a rate of 7.5% per year, that is a total of 22.5% of the total value of a farm.  We all know the current situation regarding farming.  Beef farmers were never worse off.  In the past few weeks, milk farmers have improved their lot a little but some grain and tillage farmers will not be working at all next year because they have taken such a hit.  I ask that the dwelling on a farm be the only asset that is assessed to bring farmers in line with every other person who only owns a residence.</p> <p> The fair deal scheme hurts other sectors of people such as those who live over pubs.  The pub provides their income and when the owner of the property has to go into a nursing home, the entire property is taken into account for valuation purposes.  The same applies to those who own shops.  Many people in rural Ireland live over the shops they own.  They are becoming scarce, but they still exist.  Publicans and shopkeepers have raised this issue with me recently.  They are being very badly hit, to such an extent that they are afraid that if a person who needs attention goes into a nursing home, they will lose their pubs or shops and, as a result, their livelihoods for ever.  They are in a serious predicament.  The scheme needs to be reviewed to ensure fair play.</p> <p> Every day, we hear about people in receipt of jobseeker's allowance who have been told they must visit their nearest office and Turas Nua is the organisation dictating the terms.  I know of a young man who is 23 years of age who has attended an office one day per week to sign on for the past seven or eight weeks.  He is being treated the same way as a person who stabbed someone, is on remand, has been granted bail and has to visit a Garda station two or three times a week to sign on or be seen.  The person to whom I referred has been told he will have to appear in the office for 52 weeks.</p></speech>

The man does not have a car and has to travel 19 miles to be seen every week.  He must thumb for a lift on a national primary route as he cannot cycle that distance to the office.  He is hoping someone can drive him in and out of the town in question.  He is in receipt of &euro;100 per week.  It appears to me that Turas Nua wants to keep him going to the office so that he will get fed up, lie down at home and forget about the &euro;100 payment.  The system is very unfair and is leaving a sour taste in the mouth of a young person who is trying to survive until he gets a job.  That carry-on should not be entertained.</p>  <p>  I must again refer to school buses, which are very important in rural Ireland.  When local schools in rural areas were closed years ago, people were promised they would always have transport to central schools.  That is not the case.  The Department of Education and Skills has reneged on that promise.  It is imposing clauses, such as the requirement that ten children must travel on a bus for a route to operate.  That is not possible in rural Ireland today.  If ten children do not avail of the service, the service is not provided.  Fair play is required as people in rural Ireland are as entitled to go to school as those in built-up areas.  They have been denied this right because assurances and promises were given in the past that they would always have transport to central schools.  That is not happening and I want the Minister to address the matter.</p>  <p>  There is a lot of discussion about housing and the lack thereof.  If the Government is serious about building social housing it will have to do something about the regulations that are being set for local authorities by the Department.  It is now the case that no one will sign off on anything because they are scared they will lose their jobs.  In County Kerry, three rural cottages were built in the past eight years.  We hope to build 22 in Killarney this year.  This issue has been ongoing since 2014 but rules and regulations are set by the Department and unless the Government gets stuck in and sorts out the problem, no houses will be built in Kerry, Dublin or anywhere else.</p><p>The rules that have been set by the Department cannot be complied with by local authorities.  The Government needs to get down to brass tacks and sort this out.  These are big problems but the Government is not attending to them.</p></speech>

I will be sharing time with Deputy Seamus Healy and members of the Social Democrats, should they arrive.</p>  <p>  When we look back to the foundation of our State and the way we treated our most vulnerable people, it was the academics Eoin O'Sullivan and Ian O'Donnell who described it as the "casual disregard [we had] for the quality of life of vulnerable citizens [which] characterised the formative decades of [our] State".  Its history is well recorded.  Between 1926 and 1951, 1% of our population, or 31,000 people, were held in a variety of different institutions.  They were, in effect, incarcerated in industrial schools, mental hospitals and Magdalen laundries.  Rather than creating the Gaelic Eden de Valera described of comely maidens at the firesides and athletic youths dancing at the crossroads, we had, in truth, created what Sean &Oacute; Faol&aacute;in described as a dreary Eden.  It is welcome that we moved on from that.  True to the kind of progressive policy of creating a social welfare Keynesian state of other countries, we escaped from that narrow and repressive sense of how we look after our most vulnerable people to a better, more inclusive and caring way.</p>  <p>  I want to pick out some examples of where I think we need to go further.  I am very glad that the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, is in the Minister's chair.</p></speech>

I am glad he is in the House because there is a specific example in the social welfare we provide of where we need to improve our caring infrastructure.  This relates to the fact that we have moved away from congregated settings for those with most difficulties.  These are those in whom the Minister of State is most interested, that is, those with physical or intellectual disabilities.  It is right that we have moved away from the old, institutionalised approach.  However, we are not providing an alternative in the community that would give us a real ability to look after those most vulnerable citizens.</p>  <p>  I know this is not just an issue for the social welfare budget.  As previous speakers stated, we also need housing.  We see this when we come to address specific examples.  Parents may have an adult child who has severe intellectual disabilities.  The difficulty they face is that the systems are not integrated.  Housing or other respite facilities are not available.  While we have taken the first step to move away from that old, historic, institutionalised care system, we have not provided the resources and the social welfare infrastructure for, in particular, those who are most vulnerable and in need of residential care.  There is no connection between the health system, the housing system and, I would argue, the social welfare system.  I consider that to be one of the first major gaps or flaws that I do not see being addressed within the Social Welfare Bill or in the budget more generally.</p>  <p>  Our system of child benefit was deeply sexist.  Originally, the payment went to the man of the house and there were all sorts of restrictions on it.  It took a long time but, starting in the 1950s, we made advances.  We made a major advance in the early part of the previous decade when we started to give significant support in the form of child benefit.  I believe this was one of the best interventions in our social welfare system.  By giving a sufficient amount for each child directly to the mother, it was one of the few measures that gave real financial protection to those in financial difficulty.  They could rely on the child benefit payment as a final fallback to meet the most basic of needs.</p>  <p>  I deeply regret that the Government did not increase the child benefit payment.  I have no difficulty with the arguments made by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Katherine Zappone, that she wants to target certain child care provisions at those in disadvantaged communities.  However, the latest evidence from the US and elsewhere is that one of the best ways of doing that is to provide financial security to the parents of very young children.  I believe that our child benefit measure does that better than any other measure.  I would prefer to have maintained a policy of not discriminating between different types of parenting and to have increased the child benefit payment.  This leaves the choice to the parent.  Every parent has different circumstances and an increase in the payment would have allowed them to call how best to support and raise their children.  This is a critical intervention that can be made during the early years that can prevent an ongoing poverty spiral resulting from a lack of proper development of the social, educational, cognitive and emotional skills of our youngest people.</p>  <p>  Many would argue that the problem is that this does not differentiate between the well-to-do and the poor because the child benefit system provides a universal payment.  When I was in government, we spent an extensive period of time examining if that problem could be overcome and if we could integrate some sort of progressive measures into the child benefit system in order that it was not just a universal payment and could be further targeted at the most vulnerable.  One of the biggest frustrations I had was the seeming inability of the State, which still exists, to integrate our social welfare system and our revenue and tax system.  That is not a small project, but I have yet to hear a clear and coherent argument as to why it is not possible.  It is one of the big structural changes we should be looking to make.  Were we to do it, it would allow us to provide for all sorts of creative mechanisms such as the provision of refundable tax credits and the individualisation of our social welfare system and our tax system.</p>  <p>  We only went half way in reforming our system.  We individualised the tax system but not the social welfare system.  We currently have a minority Government and different options can be examined.  It is to be hoped we are over the worst of the previous crisis.  This was a chance for us to make structural changes.  I do not see provision in the Social Welfare Bill or in the budget for a new, better and increased form of child benefit.</p>  <p>  I mentioned a further major concern of mine on budget day but I want to repeat it today.  Many of the provisions in the budget are welcome.  Our social welfare budget is not small.  It is our biggest budget.  People obviously welcome the &euro;5 increase in the pension and other social welfare payments, but it was a mistake not to target the youngest people in receipt of social welfare.  That was an unfortunate signal to send.  That original reduction in the unemployment benefit payment to younger people was introduced during our time in government, but it was nothing like the scale that subsequently occurred during the time of the last Government.  In the same way that we are looking to restore pay for the newest entrants to the teaching, nursing and other professions, it is right and time for us in this budget to start recognising that we need to provide such a safety net for younger people.</p>  <p>  That someone is on the dole or in receipt of unemployment benefit is not always a sign that he or she is looking to shirk work.  That is an old Victorian idea of social welfare.  There are many instances during which a younger person may need a period when they are not working.  They may be engaged in an artistic activity or a learning activity that is not part of the formal education system.  We need to provide that flexibility for our young people and recognise that sometimes it is not easy, for instance, to transfer from the education system to the work system.  On occasions, they need support.  Perhaps they are emigrants who have come home and are taking several months to settle in.  For a variety of different circumstances, the young person is just not in gainful employment at that particular time.  Rather than having a punitive social welfare system that sends a sharp signal that a person has to get out and work, we should have used this opportunity, when funding was available, to provide an increased provision for younger people.  I regret that this did not happen.</p><p>The Green Party and other Deputies have consistently noted the need for the introduction of a basic income model for social welfare provision.  It is a fundamental truth that providing a basic income to all citizens allows them greater freedom to decide when to provide care and when to engage in community work or paid employment.  This model recognises each form of employment.  We should not create a restrictive social welfare system that removes benefits or supports when a person moves from unemployment into employment.  A large amount of work done in society is of great benefit to individuals and society and this should be recognised through the provision of a basic income support.  Such a model would provide a flexible, innovative and just social safety net.  While it would not be easy to establish and those models that I have examined are expensive, there are means of achieving this objective.  A refundable tax credit is one option which is supported by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and Canada and the Netherlands are introducing working examples of a basic income.</p> <p> I do not get any sense that the Department of Social Protection is thinking outside the box.  It continues to operate a large budget using existing systems without innovating or trying to spend its budget in a better and more effective manner that would reduce the need for it to be policed and would not have many administrative charges.  It should do this while continuing to provide a basic social protection network, with the aim of creating an Ireland of which we can be proud and the genuine Eden to which we should aspire in our social welfare provision.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-11-09a.386" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1348" speakername="S&eacute;amus Healy" time="20:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016110900058#GGG00200"><p>Social Justice Ireland, in its analysis of the budget, noted that budget 2017 disproportionately favoured wealthy people and did nothing to safeguard against deepening inequality.  It also pointed out that reductions in the universal social charge and income tax clearly had a greater benefit for those earning more money.  The TASC report made the point that the basic rate of social welfare post-budget 2017 is still &euro;17 below the at risk of poverty line.  This means the 2017 budget maintains and widens the gap between rich and poor.</p><p>What do the gap between rich and poor, the increases in payments in the budget and the philosophy of supporting very wealthy people as opposed to low income, middle income and poor families mean?  They mean that 750,000 people live in poverty, one in five children lives in a household with an income below the poverty line, 18.7% of children are poor and almost 20% of adults with an income below the poverty line are in employment.  This final group is the working poor.  Furthermore, since 2007, the deprivation rate has more than doubled, meaning 1.3 million people or 29% of the population are deprived.  </p><p>The budget and measures flowing from it mean the gap between rich and poor will be maintained and widened.  Wealthy people will continue to be cosseted and supported by the Government, while low income, middle income and poor families are forced to live from hand to mouth and find it almost impossible to make ends meet.  What does the budget mean for wealthy people who are already very comfortable, namely, those with incomes of more than &euro;186,000 per annum?  The wealthiest 10% of people in Ireland have net financial assets of more than &euro;100 billion, an increase of &euro;35 billion on the levels recorded at the peak of the boom.  These assets are not businesses or companies but net financial assets held by individuals.  According to the <i>Irish Independent</i>, the wealth of the country's 300 richest people has increased from approximately &euro;50 billion to &euro;84 billion.  What did the 2016 budget do for this group?  Changes to the tax code and universal social charge handed &euro;120 million to the wealthiest 5% in society, while the 2017 budget gave this same group &euro;52 million, giving a total in two years of &euro;172 million.  Not 1 cent in tax is paid on that wealth or those assets.  </p><p>Incidentally, it is not revolutionary to propose a wealth tax given that wealth taxes apply in many European countries.  Deputies may not believe it but a former Fine Gael Minister for Finance introduced a wealth tax, although it was abolished shortly afterwards by an incoming Fianna F&aacute;il Government.  In introducing a wealth tax, the former Minister set a precedent.  We need to change how we do business by supporting low income, middle income and poor families and ensuring the wealthy pay their fair share of taxation.</p><p>I will address some of the specific elements of the budget, with particular reference to families, many of whom are being forced to live from hand to mouth.  Many families are not in a position to put away a few euro for events such as communions, confirmations or school trips and must borrow from money lenders and credit unions.  More and more people are borrowing from money lenders, including many illegal lenders.  What did the budget do for families?  It did not provide an increase in the child dependant allowance, child benefit - formerly the children's allowance - family income supplement or domiciliary care allowance, a benefit available to families who must look after children in need of additional care. </p><p>One-parent families are at greatest risk of poverty, with the highest percentage of families in poverty in this category.  Unfortunately, one-parent families have been decimated by the measures introduced by the former T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton.  </p><p>This Government's budget has done absolutely nothing to right the wrongs in that regard.</p> <p> Unfortunately, the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, has just left the Chamber.  Prior to the budget, we heard much talk from him and his Independent Alliance colleagues on the restoration of benefits for the elderly.  The telephone allowance has not been brought back.  There have been no increases in the living alone allowance, the household benefits package or the fuel allowance.  Over the years, the fuel allowance season has been reduced to 26 weeks from 32.  Research and statistics show there are higher mortality rates among elderly people during cold weather.  The fuel allowance should be at least brought back to the position where it was prior to the recession.</p> <p> Other Members referred to how young people have been discriminated against in the budget.  Not a week goes by that I, along with other Deputies, do not receive queries from women who are about to apply for the State pension but who find when they request their contribution records that, lo and behold, they do not have enough stamps to get the maximum payment.  This is because the previous Government changed the rules.  In the past, when women gave up their jobs to rear families and went back to work, those years were counted as credits.  That is not the situation now and we find many women either do not qualify for the State contributory pension or that they only qualify for it at a reduced rate.  That is unjust and should be dealt with as a matter of urgency.</p> <p> It is welcome that the Christmas bonus has been brought back.  However, it is mean-spirited that, rather than the full amount, only 85% of the bonus will be paid.</p> <p> I wish to refer to the outrageous delays relating to social welfare applications.  If one applies for carer's allowance, the State pension or an invalidity pension, one has to wait 14 to 16 weeks for an initial decision.  If one does not get a positive decision, one can ask for a review but that can take a further 14 weeks.  If one does not get a positive outcome from the review, one can appeal but that can take up to 12 months.  It is simply outrageous that someone applying for carer's allowance, for example, would be obliged to wait 16 weeks for an initial decision and, if that is not successful, a further 14 weeks for a review.  I have had situations - I am sure this is the case with every other Member - where applicants for carer's allowance find that before the allowance is approved, the person they were caring for has actually passed to his or her eternal reward.  This is not good enough.  Will the Minister immediately investigate the reason for the significant delays in the Department with regard to the making of decisions in respect of these applications?  Is it because there are not enough staff?  Do we need additional staff?  The staff I deal with are helpful and do an excellent job.  Despite their best efforts, these delays are simply unacceptable.  This matter should be investigated immediately and put to rights.</p> <p> Rent limits for social welfare recipients are off the wall.  In Tipperary, for example, the rent limit for a family comprising a couple and one child is &euro;525 per month.  However, no house is available for rent in Tipperary that would meet the requirements of such a family at that price.  I am sure it is the same in every constituency.  Such a family house in Tipperary would cost a minimum of &euro;750 per month.  The Minister can verify that independently, he does not need to take my word for it.  There are no rent controls, no rent certainty and no security of tenure.  These rent limits have to be increased and we have to implement a system of effective rent control.  During the week, a family in receipt of housing assistance payment of &euro;525 per month, told me they had received a letter from their landlord informing them the rent was going up to &euro;780 per month.  That is simply unacceptable.  Serious action will have to be taken in respect of this matter.  Will the Minister review rent limits to ensure they are realistic?  Families such as that to which I refer are forced into paying double rent.  They pay a rent to the local authority under the housing assistance payment scheme and then a top-up rent.  In the case in question, it was a top-up of another &euro;225 a month or &euro;55 a week.  That means from one week to the next, the family does not have two red cents to rub together.  They have no opportunity to put any money aside for any eventuality that might arise.</p><p> I would like to refer to the respite care grant and other benefits but I will leave it at that as my time is up.  The entire policy of the Government is to support the wealthy and powerful while effectively widening the gap between the rich and poor and ensuring ordinary people are forced to live from hand to mouth on a daily basis.</p></speech>

I feel like I have come in here to talk about a different one altogether.  When an untruth is said, it needs to be tackled.  This ESRI uses a switch model that examines the fairness and social impact of any given budget.  It is a model that works on a non-indexed basis.  It was found that, under the social welfare package, the 20% who are least well off in society are the greatest beneficiaries of this budget.  It is not the Government that is saying this; it is the ESRI.</p></speech>

We will do so fairly such that we can spread the benefits across society.  As I will outline, there are those who have benefitted from an increase who have not seen one since 2009 and 2010.  That is very important.</p>  <p>  This was an absolutely fair and prudent budget.  It was a reforming budget considering some of the measures for the self-employed, who take great chances and take on staff.  They are drivers of our economy and they need to be remembered.  They are remembered in the Social Welfare Bill, which was not always the case.  The Bill provides modest increases for all from available resources.  It is inclusive and not picking one group over another, as others would have one believe.</p>  <p>  The main measures in this Bill include the increases in social welfare payments by &euro;5, which will see a gain for approximately 1.5 million recipients, from carers, the disabled and jobseekers to pensioners, widows, the blind and those on maternity leave.  There are 8,000 recipients benefitting under the farm assist scheme.  There are measures covering illness benefit, invalidity benefit and lone parents benefits.  I will refer to some of these in a little more detail.  I welcome the Minister's commitment to increasing the rates above the rate of inflation in future budgets as resources permit.  This is a very important element.</p>  <p>  The increase of &euro;5 for pensioners was one element.  There are other elements that benefit the elderly.  There are changes concerning prescription charges, DIRT and the Christmas bonus.  There will be an increase of 85%.  It is not just the elderly that will benefit from the Christmas bonus measure.  The 85% increase will be very welcome among recipients.</p>  <p>  Some 840,000 people will gain from the increase of &euro;5 per week.  This covers benefits such as the back-to-education allowance, the back-to-work allowance, the enterprise allowance, the pre-retirement allowance and some others.  The jobseeker's benefit and allowance, the jobseeker's transition payment, employment support and payments for community employment workers and those on T&uacute;s and rural social schemes are also taken into account.</p>  <p>  I touched earlier on some of the reforming measures.  The self-employed comprise a key element.  In the Finance Bill, we saw further improvements involving a move towards equalisation for the self-employed in terms of the increase in the tax allowance.  We shall continue to try to have full equalisation between the self-employed and PAYE workers.</p>  <p>  There are other benefits.  We are extending the dental, optical and hearing PRSI benefits to the self-employed without an increase in the PRSI payment.  This is another sign that we want to recognise the role of the self-employed, including the small business owners who employ staff throughout the country and take chances.  There is a tax credit increase.  Self-employed people will be able to become eligible for the invalidity pension.  This covers at least 205,000 workers.  This is another key benefit.</p>  <p>  I have touched on lone parents.  They are to benefit from an increase of &euro;5 per week.  The reduction in the income disregard from &euro;110 to &euro;90 will benefit 17,500.  I refer also to the &euro;500 cost of the education allowance.  The single affordable child care scheme is a key element of that.  When we examine these measures, we realise that the lone parent provisions feed into the measures that focus on children.  This budget focuses very strongly on children.  In this regard, one must consider the child care package and the medical cards for the 11,000 children in receipt of the domiciliary care allowance.  </p>  <p>  The Bill has an educational element covering school meals.  There are some 52,800 additional places.  They are not just for DEIS schools.  DEIS status is very important for schools that have it but some schools are very close to having missed out that status.  I refer to the difference between DEIS bands 1 and 2 and to schools on the fringe of having any DEIS status.  Until now, a school with DEIS status gets all the supports while a school without it gets none.  The school meals measure of the Social Welfare Bill is very important because it extends beyond DEIS schools.  The provision of 35,000 breakfast places for non-DEIS schools is a key component.  The increase of &euro;15 per week in the guardian's payment is another element of the focus on children.</p>  <p>  With regard to the self-employed, paternity benefit kicked in during September of this year.  The treatment benefits I mentioned - the optical, dental and hearing benefits - are to be introduced in March 2017.  The invalidity pension element will be in December 2017.  This benefits up to 380,000 self-employed individuals.  It is long awaited and warranted.  This goes back to the core Fine Gael principle of rewarding enterprise, work and risk-taking.</p>  <p>  In this past couple of weeks, there was industrial strife and accompanying challenges.  Therefore, it is key to bear in mind the budgetary measures and the Social Welfare Bill in this regard.  There has been much discussion over the past couple of weeks on industrial relations and the problems and frustrations in the public service.  As with all workers in the State, public servants have endured a lot of pain in the past seven or eight years.  As we proceed, we want to see the fruits of the recovery benefitting them.  We must be very careful and measured, however, given our limited resources.  We must ensure that, when sharing out the increases and benefits, we do so in a way that benefits all.  We must do so in a very prudent way that does not threaten the fragile recovery.</p>  <p>  When we talk about the Lansdowne Road agreement and our very important 300,000 plus public servants, who do a very important job for this country, we note that the conversation in the media over the past couple of weeks would have one believe at times they are the only workers in the country.  There are 1.7 million people about whom we may not talk enough.  They also get up in the morning, work hard, pay their taxes and face all the challenges faced by workers in the public service.</p>  <p>  The Government is trying to bring together all in society on the road to recovery.  We have tried to achieve reforms and efficiencies in how we run our country.  The public servants who have felt the pressure have had to do more with less because of the moratorium on recruitment and the trimming down of the number of staff in the public service.  We are trying to ensure reinvestment in services, including for the people who are vulnerable, those who need it most and everybody who wants to gain access to our health service.  Such investment and the budget for the justice service and education system - we want to see an increase in the number of teachers and SNAs, as allowed for in the budget - are key elements of a fair, balanced approach. </p>  <p>  An economy is driven by those who work and pay taxes.  The Government is about much more than the economy.  It is about a whole-society approach.  We have measures in the legislation for the vulnerable and those who need to receive supports from the State, but these all need to be paid for.  They are paid for by the people who work and pay their taxes.</p><p>Most of them have felt a significant burden of taxation in recent years.  As we continue to increase the number of people at work through the great measures taken under the Action Plan for Jobs, we want to grow the pot of money in the Exchequer and spread a lessened burden across all taxpayers while retaining enough money to give back something to those who are working and provide extra funding to vital services.  This is an important statement of intent by the Government.</p> <p> I wish to touch on some of the concerns about the under 26s social welfare payments.  Deputy Brady of Sinn F&eacute;in was present earlier.  He and I were in a debate on local radio that got heated the morning after the budget.  Sinn F&eacute;in struggled to find holes to pick in our budget, but it focused on the under 26s.  We gave an increase of &euro;2.70 per week, which was proportionate to the &euro;5 increase for someone in receipt of the full jobseeker's rate.</p></speech>

Deputy Carey is happy for me to make this final point.  The change was proportionate, but the State should not incentivise people who want to stay at home at 18 or 19 years of age, do not work or go into full-time education and who do not look to undertake training of some nature.  For jobseekers, there is a reward for upskilling.  Jobseekers aged under 26 years will get the full adult rate of the back to education allowance, representing a 21% increase, which is the single largest increase in the social welfare package, and rent supplement.  In Northern Ireland, jobseekers' rates are between &euro;64 and &euro;81 whereas we are still at the &euro;100 mark.</p>  <p>  Fine Gael is about enterprise, reward and making work pay.  That is what we want to do.  This approach is working.  In 2010, 90,000 young people were on the live register.  Now the number is 34,000.  We want to see it decrease further.  The budget is an important step in that regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-11-09a.397" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1273" speakername="Joe Carey" time="20:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016110900061#KKK00400"><p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute on Second Stage on the Social Welfare Bill 2016, which will bring about the measures announced in the recent budget.  In general, the Bill provides for modest increases across all social welfare payments as well as measures targeted at particular groups.  It provides for a &euro;5 increase in weekly benefits, ensuring that people of working age as well as retired people aged 66 years or older see an improvement in their weekly incomes.  As a result of this and last year's budgetary increases, pension payments next year will be &euro;8 per week higher than in 2009.</p>  <p>  I welcome confirmation by the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Varadkar, of his intention to make increases in future budgets at a rate greater than inflation.  I compliment him on his efforts at Cabinet level in his budgetary negotiations, which ensured that no one was left behind by the increases.  It must be noted that the recipients of the payments in question, such as widows, the sick, the disabled and carers, have not received increases in their payments since cuts were introduced in 2010 and 2011.  Therefore, I welcome the increases.</p>  <p>  I welcome the self-employed aspect of the Bill.  That sector consists of 380,000 people and is important for the economy.  To date, the social insurance system enabled only the self-employed to qualify for the contributory State pension.  The Bill provides that, from March 2017, they will be entitled to access dental, optical and hearing benefits that are currently only available to employees under the treatment benefit scheme.  With effect from December 2017, it will also enable them to qualify for invalidity pensions for the first time.  This measure will ensure that, where a self-employed person is no longer in a position to continue working because of long-term ill health, he or she will have access to a safety net of State supports without a means test that would count the person's savings and assets or his or her partner's income against him or her.  I welcome this progressive change and look forward to future budgetary reforms of the self-employed's access to social welfare supports.</p>  <p>  Another aspect of the Bill that I welcome is the reversal of the cuts to farm assist.  At a time when farm incomes have been falling, it is important that safety net supports such as farm assist be available to the farming community.  I also welcome the provision of an additional 500 places on the rural social scheme.</p>  <p>  I welcome the income disregard for the one-parent family payment and jobseeker's transitional payment, which will increase from &euro;90 to &euro;110 per week.  In recent weeks, the Joint Committee on Social Protection has held meetings regarding lone parents.  A number of anomalies were highlighted by advocacy groups, for example, the need for greater flexibility in the 19-hour criteria that is applicable for family income supplement, FIS.  With this flexibility, more lone parents could take up work.  While the income disregard was welcome, it was pointed out that there was no corresponding increase for FIS recipients.  The advocacy groups told our committee that, although the reforms had been intended to encourage lone parents to leave social welfare for in-work payments, many parents who had transferred to FIS would have been better off transferring to the jobseeker's transitional payment.  I ask that the Minister and his Department examine these issues in the context of the Bill and to afford lone parents the chance to return to the workforce.</p>  <p>  In overall terms, the Bill provides modest increases in weekly social welfare payments.  It is important that the recovery that has started be shared.  The Bill is a start in that process.  I support the Bill and look forward to its passage through the House.</p></speech>

I wish to address a number of issues on the social welfare side.  There is a major backlog in respect of those applications to the Department of Social Protection that must be signed off on by someone from its medical office, for example, the carer's allowance, disability claims and invalidity payments.  Let us consider the carer's allowance from a commonsensical perspective.  It is applied for by family members who provide professional care in their homes for loved ones.  Sometimes, they apply because they have taken leave from work.  Other times, they must apply for it to sustain themselves because they have no entitlement to the carer's benefit.  Deputies have already referred to the weeks and months it takes to get an application through the Department.  If the case is simple but the financial issues are not in absolute compliance with the criteria and a medical assessment or someone signing off on same is awaited, it is per saecula saeculorum.</p>  <p>  From the State's point of view, a cost-benefit analysis of a carer's allowance that is paid to a family member who cares for a relative in his or her own home compared with that relative being in full-time care with the State picking up the tab under the fair deal scheme would show a value for money that could not be quantified.  This is just the financial aspect of the allowance.  As to the social and well-being aspects of a patient being looked after at home when a carer's allowance is paid by the State, that person's quality of life and care is incomparable.  It is high time that the Department was clear on this.</p>  <p>  Other Deputies asked about the reason for the backlog.</p><p>Why is there such a delay?  It is the same with many of the other applications going through the Department, including those for disability allowances and so forth.  Obviously certain criteria must be met and no one wants to see the Department defrauded but the vast majority of those who apply for the carer's allowance do so in good faith.  Of course there must be checks and balances but could somebody explain, before this debate concludes, why there is such a delay?  If an application is made on 1 May but not granted until 1 August or even 1 December if it is the subject of a review, requiring additional information from medical practitioners, the payment is backdated to the date of the original application.  Therefore, there is no financial benefit to the State in delaying the process.  Is it that there is not a sufficient number of staff in the Department or is it down to a lack of urgency?  Does the Department not recognise the fact that a carer's allowance which enables a person who is in need of full-time care to stay in his or her own home is far better than that person having to go into full-time residential care?  Has the Department not grasped that simple fact?  Often applications are refused on the basis that the person is not in need of full-time care.  When applicants appeal, they nearly have to bring the care receiver to the hearing, who may be barely able to walk, in order to try to prove their case.  That takes away the dignity of the person who requires the care and the person providing it.  Clarification is required and an explanation should be given for the size of the backlog.  </p> <p> I wish to turn now to the issue of the domiciliary care allowance.  In recent times, a line has come back from the Department to the effect that it does not dispute the fact that a child is in need of extra care because of a medical condition or a disability but that the care is not of a sufficient level to warrant receipt of the domiciliary care allowance.  That is an awful line to put in a letter.  I have met many parents in my constituency who have applied for the domiciliary care allowance, as have other Deputies in this House, and it is obvious that it has become extremely difficult to qualify for it.  Somebody within the Department has tightened the criteria enormously from a medical point of view.  Parents of children who need extra care above and beyond that required by a fully healthy child are constantly struggling to get the best possible services from the State.  Every day they have a new struggle on their hands, whether it relates to occupational therapy, speech and language therapy and so forth.  They are receiving letters telling them that the assessment waiting list is 18 months long and they are trying to pull money together to get private assessments done.  They are under enormous pressure.  Every parent wants the best for his or her child.  Parents are increasingly frustrated with regard to the domiciliary care allowance.  That frustration is also evident in parents who apply for the carer's allowance to provide care for their children.  When was the qualifying criteria changed?  The Department might point out that a certain percentage of applications are approved but there are far more people in need of the domiciliary care allowance than the numbers who are being approved for it.  </p> <p> There are also issues surrounding the respite care grant.  While this is not directly linked to the Social Welfare Bill, there is an issue with people, particularly those with intellectual disabilities, getting respite care.  The services of respite care providers have been cut, including those provided by St. Joseph's Foundation in Charleville, CoAction in west Cork, Kerry Parents and Friends Association or St. John of God.  These services have been cut to the bone and there are constant reviews by the HSE in an attempt to realise further savings.  Respite care providers are using money raised through various fundraising events like table quizzes and so forth.  Such funds are being used to fill a gap being left by the State.  The fundamental point I want to stress is that there is a problem with medical assessments in the Department and I would welcome an explanation for that.</p> <p> I wish to turn now to the issue of PRSI contributions.  In many of the constituency newsletters I have produced over the years I have included a note encouraging people in their 50s to check their PRSI records.  The tightening of this area under the 2012 Act has made things more difficult and the averaging of contributions is penalising women in particular.  There should be a mechanism in place so that when people reach the age of 55 they are automatically notified by the Department of their PRSI contributions record since they entered insurable employment so that people can make an informed decision on how to go forward.  The S-class contribution for self-employed people must also be examined and changed.</p> <p> Community Employment, CE, schemes have been of huge benefit to communities all over the country.  They have also been hugely beneficial to those who have participated in them.  However, a lot of CE supervisors and managers, when they began 20 or 25 years ago, expected to be paid a pension when they retired but they have found that none is available.  They are only entitled to the State pension.  The Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Catherine Byrne, met a number of sectoral interests today to discuss social inclusion and cohesion.  When people reach 62 or 63, they are taken off CE schemes because of the rules and are left only with jobseeker's allowance.  It is hugely difficult for them to find full-time mainstream employment.  Allowance should be made within the CE schemes for such people.  They are coming to the end of their working lives and if they want to stay on a CE scheme, which is contributing to their community as well to their own well-being, they should be allowed to do so.  </p> <p>  I now wish to speak about T&uacute;s, the rural social schemes and farm assist.  The relaxation of the rules with regard to the latter, particularly this year, are very welcome.  The Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Deputy Andrew Doyle is in the House this evening and he is fully aware of the perfect storm that raged this year in terms of farm incomes.  All sectors were affected including sheep, beef and dairy, while our tillage farmers had an horrendous harvest on the back of already reduced incomes.</p><p>The change in the criteria is very welcome but there needs to be further change because the rural social scheme and the farm assist scheme in particular keep families, including young families, in rural communities and maintain their income level in such a way as to provide for their families in a proper way.  We need to look at that and make sure it is really being targeted.  </p> <p> The T&uacute;s scheme came out a number of years ago.  Some people would ask what difference is there between the T&uacute;s scheme and the community employment scheme and whether the two of them should be working in tandem or as one.  Fifteen years ago, there was a major effort to change the community employment scheme into a labour activation scheme.  There is significant room in respect of T&uacute;s and the rural social scheme.  By and large, the dignity of the participants has been upheld on the community employment schemes.  It is vitally important that when people leave a T&uacute;s scheme or the rural social scheme, they believe they have bettered themselves in a way that will benefit them, their families and society.  The Department should look at that, cast a critical eye over T&uacute;s and other schemes and make sure the participants really believe in it and have a sense of dignity coming off it.  </p> <p> In respect of where we go with social welfare, people out there will say that too much social welfare is being paid.  We must accept that 15% of this society is not engaged in society at all, finds it very difficult to get engaged in society, depends on payments for their entire living and that possibly two or three generations are involved.  We have many challenges relating to the money side.  We need funds for a raft of issues such as the health service, the trolley issue, the needs of the Department of Education and Science and pay.  What the most vulnerable people - the least well off - need more than anything else is hope.  We have seen families where two or three generations have been outside the workforce.  You see some of them getting back into it and the pride it has brought back into those families, particularly over the past number of years.  We must develop policies because 75% of society will be able to look after itself in the best way possible and if we have a balanced and caring society, that will pick them up but there are people who feel completely alienated from society regardless of whether it is school, communities, sport, drama or anything else.  We must be as radical as Donogh O'Malley was in the 1960s when he brought in free education.  He brought in a raft of people who increased the worth of society on a massive scale and benefitted their families and communities in a major way.  We must tackle that issue.  There are parts of Dublin and every city, small town and village where a certain cohort finds it very difficult and is becoming more and more marginalised.  There has been a lot of work done in respect of resource and community centres and trying to get people on to various schemes.  I visited one of the resource centres in Dublin this morning to try to resolve an issue for somebody.  I looked at the cross-section of people who came in.  I was there for the bones of an hour and a half doing some transactions for people.  They were all vulnerable people such as young mothers with children trying to access services, elderly and frail people and people with different health issues.  Some people would say "God helps those who help themselves" and that kind of nonsensical rubbish but I do think we must become more caring and make sure these people are brought along with it.  </p> <p> I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me a good few minutes to speak on the Social Welfare Bill 2016.  The number one issue for me is that all schemes that require medical certification when they go into the Department need to be hurried up.  It is simply not acceptable to think that someone has to wait 16 weeks for the carer's allowance with all the benefits to the State and the human being needing care that follows from the carer's allowance.  It is not good enough in this day and age.  Could the Department or Minister clarify the reason for this before this debate concludes tomorrow?  Other issues include the expansion of the community employment schemes, the rural social scheme, T&uacute;s and the issue of PRSI.  The way women in particular have been treated in respect of averaging is grossly unfair but other people are affected as well.  People come with records.  I know of some people who would have worked very early in their lives, particularly from a farming point of view, in sugar factories and elsewhere and would have gone on to have no contributions while they worked the farm until the compulsory contributions were introduced in 1988.  They would be outside any State pension whatsoever because of having worked part-time in the early 1950s even though they have PRSI contributions paid.  Many people would have paid PRSI but would be outside it because of their 56th birthday.  Could the Minister come back into the House and clarify what is the policy in respect of medical certification by the chief medical officer in the Department before we conclude this debate?  </p></speech>

I spoke in this House on the Revised Estimates for social welfare earlier this year and spoke about looking beyond the broad figures and at the reality of people's lives.  In my constituency of Dublin Bay North, I see what people are facing every day and it is a difficult reality.  Seeing the reality of people&rsquo;s lives was, unfortunately, not mirrored in the policy behind the Bill.  It does not effectively deal with the people who most require the assistance of the State.</p>  <p>  It is relevant to look beyond the figures and, most importantly, to look at the purpose of this Bill.  Surely at its heart, this Bill should be about protection of the most vulnerable.  It should be about providing the moneys of the State in a fair and equitable manner as the words "fair and equitable" were sent around willingly by Ministers in recent weeks.  This Bill should be about addressing inequalities and aiding those most in need of aid.  What it should be about and what it is about are, unfortunately, different in action.  Although some provisions are welcome and will be welcomed by those who suffered previous cuts in their payments, we believe this Bill does not achieve the end result of fairness and falls considerably short in addressing the major inequalities in society.</p><p>A more equal society, if that is the intention of the Government, would recognise the different needs of different groups and attempt to address these needs, rather than see a figure on a page and simply increase it for political ends to suit a new political arrangement among its brothers.</p> <p> Not only is the Bill largely unfair in content for the people it affects, but it is also unfair in application.  For instance, pensioners and others must wait a little over four months for their payment in March.  Considering news last week of the lengthy waiting times for social welfare payments in the first place, does the Minister and his Department like to people to wait?  They wait in anticipation for a disappointing amount.  In reading the various amendments the Bill proposes, Members of this House, and particularly Government Members, must remember the effect, or more importantly the lack of effect, this Bill will have in people's lives.</p> <p> If we are to look at the figures contained in the Schedule of the Bill, we must be conscious of other figures, such as the high consistent child poverty rate in this State of 11.2%.  One in four lone-parent families in this country are seeking the services of organisations such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and Barnardos.  There is a consistent child poverty rate of 22.1% in lone-parent families.  In what way does this Bill address child poverty? </p> <p> What effect will &euro;2.70 have on those aged under 24 when we take the figure on the page and place it into people's everyday expenses?  This group continues to suffer and has suffered previous horrendous cuts to their social welfare payments.  We know of the high rate of homelessness among the under-24s.  Focus Ireland has stated that "Young people who are homeless can be prevented from moving on into independent living due to the unintended consequences of the reduced rate of social welfare paid..."  Many young people who become homeless are trapped in emergency accommodation for long periods.  How does the Bill address this problem for these young people?</p> <p> As I said, the first rise in certain social welfare payments in many years is welcome.  However, the broad dusting of payments is not.  In terms of this broad approach, where are the priorities in the Bill?  The Minister could have done things differently.  For example, in the budget, the Government indirectly gave 2,000 people &euro;20 million with the increase in the inheritance tax threshold.  Let us compare this with the Sinn F&eacute;in proposal in our alternative budget to increase the fuel allowance which would have cost the State &euro;27 million.  An estimated 28% of households are suffering from fuel poverty.  As we are debating the Bill tonight, people are cold in their homes.</p> <p> Another proposal from Sinn F&eacute;in was to reverse one of the most cynical, cruel and heartless cuts of the previous Government, which would have cost &euro;15 million.  I refer to the bereavement grant.  This payment was intended to assist families at their most difficult of times as they struggle to pay for funeral expenses.</p> <p> The policy approach seems to be one-size-fits-all, suggesting, "There you go, lads, we're all happy".  However, many advocacy groups dealing with poverty would question the Bill's fairness and equity.  Social Justice Ireland has stated that the budget overall favoured the wealthiest and that it did not take any significant steps to address inequalities in society.  Sinn F&eacute;in proposed a completely different approach.  We would have sought a greater rise in social welfare rates for the under-26s, an increase in the fuel allowance and changes to the transition State pension as well as looking after those living alone and those with disabilities.</p> <p> I am not being disrespectful in saying this but does the Minster actually see the problems people are facing?  If not, I invite him to my constituency to see at first hand the difficulties people are facing on a daily basis and how the Bill will affect them.  As this Bill passes, we must be conscious of the type of society we are creating.  The Government needs to consider the message it is portraying and what the most vulnerable mean to it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-11-09a.408" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1266" speakername="Kathleen Funchion" time="21:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016110900064#NNN00200"><p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill and I thank Deputy Mitchell for sharing her time.</p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in advocated for an equality-proofed budget and this was reflected in the proposals we made in our alternative budget for 2017.  We said from the start that fairness needed to be at the heart of the budget.  We said that given that some financial improvements had happened across some parts of the country, the Government needed to seize that opportunity to begin using money wisely and to reduce the cost of living for people while investing in proper public services.  Next year needed to be a year of change and while the budget announced in October included a few tokenistic gestures, it did very little to tackle head on the <i>status quo</i>of our State's ongoing crises.</p><p>The increase to the one-parent family payment from January 2017 is welcome, but the overall negative impact of budget 2017 on lone parents, many of whom are on the poverty line, must be acknowledged.  As Deputy Mitchell already mentioned, we know that lone parent families are the poorest in Ireland.  We know that the consistent poverty rate is 7.9% for children in two-parent families but rises by almost three times, to 22.1%, for children in one-parent families.  These children and families are in particular need of assistance.</p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in proposed to raise the cut off age of the one-parent family payment to 12 years and increase the earnings disregard to &euro;120.  The Government, while increasing the payment to &euro;110, kept the cut-off age at seven, which completely ignores the barriers faced by lone parents trying to access work.  The decision also refuses to acknowledge that any ten, 11 or 12 year old child, as any parent will know, is no less a child than a seven year old.  If anything, the cost to support and provide for a child usually rises as the child grows.</p><p>The &euro;500 per year for parents in receipt of the back-to-education allowance is welcome, but when pitted against the high cost of child care for lone parents, particularly when there has been no indication of caps for the services used, one Government allowance is cancelled out by another extortionate cost such as child care.</p><p>Low pay and precarious work have become an undeniable part of Ireland's labour market.  Unemployment among our youth continues at high levels.  The &euro;5 increase to the jobseeker payment is only for those aged 26 years and over.  We know that people aged 18 to 24 will receive an increase of &euro;2.70 and those aged 25 will receive an increase of &euro;3.80.  In no way does this provide any relief for our young unemployed people who are struggling to survive with increasing living costs year on year.  It is somewhat ironic that we are discussing small increases of &euro;2.70, &euro;3.80 or &euro;5 via this Bill in the aftermath of debating a motion last night for an increment of &euro;5,000 for TDs and Senators.  The amounts are vastly different.  Is it any wonder that the public is annoyed when social welfare recipients need to wait until March 2017 for the extra &euro;5  and the minimum wage has gone up by the grand total of ten cent?</p> <p> I welcome the Bill&rsquo;s commitment to increase school meals funding to &euro;47.7 million in 2017 which will see an extra 50,000 children benefit.  This cannot distract from the fact that 2,426 children are homeless right now as we debate this tonight.  We have been told by many child advocacy groups and agencies that budget 2017 will not make much of a dent in the atrociously high child poverty figures and we are particularly disappointed by the education budget decisions which will do little to help struggling families.  While there have been a few positives moves made in this Bill, unfortunately it will not go very far to assist the families who are struggling and in poverty tonight.</p></speech>

Other proposed measures included reinstating the State pension transition and we would have also restored the pension bands to their pre-2012 rates.  The focus of reinstating the pension bands was to address a major inequality for pensioners.  Under the Government's budget women remain at a particular disadvantage on retirement.  The changes made to pension bands by the Fine Gael and Labour Government resulted in thousands of people, predominantly</p><p>women, finding their weekly payment short of expectations come retirement age.  This meant that a pre-2012 pensioner could get a pension of some &euro;30 higher than a post-2012 pensioner with the same contributions.  The Government knew this - the measure has been in place since 2012 - and still it has failed utterly to act in the interests of this group.</p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in raised the anomaly of the State pension transition in our alternative budget.  It has not been acted upon in this Bill, but we proposed to reinstate the State pension transition which was abolished in 2014.  The current situation leaves people, who are faced with forced retirement at the age of 65, to claim jobseeker's payment - with its various obligations.  These people should not have to face this.  They have worked all their lives.  They deserve and are entitled to their pension but this Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il Government believe that these people are not permitted to their well-earned pension in the later stage of their lives as they look forward to their retirement.  What will the &euro;5 rise mean to those people, predominantly women, affected by the changes in contributions in 2012?  What will it mean to those pensioners forced on the dole queue come the age of 65?  We hope the Government will address these changes and put them right.  It is awfully disappointing that the Government has not addressed these measures in the Bill but hopefully it will see the error of its ways, see that women are those who are predominantly affected by this and bring in measures to correct it.</p></speech>

This was not just a very low blow to unemployed people at a time when jobs were particularly scarce, it was also a direct attack on the young adults of Ireland.  It was a loud and clear message from the Government to the generation that had been failed by Fianna F&aacute;il, by the policies it cheer-led and by the bailout plan followed dutifully by that party.  The message said to young people "Get out, we do not want you and if you do not leave you had better be prepared to bend the knee, doff the cap and prostrate yourself before exploiters who refuse to pay a decent or even a legal wage."  What followed was the arrival of yellow pack and unpaid work in its droves.  To be more correct this was not work; it gave no dignity and rewarded barely survival.  It was drudgery.  That was what was offered to the young people of Ireland who had their future pissed away by the Seanie Fitzes and their Fianna F&aacute;il buddies.  The Government cut the telephone allowance, the bereavement grant and household benefit.  Now they would have us think the good times are rolling in again.  Well certainly the other side of the Chamber must think the good times are rolling.  The Government thinks it is time to cut taxes for high earners, time to give back more USC to the better off - who are probably more liable - than to the worse off and time to cut capital gains tax which is a tax most people in the State would never be lucky enough to even have the chance to pay, unlike the Government's cronies who get crafty accountants to weasel them out of paying it.</p>  <p>  The Members of the elite who make up this House, who already earn far above the average wage before expenses are even considered, have arranged a handsome pay rise for themselves of &euro;100 per week, and it was spoken much of this week.  What have young people and pensioners got to celebrate in these times of glory? Nothing.  The Government has given them a measly fiver and &euro;2.70 a week, respectively.  That could probably cover a pint or a takeaway coffee.  You are very generous.  Surely this is a welfare state that typifies human dignity; pensioners left scraping to survive and the young unemployed left to live in despair or debase themselves for a zero hour contract to drudge, where the best they can hope for is minimum wage-----</p></speech>

I believe the principles and values are dignity, equality, inclusiveness and a sufficient income so that everybody can live in dignity.  If that is the vision then budgets have to be measured in how they contribute to that vision.  The economic, fiscal and tax policies determine the kind of society that we live in.  Where do this budget and its measures fit into that vision?  The figures for the social welfare allowance payments are going in the right direction, which is upwards, and that makes a really big difference from the downwards direction during the budgets of recent years.  There are aspects of the Bill to be welcomed such as the Christmas bonus which is up to 85% this year, and hopefully it will be 100% next year.  That particular cut caused an awful lot of difficulty in the communities I represent especially when people's only payment is a social welfare payment and they have the additional cost and expense of Christmas to deal with.  The &euro;5 increase across the board is better than a &euro;5 decrease.  Unfortunately it is not coming until March.  Other aspects to be welcomed include extending eligibility for the invalidity pension to the self-employed.  I believe that the school meals funding increase is also very valuable.  It is vital particularly for those additional numbers of children who are coming from hostels, bed and breakfast accommodation and hotel accommodation.  It is good that the measure is also extended to non-DEIS schools because there are children who are disadvantaged but are not exclusively to confined to DEIS schools.  I welcome also the education allowance and the proportionate increase for qualified adult dependants for the self-employed, the benefits for rural Ireland and the protection of the fuel allowance and the free travel for older people.  I see the investment in child care such as the early years funding and the affordable child care.  I know there are criticisms from the stay-at-home parents and I am sure that the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Katherine Zappone will take those comments on board, but it should be noted that the Children's Rights Alliance has said that this measure was a fair attempt to address the needs of children living in poverty.</p><p>There are also increases in the employment programmes, and I want to mention community employment because it has been so beneficial in communities in Dublin Central, but it has been a struggle in recent years to get people to go on it because of the drastic cut to the financial incentive.  For some people, availing of community employment costs more than they received and there is an additional cost for them.  It is vital for participants in second chance education, further education, child care and personal development, not to mention the essential services they provide in the communities where they live.  Sometimes people and their needs get lost in the statistics on gross national income and GDP.<br/><br/>When speaking on budgets, we constantly make the point there is a need for equality proofing and a need to measure quality of life.  The question is whether these budgets will contribute to or take from the quality of life.  While all the increases are welcome, particularly after the horrendous budgets of recent years, it will take quite a long time to redress these cuts.<br/><br/>There is a roadmap to 2030, and it is a roadmap to ending poverty and protecting the planet, but is also about dignity for adults living in poverty, those living with a disability, mental or physical, those who are homeless, Travellers, the new communities, prisoners, those in addiction and those in recovery from addiction.  The measures have been introduced, but there is a need to evaluate and monitor them constantly.<br/><br/>My main criticism is on spreading the net so widely that it will be of minimal impact generally.  It is a case of a little for everyone versus a lot for one particular sector.  For me, this one sector is those with a mental or physical disability.  People tell me the USC cut means they will receive 90 cent extra a week.  This will not make any difference and there are similar examples to this.<br/><br/>Before the budget, disability groups told us that more than 70% of people using disability services state it is difficult or very difficult to live on their income.  We know people with a disability find it difficult, if not next to impossible, to get employment.  They are half as likely to be employed as others.  Therefore, they are dependent on social welfare.  Many tell us the disability allowance is barely enough to live on.  People with disabilities have additional costs because of the disability.  We need to look at the fuel allowance, because someone with a physical disability is not be able to move around and spends longer at home in one particular place.  The fuel allowance does not take this into account.<br/><br/>The Disability Federation Of Ireland felt there was a real opportunity for a focused impact in the budget on funding for people with disabilities, but this was not taken.  Senator John Dolan expressed his criticisms, making the point that 600,000 people and their families are being denied access to basic services and supports or having such access rationed.  They called for a &euro;20 increase weekly to meet the extra daily cost, but they did not get it or anything near it.  They acknowledged the positives, but the disappointment is with not taking the chance to make a real difference to this group and the chance to kick-start the recovery of those with a disability.  I also want to discuss a payment which is not social welfare but is related.  This is the grant for housing adaptations, especially for people with a disability.  A total of &euro;30 million had been sought.  There is a need for more cross-departmental communication and co-operation.<br/><br/>In his speech on 1 November, the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, stated that budget and social welfare measures aim to ensure everyone benefits from the recovery and that the ESRI had already shown that budget 2017 contains the greatest benefits for the least well-off, but the ESRI has shown it is the poorest 10% who have paid more than any age group.  I do not think this has been addressed in the budget.<br/><br/>Social Justice Ireland indicated a &euro;6.50 increase to all social welfare payments was needed to combat inflation.  It also stated there was need to look at the basic payment, <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the increases in inflation.  I often think with payments, and with requests for pay increases which we see so much of at present, the debate should also be about the cost of living because so many times a pay increase can be given with one hand but the cost of living increases and the pay increase is completely negated.  We do not have enough debate on how we can contain our cost of living.  Perhaps this is something for the new budget committee.<br/><br/>There have been larger gains for those on the higher incomes compared with those on lower incomes.  For example, a single unemployed person will gain approximately &euro;95 yearly while a single employed person gains approximately &euro;1,000.  The unemployed couple will gain &euro;157 and the employed couple will gain &euro;1,500.  All gains are very welcome, but they must be proportionate to need.  To go back to Social Justice Ireland, its figures show a single person earning &euro;25,000 will gain &euro;127 but a single person on &euro;75,000 will gain &euro;352.  It suggested that for the same amount of money a tax credit could have been refundable.<br/><br/>The minimum wage increase amounts to 10 cent per hour.  We know thousands of people live in poverty.  The new hourly minimum wage of &euro;9.25 is almost 25% below the living wage of &euro;11.50.  It is very alarming that one in every six people in Ireland, which is 750,000 people, live on an income below the poverty line, and I go back to the point on the cost of living.  Of these, 250,000 are children who are either in low-income households or are homeless.  The test is whether the budget will see a decrease in these numbers, and perhaps this time next year, if we are all still here, we will be applauding the fact we are seeing these decreases.<br/><br/>I welcome the initiatives, which are going in the right direction.  Most people will benefit to some degree, but I must question where the benefit would have made a difference, which is why our budgets must be rooted in human rights.</p></speech>

It is the first Social Welfare Bill in many years where a Government was able to give something, even though small, back to the people after such a long hard haul.  There is no use in people saying one group experienced hardship more than another.  Everybody experienced hardship, including those who are young, those who are unemployed, those are middle aged, those who are elderly and, in particular, those with special needs, as Deputy O'Sullivan stated.  They continued this battle in the coldest and hardest of times.  They fought on in the hope things would get better.  Eventually they are beginning to turn and they are getting better.</p>  <p>  It is a shame we cannot repay them all at the same time because unfortunately we cannot do this.  It is all very fine for people to say if we did this and increased taxes and did several other things, it would be much better and we would be able to recover overnight.  I am afraid if we tried the option of recovering overnight, we would find ourselves back where we were before.  Sadly and unfortunately, if we find ourselves back in that particular trench it will not be so easy to get out of it the next time.  It was not easy to get out of it the last time.</p>  <p>  I congratulate the Minister, all parties and participants in the Government and the Opposition on their positive comments.  We must move away from suggesting to the people there was a different route and an easier way, and that if we did not have to pay bondholders or we did not have to pay back debts, we need not have gone in this direction.  In fact this is not the way it was.  Before the full effects of the downturn in the economy hit the country, I and everybody else in the House was inundated with phone calls from people inquiring about what was likely to happen to the few shillings of savings they had because, suddenly, they began to get worried about the few euro they had put away for their old age.  When the bank guarantee came about, I was not in favour of it, as my colleagues will remember, because I felt things had happened outside of our control, as a result of which we were all going to pay.  However, I knew that if we did not do it, there would be consequences which would be ten times worse than what befell the country eventually.  There is no sense in trying to get away from this.  We are misleading the people if we try to tell them there was an easier way and it need not have been as bad as it was.  This is wrong.  There was a worse way, and if we had gone that other way, it would have been worse and we would have found ourselves trying to explain to people why they were rifling the dustbins to survive.</p></speech>
