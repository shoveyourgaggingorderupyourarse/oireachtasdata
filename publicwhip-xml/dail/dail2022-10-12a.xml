I am disappointed that the Minister for Transport, Deputy Ryan, was not able to make it.  I have raised this issue previously, most recently with the T&aacute;naiste in this Chamber in September and at committee meetings last year.</p>  <p>  Specifically on the Go-Ahead bus service, my office is inundated with complaints from customers.  It is not just the 63, 59, 45A, 111 or 75 routes in D&uacute;n Laoghaire; it is Go-Ahead bus services across the greater Dublin area.  Just yesterday, for example, the 16.56 and the 17.38 services on the 18 route to Palmerstown were cancelled.  On Monday, a woman was left to wait for more than an hour for the 17.05 service on the 175 route, which was cancelled.  Another man was left waiting for more than an hour in Kilmacanogue because the 13.10, the 13.30 and the 13.50 bus services to D&uacute;n Laoghaire on the 45A route did not show up.  When he contacted Go-Ahead, he was told that the 14.13 service was also being cancelled and that he would have to wait until 14.33.  That is a wait of more than an hour and a half for a service that is meant to run every 20 minutes.  It  is completely unacceptable.</p>  <p>  I could list a dozen more examples from this week alone.  As I said, I am disappointed that the Minister is not here to take this matter.  I wonder if he is aware of how bad the Go-Ahead bus service has become and the significant impact this is having on people&rsquo;s lives, particularly those of his constituents in Dublin Bay South.  My Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues across Dublin and I will continue to raise this issue until we see a resolution and an improvement in the Go-Ahead bus service.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-12a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1568" speakername="Paul McAuliffe" time="09:12:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022101200003#A00500"><p>Deputy Devlin provided a litany of buses that have been cancelled.  Thankfully, Go-Ahead only operates one bus in our area, the N6, although many would say that one is enough.  It does not seem to be able to fulfil the contract that has been given to it.  That is significant.  When a person is standing at a bus stop at 7.50 a.m., has to be in work for 9 a.m. and the first time a bus arrives at the stop is at 9.10 a.m. - nearly 55 minutes later - that person is already ten minutes late for work and will arrive in at 9.45 a.m.  That is happening on a consistent basis.</p>  <p>  The National Transport Authority, NTA, has issued fines to Go-Ahead, LUAS and Dublin Bus, amounting to nearly &euro;5 million.  That is welcome to send the signal that it is not acceptable for them to cancel bus services.  However, nobody wants to hand out fines to transport companies.  We want them to collect their passengers and to be able to deliver the services that they promised to deliver.  Go-Ahead promised that it would have a service for local people on the N6 route.  It told us its issue is staffing, and I understand that anybody can have staffing concerns.  The real difficulty is that the new N6 replaces two previous routes, namely, the N6 and the N4, one which was operated by Dublin Bus and the other by Go-Ahead.  The Dublin Bus service powers ahead past the interchange at Finglas village.  Meanwhile, there are five or six buses left waiting by Go-Ahead in the middle of Finglas village, where it has located its new canteen.  Not only is it not providing the service, it is also blocking up the village.  There are many complaints from the local Tidy Towns group, disability activist groups and so on.  There cannot be a bus depot in the middle of a village.  It is just not safe for pedestrians or cyclists and it is not good for congestion.  As I said, I know this is about drivers.  However, a company should not tender for service if it is not able to provide it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-12a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1578" speakername="Hildegarde Naughton" time="09:12:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022101200003#A00600"><p>I would like to thank Deputies McAuliffe and Devlin for giving me the opportunity to discuss this issue on behalf of the Minister.  I understand that the Deputies' questions are in relation to ongoing issues with the provision and reliability of bus services provided in Dublin, in particular those services provided by Go-Ahead Ireland.  I further understand that the issue of service reliability with Go-Ahead Ireland routes was previously raised by several Deputies in recent weeks during Topical Issue debates and parliamentary questions.</p>  <p>  The Department has responsibility for policy and overall funding in respect of public transport.  However, the Department is not involved in the day-to-day operation of public transport services nationally, including those public service obligation, PSO, routes in Dublin currently operated by Go-Ahead Ireland or other operators.  It is the NTA that has statutory responsibility for securing the provision of public passenger transport services nationally by way of public transport services contracts and for the allocation of associated funding to the relevant transport operators.  As the Deputies know, PSO services are socially necessary but financially unviable services and the PSO programme represents a significant expenditure of taxpayers' money.  Currently, the vast majority of PSO bus services are provided by either Dublin Bus or Bus &Eacute;ireann through what are known as direct award contracts.  The remaining routes are operated by Go-Ahead Ireland, which entered the market in September 2018 as part of Government's commitment to open up the bus market through a programme of tendering known as bus market opening.</p>  <p>  A key Government objective is to provide all citizens with reliable and realistic sustainable mobility options, and transport plays a key role in delivering this goal.  To support this objective, in budget 2022, the Department of Transport secured approximately &euro;538 million of funding for PSO and Local Link services this year.  The Department recently secured &euro;563 million in budget 2023 for the continuation of these essential PSO services and for the continuation of both the 20% average fare discount and the young adult card.</p>  <p>  In the context of the Deputies' specific questions on ongoing issues with the provision and reliability of bus services provided in Dublin, and in particular those provided by Go-Ahead Ireland, the NTA has advised that the performance of all public transport operators is closely monitored by the authority as part of the contractual arrangements in place between it and the operators.</p>  <p>  Go-Ahead Ireland is not alone in experiencing these issues.  Many operators in the public transport sector are facing similar challenges with staffing, both because of Covid-19-related absences and with regard to recruiting new drivers.  The public transport industry has been particularly hard hit with driver shortages as operators attempt  to return to pre-pandemic levels of activity as well as deliver intended service improvements.  However, while these staffing issues are being experienced across the system by both commercial and PSO operators, it is also true that Go-Ahead Ireland is experiencing higher than normal levels of Covid-related staff absences that are impacting on service delivery, with a number of services not operating as scheduled.</p>  <p>  I understand that the NTA is working closely with bus operators, including Go-Ahead Ireland, to try to mitigate the impact of the driver shortage through extensive driver recruitment campaigns, engagement with the Road Safety Authority, RSA, regarding the testing and licence process of new bus drivers and by working with the operator to minimise service cancellations, ensure first- and last-service buses operate and on low-frequency routes to avoid, where possible, the cancellation of consecutive low-frequency services.</p> <p>Before coming into the Chamber, I got updated information from the NTA that Go-Ahead has indicated that it will have the adequate number of drivers by December of this year.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-12a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1481" speakername="Cormac Devlin" time="09:22:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022101200004#B00200"><p>I thank the Minister of State for the update, the majority of which was contained in the response I received yesterday from the Department, which is welcome.  A parallel I would draw is the issue of Go-Ahead experiencing higher than normal levels of Covid-related staff absences.  We wish Covid on nobody but I do not understand how that company seems to have a worse number of cases of Covid than any other operator.  It is having a serious impact on commuters.  From the Minister's perspective, there is a kind of a hands-off approach to public transport in Dublin in particular, and that is leaving it to the NTA.  That approach is not working.  I contrast that with the issues during the summer at the Dublin Airport Authority, which the Minister of State herself worked on.  That political pressure resolved the issues.  Between the NTA and the Department, pressure needs to be applied to ensure we do not wait until Christmas.  People have jobs to get to between now and Christmas and they need to get there on time and to have a reliable bus service.  It is very important that this is done, and done quickly.  Furthermore, if the issues continue in regard to Go-Ahead, I and Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues like Deputy McAuliffe will be back again.  People need safe, efficient, high-quality bus transport.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-12a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1568" speakername="Paul McAuliffe" time="09:22:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022101200004#B00300"><p>I welcome the news that Go-Ahead will have its full complement by Christmas.  As I said from the beginning, if a company tendered for a service, it should be in a position to deliver it.  In that context, we should not be playing catch-up, particularly where people's lives are concerned.  We only have to look at the discrepancy between the number of routes Dublin Bus operates and the number Go-Ahead operates.  Dublin Bus received fines of &euro;1.5 million whereas Go-Ahead, with a fraction of the bus services of Dublin Bus, received fines of &euro;850,000.  I appreciate that there are staff shortages right across the economy; it is because the economy is growing fast, which is to be welcomed.  However, we have to look at what the manpower issues are in the transport industry.  We are getting similar concerns from Dublin Bus on the 40 bus route, where buses are again being cancelled.  If this is widespread, we are going to have to examine the terms, the conditions and the working environment.  Of course, Covid impacts those people on the front line but there is nothing new about that and we have known about it for some time.  Operators like Go-Ahead should have done far more far sooner.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-12a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1578" speakername="Hildegarde Naughton" time="09:22:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022101200004#B00400"><p>I thank the Deputies.  I will be raising the issues they have raised with the Minister.  I want to reassure them that the NTA is engaging regularly with Go-Ahead Ireland and other public transport operators in regard to any service provision issues on the PSO network, and the NTA is providing regular updates to the Department of Transport in regard to these issues.  I can also confirm that, as part of the NTA&rsquo;s contractual performance monitoring system with operators, issues of poor reliability and punctuality performance can result in financial penalties for those operators.  As the Deputies referenced, the NTA formally administers sanctions and penalties.  The NTA also formally meets with Go-Ahead on a weekly basis to review performance-associated customer feedback and driver recovery plans, and it will continue to closely monitor the situation.</p>  <p>  In respect of the specific issues being experienced regarding service reliability, the NTA has advised that it has raised these with Go-Ahead Ireland and will continue to monitor and engage closely with the operator in an effort to improve the situation.  As Deputies have noted, penalties were previously applied to Go-Ahead Ireland for quarter 4 of 2021 and quarter 1 of 2022, amounting to &euro;266,968 and &euro;209,188 respectively.  Furthermore, public transport operators are forecasting improvements in reliability in the coming months.  This will depend on successful recruitment and retention of critical staff, in particular drivers.  It is hoped that this will help to resolve the current reliability issues being experienced.  I will ask the Minister to keep the Deputies updated in regard to the driver shortage.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-12a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1485" speakername="Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh" time="09:22:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022101200004#B00500"><p>This is similar to the previous topic.  It is strange the two were not grouped.  The matter concerns Go-Ahead bus services in my area, the 17 and 18 routes, and in other areas across the city.  A mistake was made when these services were privatised in the first place, but we are not going into that today.  If a schoolchild of 12 or 13 years of age is standing at 7 a.m. in the lashing rain, trying to go to secondary school in Rialto, and the bus does not turn up until an hour later, that is madness.  The same happens week in, week out.  There is nothing new in this.  Despite contacting Go-Ahead previously and despite the services pre-Covid being this bad, it has continued.  These are radial services and any other journey would double the time.  What is happening now is that most people are abandoning these services, which means they are unviable, and they have to rely on other services.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-12a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="09:22:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022101200004#B00600"><p>The level of service that is provided by Go-Ahead for the people I represent in north County Dublin is nothing short of disgraceful.  Buses are being cancelled at the very last minute and no explanation is being sent to passengers.  This means people are missing appointments and they are late for work and late for school.  It is happening constantly.  We have contacted Go-Ahead I do not know how many times and the answers we get are of absolutely no comfort at all.  I very much welcome what the Minister of State is saying in regard to recruitment but the company seems to be recruiting some of the most delicate drivers I have ever heard of.  The level of sick leave and Covid seems to be disproportionately impacting the workers in Go-Ahead, and the Minister of State might want to look at that.  The simple fact is that Go-Ahead is not delivering on its contractual obligations.  That is the bottom line: it is being paid to deliver a service and it is not delivering that service.  The question for the Minister, were he to be in the House, is what he is prepared to do about it.  We do not need a description of the problem because we know what the problem is.  We want to hear from the Minister or the Minister of State what it is that they are going to do to resolve this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-12a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1585" speakername="R&eacute;ada Cronin" time="09:22:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022101200004#B00700"><p>I also want to talk about the Go-Ahead bus service, in my case the 120 service in north Kildare.  It is the bane of workers&rsquo; lives in north Kildare.  Workers are out in the cold at the crack of dawn, waiting for a bus that does not turn up, that just disappears, that is late or that is too full and will not let them on.  I know of several workers in north Kildare who are on late warnings from their employer and one on a final late warning because of the 120 bus and the absolutely appalling Go-Ahead service.  In particular, when we have a Green Party Minister as the head of the Department of Transport, and with climate collapse at our doorstep, it is unbelievable to think that we are depending on the private sector to provide a public service.  I will leave it at that because I only have a few minutes and that is because four of us from the Sinn F&eacute;in Party are here to bring up the Go-Ahead service.  It is a disgrace.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-12a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1507" speakername="Darren O'Rourke" time="09:22:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022101200004#B00800"><p>The poor standard of service provided by Go-Ahead is a huge issue and we can see that across the board.  My colleagues here this morning have given their own accounts but, in truth, as my party's transport spokesperson, wherever Go-Ahead operates, I have heard of problems from Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies, Senators, councillors and local area representatives.  It could be that the 184, 185, 45A, 238, L52, 115, 120, 33A or 33B - the list goes on.  Anywhere it operates, there are these challenges.  We know there are challenges but it is weasel words from the NTA that there are problems in the sector because there is a particular and pronounced problem with Go-Ahead.  In my own area, the 270 is a connecting route from Dunboyne that people use as part of their journey to school, work and hospital appointments, and it lets them down time and again without warning.  Go-Ahead must be held to account.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-12a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1578" speakername="Hildegarde Naughton" time="09:22:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022101200004#B00900"><p>I thank the Deputies for the opportunity to discuss further this issue.</p> <p>I understand that, similar to the issue raised by Deputies McAuliffe and Devlin, this matter relates to ongoing service delivery issues with bus services provided by Go-Ahead Ireland and the urgent need to address these.  The Department has responsibility for policy and overall funding in respect of public transport and is not involved in the day-to-day operation of public transport services nationally, including those PSO routes in Dublin currently operated by Go-Ahead Ireland and other operators.  It is the NTA that has statutory responsibility for securing the provision of public passenger transport services nationally by way of public transport services contracts and for the allocation of associated funding to the relevant transport operators.</p> <p> The majority of PSO bus services are provided by Dublin Bus or Bus &Eacute;ireann through what are known as direct award contracts, with the remaining routes being operated by Go-Ahead Ireland.  The Government is strongly committed to providing all citizens with reliable and realistic sustainable mobility options, and public transport plays a key role in the delivery of this goal.  The recently agreed budget 2023 helps to support this objective and is a further positive development for public transport passengers across the country.  We have extended the 20% fare reduction on PSO services so that everyone will benefit until the end of 2023, we have extended the 50% reduction available to young adults on PSO and commercial bus services until the end of 2023, and we are supporting new and enhanced bus and rail services throughout 2023.  These are all part of the &euro;563 million funding package to support PSO services.  This package is significant in the context of providing accessible and affordable transport options.</p> <p> Regarding the specific question on ongoing service delivery issues with bus services provided by Go-Ahead Ireland and the urgent need to address these issues, the NTA has advised that it is closely monitoring the performance of all public transport operators as part of the contractual arrangements in place between it and the operators.  The service reliability issues being experienced by Go-Ahead are not unique to that operator, with many operators in the public transport sector facing similar staffing challenges as a result of Covid-19 absences and the recruitment of new drivers.  However, while these staffing issues are being experienced across the public transport system, it is also true that Go-Ahead is particularly impacted by them and is experiencing higher-than-normal levels of Covid-19-related staff absences.  These absences are having a knock-on negative impact on the delivery of services, with a number of services not operating as scheduled.</p> <p> The NTA is engaging extensively with Go-Ahead on this issue.  Go-Ahead has told the NTA that it will have the full complement of drivers in place by December.</p></speech>

This does not have to do with Covid or staffing issues.  These problems have existed from the start, particularly on the 17 and 18 routes in my area.  They have always been known as a joke, but parents have to rely on them if they are going to work in one direction and their kids are going to school in another.  In the case of a woman who wrote to me last week, her kids were going to a bus stop at 7 a.m. to try to get to Col&aacute;iste Eoin and Col&aacute;iste &Iacute;osag&aacute;in, which are her closest schools and supposed to be on a direct route, but they cannot get there.  Other people cannot get to their hospital appointments or doctor appointments and others are being challenged at work because they cannot get to work.</p></speech>

People rely on these services but they have been left at the side of the road.  They have a choice at that point - to miss their hospital appointments or be late for work or to get into their cars and drive.  If something is not done about this, we will be forcing people into a situation where they will either be constantly late for work - the Minister of State knows what the consequences of this are - hospital appointments or school or they will be forced into their cars.  That is not acceptable.</p>  <p>  I am disappointed.  When I asked the Minister of State what she proposed to do about this, she gave us a long-winded description of the problem.  We know what the problem is.  We want to know what she is prepared to do about it.</p></speech>

I cannot go to constituents in Prosperous, Clane, Straffan and Celbridge with it.  There is no way that the Go-Ahead contract should be renewed.  The Minister of State mentioned in an earlier reply that Go-Ahead would have the full complement of drivers by the end of December, but the time to have the full complement was before it applied for the contract so that it knew it could fulfil that contract.  This shows that we cannot depend on the private sector to deliver public transport.</p></speech>

I assure Deputies that the NTA is engaging regularly with Go-Ahead Ireland on the service provision issues currently being experienced on the PSO network.  The NTA is also providing regular updates to the Department of Transport on these issues.</p>  <p>  Regarding poor reliability and punctuality performance issues, they can and have resulted in financial penalties for operators.  As part of the performance monitoring process, penalties were applied to Go-Ahead Ireland for quarter 4 of 2021 and quarter 1 of 2022 at &euro;266,968 and &euro;209,188, respectively.</p>  <p>  Regarding the specific issues being experienced with service reliability, I assure all Deputies that the NTA has raised these matters with Go-Ahead Ireland and will continue to monitor and engage closely with the operator in an effort to improve the situation.  I have no doubt that the Minister will keep Deputies up to date on the driver complement up to December.</p></speech>

As the Minister of State is aware, 16 private nursing homes have closed over the past 12 months alone.  There are more than 30,000 residents between public and private nursing homes.  Approximately 7,000 of them are in public nursing homes, with in excess of 23,000 in private ones.  The cost base of each nursing home varies, but the average for a public nursing home is approximately &euro;1,650 per bed per week whereas the average for a private nursing home is in excess of &euro;1,100 per bed per week.</p>  <p>  I will cite a study done on a nursing home.  In 2020, the wage and salary costs there were &euro;710 per bed per week.  In quarter 2 of 2022, they were &euro;864.  Direct costs increased from &euro;56 per bed per week to &euro;71 and the cost of lighting and heating increased from &euro;17 per bed per week to &euro;55.  According to the analysis of this single nursing home, the overall cost increased from &euro;912 per bed per week in 2020 to &euro;1,134 per bed per week in quarter 2 of 2022.  That was an increase of &euro;222.  Additional supports are needed.  Importantly, they must be introduced early.</p>  <p>  There is an issue that many people are not aware of, in that private nursing homes are paying for a number of items that are not paid for by public nursing homes.  Despite that, the public nursing homes' cost per bed per week is in excess of &euro;1,650.  For example, commercial rates are paid by private nursing homes whereas public ones do not need to pay them.  The average cost of commercial rates for a 50-bed private nursing home is more than &euro;40,000 per annum.  That cost is substantially higher in the Dublin area.  Some &euro;40,000 per annum is going to the local authority from a private nursing home whereas the public sector is not required to pay.</p> <p>Likewise, there are a whole host of costs, including light and heat.  The cost of wages in order to retain staff is extremely difficult.  If we want to prevent further nursing home closures in the next six months, additional supports need to be put in place at the earliest possible date.</p> <p> When a person is admitted to a private nursing home, there is an assessment of the fee that will be paid and the supports the person will get under the fair deal scheme.  I understand that does not vary even if the patient needs a greater standard of care two or three years later, whereas in a public nursing home that changes.  Public and private nursing homes provide the best standard of care to their patients.  It is extremely important that we put in place the additional supports at the earliest possible date.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-12a.33" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1484" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="09:42:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022101200006#D00200"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  I am taking this matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Mary Butler.  The Government is conscious of the financial challenges faced by the nursing home sector, in particular inflationary cost increases.  The Department of Health is bringing forward appropriate responses.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State is aware that a number of nursing homes have closed this year.  The closure of any nursing home reduces bed capacity and puts pressures on other local health and social care facilities, including acute hospitals.  Ensuring the welfare and safety of residents is secured when a nursing home closes is the most important thing and work to alleviate the concerns of residents must continue.  There is a legal requirement that providers must give at least six months' notice to HIQA if they intend to close.  This provides residents, families and the public health authorities the appropriate time to respond efficiently.</p>  <p>  As of 10 October, 16 nursing homes had closed, or had officially notified HIQA of their intention to close, since the start of 2022.  Over the same period, four new nursing homes have opened.  Gains in capacities this year have been effectively offset by the closures.  However, the Minister of State understands more capacity is expected to come on stream before year-end.  It is imperative that nursing homes manage potential cost pressures in line with regulatory and contractual responsibilities, maintaining the quality of care to the residents' lived experiences and comfort is not affected.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State announced, prior to budget day, that her priority over the past weeks had been to secure additional funding for budget 2023 to ensure the continuation of all services to high standard.  Long-term residential care will be supported through &euro;47 million in additional funding for the nursing home support scheme to maintain services and manage inflationary increases.</p>  <p>  The Government has provided substantial supports to the private and voluntary nursing sector over the course of the pandemic.  As the Deputy is aware, the Covid-19 temporary assistance payment scheme, TAPS, has been in place since the start of the pandemic and over &euro;144 million has been made available to date under the scheme.  The scheme has now been extended to the end of 2022 and will be refocused on inflationary energy costs, while continuing to support nursing homes that experience Covid-19 outbreaks.  Details have been finalised and these will be communicated in the coming days.</p>  <p>  A &euro;100 million inflationary fund in the Department of Health was announced in the budget, which is a once-off payment designed within the Department.  It will be rolled out before year-end to nursing homes.  In addition to TAPS, direct support has been provided by the HSE to private nursing homes in many areas, including the provision of PPE, serial testing and support with staffing.  In response to the strategic workforce challenges in nursing homes and healthcare sectors, a cross-departmental strategic workforce advisory group has been established.  The group has worked to a tight timeline and is currently finalising a report which will outline a set of recommendations for the consideration of the Minister of State, Deputy Butler.</p>  <p>  In the time I have left, I wish to advise the Deputy that I will bring his conversation on what public patients are receiving compared to what private nursing homes, on average, receive to the Minister of State, Deputy Butler.  He spoke about his constituency.  The average in my constituency for public nursing homes is &euro;1,450, whereas the private providers are lucky to achieve &euro;1,100.  There is a clear disparity between what is received in the public and private sectors.  To be very fair to the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, that is why she secured &euro;47 million in funding and will go back into negotiations.</p></speech>

I very much appreciate the work Deputy Butler has done since she became Minister of State regarding making sure funding is available.  The current pressure means that nursing homes would like if the Department came forward with proposals at the earliest possible date.</p>  <p>  We are discussing the opening of four new nursing homes, but 16 have closed.  The major change that is coming is that there are currently 760,000 people aged over 65 years but within eight years that figure will be 1 million, an increase of one-third.  If we are using the same comparable, we technically need 40,000 nursing home beds by 2030 if we want to increase the number of places by the same proportion.  I am not saying that we necessarily need to go down that road.  We also need to ensure we have adequate supports in respect of home care.</p>  <p>  I have come across a few families in the past number of weeks where family members have been in public hospitals for over six months, despite the fact that they should be in a nursing home.  No nursing home is prepared to take on particular patients.  The cost per bed per week in a public hospital is around &euro;7,500 to &euro;8,000.  It is something we need to examine.  We also need step down facilities within hospital grounds.  We have a significant problem with respite care and as a result people stay in hospitals for longer.  Step down facilities within the confines of hospital grounds mean that people can leave a hospital bed and enter a step down bed.  The cost of running such facilities is lower which means there is a saving to the State.  It is something the Department should take on board.</p>  <p>  It is important that we try to put in place additional supports for the private sector at the earliest possible date in order to make sure that we do not have any further closures over the next few months.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-12a.35" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1484" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="09:42:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022101200006#D00400"><p>Ensuring the welfare and safety of residents is secured when nursing homes close is the most important thing.  They and their families remain the continued focus of the Minister of State, Deputy Butler.  Maximum prices for individual nursing homes are agreed with the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, following negotiations based on NTPF cost criteria.  It carries out this role independently and there is no role for Ministers or the Department in these negotiations.</p>  <p>  Aside from the script from the Minister of State I genuinely think the NTPF needs to consider inflation, the cost of living and the crisis of retention in the sector.  To be honest, while I know there is no role for Ministers in the NTPF, it would be great if it listened to Ministers and articulated the need to take on board the cost of living, inflation and the retention crisis.  We know the biggest costs for nursing homes at the moment are food, energy and the wage retention.</p>  <p>  However, the Department has made significant additional support available to nursing homes, predominantly through the &euro;144 million paid out under the temporary assistance payment scheme.  The scheme continues and will now be refocused towards supporting inflationary costs as well as helping nursing homes mitigate Covid-19.  A budgetary uplift of &euro;47 million has been secured for nursing home funding in 2023.  That has to be welcomed.  It is a positive indication of funding that will go into the NTPF and the workload the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, has taken on to address this matter.</p>  <p>  Given the importance of nursing homes and the NHSS to the wider health and social care sector, with a budget of over &euro;1 billion and over 22,000 residents supported, it is essential that policy measures are examined with due care in order to ensure that Government objectives are delivered and to avoid unintended consequences.  I will take what the Deputy said about step down facilities back to the Minister of State.</p> <p>Perhaps we should be giving more respite beds to the nursing homes so that they can facilitate people in the community.</p></speech>

I want to make a few specific points about the escalating situation in County Tipperary.  Last Thursday night there was a large public meeting in Moyle Rovers GAA club, which illustrates the growing public concern about the levels of crime and criminal activity.</p>  <p>  The first point I want to make relates to the Garda Commissioner's decision to remove a chief superintendent from Tipperary.  We have always had a chief superintendent based in Thurles.  The county is 140 km long, stretching from Portumna to Carrick-on-Suir and for the Garda Commissioner to suggest that Tipperary does not need a superintendent is ludicrous.  Obviously, this will result in a reduction in the resources being deployed into Tipperary because we will not have a chief superintendent fighting our cause at the Garda Commissioner's table.  I cannot understand how a county the size of Tipperary can be left without a chief superintendent.  </p>  <p>  I am sure the Minister of State will say that this is an issue for the Garda Commissioner and is not within the Minister of Justice's remit but at the end of the day, we are elected by the people.  For the Garda Commissioner to decide that a county the size of Tipperary, stretching from Mullinahone to Limerick Junction and from Portumna to Carrick-on-Suir, does not need a chief superintendent is just not on.  This decision has to be revisited and addressed.  My understanding is that the chief superintendent has moved from Thurles in recent days and has been relocated to Limerick.</p>  <p>  The other issue I want to raise is our trespass laws.  We have a growing problem with people going around rural Ireland and getting up to various activities in rural areas.  Garda&iacute; say that they do not have the power to do this or that to tackle it.  We need to strengthen our trespass laws.  If someone is found on property without good reason, he or she must be prosecuted and the penalties need to be a lot more severe than they are currently.  People are going around rural areas under various umbrellas, including walking dogs and so on.  Illegal hunting is also going on and is a huge issue.  There are gangs with lurchers going around, engaging in illegal activities.  They are going around and gathering information which is definitely contributing to the crime spree.  I was talking to a man this morning whose tractors were emptied of diesel the other night.  Another constituent is being constantly called to by people who are going around the area on leisurely walks.  She is so afraid in her home now that she is sleeping in an outhouse.  She is convinced that she is going to be broken into and believes that if she is in an outhouse, at least she will be able to get away from these gangs.</p>  <p>  We need extra Garda resources and the legislation on trespass must be improved and strengthened.  If people are found in a place where they have no right to be, the penalties must be severe and serve as a proper deterrent against marauding gangs in rural areas.  In the last six months I have seen an increase in the number of people contacting my constituency offices who are seriously concerned for their safety.  We need to start with our trespass laws.  Furthermore, having no chief superintendent in our county is ridiculous.  Those two issues must be addressed.</p></speech>

It is important to say that often Ministers make commitments before Topical Issues are tabled and cannot change them.  That is why I am here.</p><p>I thank Deputy Cahill for raising these issues in the House today.  Rural communities deserve to be, and to feel, safe.  The Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland recognised that community safety is not solely the responsibility of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the Department of Justice but is a whole-of-Government responsibility.  The Government is committed to ensuring that everyone, whether they live in, work in or are just visiting a community are safe and feel safe and can enjoy all that the community has to offer.</p><p>High visibility policing is a crucial element in improving feelings of safety in communities.  As the Deputy will be aware, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been allocated a record &euro;2.14 billion for 2023.  This funding includes provision for the recruitment of up to 1,000 new Garda trainees and more than 400 civilian staff in 2023.  Budget 2023 also includes a &euro;5 million increase in the overtime budget for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to over &euro;100 million.  These budgetary measures will support high visibility policing to tackle crime and anti-social behaviour.</p><p>The Deputy will appreciate, of course, that the Garda Commissioner is, by law, responsible for the management and administration of Garda business and for determining the deployment of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na resources throughout the State.  The Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, is assured that Garda management keeps the distribution of resources under continual review in the context of policing priorities and crime trends to ensure their optimal use.  </p><p>The Deputy may be aware that on 30 September An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na launched this years' winter phase of Operation Thor, the Garda operation designed to prevent potential burglars from exploiting the reduced hours of daylight in winter months.  Since Operation Thor was first introduced in 2015, burglary and related offences have steadily declined and figures show that there has been a 36% reduction in the rate of such offences when compared to pre-Covid levels in 2019.  To date this year, there have been 6,100 residential burglaries reported, compared to 10,297 during the same period in 2019.</p><p>The Department of Justice is also delivering a range of measures, under its Justice Plan 2022, to improve community safety across the State including three pilot local community safety partnerships that will build upon the existing joint policing committee, JPC, structures to provide a modern, fit-for-purpose forum for community safety concerns.  The partnerships have a broader membership than the existing JPCs, including youth, new communities, voluntary sector and State agencies such as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the HSE, Tusla and others.  Nationwide roll out of the partnerships is scheduled for January 2024.  The Department is also drafting new legislation, including the new Policing, Security and Community Safety Bill, which represents the largest reform of policing in the State in a generation and will give effect to many of the recommendations of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.  Another measure is the community safety innovation fund, which has an initial outlay of &euro;2 million this year, increasing to &euro;3 million under budget 2023.  This fund will encourage the development of innovative ways to improve community safety from the people who best understand local community safety needs.  The Department also published a rural safety plan, which is available on <i>gov.ie/justice</i>.  The plan, which was launched by the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, at this year's National Ploughing Championships strengthens and enhances community safety initiatives.  </p><p>I assure the Deputy that the Minister for Justice is in contact with the Garda Commissioner on an ongoing basis in relation to concerns relating to criminal behaviour and community safety  Indeed, she met him only yesterday, 11 October, accompanied by her colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Browne and she will continue to prioritise this continual engagement.  I will raise the items that Deputy Cahill has raised here today with the Minister, namely, the lack of a chief superintendent in Tipperary and the trespass laws in the context of illegal hunting.</p></speech>

Anyone found on property who has no right to be there should face far more severe penalties.  Rural crime is not the only issue in my county.  There are also problems with anti-social behaviour in town centres, including Ballina, Nenagh and Clonmel.  I have had numerous complaints in the recent past about anti-social behaviour.  Our battle against drugs is the greatest challenge facing modern society.  I want to see more Garda resources being put in place to tackle this scourge on modern society.  I am not here to criticise garda&iacute;.  They are doing the best they can with scarce resources.  We need more resources because drugs are becoming a huge problem.  They have an enormous impact on mental health and, unfortunately, on suicide rates.  Anti-social behaviour in towns is a significant issue.  Old people are frightened in their homes and that is a situation that we cannot allow to continue.  Greater Garda resources and a greater Garda presence are the only way we can hope to combat that fear.  I thank the Minister of State for her reply but we have a serious hill to climb.</p> <p>We have to address these issues.  We have to tackle drug abuse and those dealing in drugs.  We have to face up to it.  It is now an issue at every crossroads.  In the past drugs were an issue only in the major urban centres but that day is long gone.  The abuse of drugs is happening in every corner of our country.  I want to see greater Garda resources put in place so we can really get to grips with the situation and bring to justice those who are profiting from people's misery and making serious money from it and bring the full brunt of the law to bear on them.</p></speech>

As I have already outlined, the Government is committed to ensuring An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the resources it needs.  We had an unprecedented allocation of more than &euro;2.1 billion in budget 2023.  Garda numbers are at the highest level with 14,283 members and 3,117 whole-time equivalent Garda staff nationwide as of 31 August.  Since the lifting of the moratorium on Garda recruitment in 2014 a total of 4,000 new Garda recruits have attested and been assigned mainstream duties nationwide.  I can confirm to the Deputy that the Tipperary division has, as of 31 August, which is the latest date for which figures are available, 399 members of all ranks assigned.  This is an increase of more than 12% since the end of 2015 when there were 354 members assigned to the division.  In the period from 2017 to 31 August 2022, 875 Garda members have been reassigned to operational roles under a Garda reassignment initiative.  A further 306 posts have been identified as suitable for civilian roles and redeployment.  The Minister, Deputy McEntee, welcomes the progress, which demonstrates An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's ongoing engagement on the programme for Government commitment to remove garda&iacute; from non-core duties to allow them to focus on policing matters, thereby prioritising visible policing in rural and all communities as the Deputy has mentioned.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-12a.44" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1564" speakername="Duncan Smith" time="10:02:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022101200008#F00300"><p>I move:</p> <blockquote> 	  	 <blockquote> 	That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann:<br /><br />recognises: <blockquote> 	&mdash; that until 2008 people employed in the community, voluntary and care sector, such as Section 39 workers, received pay increases under national wage agreements, but have not received pay increases since, and have no formal mechanism for collective pay bargaining;<br /><br />&mdash; the immeasurable contribution of independent non-State agencies in the community and voluntary sector, which provide a range of vital health and personal social services that the State has historically outsourced;<br /><br />&mdash; that these vital public services include Health Service Executive (HSE)-funded Section 39 organisations, Tusla-funded Section 56 organisations, Section 10 homeless services funded indirectly through the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and a broad range of community services like those managed by supervisors of the Community Employment Scheme, T&uacute;s and the Rural Social Scheme, where salaries are indirectly funded by the State; and<br /><br />&mdash; that without the continued active participation of these bodies there would be massive deficits in public services across a range of activities, including meeting the healthcare needs of both old and young, and of people with disabilities, provision of child and family services, accommodation and homeless assistance, dealing with substance abuse and suicide prevention, domestic violence supports and working for social inclusion, education and community development across the State;  </blockquote>notes that: <blockquote> 	&mdash; public sector workers received a pay rise of 3 per cent under Building Momentum - A New Public Service Agreement 2021-2022, with a further 6.5 per cent increase under an extension to that agreement, but no pay rise or improvement in conditions was provided to the community and voluntary sector;<br /><br />&mdash; pay claims have been submitted as part of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions-led &quot;Valuing Care, Valuing Community&quot; campaign supported by the Services Industrial Professional and Technical Union, F&oacute;rsa and the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation;<br /><br />&mdash; F&oacute;rsa commissioned the report entitled &quot;A New Systemic Funding Model: The voluntary and community sector in the 2020s&quot;, written by researcher Brian Harvey, on delivery of health services by Section 39 organisations; and the report found very high annual staff exit rates of up to a third annually, with further reports since of workers leaving to take up direct employment in the public service such as the HSE, due to the pay gap and gulf in terms and conditions;<br /><br />&mdash; during the economic crisis Section 39 bodies were instructed by the HSE to cut the pay of staff in line with pay reductions for public servants, but that these staff were not automatically included in pay restoration agreements and, while there were some pay restoration measures, these were not commensurate with those in the public service; and<br /><br />&mdash; these bodies are funded through a mix of Service Level Agreements and fundraising, but there is no automatic rise in public funding in line with public service pay agreements, and that recent increases to some bodies have been to support service delivery, not improved terms and conditions or pay restoration and parity for staff; </blockquote>acknowledges: <blockquote> 	&mdash; that, while these organisations continue to sustain the communities they serve, there is a growing crisis within the sector because its workers, who have endured over a decade without a pay rise, are undervalued and disrespected by the State;<br /><br />&mdash; that the anomalous position of these workers leaves them excluded from public sector negotiations on pay and conditions, and from any other collective bargaining arrangement, and that their vulnerable status has resulted in them being undervalued and underpaid in insecure employment with poor career paths, resulting in a high turnover of staff which adversely impacts on the level of care that can be provided to those in need; and<br /><br />&mdash; the need to establish a renewed relationship between not-for-profit organisations and the State, based on a shared long-term vision and plan that would allow for an integrated approach to service provision supported by adequate funding; and </blockquote>calls on the Government to: <blockquote> 	&mdash; mandate the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to reverse the policy that has resulted in the exclusion of thousands of affected workers from the established norms of the public sector employment framework on the basis of continuing claims that no direct employment relationship exists between those workers and any public body;<br /><br />&mdash; fund pay rises for workers in the community and voluntary sector, in line with recent public sector pay agreements;<br /><br />&mdash; implement these pay rises through the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform by establishing a standing forum and mechanism for collective bargaining on pay and conditions with recognised trade unions in the sector;<br /><br />&mdash; guarantee that Ministers in the relevant line Departments commit to funding increases for organisations they support in order to provide for salary increases;<br /><br />&mdash; ensure that future Service Level Agreements provide for automatic funding increases for salaries in line with public service pay increases and policy; and<br /><br />&mdash; commit to a multiannual funding framework for the sector to provide certainty for providers, their staff, and those who rely on their essential services. </blockquote> </blockquote>  </blockquote>  <p>In opening the debate I welcome the workers who have come to Leinster House to view it.  We have workers from the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation in the Gallery and workers from F&oacute;rsa and SIPTU are on their way.  They have been the driving force in the valuing care, valuing community campaign in recent years.  They have worked hard to build momentum and energy for what they require and what they so desperately need, which is pay justice, pay restoration and pay increases.</p><p>The ask of this motion is simple but if delivered it would have a radical impact on the lives of the workers, who perform some of the most vital and important jobs in the State.  I am proud to introduce the motion in the name of the Labour Party on behalf of community and voluntary workers throughout Ireland who have been working so hard on this campaign.  Before I go into detail on the motion I want to assuage some of the concerns that have been expressed by the Government in recent days.  The motion is not a Trojan horse to make community workers public sector workers.  Community and voluntary workers do not want this.  They want to remain community and voluntary workers.  They just want respect.  The motion is also not a Trojan horse to make community organisations public sector organisations.  The organisations do not want this.  They are community organisations.  This is their DNA and fabric and they want to remain so.  They just want respect and to be valued.</p><p>The motion is about finding a mechanism to ensure these workers can bargain for pay.  This is a fundamental requirement for any worker in this country and something on which we are falling far behind.  The motion boils down to something as dull and technical as a mechanism for pay bargaining.  It is something that has been done in other areas.  We have seen it in childcare.  There are models that can be used for section 39, section 56 and section 10 workers and the community and voluntary sector.  We are not trying to reinvent the wheel.  We are trying to bring the Government up to where it needs to be, which is to recognise these workers and their serious concerns and recognise that they need a pay increase having had their pay cut in 2008 with no mechanism to restore it since.</p><p>Yesterday the Taoiseach criticised the motion saying it was too broad.  This was on Leaders' Questions in response to Deputy Bacik.  The ask of the motion is not broad; it is simple.  The scope of the motion is broad in terms of the workers it seeks to value and assist because this is the extent to which the workers in these organisations are active in our society.  They represent a broad spectrum of work.  This includes disability services, addiction services, homelessness services and nursing.  The list goes on and on.  There are also community employment supervisors.  This is where the motion is broad but the Government should not fear it.  There is nothing to fear from bringing as many workers as possible into fair pay and proper pay mechanisms.  The Government would be rewarded if it did so.</p><p>The Government needs to join up the dots on why this is important.  This not just about pay.  When the Government answers questions on why there is a delay in home care packages being given it has to join up the dots and ask why we do not have enough home care workers.  When members of Government answer questions on why day care services are being paused or unable to get off the ground they have to ask why there are no day service workers or why the workers are leaving the service.  When Government Deputies are answering questions at clinics from service users who say they must continually build new relationships with new care workers they have to ask why.  It fundamentally comes down to the recruitment and retention crisis in the sector, which is underpinned by low pay and the workers having no mechanism to negotiate their way out of it.  This is the reality.</p><p>We know the HSE is poaching staff from this sector.  We know staff are exiting the sector to go to other jobs for better pay.  We know they are exiting this country to take up care roles in the NHS or further afield.  The Government knows this.  In May I attended national demonstrations and spoke to supervisors and workers.  I was on the picket line in July with the Irish Wheelchair Association.  Several weeks ago I went to Charleville to meet St. Joseph's Foundation with Deputy Sherlock.  While the workers are diverse in the jobs they do they are united in their experience of being undervalued, on the outside and not being listened to.  They are united in the fact, as has been said, that they provide work and care for those on the margins and the most vulnerable in society.  This is what unites all of these workers.  It behoves the Government to pay them the respect they deserve.</p><p>If we look at the past week as a microcosm of this debate and campaign, we saw that last Thursday Deputy Bacik asked a question of the T&aacute;naiste on pay increases.  The T&aacute;naiste said there is a &euro;100 million block grant that will be paid by the HSE which will cover the pay and that it will be enough to do so.  There was a glimmer of hope among the workers.  We were contacted and asked whether this was good news.  We interrogated it a little further and yesterday Deputy Bacik followed up with a question to the Taoiseach.  He said the &euro;100 million was a cost-of-living measure.  This is not what the T&aacute;naiste said last week.</p><p>Last night in the debate on disability matters the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, said that as part of budget 2023 &quot;an inflation support fund of &euro;100 million will be made available to support community-based voluntary organisations, including those providing disability services, which are an essential pillar in the provision of health services&quot;.  She said the fund &quot;is being made available in recognition of the challenges faced by the sector in delivering and maintaining key health and social care services against a backdrop of increased inflationary pressures affecting energy, heating and related costs.&quot;  This is the truth of what the money is for.  There is no doubt the money is needed but it is not for what the T&aacute;naiste led us, the workers and the trade unions to believe last week, which is that the fund would be part of a mechanism for pay increases and pay restoration.  This is an example of the disrespect these workers have been facing for many years, which this campaign is about.</p> <p>The workers' representatives, their trade unions, cannot even get responses to letters.  If they do, the response is to the effect that it is not the respondent's responsibility but that of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform or the Minister for Social Protection or the Minister for Health and round and round they go, with no answers.  They move from Minister to Minister.  That has to end.  We have had straws in the wind and whispers in these corridors that there is a process coming down the line; we have had no detail.  We have tabled this motion to ask for that.</p> <p> Again, we are not seeking to reinvent the wheel.  We just want these workers to have what workers in other sectors have and what these workers deserve.  That is why the Labour Party now calls on the Government to commit to a formal process to recognise and to engage with workers in this sector and their trade unions in order to ensure that public sector pay rises are automatically passed on in future to recognise this in service level agreements and to commit to multi-annual funding to provide certainty for providers, staff and service users.  Anyone who talks to the staff, that is, to the workers, will know that this is what it is about for them.  It is about ensuring they can continue to provide the service.  For the vast majority of the workers, this is vocational.  They want to do this and to be in this service.  They are not in it to make millions of euro.  They are in it to provide care, to be respected and to have the energy and ability to provide that care and service to the service users.  We have had three days of action in the past few months.  We have spoken to service users and have not had one complaint from a service user or a family member of a service user about a delay or a stop to a service.  The service users fully support this campaign because they know that their caregivers, the workers with whom they interact, are burnt out.  They know they are leaving.  They know that has an impact on their care.  Where would we be without organisations such as the Irish Wheelchair Association, Prosper Fingal and Enable Ireland?  The Minister would have a proper collapse in the health service on his hands.</p> <p> This sector is the bedrock of our health service.  When we have patients leaving hospitals and moving to home care packages, they leave the care of HSE-funded employees, who get paid, get their increments and get their pandemic recognition payments.  Workers in this sector do not have that.  They provide home care packages.  There are delays.  They work long and hard hours with very little pay.  The organisations are struggling to recruit and to retain their staff.  That is the essence of this.</p> <p> The Minister is not opposing the motion, so there will be no set piece vote tonight.  We are not interested in set pieces.  We want to see action.  I hope that in his response the Minister will have something real and tangible to give to us, to the workers and to the representatives in the Gallery and all across the country.  I hope this is not another cynical attempt by the Government just to let something pass through for it to go back into the political abyss and the political ether of these corridors and Government Buildings.  I plead with the Minister to give these workers something.  We hope there is something in the paper in front of the Minister that will be tangible and will deliver.  We do not hold out much hope but we will continue to work on behalf of these workers and all the service users all over the country who rely, day in, day out, on these vital front-line services.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-12a.46" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1698" speakername="Ivana Bacik" time="10:12:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022101200009#G00200"><p>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on our Labour Party motion and to second it.  Our motion seeks to secure better pay and conditions for those employed in the community, voluntary and care sector, such as section 39, section 56 and section 10 workers.  These are thousands of workers who work for independent, non-State agencies to provide vital support services in the community and voluntary sector.  I pay tribute to my colleague, Deputy Duncan Smith, our party's health spokesperson, who has proposed the motion so eloquently and put the case for it so clearly.  As he said, while there is a good deal of detail in it, it is a simple ask.  We are simply seeking a mechanism for pay bargaining on behalf of these workers.</p>  <p>  I thank those who work in the community care and voluntary sectors.  I welcome those joining us in the Gallery: members of the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, SIPTU and F&oacute;rsa, many of whom work directly in the sector.  I welcome Noeline Blackwell, director of the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre, who spoke so clearly in the media this week about the issues facing those who provide essential care services and enormous support to the health and care services of this State but who are not given adequate pay and conditions, certainly not pay and conditions commensurate with those for the work done directly by those employed by the HSE.  I thank those in the Gallery and those they represent for their service to the State and to the people who live in it and the many who require their services.  They are among the heroes of Irish society, filling the gaps left where the State does not have capacity to provide.  It is no exaggeration to say that without their work, many of society's most vulnerable members would be left disconnected from their communities.</p>  <p>  We know that many organisations, including those Deputy Duncan Smith named, organisations such as Enable Ireland, the Irish Wheelchair Association, the Rehab Group and many more are lauded and rightly praised as bedrocks of the care and voluntary sector.  Their staff provide vital services in communities across the State in supporting those with disabilities, lending their ears to those suffering mental health crises, extending help to people who have lost their homes and giving stability and support to those victimised by sexual or domestic violence.</p>  <p>  The question, however, is who is caring for those who care for us, who is providing the necessary value and who is valuing the care workers in our society.  Despite being effectively paid from the public purse to deliver a public service, the fact that these workers are in indirect employment arrangements means they are in many cases not given decent pay or the same pay and conditions as other workers.  As Deputy Duncan Smith said, this motion and the campaign do not seek to bring such workers directly into the public service; rather, they seek just to recognise adequately the work they do, commensurate with the work done by those directly employed within the public service.  We know that, for example, section 39 bodies were required to reduce pay during the economic crisis, but the process of pay restoration has been much slower and patchy.  I hasten to add that part of the reason there are such issues today stems from the effort made by voluntary sector organisations to lessen cuts imposed previously.  All voluntary organisations reduced salaries previously, but many used mechanisms more appropriate to them than the methods applied in the public sector.  Workers across the sector are now at least 9.5% behind public sector comparators on ratification of the review terms of the public sector agreement.</p>  <p>  This is not just about direct pay; clearly, it is also about pension coverage, sick pay coverage and contract terms, with fixed-term contracts being more prevalent.  We know that significant numbers of individuals are affected by this.  We know that the HSE funds an estimated 1,700 agencies through service level arrangements under section 39 of the Health Act 2004.  We know that there are other service level arrangements under other sections of that Act, with, again, many more affected there.</p>  <p>  As a lifelong trade unionist, I have always maintained that the best way to improve pay and conditions and quality of life for employees is through collective bargaining and the trade union movement.  That is our belief as a labour party.  I welcome the trade union officials and activists who have joined us in the Gallery.  We know that pay claims have been submitted for workers in the care and voluntary sector as part of the ICTU-led Valuing Care, Valuing Community campaign, which my colleague, Deputy Duncan Smith, mentioned.  That campaign is supported by SIPTU, F&oacute;rsa and the INMO in particular to ensure that staff working through these voluntary bodies will have equivalent pay and conditions to their counterparts employed directly through not just the HSE but also Tusla.  Trade union officials have communicated to me and my colleagues their frustration with the challenges which arise for section 10, section 39 and section 56 workers who attempt to organise through trade unions.  When it comes to collective bargaining, the sponsoring Department will usually reiterate that it is not the direct employer.  Typically, employers may have an inability to pay.  The EU directive on collective bargaining and minimum wages will oblige member states to increase collective bargaining thresholds.  That may well lead to a significant increase in Ireland's very low collective bargaining percentage threshold.  My colleagues and I have welcomed last week's report by the high-level group on collective bargaining.  We want to see the implementation of its recommendations.</p>  <p>  The need to ensure proper valuing of care provided through the care and voluntary sectors has been brought into sharper focus by not just the Covid-19 pandemic but also the acute cost-of-living crisis we now face.  So many of the workers who help struggling people are themselves struggling to pay their bills.  A constituent of mine who works for an organisation funded under section 39 has told me of their experience, explaining that care workers, who are expected to have a degree in social care or an equivalent qualification, and team leaders, who are required to have a management qualification, are simply very difficult to recruit.  Where they are recruited, it is nearly impossible for them to secure 39-hour contracts to sustain themselves.  This is therefore not just about hourly pay rates but also about hours of work and treatment at work, treatment which is challenging to contest on behalf of workers because they do not have the same access to the industrial relations mechanisms of the State.</p>  <p>  As Deputy Duncan Smith said, the hidden victims of the piecemeal arrangements in place throughout the community and voluntary sector are those who rely on the services provided, that is, service users themselves.</p> <p>They are really affected by turnover among section 39 workers, which we know from the Harvey report is as much as one third.  Churn is high and this denies stability and consistency of service provision to many service users.  I will read a few lines sent to me by someone whose support worker is employed by the Irish Wheelchair Association.  He calls her Mary.  He said:</p><blockquote>	Mary helps me to live a normal life.  [...]  Because of Mary and her colleagues, people life me can get that bit of help to stay at home, and we can have a bit of company too. That made all the difference during the pandemic.  [...]  As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, she should be paid the highest salary possible. Certainly not less than people who do the same job, but working for the HSE. </blockquote> <p>That testimony goes to show the difference section 39 workers make in supporting the lives of those who need their services and their care.  It is not just assisted living support workers either.  As I said, we heard recently on RT&Eacute; radio from Noeline Blackwell of the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre.  She spoke about the difficulty affecting services such as hers that provide vital public services to support victims and survivors of rape and other sexual offences, but do so in the absence of sustainable multi-annual funding frameworks and assurances as to adequacy of pay for staff.<br/><br/>I was in Cork last Monday and heard from parents of children with autism and other disabilities.  Parents organising through Families Unite for Services and Support, FUSS, Cork, told me the difficulties in securing services for their children are often due to the fact that organisations like Enable Ireland simply cannot recruit and retain staff.  Among other things, the parents told me the HSE and even the NHS have been approaching staff members of voluntary sector organisations, seeking - understandably - to entice them to work directly for the public sector in this country and others where workers will have much better pay and clearly much better conditions and security of employment.  Of course, the knock-on effect is felt by the parents I met in Cork, whose autistic children are thereby being denied timely and effective access to services.  They are faced with long waiting lists because staff are not available to the organisations providing the support on behalf of the State, and of all us.<br/><br/>In the interests of those children and of the many individuals and communities who really need the services provided through voluntary organisations we need to see support from the Government.  It must support workers to remain in their jobs and support them to have access to decent pay and conditions.  That is what our motion seeks to do and it is a simple and straightforward ask.  My colleagues will speak more about the individual provisions contained within our motion and the specific points in it.  I hope the Minister will hear our call, and the calls of the trade unions, individual workers, service users and the organisations upon whose help they are reliant.  That call is for the Minister and for all the Government because this is a whole-of-government issue.  The call is for it to take meaningful steps towards pay restoration, pay increases, and better conditions for workers in the community and voluntary sector.  The sector needs sustainable to funding to ensure our communities are truly valued.  That is what the Valuing Care, Valuing Community campaign, which we are proud to support, is about and that is what our motion is about.  We are glad the Government is not opposing the motion but we hope, as Deputy Duncan Smith said, for a meaningful response that will have a positive impact on the workers, and indeed the service users, we are speaking about today.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-12a.48" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="10:22:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022101200010#H00200"><p>I begin by acknowledging and paying tribute to the vital role community and voluntary organisations play right across the country.  I pay tribute to our guests from the community and voluntary sector and acknowledge the extraordinary work they do.  The work carried out by these organisations and by the people who work for and make up these organisations has a hugely beneficial impact on so many people.  As the Deputies have said, these are very often the most vulnerable people in our society and communities.  The services range from mental health services, disability services in my own sector, to bereavement counselling, speech and language therapy services in organisations funded by Tusla, to emergency accommodation services in the housing sector.  As Deputy Bacik has said this is a matter for all of Government, as well as the health sector.  I thank Deputy Duncan Smith and the Labour Party Deputies for tabling what is a very important motion.  The Government will not be opposing it.</p>  <p>  From the perspective of my own sector, I commend the extraordinary dedication we have seen of those working in organisations funded under section 39 of the Health Act.  We are all familiar with the work they do in all of our own communities, in delivering health and social care services.  These include residential, day and ancillary services for people with disabilities, mental health services, palliative care services, addiction services, domestic and sexual violence services and supports for many different groups of patients living with and managing many different conditions.  It includes a wide range of community initiatives that improve the quality of life for older people, maintains a sense of community and combats loneliness and isolation.  They also provide practical, vital services like meals on wheels, laundry, basic essential repairs and much more.</p>  <p>  Under section 39 of the Health Act, the HSE provides financial assistance to organisations providing services similar or ancillary to services the HSE would otherwise be providing.  As colleagues will be aware, this arrangement also recognises these section 39 organisations are independently owned and run and the terms and conditions of employment are as such a matter for them as independent organisations.  The Government is highly appreciative of the vital work of the organisations right across the various sectors, including Tusla and the organisations that fall under section 10 of the Housing Act 1988.  On the specialist palliative care services provided by hospices, because of the complex clinical patient care provided these services are unique within the broad range of section 39 organisations.  In this regard I have been engaging with the hospices regarding their specific status.</p>  <p>  The Government is acutely aware that while public servants had the provisions in the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, legislation reversed and are due to receive further pay increases under the extension to the public service agreement, Building Momentum, those working in community and voluntary organisations are not covered by these arrangements.  Nor are they covered under any public service agreements negotiated between public service unions and the Government.  Those working in the community and voluntary sector are not public servants, as we know, so the Government does not have a mandate to change the rates of pay or terms and conditions of employment for these workers.  The legal mandate, the legal authority, to do that rests with the employer within the organisations.  However, the Government is also acutely aware, as am I as Minister for Health, that as the main and often sole funder of these organisations, the funding levels provided by the Government of course impact on the ability of individual organisations to increase pay and improve conditions for their staff regardless of the fact they are legally independent organisations.</p>  <p>  Today&rsquo;s motion concerns community and voluntary sector organisations across many different sectors, including health and social care, housing and homelessness, children&rsquo;s services, and others.  However, I have no doubt that the challenges faced by organisations in the health sector, which I am very well aware of and familiar with, are also being felt in these others sectors as well.  I appreciate individuals working in the community and voluntary sectors are feeling worried  in the midst of a cost-of-living crisis.  I am aware of the challenges of many of these organisations when trying to retain and hire staff given their current funding allocations.  I am also aware of the challenges many community and voluntary organisations are facing this autumn and winter with spiralling energy costs and increases in other bills as well.  I believe the point the Taoiseach was making yesterday on the breadth of the motion is that it covers a very large number of organisations.  They range from very small organisations to some very big organisations and service providers.  According to the latest publicly available data, the sector has over 32,000 organisations.  This includes nearly 3,000 contracted and funded to provide services on behalf of the State.  The sector is, as we all know, hugely diverse, complex and the challenges for the different organisations within it are varied.</p> <p>This is also true of the terms and conditions of staff working in these organisations.  The pay of public servants was cut by the FEMPI reductions in 2010.  While FEMPI provisions did not technically apply to community and voluntary organisations, savings were made by those organisations.  In many cases, this was achieved through pay cuts in line with the FEMPI cuts made to public sector workers' pay.  As we are all aware, the issue of restoration of pay for workers whose pay was cut arose a number of years ago.  To address this, a process involving the Department of Health, the HSE and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, was initiated at the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, in 2019.  It was mandated to work through these many complex issues and resulted in funding being made available for pay increases for an initial 50 of the larger agencies that met various criteria from a total of 300 agencies.  Subsequently, in 2021, there was further engagement at the WRC.  This resulted in funding being made available for pay increases for cohorts of staff in the remaining 250 of the 300 agencies initially identified in 2019.  A process along these lines could play a very useful role in providing solutions to the current pay-related issues that have been raised and which are, very understandably, referenced in this motion.  The issues have also been raised with me, with Government and with Members of this House by representatives of the community and voluntary sector.</p> <p> At the same time, there is a need for more immediate financial support in the face of the energy crisis.  The Government&rsquo;s acknowledgement of the challenges faced by the sector in the midst of this cost-of-living crisis is illustrated by the support in last month&rsquo;s budget.  In my own sector, we are providing once-off funding of &euro;100 million.  This money will help section 39 organisations, community organisations and nursing homes, as well as certain section 38 organisations.  This is once-off funding and will be allocated as quickly as possible to help these organisations with spiralling costs for energy, for transporting patients to hospitals and for many other things.  Tusla's funding allocation will increase to &euro;935 million next year.  A further &euro;21 million has been secured for homeless services.  This will bring the total funding for homeless services next year to &euro;215 million.</p> <p> I again acknowledge the important work these organisations, and essentially their workers, do.  Funding for these sectors of healthcare is at its highest level ever.  I know these workers and organisations are using that funding and turning it into vital services for people right across our country.  I acknowledge the genuine financial challenges facing many of these organisations because of the energy crisis.  We need to proceed with both short-term and longer-term solutions.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, the Business Committee does not allow the majority of Deputies on the backbenches to make contributions in these debates.  That is reserved for the Government.  However, I will be here for the debate because, as a former T&uacute;s supervisor and volunteer on the board of a community cr&egrave;che, I recognise the work being done here.  I commend the Labour Party on bringing forward the motion and I commend SIPTU on its campaign.  These organisations emerge because there are often gaps in State services or to give communities a stronger hand in how services are delivered.  We must find a mechanism for the State to improve pay and conditions for the people who work in this sector because otherwise we will not retain the talent needed or recruit new staff to continue to deliver services.  This work needs to continue in the background.  It cannot be deferred or delayed.  We need to find a solution as soon as possible.</p></speech>

In most cases, one comes in here with a pre-prepared speech but it is important to parse the words of the Minister and to seek to interpret them.  His speech states:</p> <blockquote> 	Government is acutely aware that while public servants had FEMPI reversed and are due to receive further pay rises under the extension to the current Public Service Agreement, Building Momentum, those working in Community and Voluntary organisations are not covered by these arrangements.  Nor are they covered under any Public Service Agreements negotiated between public service unions and the Government.  Those working in the Community and Voluntary sector are not public servants and so, the Government does not... </blockquote>  <p>There are a lot of nots and nos there.  However, one seeks to be positive in interpreting the Minister's words.  The speech goes on to say &quot;I believe a process along these lines could play a useful role in providing solutions to the current pay related issues that have been raised, and which are referenced in today&rsquo;s [Labour] motion.&quot;  This statement relates to further engagement by the WRC.  I hope that the Minister is today sending a signal that there are potentially grounds for a &quot;process&quot;, to use the Minister's word, to be devised in which people could come around the table to begin to deal with these anomalies that exist.</p><p>In my area in Cork, organisations like Enable Ireland and the St. Joseph's Foundation operate.  I was proud to join them in Charleville recently where speech and language therapists, occupational therapists and other professionals are rolling out Government policy.  The Government established the children's disability network teams and expects organisations like the St. Joseph's Foundation and Enable Ireland to deliver on that policy.  However, they are delivering on that policy with one hand tied behind their backs because there are people working in equivalent grades and professions, that is, speech and language therapists, occupational therapists, physiotherapists and so on, who are working in the HSE and have better terms and conditions.  The mandate the Minister talks about can now change.  Surely Government policy should demand that, if we are to roll out children's disability network teams and if that is a function of Government policy, the people who are rolling them out should have equal terms and conditions of employment.  All we are asking for today is for Government to devise a process to allow trade unions and workers' representatives to come around a table and begin the change we all acknowledge is needed.  The mandate needs to change and it is time for it to change so that there will be equality in the system.  As I have said, people working as occupational therapists for the St. Joseph's Foundation should have the same terms and conditions as people working in the HSE.  It is as simple as that.  I am looking the Minister straight in the eye now and I hope that he is smiling because his Government will come up with a process.  That is all we are asking for here today.  That would give some semblance of hope to the many people we are seeking to represent.</p></speech>

That success was built on a level of trade unionism that stood with those women five years ago when they threatened strike action.  That is what the trade union movement does.  When it sees injustice in the workplace or anywhere else, it stands beside those affected and seeks to platform that injustice.  It is on the shoulders of SIPTU that the Irish team is heading to the World Cup next year.  That needs to be acknowledged.  I acknowledge the other trade unions represented here this morning as we speak to our motion.  The Minister has acknowledged our motion and thanked us for it.  We get one motion every six weeks.  That is how important the issue of section 39, section 56 and section 10 workers is to us as a party.</p>  <p>  I will speak a little bit about the drugs area.  With regard to addiction and those working in addiction services, despite hiding behind a promised citizens' assembly on drugs, this Government has been the most absent and uninterested I have ever known when it comes to the drugs crisis.  Something was said at the SIPTU briefing yesterday that I thought was very interesting.  Section 39 workers do not want to be public servants because those people whom they work with do not trust the State.</p> <p>If someone is in addiction and powering their way through that scenario, if they find themselves down an alleyway injecting something into themselves or if they find themselves stained and soiled because of the disconnection in their life and the various troubles or difficulties they have had, the last person they are going to engage with is somebody from the State.  We need these section 39 workers and agencies.  What they are saying to us is that many of the projects they currently have are threatened.  It is hard to get people to maintain their work within this sector.  It is hard to attract people into the sector.  In an environment where drug-taking and the manner of addiction changes all the time, it is hard to start new initiatives because they do not have the security.  That security has to come from the Minister and, I would suggest, from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, whose absence this morning is a disappointment to us in the Labour Party.  He is the person with control of the purse strings.</p> <p> It is often said to us that the Labour Party is trying to nationalise these services or wants all these workers to be public servants.  That is not the case.  However, we want them to be treated with the same terms and conditions as public servants, including those working with the HSE.  It has been said that the HSE is sometimes like an oil tanker and those working in these section 39 organisations are much more nimble and can adapt to situations more quickly.  The fundamental issue here is that these workers are not just changing lives; they are saving lives.  It undermines the work they do when they are treated so unfairly and not treated with the same basic respect as other workers.  How do you attract somebody into the service?  How do you change the way of interacting with people who are so in need of a helping hand and of care and compassion?  That is something they have never felt from the State because in their lives, the State has at every juncture treated them with a lack of respect.  That can come from the school system, the courts system, the Garda or social workers.  We all may find this hard to accept but it can come from politicians.  That is the day-to-day reality these people are working with.  Let us dispense with this myth that we are trying to fundamentally change the structure of these organisations.  What we are trying to do is provide that helping hand that shows respect to people who find themselves in addiction and are trying to power their way through this heroic path to a new future.  The person helping those people should also be dealt with with respect because respect goes so many different ways.  Those are the main points the Labour Party is trying to make.</p> <p> There are question marks over this &euro;100 million figure that keeps being bandied around the place.  It was mentioned on Thursday by the T&aacute;naiste and yesterday by the Taoiseach.  It was mentioned by the Minister for Children, Disability, Equality, Integration and Youth during last night's debate on disability, which was brought forward by my colleagues in Sinn F&eacute;in, and it was again referenced by the Minister for Health today.  That is a cost-of-living &euro;100 million.  That is a "keep the lights on" &euro;100 million.  It is not to be confused with what these workers are seeking.  The Government needs to be an awful lot clearer as to what the proposals are for pay parity and basic respect for workers in these sectors.  The Labour Party says to those section 39 workers, section 56 workers and section 10 workers that we value what they are doing.  We only get time to propose motions once every six weeks.  This is how important this issue is to us and we need it to be important to the Minister as well.  We thank the trade union movement for its ongoing campaigns.  If it was not for these workers, more lives would be lost and that would be on us.</p></speech>

T&aacute; s&eacute; f&iacute;orth&aacute;bhachtach go bhfuil an r&uacute;n seo &aacute; phl&eacute; againn inniu.  I also thank and commend the trade unions for their representation of these workers.  I commend the amazing work of our friends in the community and voluntary sector, some of whom are here with us today.  It is essential that we have this debate and this conversation within the D&aacute;il but it should not just end as a conversation.  Something must come out of this.  I note the Government is not opposing this motion but there is a difference between not opposing something and supporting it.</p>  <p>  Every single one of us who lives and works within our communities knows that the community and voluntary sectors are the unsung heroes of so many of our services.  That includes our health services but many others as well.  Although they are not technically part of the public sector, we are acutely aware that the public sector would not be able to function without them.  In many instances they are performing services comparable with those in the public sector and in some instances they work closely with those in the public sector but do not enjoy the same pay and conditions.  There is an incredible unfairness at the heart of all of this.  Many of these workers suffered pay cuts at the time of the financial and economic crisis.  The Minister said that FEMPI did not technically apply to community and voluntary organisation but we know that in reality, those pay cuts did apply for many of them.  There is no technicality around the restoration of that pay and those conditions.  We know how that happened in practice but I often think about how one Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform was able to bring in those pay cuts.  We need the current Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform here today to also look at how we can bring in pay restoration for these people and workers, as the economy has got back on its feet, to recognise everything they have done.  They have been forced to take industrial action and to fight.  They have had to lodge pay claims with the Workplace Relations Commission and they have been asked to do more with less and for less.</p>  <p>  I think of the fantastic work that has been done by the likes of the rape crisis centres, Enable Ireland and many others and the real difference they have made in people's lives.  They have done this because they are driven by conviction and the desire to make a difference in people's lives.  They have made a difference and they know that because families tell them this and we see it ourselves.  Unfortunately, this has been met by indifference on the part of the State.  That needs to change.</p>  <p>  This all comes down to one crucial aspect.  Something I have long tried to get my head around since being elected is the relationship between these organisations and the State.  I welcome that the Minister is here.  As he has recognised, many of these organisations fall under different arms within the Government.  There is not a one-stop shop for who exactly everything falls under or which income streams apply to them.  The Minister stated that there are at least 83,714 staff in these organisations.  I have submitted questions, as have many others, to find out exactly how many people fall within these organisations and exactly where different funding streams come out of.  If we actually want to look at this collectively and take this approach to it, we need that kind of information.  The Minister says this is the latest data available to him.  I would love to see exactly where those data come from and I will submit a follow-up question directly to the Minister's office to see that.  This is information that many within Sinn F&eacute;in, as well as the trade union sector and other parties, have tried to get.</p>  <p>  I wanted to say something specifically to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform but I will bring that directly to him.  It relates to his Civil Service renewal strategy and the establishment of a national data infrastructure.  The strategy states that this will "unlock the power of administrative data and improve the lives of the Irish public through evidence informed policies and effective services".  When we have a situation like this where we do not actually know how many workers there are within these services, we need to take a serious approach to this and look at that initiative.</p></speech>

We will not have a community and voluntary sector if the pay and conditions of these workers are not dealt with, similarly to how the public service was dealt with.</p> <p>As someone who served as a member of a board for many years, I remember how, before 2011, people started off on the same pay.  That link was broken and has never been restored.  It should be restored.</p> <p> We talk about funding of &euro;100 million.  As the Minister alluded to, that funding is being provided.  On further investigation, because people believed this was about pay restoration or pay increases, it turns out the funding is for the cost-of-living crisis for projects and not the workers involved with those projects.  The money is for heating and energy.  There should be funding for both.  Those community projects should not be fighting about whether there should be extra pay for workers or whether they pay the bills and keep the doors open.  Two separate payments are required.  I listened to Linda Scully yesterday.  She spoke about her 22 years of involvement with her project.  She has not had a pay rise in 14 years.  Name any worker in any sector who has not received a pay rise in 14 years.  Linda manages people in community centres, church halls, childcare and sports organisations.  I think we all agree that the latter are the backbone of our communities.  What I found interesting is that Linda is the employer.  Those involved have no say regarding their salaries.  That is set by the Government.  They have no say over hours.  Again, these are set by the Government.  What we find astonishing and what any person would find astonishing is that when it comes to increasing wages over a decade, the Government says that this is the responsibility of the voluntary boards, the HSE or Tusla - everybody else except the body that sets all the other conditions.</p> <p> It is really important that we have pay restoration and pay increases that bring people to the level of the public sector because there is an equalisation here.  There are people in the public sector doing exactly the same job as people in the community, voluntary and charitable sector and it is only fair, right and decent that these people are treated in the same way as they were prior to 2008.</p></speech>

This has been going on for way too long.  I started working in the community and voluntary sector in 2003.  Since then, we have been talking about the same thing that we are discussing now.  The Minister stated that those involved are not public servants, but they serve the public so we are splitting hairs.  There has been an abdication of responsibility on the part of successive Governments along the way when it comes to taking any kind of responsibility.  On one hand, we say we appreciate the work they do but, on the other, no Government, certainly none since I returned to this country, has appreciated the work done by these workers.</p>  <p>  We talk about the independent status of the organisations.  Again, this is just a way of abdicating any responsibility for it.  It has to stop.  I thank the Labour Party for bringing forward this motion.  It has to stop here and now.  Some 83,000 people are affected by this.  We met them.  Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh brought in a group of community employment supervisors a couple of weeks ago.  They had received no pay rise for 14 years.  We know who was hit the hardest when austerity arrived.  Wider society has been negatively impacted by that.</p>  <p>  I ask the Minister to give a commitment that a standing forum will be established, along with a mechanism for collective bargaining on pay and conditions with recognised trade unions.  That would solve the problem.  We say that the problem is too complex.  We have just dealt with a pandemic.  We can deal with this.  This needs to be dealt with.  We are avoiding the inevitable issue - that these workers must be appreciated and have to have a framework.  They must have automatic salary increases.  They cannot be going cap in hand every year asking "Please can I have some more?"  Fourteen years without a pay rise speaks to exactly how much we appreciate the work these people do.  They do it right across Mayo and all other counties.  They permeate every part of our community and homes in some cases.  It has to stop and it is within the power of the Minister and the Government to stop it.</p></speech>

Last week, I was a member of the Sinn F&eacute;in team that met community employment supervisors in Leinster House.  Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael Governments have refused to give any pay increases to these workers for the past 14 years.  The starting rate of pay for an assistant community employment supervisor is &euro;11.01, which works out at less than the proposed minimum wage.  You think of the crucial roles these workers play in our community.  My constituency office is in a local unemployment and training centre and many of the staff are community employment workers.  I am a former community employment worker.  In 2009, I was out of work for the first time after being diagnosed with multiple sclerosis.  I got a start as a community employment worker in a local addiction centre.  My community employment supervisor encouraged me to enter third level education.  I did so and eventually got a degree in addiction and counselling and went on to manage addiction centres over the years.  I have no doubt that without the vital intervention I received from the community employment supervisor, I would not be a Deputy representing the people of Dublin Mid-West.  I am calling on the Government to resolve this matter and to give community employment supervisors the pay increase they deserve.</p>  <p>  I also want to mention youth workers.  Ronanstown Youth Service plays an invaluable role in my community.  It often holds children as statutory services such as child and adult mental health services, the HSE and other statutory bodies are not meeting children&rsquo;s needs.  Youth workers receive referrals from garda&iacute;, the HSE and social workers but are not recognised in the same way when it comes to working terms and conditions.  Youth workers were at the forefront during the pandemic.  Engaging with young people who had lost all their normal structures like schools, sports clubs and everything else that went with just being a young person.  During the bust, youth workers received a 10% reduction in funding, and, 13 years later, they have not fully recovered this deficit.  Youth workers are way behind other sectors when it comes to pay increases.  They are just looking for parity and a professional recognition of their vocation.  Youth workers go above and beyond the call of duty in the care the give our young people and failing to invest in youth workers is failing to invest in our future generations.</p></speech>

I particularly congratulate Denise O'Sullivan from Knocknaheeny in my community.  The whole country is very proud of all of them.</p>  <p>  This is a vital motion and I thank the Labour Party for bringing it forward.  What I do not want is for the Government to support it and then send it off to motion heaven where nothing will happen.  The buck stops with the Minister and Government to finally look after these workers, who have been without a pay increase for 14 years.</p>  <p>  According to the CSO, &euro;100 worth of shopping in 2008 would now cost &euro;115.  The average rent in 2008 in Cork was &euro;1,003.  According to Daft, that is now &euro;1,670, which is an increase of over &euro;8,000 a year.  We are talking about people paying well over &euro;10,000 extra a year for the same standard of living today.  Many of the workers who come under this motion have seen no increases in their pay.  These are front-line workers.  They are drugs workers, youth workers, community employment workers, mental health workers and people working with people with disabilities.  These are people who are changing lives every single day.  Many of them worked through the pandemic - changing roles and supporting people where we really needed them.</p>  <p>  We see huge levels of staff burnout and staff turnover because of low pay and overwork.  The treatment of community and voluntary sector workers by successive Governments has been shameful.  I pay special recognition to those working in the community addiction sector who are not only facing unchanged pay.  Fine Gael decimated their core funding and have still not restored it to pre-austerity levels so not alone are they not getting the pay they need, they are not getting the support they need.  This Government has to recognise that and recognise these workers once and for all.</p></speech>

Very clearly, they have come an awful long way in the past five years since their meeting in Liberty Hall.  It is a testament to the value of trade union action and collective action, which speaks to the heart of this motion.</p> <p>I thank the Deputies for bringing it forward and giving us the opportunity to have this important debate.<br/><br/>The people working in homeless services, health and social care services and child and family services, though the Minister says they are not public servants, are providing a service to the public on behalf of the State.  Just because it is via a service-level agreement does not mean it is not a public service.  Technically, they are not public servants but many of them had their pay cut when public servants had their pay cut.  When the funding was reduced, the cuts involved were passed on to these workers.<br/><br/>The Deputies bringing forward the motion will not be unaware of their role in that.  I am glad we have the opportunity to interrogate it because at the time when the cuts were being passed on, I was representing those workers in some instances.  I welcome the men and women in the Gallery and anyone listening.  When we went to the Labour Court and did exactly as the Minister said by saying we were not public servants, we were sitting across the table from people who could not make a decision.  The fact the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform is not here is illustrative of that.  You take your case to the court and have two thirds of the decision-making team sitting there.  It is a tactic and it was done repeatedly.  The people in the room might offer all the tea and sympathy in the world.  The Minister gave it: they do great work; pat on the back - all of that.  When it comes to fronting up with money to resolve this or a process by which their rights can be vindicated, that is wholly absent.  They end up with a situation whereby they are sitting in a room and half the time the employer is agreeing with them and saying that if he or she had the shekels, he or she would definitely provide a pay increase.  The employer is nearly making the case for you to the chairperson of the court or the adjudicator.  They are saying they cannot keep staff and are haemorrhaging staff to the public service because they cannot keep pace and the funding is not keeping pace because those cuts were passed on to workers.<br/><br/>It is unfair, as I am sure the Minister will acknowledge and as the Deputies bringing forward the motion are not unaware, on the one hand to say:</p><blockquote>	We'll consider you as public servants some of the time and we'll hold you to a high standard - and rightly so - and a similar standard to the rest of the public service - and rightly so - but when it comes to pay restoration, well, you're not technically public servants, lads, so, you know, we're terrible sorry but there's nothing we can do. </blockquote> <p>That is unfair.  I welcome the mention in the motion of a process by which these workers can negotiate because there is nothing more frustrating than being an active trade union member.  I have said on the floor of the D&aacute;il many times that the best way to secure decent treatment and fair wages at work is to join and be active in a union.  These people do that.  They are active trade union members but when they go to what should be a negotiating forum, they sit across the table from two thirds of a team.  Maybe the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is there and the employer is there, but the Department of Health is not there; or maybe the Department of Health and the employer are there, but the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is not.  They need a proper forum to negotiate their terms and conditions.  What has happened them until now is not fair.<br/><br/>The cuts were passed on and some of them were given an awful choice in 2012 or 2013 when they were told their funding would be cut.  The employer was looking at me and saying that the other option was to cut services to people.  Will the Minister cast his mind back?  It was slash-and-burn austerity all over the place.  The people who depend on the services delivered by these men and women were at the business end of that austerity.  Employers were faced with the choice of cutting pay, cutting hours or cutting services.  No wonder they cannot compete with the public service.  They are losing personnel day after day.  It is not fair.<br/><br/>I welcome the motion.  It is not good enough that the Minister will say he will not oppose it.  He should support it, actively engage with that forum and give these people a chance to vindicate their rights at work.</p></speech>

Successive Governments have outsourced and undervalued health and social care work.  Some of the most important State services around supporting vulnerable people, care for older people, addiction services, specialised health interventions and disability services are provided by dedicated and severely underpaid workers.  Organisations such as CoAction and EmployAbility in west Cork fall into this category, as do other community care groups, homeless services and community employment, CE, schemes.  These workers provide essential services.  They do it because they are committed to helping other people and making Ireland a better place.  For their efforts and diligence they are treated disgracefully.  They are paid less than other professionals doing the same and comparable work in other organisations and State bodies and do not have pension entitlements.  Not only have these workers been paid less for years, but they will be worse off in their old age.</p>  <p>  This approach is leaving the sector in crisis.  Community and voluntary organisations are experiencing an escalating crisis in staffing.  Service delivery is being jeopardised as a result of challenges around staff recruitment and retention.  This is mainly due to the disparity in pay and conditions between organisation staff and their public sector counterparts.</p>  <p>  In our alternative budget, the Social Democrats called for an increase in the allocation across services budgets for section 39 organisations, Tusla-funded section 56 organisations and section 10 homeless services of a total of &euro;80 million as a first step to addressing this disparity.  Instead of investing in this sector and recognising highly skilled professions and the thousands of vulnerable people who benefit from their care, the Government went ahead with tax cuts and payments for the wealthier.  In a budget of &euro;11 billion, the Government chose not to address this major issue.  Each Minister and Government backbencher understands the issue, yet it was not important enough to resolve, again showing where the Government's priorities are.</p>  <p>  The F&oacute;rsa report, A New Systematic Funding Model, highlights that during the austerity era - that is the Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party and Fine Gael-Labour Governments - funding for the voluntary and community sector was slashed by between 35% and 45% and its staffing by 31%, with funding lines permanently flatlined at much lower levels.  Not only are staff underpaid, the whole sector is vastly underfunded.  The system is failing service users and workers and the Government has clearly shown it has no intention of resolving these issues.</p>  <p>  This is a system designed by civil servants and facilitated by Ministers more concerned with balance sheets than caring for some of the most vulnerable people in our society.  The services are provided by separate bodies, which reduces the responsibility of the Minister, Government, HSE, Tusla and local authorities.  It costs less because the Government continues to underpay them.</p>  <p>  When you stop and look at the situation, it is truly appalling.  It shows how this and previous Governments view those workers and the services they provide.  There will be supportive words said today, as always from Ministers and Government Deputies but, like clapping for healthcare workers during Covid, praise from Ministers will not pay bills.</p>  <p>  Discussions on this issue have reduced workers rights and essential services to euphemisms.  Section 39 organisations, section 56 organisations and section 10 homeless services are referred to as if they were abstract matters.  This system was an intentional structure established and perpetuated by Governments.  Section 39 organisations were created under the 2004 Health Act, introduced by the Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats Government, with the help of their supporters on the Independent benches.  The then Minister for Health and Children, Mary Harney, who had just taken over the position from the current Taoiseach, was responsible for the Act's introduction.  Section 56 organisations were created under to the Child and Family Agency Act 2013 brought in by the Fine Gael-Labour Government.  That Act was introduced by the then Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Frances Fitzgerald.  Section 10 homeless services were created under the Housing Act 1988.  This was brought forward by the then Minister for the Environment, P&aacute;draig Flynn, who was a member of a minority Fianna F&aacute;il Government.  Each of these Acts, introduced by parties represented here today - including some of the Deputies who supported them - enabled the creation of the structural inequality that lies at the heart of this issue.</p>  <p>  When we are discussing the disgraceful treatment of highly skilled and dedicated professionals in the community and voluntary sector, we have to be honest.  The problems started in this Chamber.  Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael, Progressive Democrats and Labour Governments established these systems and allowed glaring and disgraceful disparity to continue.</p>  <p>Any Deputy or party that claims to be serious about addressing the intentional shameful treatment of these workers and the services they provide must address the root cause of the issue.</p> <p> Today&rsquo;s motion, which will be ignored by the Government, draws welcome attention to the symptoms of a much larger problem which ultimately will need legislative changes to the primary Acts to guarantee the fair treatment of workers.  The specific actions outlined in the motion are important steps to remedying the situation.  The pay inequity needs to be resolved immediately and back-dated and there must be mechanisms for collective bargaining pay and conditions.</p> <p> This motion also highlights the case of supervisors and workers in the community employment scheme, T&uacute;s and the rural social scheme.  I have repeatedly raised the poor treatment of these workers.  They are vital in supporting many rural and community organisations.  Community halls, Tidy Towns, sports clubs and charity shops all have gained from the programme.  It is also another form of outsourcing as functions formerly fulfilled by state bodies and local authorities are being carried out by these workers, or roles which in other jurisdictions are permanent pensionable jobs are being carried out by people for a small top up on social welfare rates.</p> <p> Despite the great impact of these schemes providing unemployed people with skills and experience and offering services and assistance to communities and non-profit organisations, the workers are poorly remunerated and are too often met with restrictions and bureaucratic barriers.</p> <p> In the budget, the Government announced a top-up payment to participants in the CE, T&uacute;s and rural social scheme of &euro;5 to &euro;25 per week.  The Social Democrats in our alternative budget proposed to increase the top-up to &euro;100 per week for participants of the rural social scheme and to reinstate the community employment, CE, scheme budget to &euro;500 per participant, currently &euro;325, per annum.  The Government and the Department have to recognise that the cost of the programme is vastly outweighed by its impact on the ground.</p> <p> All of this comes down to how we as a society see and value social and community work.  The professionals in this area do incredible work often in extremely challenging contexts.  Their pay and conditions in no way reflect this and, unfortunately, it has been a policy by many of the political parties in the D&aacute;il to enable this approach.  All these workers deserve proper pay.  All these services need to be properly funded.  Regrettably, the Government&rsquo;s budget has shown that these urgent reforms will not be happening anytime soon.</p></speech>

The pay increase in the public sector is less than the rate of inflation.  It constitutes a <i>de facto</i>pay cut.  The increase in the national minimum wage due in January is also below the rate of inflation and also constitutes a <i>de facto</i>pay cut.  But the situation is worse again for the nation's community and voluntary workers in section 39, section 56, section 10, homeless services and others.</p><p>The majority of these workers have not had a pay increase now in 14 years.  Despite the fact that some of these workers transferred recently to the Department with responsibility for equality, there is anything but equality when determining how they are paid.  Despite the fact that many of them do the very same work as section 38 HSE workers, they are paid less, are not entitled to public sector pay increases and so on.  These workers provide vital services in our communities such as those to people with mental health pressures, those with disabilities, community employment etc. yet the unjust pay mechanism for these workers is now undermining the services as workers are forced to look elsewhere for jobs which provide a decent pay pocket for their family households in a cost of living crisis and as the organisations that directly employ them struggle to recruit new staff when conditions on pay are so low.  So when these workers strike, they strike not only for justified pay increases, but to defend the services that they have devoted years of service to.  On the last strike day, the <i>Irish Examiner </i>quoted the words of Gerald Madigan. Gerald is a social care worker for people with disabilities at the St. Joseph's foundation in Charleville, County Cork.  Gerald said that they did not want to go on strike again but that they would have to if a pay linkage with the HSE on section 48 workers was not formed.  His words show the determination of these workers.  This issue is clearly not just going to go away.  Enough is enough.  The State should reinstate the pay link and increase the pay of these vital workers providing vital services in our communities and they should do it now.</p></speech>

They are in many cases, the glue that keeps whole parts of our society together and yet the Government treats them as second class citizens.  It is treating the workers who provide these services as second class citizens and it is treating the service users as second class citizens.  That is the reality of this.  There is simply no justification for the unequal treatment of these workers and the people who use these services.</p>  <p>  It does show a certain contempt.  There is no other way to look at it.  Of course it is linked to the outsourcing of vital health, community and social services which is endemic in our entire system.  It leads to fragmentation and a situation where the Government can pass the buck because it does not have to take direct responsibility for either employees or for the vital community and social services and so on that these workers provide.  It is really an apartheid in the treatment of certain types of community and public services of incredibly dedicated workers.  God knows how any of them sustain themselves in a situation where they have not had pay raises for up to 14 years.  They have been crucified like everybody else with the cost of living crisis and, indeed, the housing crisis that is hammering our society generally, but they are suffering disproportionately.  While, as Deputy Barry said, public sector workers are getting some pay increases, which are not even enough to keep pace with the rocketing cost of inflation of energy prices, house prices and so on, these workers have been left without any pay increases.  Seriously, how does the Government expect people to sustain that situation?  This has to end.  The Government should accept the principle that is being put forward in this motion.  These workers should be paid the same as other public sector workers and get the same pay increases as other public sector workers.  More generally, the services they provide for communities, for the vulnerable in society, for young people, for people with addiction issues and so on need to be seen and treated as equal to all the other public services for which the Government takes direct responsibility.  The lack of respect and frankly the contempt that has been shown to these workers and their service users has to end.</p>  <p>  I commend the workers for that campaign.  I have no doubt they will continue it.  They can be assured of our continued support.  It is long past time that the Government recognised their case and conceded the demands that they are making.</p></speech>

I welcome the opportunity to shine a light on the great work being done by those who work in our community sectors and to support them in their quest for a pay rise.</p> <p>I recently received correspondence from Maire Jackman who works alongside Darren Nolan.  They run a large community employment scheme in south County Wexford.  There are 40 participants and it covers: Wexford town, Clongeen, Foulksmills, Fethard-on-Sea, Duncannon, Campile, St. Leonard's, Ballymitty, Wellingtonbridge, Ballykelly, Whitechurch, Dunbrody, New Ross and Tintern Abbey.  This is much of south County Wexford.  Participants vary in age, ability and experience.  In addition to supporting participants in their work, the supervisors also take on roles including an element of counselling and the provision of psychological supports to those on the scheme who may be facing certain challenges.  The participants on the schemes work in a variety of areas, such as childcare, caretaking, boatbuilding, administration, environmental work, pitch maintenance, trail maintenance and in administration for the Wexford Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, WSPCA.  The role of the supervisor and the assistant supervisor varies from counselling, training and development, all human resource activity, health and safety, payroll preparation, Revenue returns, strategic management, procurement, budget planning and all financial activities.  <br/><br/>In essence, they run all the aspects of a small-to-medium business on a very small budget.  To quote directly, the email stated:</p><blockquote>	We do suffer from burn out but have no option but to keep going.  Supervisors right across the country have to deal with some very serious situations in their working life.  Many just give up as they burn out.<br /><br />Our pay certainly does not reflect the level and depth of responsibility we have.  We have not had a pay rise since 2009 so we are well below the level of pay we should have.  Our workload has at the very least doubled.  Any additional work was implemented unilaterally by the DSP and we have had no say and no training in any new processes and procedures and any feedback we give is falling on deaf ears. </blockquote> <p>The crux of the problem it seems when it comes to pay levels for these supervisors is highlighted in the next paragraph of the correspondence:</p><blockquote>	when any of our issues are raised in the Dail, the stock answer given is that the departments are not our employers, however they dictate every aspect of the work and use this line so that they do not have to give us any support in terms of pension or pay rises in line with inflation.  </blockquote> <p>The buck passing is unfair from Government because it dictates almost every aspect of how these schemes are run and it is just using a technicality to avoid taking responsibility for supervisors' pay.  It dictates the policies that should be implemented.  It asks community schemes to do work that Departments should be funding more adequately, such as childcare, village work and drug rehabilitation, to mention but a few.  The sponsors of these schemes are ordinary people who volunteer to run them but who have no access to funding other than from the Government.  They are all fulfilling an important role on behalf of the Government.  If the work was not done, then childcare would fail, villages would be in disrepair and drug rehabilitation schemes would close.  The fantastic Helen Blake boatbuilding project would not run, Tintern Abbey's walking trails would not be developed and the WSPCA could not offer the services it can currently.  <br/><br/>In light of this and what has been outlined, I hope the Government will not ignore the issue and pass the buck this time.  It has agreed with this motion and to accept it, but I hope it will also take an active part in implementing it.  </p></speech>

They need to be treated with respect and parity.  We know what they do.  We know what section 39 workers do in Ability West and the Irish Wheelchair Association, IWA, in the constituency I share with the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte.  People there were out protesting the week before last to try to highlight the issue they are facing.  To add insult to injury, last January it was announced that a bonus of &euro;1,000 would be given to front-line health workers.  The people working in Ability West have had no sight of that payment yet, nor have those working in private nursing homes, even though this payment was promised.  Something is amiss in this situation and we must get it right.</p>  <p>  In addition, if people have been working for the last 14 years without a pay rise, then something is wrong.  This is not, however, all about pay rises.  It is about engaging with people and treating them as equals so they can engage under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission with their representatives and reach a situation where all these things can be addressed.  What happens is that Departments announce money is going into a fund for something, but this is not dealing with the core issue.  In fact, the pay for workers should be removed from the capital costs required to run the services and treated separately.  This is fundamental.</p>  <p>  I have been involved in many community organisations in my area.  Concerning the rural social scheme and the meals-on-wheels scheme, and all these types of schemes, I have seen the actions they undertake and the bonuses they bring to communities.  I have seen the way our towns and villages and our community facilities are being maintained.  We invested taxpayers' money into these community and sports facilities, and this is all great.  Ultimately, however, the people who keep these facilities right and sustainable are these workers and supervisors who manage the whole process.  I guarantee one thing, and the Minister of State will understand this point, and it is that the local authorities do not have a pot to pee in, never mind the wherewithal to maintain all these villages.  They are relying on these people and these supervisors to keep the countryside the way it is.  </p>  <p>  We have something that is working well.  It is working very well and providing something badly needed.  What we are going to do ultimately, though, is to drive these schemes into the ground and ruin this model.  Will the local authorities then have the funding to take on what the people in these schemes are doing now?  They will not.  Will the HSE or the Department of Health have the money to undertake these activities?  They will not.  This comes back to one thing and that is respect for what people are doing.  Platitudes are finished with.  We need to think about these schemes completely differently.  We must ensure that any money we spend on the pay of people providing these services is not seen as a cost but as an investment in these services.  </p>  <p>  If we do not put this investment into these schemes, then we are going to lose many more of the key people now working in the services and we will end up with no new recruits joining.  They will not touch them with a 40 ft. pole.  We will have got rid of them by natural stealth.  There is an urgency regarding this matter.  It needs to be dealt with now.  I keep repeating that what people want is respect.  People came to Dublin to talk to us about this issue.  These are people who went on the picket lines.  They do not want to be doing that.  Instead, they want to do what they like doing every day, which is managing the facilities, the community areas, the countryside and looking after people who are vulnerable.  I refer to people like those in Ability West and the IWA.  Let us get this right for once and for all.</p></speech>

I wholeheartedly support the community and voluntary sector.  The people working in that sector have not had a wage increase in 14 years.  What other section would put up with that?  These people are the glue and the building blocks that keep our country together.  In many cases, these are voluntary boards.  What is the Government doing?  As with pyrite and mica, it is devastating these communities because it does not care about them, does not respect them and does not support them.  N&iacute; neart go cur le ch&eacute;ile.  This is what the Government does not do.</p>  <p>  I wish to be a bit parochial and to talk about our community employment scheme in Newcastle.  It has been in place since 1996.  I pay tribute to the late Alice O'Shea.  She was our treasurer until a few months ago.  Fuair s&iacute; b&aacute;s at 93.  She was still our treasurer then and had a very active mind.  She was signing cheques and doing everything for us weekly.  I salute the other members of the voluntary board, including Tom Lonergan, the late Martin Lonergan, Liam Kelly and others.  We have the supervisor, Sean Byrne.  A wide range of skills evident in the three parishes of Ballybacon-Grange, Newcastle and Ballymacarbry in Contae Phort L&aacute;irge.  I salute the work they do in the community, including with the Tidy Towns, the na&iacute;onra, the flourishing one we have in Caisle&aacute;n Nua, in the community hall and the new extension to the Muintir na Tire hall, as well as the brilliant work done by Catherine Moran and the participants.  </p>  <p>  Turning then to the community alert groups who are visiting the elderly, we have a participant, James O'Neill, spearheading the property-marking project throughout the country.  This initiative was recently launched in Monaghan, but it is being spearheaded from a small place in Caisle&aacute;n Nua.  We also have Tigh na nDaoine, which is a community house.  The national roll-out of the property-marking scheme is taking place from that little village on the River Suir.  Tremendous work is being done by the voluntary committee that keeps that organisation afloat.</p> <p>That is very onerous.  The supervisor of the team is Sean Byrne.  There is dignity in the work and we have had progression.  They have moved on to many other degrees and taken on other projects.  Above all, I am aware of the care that they give and the love and passion they have for their job.  They love going to work and playing a part.  They are being hived off at different ages and it is a battle to retain them.  We have had a significant rate of progression.  The Air&iacute; might listen rather than talking among themselves.  The Ministers should have an understanding of what the workers do and support them, not betray them and dismiss them.  It is shocking that they are waiting 14 years for a pay increase.  Mar focal scoir, I thank Michael Ormond, Stephen Burke and Catherine Corbett in the Department of Social Protection.  We would not function without them.  They are understanding officials and we appreciate that.</p></speech>

As has been noted by many speakers, the section 39 workers in the community and voluntary sector are not being properly paid and they have not received a pay increase for 14 years.  We have only to look at this year and the way the cost of living has gone up - it has practically doubled in the past 12 months - to know that these people cannot be expected to keep going with the rate of pay they are getting at present.  They do such important work, whether it is in the childcare sector or helping people with mental health problems, in rural social schemes and delivering meals on wheels to elderly people who can no longer make a meal for themselves.  This ensures they can stay in their homes for as long as possible without going into a nursing home or hospital.  They do such valuable work for all those people.</p>  <p>  We thank the workers for the great work they do in all of our communities and for keeping places looking so well, including entrances to towns.  Local authorities do not have the funding or operatives to do this kind of work.  The workers themselves are glad to be out in the morning and playing a part in their community and leaving the signs of their handiwork on so many parts of our towns and villages.  The fruits of their work are to the benefit of all the people who live in these rural places especially.  If they were not there, these places would be very shoddy and out of shape.  We thank the workers and supervisors.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure that the workers are treated the same as every other worker and not to have them waiting for 14 years for a pay rise.</p></speech>

The Government and the D&aacute;il are aware of the contribution that these projects make to CE participants and communities throughout Ireland.  Generally, a supervisor needs a car to complete his or her work on a daily basis.  It is the supervisor's responsibility to ensure the smooth payment of all benefits - fuel and bonus payments - to CE participants weekly.  As the Minister is aware, there are more than 19,000 CE participants in the country.  The programme offers training and development, which has helped many participants to achieve full-time employment.  The management of this also falls into the role of the CE supervisor.  Supervisors are funded by a Government grant, which appears to be the only way they can achieve a pay increase.  The current Government states that the Government is not the employer.  Many supervisors have more than 25 years service, and are deeply hurt that at this stage they do not have Government employment status.  This is totally inadequate for this to continue.  We have had motion after motion on this issue.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State is also a Deputy working on the ground and I am aware that she knows the value of CE supervisors and workers.  The same as RSS workers, they need to be looked at in a fair manner.</p></speech>

I know that myself.  In Goleen we have CE workers in community and voluntary organisations, and with the Goleen and District Community Council.  We have rural social workers, T&uacute;s workers and HSE employees in section 39 organisations, who are providing meals on wheels.  These workers are carrying out invaluable work.  I give great praise to the supervisors of CE schemes, the rural social scheme and the T&uacute;s scheme.  I also praise the workers themselves who look after graveyards, meals on wheels, Tidy Towns and community pitches - be it a GAA pitch or a soccer pitch.  Whatever task they are given, they beautify their area, in particular the Tidy Towns workers in places like Goleen, Schull, Ballydehob, Skibbereen, Clonakilty, Kinsale, Bantry, Dunmanway, Beara, and Sheep's Head, to mention just a few.  These people have done Trojan work, and both the supervisors and workers have been forgotten in the budget.  The budget can surely squeeze money out for these supervisors in a way that shows them some bit of respect, and the same for the workers going forward.  I appeal to the Minister to work on that so that we do not have to table another motion on the issue in six months' time, more or less saying the same thing.  It is not fair.  These people have not been treated with the respect they deserve.  Without them, we would have very poor communities.</p></speech>

When you say it quickly, 14 years slips off the tongue, but that is a very long time.  As somebody said at yesterday's briefing on the issue, they are tired asking for equity, justice and a bit of respect, and for an acknowledgement that their work matters.  All of us in this Chamber and throughout the country know how much their work matters.  There are so many services on which so many people rely right throughout the country, in rural and urban areas, towns, villages and inner cities - in family resource centres, drugs services, T&uacute;s, RSS and CE schemes, youth services, LEADER companies, services for children, adults, older people and education services.  It is a very long list.</p>  <p>  I have only mentioned some of the areas, but these are the kinds of service that form a type of safety net in society.  They are the kind of services that all of us as individuals or family members will require at some point in our lives.  These services are run by voluntary boards, volunteers who give their time, commitment and energy trying to provide, in conjunction with the State, local services to support local communities.  On a regular basis, all of us are approached by groups in our constituency who want to set up these kinds of services to serve the local community.  Only the day before yesterday I was approached by some people in Manorhamilton, who are looking to set up a family resource centre in north Leitrim.  That is the kind of service that supports families, but it is not coming from the State, it is coming from the local community, from people who are willing to give their energy, time and commitment and to fundraise and work with the State agencies to set up this vitally necessary service that will support their local community.  That is what is important here.</p>  <p>  The service is one thing, but the workers, those who deliver the services, must be supported and resourced, as they should be.  Sometimes I wonder if it is because these services are run by volunteers and voluntary boards which do not cost the State - they are free and there is no extra cost - is perhaps part of the reason that the services are not valued the way they should be.  If that is the case, it is unjust and discriminatory.</p> <p> I spoke to these workers yesterday but I have spoken to representatives in my office many times and met, in Leinster House on many occasions, representatives particularly of section 39 workers.  All of them feel passed from Billy to Jack.  They know their salaries and hours are set by the Government - their employer has no say in this - yet the Government says it has no responsibility for wage increases.  There have been no increases since 2008.  One person said yesterday, in what I thought was the best description ever, that they feel like nobody's child.  There was the recent sleight of hand - that is all I can call it, although it gives me no joy to do so - of the &euro;100 million we have all been told about, by the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste and last night in the Chamber by the Minister of State, but we need clarity here.  It is my understanding, and I ask her to correct me if I am wrong, that this money is largely intended to meet additional costs due to skyrocketing inflation, increased energy costs and so on.  All agencies and organisations need additional resources just to finance their increased day-to-day spending.  This money has not, again as far as I know, been specifically earmarked for an increase in workers' pay for section 39, section 56 and section 10 workers and so on.  On hearing three times in the past week, from the most senior of politicians, that this money is somehow meant to deal with the issue, when we know it will not bridge the gap, it is no wonder workers who have waited patiently react with anger and disbelief.</p> <p> The way forward is straightforward: the Government must engage with the unions that represent the workers and agree a mechanism and a way forward that will guarantee these workers receive their long-overdue pay increases.  As we are all aware, the directive on collective agreements has to be implemented.  Perhaps this would be an excellent way to start implementing that legislation.  Crucially, any agreement cannot and must not threaten in any way the viability of these services.  We must not pit workers against service users under any circumstances because these services fill the gaps left by the State.  They are essential services, and in many cases, they are a lifeline for those on the margins but, as I said earlier, they are not only for them.  All of us at some point in our lives, whether ourselves or our families, will use these services because they are for all of society.</p> <p> The Government has consistently refused to accept any responsibility for pay and conditions in this sector, insisting the State is not the employer.  It is washing its hands and that means these workers have had the worst of both worlds.  When the Government reduced pay in 2008 during the crash, they paid a price and their pay was reduced but when it comes to pay increases, the Government is basically saying they can take the pain.  In fact, it is saying it will see to it that they will take the pain, but that where there is gain, they are not in line for increases and that is just wrong.</p> <p> Staff retention is a huge issue, with up to one third of staff leaving annually, which is simply to be expected.  These workers are sick of listening to the answer, "No".  Let us give them the answer, "Yes".  Let us say we will sit down with them, go through the process with the Workplace Relations Commission, take responsibility and treat them fairly and with respect.</p></speech>

I have been finding this Private Member's motion to be one of the more difficult I have dealt with because, if I were in opposition, I would be standing alongside the Deputies and in support of them, as I did many a year.  That is why, when the Minister for Health stood here earlier and spoke about the process, I really welcomed that step change and that step forward.  It is a very welcome departure on this side of the House.  Many Ministers stood here in the past, but we are serious and we believe in that intent.</p><p>That is the case from the top down, given last Thursday, the T&aacute;naiste signalled it too, and only yesterday, the Taoiseach signalled it, stating:</p> <blockquote> 	  	That said, the Government will enter a process, as happened in 2019 at the Workplace Relations Commission.  We anticipate getting into some process to try to sort this out once and for all.  </blockquote>  <p>He then doubled down on that, going on to state, &ldquo;we need to get into some process to get the issues resolved for these organisations&rdquo;.  There was reference to the T&aacute;naiste's comments earlier, while my colleague the senior Minister spoke about the process earlier during this debate.  That is from the highest office in the Department of Health.</p><p>Other Departments need to be part of it as well, given many of the Deputies who spoke earlier referred to our community and voluntary workers, not just those within health.  There are many more than just us.  A total of 84,000 people work in this space and each one of them is valued and respected.  In response to Deputy Harkin&rsquo;s point, I want them to know their work matters.  We are dependent on their work and that is why this process needs to begin.  The phrase &quot;14 years&quot; slips off the tongue easily but it is far too long not to have proper recognition within a process.  When we talk about people in that space, the data show there are 32,841 organisations.  The sector includes approximately 2,886 entities and there are 83,714 members of staff, of whom the lion's share work in disability, where more than 27,000 people are section 39 workers.</p><p>I acknowledge what Deputy Sherlock said about the creation of the children's disability network teams, CDNTs, in itself, having created an inequality in the staff room, and I want to address that through the process with my colleagues.  While the figure of &euro;100 million might be bandied around without enough clarity, that is where the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform supported us in our ask to acknowledge the role and the pressure section 39 workers are under.  I acknowledge the fact that &euro;100 million is a once-off measure of funding to address the autumn and winter along with the challenges of energy, food, transport and other challenges within those organisations.  If that means it is pay, it will be only once off.  They are separate companies.  We dispense the money to the HSE and it is up to the companies to ensure these vital services the section 39 organisations provide continue to be sustainable through this difficult juncture we face.  That is where the &euro;100 million for the community nursing homes, hospices and disability teams will go, and we welcomed that once-off funding that was given within the budget.</p><p>As the Minister outlined earlier, the Government is committed to redesigning the voluntary hospice sector, which provides crucial palliative care and respite services from section 39 to section 38 status.  This will help ensure that highly specialised services are more closely integrated with other HSE services.  In March 2020, the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, established a cross-departmental strategic workforce advisory group in the home support and nursing home sectors.  The group examined issues such as the recruitment, retention, training, pay and conditions and career development of front-line care workers to identify solutions to the challenges being experienced in the home support and nursing home sector.</p> <p>It is no different to the home support issues I have in the disability sector with the delivery of personal assistant, PA, hours and home supports for persons with disabilities.  This group is also engaged with key stakeholders to better understand the workforce challenges people face.  Having taken stock of all the evidence, the group is currently finalising a report outlining the key findings and recommendations.  Following budget 2023, the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, announced that Tusla's funding allocation will be &euro;935 million in 2023, which is an increase of 4% on 2022.  This underlines the Government's commitment to supporting Tusla and its service delivery partners.</p> <p> In 2021, the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth conducted an Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service spending review into Tusla's residential costs to identify key cost drivers.  This review illustrated the agency's dependence on the voluntary sector to provide essential front-line services and the value for money and stability offered by these services.</p> <p> The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage's role with regard to homelessness is to make sure a framework of policy legislation and funding is provided to ensure housing authorities are in a position to address homelessness at a local level.  To that end, a further &euro;21 million has been secured for homeless services to bring that funding up to &euro;215 million.</p> <p> I have comprehensively addressed where we want the direction of travel to go.  We are not opposing the Labour Party motion in any way whatsoever.  We want to work with all Members.  Everybody in this House has a story and a connection with people who fall into that cohort of 82,000 people.  We need to ensure we create that process.  As one of our colleagues said, we cannot have motion after motion; it is now time for action.  It is time to get that process under way.  Let us see with all our partners in this space how we can create the process with a direction of travel and associated timelines.  At the end of the day, we want fairness, equity, respect and value.  That is what I, along with my colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, with the support of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, and the Taoiseach, who made a commitment in the past 24 hours, will deliver.  It is time now to engage in the process.</p> <p> I thank the Labour Party for giving us the opportunity to set out our stall.  There is more that we need to bring to the process, however.  I have no doubt that the Labour Party will hold us to account, as I will hold my senior Cabinet Ministers to account on that process.  I have 27,000 people in the disability sector without whom I cannot operate and on who I am dependent to deliver health and social care services in all our communities right across the country.  I am delighted that with the support of the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman and Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, we will have a cross-Government, cross-party solution to this process, and we will deliver that to the 82,000 people on whose behalf the Labour Party has tabled this motion today.  It has given us the opportunity to start forward from today.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-12a.80" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1599" speakername="Gerald Nash" time="11:52:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022101200019#R00200"><p>This has been a really welcome and, to a degree, very informative debate.  I have no doubt that what the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, said is sincere and genuine, and I have no doubt that the remarks made by the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, are also sincere and genuine.  Somebody is missing today, however, and that is the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath.  I will return to that particular issue later in my remarks.</p>  <p>  It is really welcome that we are having this public debate in our national Parliament about the real-life experience of those who run, manage and operate the services on which we all rely.  I was reflecting earlier on my own personal experience this week before attempting to prepare some remarks.  My family spent much of Monday morning helping a family member go to a service that is operated by community employment, CE, supervisors and funded by various agencies.  I spent most of my day on Monday dealing not with the HSE, the local authority, the Department of Social Protection and so on but with section 39 organisations, some section 56 organisations and other community and voluntary sectors in my community in Drogheda in terms of some very current issues.  That is the reality of life for all of us, and the centrality of life for the community and care sector in terms of literally everything we do and the services on which we depend.</p>  <p>  I hear what the Minister of State is saying about a process and I will respond to that later.  We also need be cautious, however.  As Deputy Sherlock said earlier, we parse the remarks made by Ministers in this Chamber, and the Minister of State is to be held account for the remarks she makes.  It is on the public record.  Citizens across this country look to the Minister of State for leadership they will hold her to account on the commitments she makes.   To be perfectly frank, the experience in this Chamber over the last week has been confusing.  It has created problems.</p>  <p>  We heard the T&aacute;naiste last week make remarks regarding the famed &euro;100 million that was provided for in the budget whereby some of those resources could be used for pay rises for the care and community sector without passing the responsibility on to the sector itself to make those decisions in a very challenging funding environment.  That was directly contradicted by the Taoiseach yesterday.  To be fair, it was further clarified by the Minister of State yesterday evening in terms of what that resource is designed for.  As Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in said, it is designed to keep the lights and the heating on in the services on which we all depend, and to keep service users safe, warm, fed and healthy over the next very challenging period.  It is a cost-of-living measure.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State should, however, ask many of our colleagues in the Gallery today about a cost-of-living crisis.  They had been experiencing one themselves before the current crisis emerged.  There has been no pay increase since 2008 for far too many of them.  There is a divergence between their pay and that enjoyed by comparative workers in the public sector.  It has been a permanent cost-of-living crisis for tens of thousands of community and voluntary sector workers across the country.</p>  <p>  One of the most egregious problems we have had in this society over the last few years is our treatment of community employment supervisors and rural social scheme, RSS, and T&uacute;s supervisors.  In 2008, a process was set up and a Labour Court recommendation was made in terms of improving the pay, terms and conditions and pension payments and so on.  It took until recent years to actually resolve that matter.  My colleague, Deputy Howlin, the then Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, established a forum in 2013 to address these issues; a process that was ignored by the previous Administration.  Some of those issues have now been resolved.  I use that example to illustrate a broader point about the official neglect of the community and voluntary sector and in this country on which we all depend.</p>  <p>  Much disinformation has been bandied around over the last few days by various Ministers about the purpose of this particular motion.  We were challenged on the notion of whether the Labour Party wants to see all of these community and voluntary sector services brought into public ownership and managed by the public service and Civil Service.  We very much do not, and neither does anybody represented in the Gallery today or the trade unions that represent them.  As my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, said, they are agile, flexible services that are designed to respond to community needs in a way the public service and Civil Service will never do.  They generally work really well.  Frankly, the Government was being disingenuous in making those claims and giving that impression to the wider public.  Those confused messages were problematic and created issues over the last few days.  Some of those problems need to be addressed and repaired, quite frankly.</p>  <p>  One way, though, of making sure the State has to take ownership of and responsibility for managing these organisations and the kinds of services they provide is by not paying their staff and not giving adequate sources to the organisations that manage those staff or those services.  Ultimately, if it does not, because of the issue of churn in the sector and the loss of staff and retention of skilled staff, the reality is that the responsibility for managing those services is being done really well by section 39, section 56, section 10 and other organisations that are operating in our communities across the country.  The responsibility for the provision of those services will then fall directly on the State itself.  Therefore, the State is arguably being penny wise and pound foolish in terms of how it is responding to these issues.  The investment needs to be made now.</p>  <p>  We have all been subjected time and time again to the mantra from individual Departments, but especially the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, that there is no direct employment relationship between the organisations and individual workers and the line funding Departments or agencies.</p> <p>We understand and accept that but I remind the House about the following matter.  A precedent was set in terms of a process earlier this year by the visionary work that has been organised by the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth in resourcing the employment regulation order to drive better pay, terms, conditions and retention in the early years sector, using a mechanism re-established by the Labour Party in recent years.</p> <p> I am pleased to see that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has belatedly joined us.  We are disappointed that the Minister or one of his colleagues in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform did not take this motion because when I talk about the mantra of repeating the idea that there is no direct employment relationship, that comes from on high.  It comes from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and distils its way down to each and every Department.  Another Opposition spokesperson made remarks earlier to the effect that you go into a negotiation with a Government agency in the Labour Court, or the WRC previously, and the line Department might decide that it wants to do business with you but the people who are saying they have no direct employment relationship are outside the door with their calculators refusing to do a deal.  The reality is there is a relationship and that nonsense and guff needs to be addressed and got over.  People need to understand that if a process is to emerge from this, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has a critical role to play, on a cross-Government basis, to make sure that any process that might emerge from today will be taken seriously and operated in good faith by everyone.</p> <p> The Minister of State mentioned the number of people who are working in the sector and there is a great organisation called Benefacts that we all relied on for up-to-date and real-time information on employment numbers, funding and so on for section 39, section 56 and section 10 organisations and for the community and voluntary sector more generally.  It has effectively been closed down by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and we can only manage what we measure.  That was a real problem and that is something we are going to regret when it comes to us being in a position to analyse the way forward and propose the best way forward for the community and voluntary sector and the workers therein.</p> <p> We are a solutions-orientated party and we try to be constructive.  We fundamentally believe in the principles of collective bargaining and nobody should be afraid of collective bargaining.  I am pleased that the Minister has put on the record his commitment to engaging in a process of sorts.  The next step, if we are to develop a process in good faith with the trade unions and employers, is to have a fundamental role for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in order for that process to succeed.  That should involve a commitment on multi-annual funding for organisations to give certainty and security, not just to staff but to service users themselves.  There should also be a commitment, through the public procurement process, to have a drive and move forward in pay parity and convergence of the pay of these workers and public servants into the future.  The next statement we need to hear from the Government is a commitment from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, to move this process on.  A phone call should be made today to SIPTU, F&oacute;rsa and the INMO to deliver on the commitment made by the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, and reiterated by the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, today that a process would be entered into to address these issues.</p></speech>

October's bill will land shortly and households are already worried sick at the thought of it.  We already know that people are struggling to pay their bills following never-ending hikes over the past 18 months.  The facts speak for themselves.  There were 715 domestic electricity disconnections in the first half of this year and that was before many of those hikes kicked in.  We also know that 125,000 households are in arrears, and that figure is only going to get worse.</p>  <p>  The Government's refusal to reduce and cap electricity prices at pre-crisis levels is a big mistake.  It will leave hard-pressed families and households wide open to further increases and the possibility of disconnection.  As families face into a long winter they worry that they will not be able to afford to keep the lights on.  I must tell the Minister that what is being put in place to prevent disconnections is not good enough.  The plan to introduce a ban on disconnections from December to February falls far short of what is needed.  People cannot wait until December.  They need protection from disconnections right now.  What is needed is an immediate ban on disconnections now and to run that ban right through to the end of March for every household in the State.</p>  <p>  We turn to the 346,000 households that use prepay electricity meters.  Despite the Taoiseach's commitment that nobody will be disconnected this winter, we have still not seen any real plan from the Government to protect these households.  We know that once the &euro;20 emergency credit runs out, prepay customers are disconnected by default.  The Taoiseach said yesterday that the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, is looking at waiving the fees for vulnerable customers to change to bill pay but that is only for medically vulnerable customers and not for those in financial hardship.  The fees to switch to bill pay should be waived for all customers.</p>  <p>  Households that cannot afford to pay need more than being told to seek help from social welfare or the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, MABS.  They need a specific solution as we come into the winter period and there are such solutions that can be brought about if the Government will is there to make it happen.  As the Minister knows, many suppliers can extend an additional credit, sometimes called a friendly credit, at weekends and public holidays to prevent disconnections.  This already exists.  To protect prepay customers, this friendly credit should be extended to a 24-7 basis for the duration of the ban on disconnections.  This is an unprecedented crisis for households and the Government has a responsibility to ensure that all households are protected from disconnection.  There can be no exclusions in this.</p>  <p>  We have asked the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste what the plan is and today I am asking the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to do two specific things that can provide protection and certainty to households.  Will the Government introduce the ban on disconnections for all customers from now until the end of March?  Will the Minister guarantee that those using prepaid electricity meters are included by extending that friendly credit for the duration of the ban on disconnections? </p></speech>

I want to convey my personal and deepest sympathies to all of those who have been bereaved and to the wider community.  I know the funeral of James O&rsquo;Flaherty is taking place at this moment and this afternoon funeral mass will be held for Catherine O'Donnell and her 13-year-old son James Monaghan.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a n-anamacha.</p>  <p>  I thank Deputy Kerrane for raising the issue of the cost of living and, in particular, the issue of the vital continuation of electricity supply for households all over Ireland.  I acknowledge that a lot of people are worried because the level of inflation is at a 40-year high.  We have had a raft of utility bill increases announced, which in many instances have only kicked in during recent weeks, and this coincides with a time when people will be using more energy when the days are shorter and the nights are getting colder.</p> <p>That is why the Government has responded in what we believe is a very fair and genuine way in the context of the overall budget package of &euro;11 billion we announced two weeks ago.  Individuals in apartments and houses all over the country want to know what it means for them.  Talking about billions is of little comfort when you are worried about the next bill.  The Government completely understands this.  That is why, yesterday, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, and I put flesh on the bones by laying out the specific payment dates for a range of payments through the social protection system that amount to some &euro;1.2 billion.  Those payments, which will start next week and which will conclude in early December, are for people who are among the most vulnerable, including older people, those living alone, carers, people on disability allowance and invalidity payments, and working family payment recipients, who are low-income working families.</p> <p> We are going much further than all of that in the budget, with increases in core weekly rates that will kick in on 1 January and an expansion of eligibility for the fuel allowance for 80,000-plus pensioners and others on low levels of income.  In addition, there are the three &euro;200 electricity credits, the rental tax credit this year and next, a significant income tax package that will benefit hundreds of thousands of workers all over Ireland, a once-off reduction in the Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, fee and improvements in maintenance grants, a reduction in childcare fees that will commence next year, free schoolbooks at primary level, the extension of GP visit cards to hundreds of thousands of people, the elimination of hospital charges, the extension of reduced public transport fares and so on.  That is just to give an overview of the range of measures we are funding within the overall package.</p> <p> The Deputy raised a specific issue that is of concern to many people.  As she knows, the one-month pause in disconnections generally for non-payment has been extended to three months.  She is correct that for vulnerable customers, the pause in disconnections for non-payment has been extended to six months.  As the Taoiseach said yesterday, work is being progressed by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, to waive the fee to enable people to switch from pay-as-you-go payments to bill pay in order to allow people to avail of the protections that are available for vulnerable customers.  In addition, the CRU has directed that all customers with a financial hardship meter, that is, pay-as-you-go customers, must be placed on the cheapest tariff available from their supplier from 1 December.  Individual utility companies all have specific hardship funds that are available as well.  A change has also been made to allow for a reduced payment for legacy debt reduction, allowing people to pay for new supply and for energy that continues to be provided.  Of course, we will continue to fund the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, MABS, and our Intreo offices through the exceptional needs payment.  I will respond further presently.</p></speech>

Just like the Taoiseach yesterday, when we raised the need for a ban on evictions to keep people in their homes, the Minister spent most of his response reiterating what was in the budget.  Some of what is in the budget, particularly for those on fixed incomes and who rely on social welfare, is welcome.  However, we are talking about householders who face disconnection.  A total of 715 households have already been disconnected in the first part of this year alone, before we get to the winter period.  We do not have certainty as to the timeline for the electricity credits.</p>  <p>  Of course, we would have taken different steps and made different decisions in order to provide certainty to households.  The vast majority of people and households do not receive the fuel allowance.  They are being left extremely vulnerable because they do not have supports in regard to energy prices, which are increasing, and they do not have as easy access as the Government contends they do to the additional needs payment, in respect of which it is taking between five and eight weeks for a decision to be made.  If you have a utility bill, you cannot wait two months for a decision on emergency financial assistance.  I am speaking specifically about a ban on disconnections for householders who are on prepaid meters, of whom there are 346,000.  They will take no comfort from the Minister's response.</p></speech>

Bill pay customers have that three-month period in which there cannot be a disconnection for non-payment.  For vulnerable customers, that has been increased to six months.  I have outlined a whole series of interventions that have been made to assist pay-as-you-go customers.  We acknowledge they are in a different and more vulnerable situation because, in the absence of anything else happening, if their credit is gone, then the power, in essence, will stop.  There should be no reason to do with financial hardship that anyone loses power supply this winter.  We have to look at this in the round, including all the interventions we are making and all the cash supports that are being made available to the most vulnerable all over Ireland, in addition to the strengthening of protections being introduced as a result of the work the regulator is doing.  The Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, continues to engage with the regulator.  We certainly do not want to see any vulnerable household lose its electricity supply this winter.  We do not believe that should happen and we believe sufficient supports have been put in place to prevent it from occurring.</p></speech>

Yesterday, planning permission for 1,400 housing units was quashed in the High Court after An Bord Plean&aacute;la conceded three cases that were linked to its former deputy chairman, Paul Hyde.  Those challenging the developments raised the issue of objective bias in the board's decision-making process.  The board's legal advice was that it could not defend those challenges.</p>  <p>  I want to say clearly that Mr. Hyde is facing a criminal prosecution following a Garda investigation into his conduct at the board, but my remarks do not relate to that.  The criminal prosecution is not a matter for this House and I am no making no comment on it.  However, the prospect of a large number of planning permissions being quashed in the High Court is most certainly something we should be discussing.  It seems to me there is a concerted determination in Government circles to sweep the scandal of An Bord Plean&aacute;la under an increasingly large and bumpy carpet.</p>  <p>  A number of reviews have been undertaken.  Most recently, the Planning Regulator issued a report last week demanding urgent reform in An Bord Plean&aacute;la across a range of areas.  The response of the board to that damning report was to welcome the fact it did not contain specific criticisms of the board's practices.  How an organisation, not least an extremely important authority the reputation of which is currently in tatters, could read such a devastating critique of itself and issue such a cheery response is, frankly, beyond me.  It raises serious questions about whether those who remain in leadership positions at the board are up to the task of instituting the kind of root-and-branch reform that is required.  How can you drive reform if you do not acknowledge the problems?</p>  <p>  A related issue arises.  One of the outstanding reviews of An Bord Plean&aacute;la is one it is undertaking of itself.  As far as we know, the conduct of other board members will not form part of that review or any review.  This is despite the fact we know some sitting board members routinely overruled the reports of their own planning inspectors and made decisions on planning applications that were near or even next door to their own homes.</p>  <p>  My questions to the Minister are as follows.  How many planning permissions are going to be quashed as a result of this scandal?  Has the Government been provided with that information?  Is An Bord Plean&aacute;la likely to face legal action from developers in cases where permissions have been quashed?  Does the Government have confidence in the chairman of An Bord Plean&aacute;la and, if so, does it have confidence in him to deliver the reform of the board that is so urgently needed?  Why is it that the decisions of just one board member, Mr. Hyde, have been scrutinised when allegations have been made about others in news reports, including, for example, Michelle Fagan?  It just does not make sense.</p></speech>

We regard the revelations that have emerged as being of the utmost seriousness.  That is why the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, has acted decisively and it is why the Government is acting.  The Minister has obtained Government approval for an action plan for An Bord Plean&aacute;la, outlining a series of specific measures to address the Office of the Planning Regulator's phase 1 review recommendations.  The issue has been discussed at Government level.</p>  <p>  It is important to recap briefly.  The issue that triggered all of this is one with which we are well familiar.  On 27 July, the Minister received the report from Mr. Remy Farrell SC into the management of conflicts of interest and relevant disclosures by the deputy chairperson of An Bord Plean&aacute;la in respect of certain decisions of the board.</p> <p>As the Deputy has acknowledged, in the middle of August, on the advice of the Attorney General the Minister referred the report to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Standards In Public Office Commission, SIPO.  The Office of the DPP is actively dealing with the matter and has requested that Mr. Farrell's report not be published or otherwise released until such time as the process has been concluded.  In view of this, it would be inappropriate for me, or anyone on behalf of the Government, to comment further on that specific matter.  I acknowledge that the Deputy has not asked me to do so.</p> <p> The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage has obtained Government approval for an action plan arising from phase 1 of the recommendations of the Office of the Planning Regulator, OPR, as part of the review that was carried out by the OPR of An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The action plan includes measures to address conflicts of interest, changes to the board appointment system, strengthening the senior management team and the provision of further resources to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  A whole series of very significant and impactful changes have been agreed to and will be implemented.  We provided significant resources to the Minister of Housing, Local Government and Heritage in the budget for beefing up the capacity of An Bord Plean&aacute;la and to address a number of the issues that have been raised.</p> <p> With regard to broader issues that have been raised in relation to the board's internal processes, on 24 August the OPR initiated its review of An Bord Plean&aacute;la systems and procedures of part of its review programme.  The review, which is being undertaken by independent planning experts from other jurisdictions and Mr. Conleth Bradley SC, is being carried out in two parts in line with the terms of reference which have been published on the OPR's website.  This review will help inform other internal changes as required and will also assist in identifying legislative amendments which may be required.  The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage has welcomed the publication of phase 1 of the OPR review of An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The OPR review sets out a series of recommendations, a number of which the Minister and his Department will now act upon, and a number of which will fall to the board for implementation.  In order to uphold trust in the planning system and maintain its ongoing functionality, the Minister has concluded that a range of actions are now required which involve both immediate and medium to longer term actions as well.</p></speech>

On conflicts of interest, there are other people who have had conflicts of interest, including in respect of making decisions very close to where they live when that is supposed to be precluded.  Will the Minister address that?  Last year, An Bord Plean&aacute;la spend 45% of its budget losing or conceding challenges in the High Court.  Some of that goes back to the disastrous political decision to turn the planning appeals board into an application process for strategic housing developments, SHDs.  That was purely a political decision.  It was very predictable at that point that people would revert to the courts because they were not being given the opportunity to appeal.  I think it was a desperate decision and I made that point when the decision was being made.  I ask the Minister to respond to the questions that I asked.</p></speech>

It has to be accountable.  I cannot give the Deputy a figure on the number of planning permissions that might be overturned in the Irish courts, nor would it be possible for anyone to estimate that.  Of course, any overturning of a planning decision by a court of law is a serious matter.  To be honest, there have been too many instances, in particular, relating to SHD decisions by An Bord Plean&aacute;la, that have been overturned in the courts, presumably on very good legal grounds.  We need to have a planning system that is more robust, where the final destination for the outcome of planning matters is in our planning bodies rather than in the courts of law.  As the Deputy is aware, there is a substantive piece of work under way which is nearing completion now, whereby a new consolidated planning Bill will be brought forward by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage very shortly.  We believe that that will significantly streamline and make the system more efficient.  It will reduce the legal risk of planning decisions being overturned in a court of law.  I will not comment on allegations that are being made by others.  As the Deputy knows, an internal review is under way into particular allegations that have been made and specific decisions that certain parties were party to within An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I cannot comment on those.</p></speech>

Under the current service-level agreement, SLA, these workers, who are employed by local authorities, provide services to Irish Water.  Under the terms of the SLA, they can, if they wish, transfer to Irish Water in January 2026.  Part of the agreement was that there would be a referendum to enshrine water services under public ownership and management.  Recently, a draft framework agreement has been negotiated through the WRC, which brings forward the date of possible transfer to Irish Water to January 2023, which is about 10 weeks away, without any commitment to a referendum on water services being under public ownership and management.  This has raised very serious concerns among these workers who, if the framework agreement is implemented, will lose their existing public service status, with concerns about their pension rights they currently have as local authority employees.  Part of the agreement is that workers who choose to remain with the local authority will be redeployed.  However, the local authority national managers' organisation has indicated that it will not redeploy these workers.  To date, the relevant union has not held a ballot of the workers concerned.  While the Minister can not do anything about that, I am sure he will agree that it is a serious democratic deficit.  One thing the Minister and the Government can do to address these workers' concerns is to give a clear commitment to hold a referendum on water services in public ownership and management.  I refer not just to a commitment in a words, but a definite commitment with a date and an outline of the wording of such a referendum.</p>  <p>  In 2016 I introduced a Bill based on the wording agreed by the unions involved in the Right2Water campaign, which would bring water services very clearly under public ownership and also importantly, under public management.  The Bill passed First Stage without opposition, but has been stuck, or buried, at Committee Stage for six years, with the excuse that we are waiting for possible amendments from both the present and previous Attorneys General.  I do not believe any such amendments will ever be produced.</p>  <p>  The Business Committee has now agreed that a debate on the future of water services will be taken by the first week in November.  Maybe then certain political parties can come forward and honestly declare their true intention on this issue.  I can assure the Minister that in discussions and contact that I have had with many of the workers involved, they have told me that they will resist, in every way they can, being railroaded into an agreement without a vote, without a guarantee on their public service status and without a referendum.  They will not accept it.  Will the Minister and the Government announce a date and wording to enshrine ownership of our water in the Constitution, preventing future privatisation?</p></speech>

First, to address the transfer of staff from within our local government system who are working in the area of water services to Irish Water, I am aware that very significant progress has been made.  The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage has met directly with the representatives of the workers on a number of occasions.  As the Deputy said, the offices of the WRC have been used to try to reach an agreement.  My understanding is that there are up to 3,000 working across the local authority system in respect of water services.  We want to have a system of provision of water and wastewater services that is seamless and integrated and where there is a very clear delineation in terms of the responsibilities of Irish Water relative to local authorities.  As the Deputy is aware, as part of the framework and the progression of this issue, commitments have been given to workers, including that they will be transferred to Irish Water on terms that are no worse than their existing terms as employees of the local government sector.  They are employed by specific local authorities and there is an SLA in place at the moment.  Clearly, there are details that have to be ironed out.  For example, the workers will be transferring into an Irish Water pension scheme and will be leaving a local authority pension scheme.  The Irish Water pension scheme is Exchequer-funded, as such.  The commitment that they are going to be looked after and are not going to be any worse off in terms of their pension entitlements and so on must be stood over and vindicated.  My understanding is that very good progress has been made.  The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage is working collaboratively with all of the stakeholders involved, including the WRC, Irish Water, the local government sector and, of course, the representatives of the workers to ensure that transfer goes through.</p> <p>It is in everyone's interest that it does.  Many staff will choose not to leave the local government sector and will be redeployed away from water services in many instances.  That is a choice they will have.  They are not being forced to leave the local government sector.</p> <p> The Deputy asked about a referendum on Irish Water and public ownership.  The most important reassurance I can give is that there is no threat whatsoever to the public ownership of Irish Water or our water network.  We have a system whereby domestic users do not pay a separate charge for water whereas commercial users do.  There is no suggestion from anyone in government, or any proposal I am aware of, that would put Irish Water at any threat whatsoever.  We will respond to the proposal for a referendum to copper-fasten its status as a public utility.</p></speech>

I have had a lot of contact and discussions with the workers involved.  They have told me they will resist in every way they can being railroaded into an agreement without a vote, a guarantee of their public service status and a referendum.  They will not accept it.</p>  <p>  The Thirty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Water in Public Ownership) (No. 2) Bill 2016, proposes that: "The Government shall be collectively responsible for the protection, management and maintenance of the public water system.", and that this be inserted into Article 28.4.2&deg; of the Constitution.  This Bill is in line with the recommendations of the expert commission on domestic water services and a special Oireachtas Joint Committee on Future Funding of Domestic Water Services.  It is supported by the Right2Water unions, Unite, the Communications Workers Union, CWU, Mandate and the Operating Plasterers and Allied Trades Society of Ireland, OPATSI.  It is supported by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, which represents 600,000 members.  It is supported by thousands upon thousands of people who were on the streets during the Right2Water campaign.  It is supported by parties in the D&aacute;il who supported the Right2Water campaign, including some members of the Government who, in 2018, declared they would support the thirty-fifth amendment Bill.  If the Minister cannot give me a date today, will he assure me that the relevant Minister will announce the wording of a referendum, and a date for it, to protect our water service from privatisation within the next two weeks?</p></speech>

That commitment is being given in the context of the framework that the Minister for Housing, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, has brought forward.  I will discuss the specific issues the Deputy has raised with the Minister, but that is my understanding of where the matter stands.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy knows, there is a clear commitment in the programme for Government to retain Irish Water in public ownership as a national stand-alone regulated entity.  We very much look forward to seeing what the Oireachtas committee brings forward.  I will ask the Minister for Housing, Heritage and Local Government to revert directly to the Deputy on the matter.</p></speech>

Never has there been a more important time to be decisive and to reduce the crippling bills that households, small businesses and farmers are facing.  All energy customers are once again facing extremely significant increases in their bills from this month, with seven providers applying massive price hikes.  These companies are receiving little or no support from the community, public or businesses.  Why would the Government do nothing and effectively hand these companies <i>carte blanche</i>approval to do what they like?  That is what it has done.</p><p>When all of the price increases since the start of last year are totalled, they add up to more than &euro;1,700 per year to people's electricity bills and over &euro;1,700 to their gas bills.  In overall terms, these cumulative increases will mean an average household will be paying &euro;2,500 more in energy costs than was the case in 2020.  Those are the basic and bare facts.</p><p>The Government's only intervention of offering a rebate for households this winter is completely insufficient.  This rebate will not even cover 25% of the increased cost of household energy bills above 2020 levels.  It is a pittance.  It is silly.  For many households, that amount will not even pay one month's supply bill.  Those are the facts of the matter.  In all, the money from this voucher scheme will only end up going directly to the energy companies, which is not the desired effect.  In reality, it is a bailout for those companies.</p><p>Ministers have been quick to recommend that customers change providers to obtain better prices.  According to the CRU, however, customers who attempt to switch will be able to make no real savings because the discounts offered as incentives have been dramatically reduced.  The companies are doing what they like all the time.</p><p>Electric Ireland has approximately 1.2 million electricity customers and 145,000 gas customers.  Its parent group, the ESB, reported operating profits of &euro;679 million for last year, an increase of 10% on 2020.  The dividend it paid to the State was a mere &euro;126 million.  Why does the Government not take a much larger slice of that?  The massive profits made by ESB Group during the current energy crisis should be used to reduce utility bills.  This is especially true when one considers that ESB Group has reported overall profits of &euro;1.5 billion in the past year alone.  That is a staggering level of funds.  No one would deny a company the right to make a profit but those are staggering, eye-watering figures.  As the owner of this company, how can the Government allow it to make record profits off the backs of ordinary householders and small businesses amid soaring prices for energy?</p></speech>

We absolutely recognise that there is a lot of worry out there.  Many households, businesses, community groups, sports clubs and so on are genuinely worried about the months ahead and the bills that are coming their way.  They worry about how they are going to be able to meet those bills.  We accept that, and it is why we have brought forward a whole range of issues, which I will not go through again because I think people are well familiar with them.  However, by any measure, it is a serious response from the Government.  We have done the best we can in bringing forward an &euro;11 billion package that will benefit every household in the country.</p>  <p>  The Deputy made points about the energy companies.  We are acting on that through the EU framework.  There was agreement on 30 September at the Council of energy ministers.  That will result in a temporary solidarity contribution from the fossil fuel production companies and a cap on market revenues for those energy providers that have not seen an increase in their costs.  That will apply to providers involved in wind and solar energy, and so on.  The commitment we are giving is that the resources that we collect, and we are currently calculating and assessing how much money Ireland is likely to get from those initiatives, will be given back to households and businesses to help them cope with the increased bills they are facing.</p>  <p>  The cap on market revenues must be implemented by the start of December and the solidarity contribution by the end of December.  That is a tight timeframe, given that legislation and technical implementation in the energy market will be needed.  The Government is committed to doing that and to making sure that we provide the benefit of that extra revenue we will collect for those who need it most.</p>  <p>  The temporary business energy support scheme will be up and running next month.  It will be backdated to 1 September.  As the Deputy knows, it provides for a payment, capped at &euro;10,000 per month, to individual businesses which will meet 40% of the increase in their energy costs this year relative to last year.  It will be based on the per unit price.  Of course, that will be administered by the Revenue Commissioners.  We believe it will be of significant benefit to businesses all over the country.</p>  <p>  We know that clubs, service providers and community groups are facing a hard winter.  We want to keep the floodlights on.  We want to keep our community halls warm.  We want people to be able to avail of all of these vital services and local amenities.  That is why we have provided &euro;340 million in extra funding between now and the end of the year across a whole range of areas.  Some &euro;35 million, for example, will be provided for our sports clubs to ensure that our children and all members of clubs across the country can continue to avail of the facilities that we and local communities have invested in over the years.</p></speech>

The Government is tired; it has created this problem itself.</p> <p>The Government likes to blame the war in Ukraine but, as awful as that is, the Government has created this problem.  You cannot make a silk purse out of a sow's ear.  That is what the Government is trying to do here.  Some 40% is not nearly enough for businesses.  I know of one SuperValu in Tipperary whose bill increased from &euro;6,000 in February last year to &euro;18,000 this year.  What good is 40%?  That is replicated for all other businesses, big and small.</p> <p> The Departments did not have the energy to stop the money going to aid millionaires and people like ourselves who do not need it and can manage without it.  What is wrong with the Government that it cannot do that?  It is time for the entire Government to pack its bags, b&iacute; ar an bh&oacute;thar and go back to the people because the people know the Government has created this problem.  It is blinkered by Green Party policies and no matter what happens it will continue with the folly of supporting the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and following him down this cul-de-sac from which there is no comeback or exit.  It is a deep, dark cul-de-sac and that is where the Government will remain but the people of the country do not want to go down those cul-de-sacs.  They are frozen, worried, they cannot afford to meet these bills and the Government is trying to kill their spirit.  It will not kill that spirit because they are resilient people and they know they will get the Government out very soon from where they are sitting on their pretty seats.</p></speech>

It is a ludicrous notion to increase the cost of building homes at a time when we are facing an unprecedented housing and inflationary crisis.  Incredibly, those families that were impacted by the defective blocks scandal and Celtic tiger-era fire safety defects will be forced to pay more to rebuild under this levy.  Will the Minister please break through the spin for us, and the briefings and reports, and let us know whether the finance Bill will include provision for this levy?

The finance Bill will be published.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, will give very careful consideration to all the issues that have been raised.  However, we have to ensure that we can fund a &euro;2.7 billion bill for the mica issue.  The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, has a report on his desk relating to apartment defects, which could cost up to &euro;2.5 billion to resolve.  Between those two schemes, there is a bill of &euro;5 billion that somebody will have to meet at some point in time.

Five years ago, many of these women had to threaten strike action in order to get basic respect within the FAI.  I put it to the Minister that Irish soccer and Irish women's soccer, in particular, has not got enough support or respect from Irish politics.  A woman in Ireland cannot be a professional footballer.  Young girls who dream of becoming professional footballers have to go to England; many of them are doing that.</p>  <p>  Last year, the Government gave &euro;95 million to the horse and greyhound fund.  This is a direct fund paid for through a levy on betting.  No other sport benefits from it.  I suggest to the Minister, and I know the Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Deputy Chambers, is quite committed to Irish football, that we find pathways for young women to keep playing in Ireland and should not say to them that they have to go abroad in order to fulfil their footballing ambitions.  We should build on the legacy of what was achieved last night for future generations of Irish footballing women.</p></speech>

I know of the fantastic work that is being done at grassroots level.  I assure the Deputy that the Government will support the FAI in all the efforts that are under way to strengthen the supports for girls' soccer in Ireland.  That is specifically provided for within the memorandum of understanding the Department has with the FAI.  I assure the Deputy of our continued commitment to that. </p></speech>

The Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, continues to stand over the flawed commission's report, which absolved the church of any responsibility.  The State and church perpetuated some of the worst human rights abuses in our history, including illegal adoptions, illegal vaccine trials, mass graves and the abuse of children.  The Government remains deferential to the church instead of pursuing it to offer some form of compensation to survivors.  We also learned the Government's redress scheme will exclude many of the survivors, no doubt with input from the Minister's Department, which was more concerned with costs than justice.  The Government is intentionally giving as little as possible to as small a number of survivors as possible, while allowing the religious orders that profited from these crimes off scot-free.</p></speech>

Those negotiations are ongoing at present.  There has been no conclusion in terms of those engagements.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy said, yesterday we brought forward the final redress Bill, which allows for a scheme that will cover 34,000 individuals, recognising the major impacts that mother and baby homes have had on Irish society.  It is hoped we will bring that legislation to the House in the next two weeks, and pass it rapidly through the Houses, so those 34,000 individuals can avail of financial payments and 19,000 individuals can receive enhanced medical cards.</p></speech>

For about two years now, I have highlighted the case of a mother who works for a State agency, is living with her child in the same bedroom in emergency accommodation, is not entitled to HAP or social housing and, at one point, was threatened with eviction from emergency accommodation.</p>  <p>  These are the bitter fruits of the Government's refusal to raise the income thresholds for social housing and HAP.  If someone is not entitled to social housing because of his or her income, that individual is not entitled to HAP or emergency accommodation.  The Government recently published a review that was completed in November.  That review concluded that we need another review.  When will we actually raise the thresholds on social housing?  My minute is up now. </p></speech>

Leaving social housing income limits aside, it should not be the case that a family with two children with special needs are sleeping rough so I ask the Deputy to please provide us with the details of the case so that we can make sure it is followed up on.  The Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, has increased the limits for five different counties.

Last Monday night, along with other public representatives, I met with some GPs in Ballinasloe to discuss grave concerns about the out-of-hours GP service for a large part of south-east Galway, including Eyrecourt, Lawrencetown, Kiltormer, Kilconnell, parts of Ballinasloe, Portumna and Loughrea.  The service serves approximately 15,000 patients and is currently providing full 24-hour cover, including 53 straight hours of cover at the weekend, without a driver, nursing administration staff or a triage service.  The HSE has made an application for funding to the Department of Health each year for the last five years but this has been refused on the basis that there is no funding available.  Last Monday night, four of the service's doctors told us that they will be retiring very soon and that the whole system will collapse.</p></speech>

The special educational needs organiser, SENO, in north Tipperary has been covering the area to the best of her ability.  Given the rising number seeking special needs education and supports and the importance of access to SENOs for parents, will the Minister have this situation rectified?  It is shocking that we do not have a SENO in south Tipperary.  The last SENO did a great job.  Given that Tipperary is 115 miles long, it is just not possible for the SENO in north Tipperary to provide that service.  Parents are frustrated and children with such needs are not being looked after in a timely manner.</p></speech>

We provided increased resources for the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, in the most recent budget.  That will result in an increase in the number of SENOs all over Ireland.  If the Deputy provides me with the specifics of the case in south Tipperary, we will take it up.  There is a new CEO in charge of the NCSE which, as I have said, has been given resources to increase the number of SENOs in the country.  I hope that will help to resolve the issue in south Tipperary.</p></speech>

I put down a number of written questions asking for a progress report but the only response I have got is that there is a review ongoing in the Workplace Relations Commission.  Despite a real crisis in the sector, very little progress has been made in getting this review up and running.  Approximately half of people with a cancer diagnosis will require radiation therapy and this can only be delivered by a radiation therapist.  For the north west, that service is mainly delivered in Galway.  Approximately 15% of radiation therapist positions are vacant and that number is rising rather than falling because of poor pay and poor career opportunities.  This is not just about staff, however.  It is about timely quality care for cancer sufferers.  Will the Minister ensure there is no delay in finalising the review?</p></speech>

I will make the point that we have increased overall staffing numbers in healthcare by 15,000 over the last two years.  This is biggest increase in staff since the HSE was established and includes 4,500 nurses and midwives, 2,300 health and social care professionals and 1,400 doctors and dentists.  The Deputy has highlighted a particular issue.  We will follow up on it and revert to her.</p></speech>

I was watching from my office.  I have a very quick question.  Shannon Airport has submitted an application for a public service obligation route to the Department of Transport.  This will soon come across the Minister, Deputy McGrath's desk.  It seeks a service between Shannon Airport and Amsterdam Airport Schiphol.  Brexit has been a disaster for everyone on this island but we in the Shannon region are feeling it particularly strongly.  We in the west of Ireland are geographically peripheral and distant from continental Europe.  We have key companies like Boston Scientific and EI Electronics and many other very large companies that need to get their products out of the mid-west and into continental Europe.  We need this service.  The proposal has been warmly received by many.  At 3 p.m., I am going to the Dutch Embassy to again push this matter.  I would love to hear some words of positivity from the Minister.</p></speech>

I commend the management of Shannon Airport on its recovery, which is now well advanced, following the very dark days of Covid-19.  Government has provided a lot of support and will continue to provide support to Shannon Airport through the regional airports programme.  In light of the pressure Dublin Airport has been under, it makes sense to support our regional airports, including Shannon Airport and Cork Airport.  I will follow up on the specific issue the Deputy has raised.  I appreciate the importance of Schiphol as a key hub and what such a route would open up for Shannon.  That is something we will raise with the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, and the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan.</p></speech>

These are attacks on civilian targets, on cities and residential buildings.  What is happening there is appalling and subhuman.  I will ask the Minister, Deputy Coveney, to respond to the specific question the Deputy has asked but we have been very clear about whom we are politically standing with, united with and acting in solidarity with, that is, the Ukrainian people.</p></speech>

I will raise the sense of abandonment my constituents in Meath East feel with regard to Garda resources.  As the Minister will know, there is a Garda station there that is not fit for purpose and which is only manned from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. despite the fact that there is a population of more than 32,000 in the area.  The Garda Commissioner's office has said that the Office of Public Works, OPW, is preparing proposals but my constituents in Meath East are asking whether we have a date for when the Garda station will be fully resourced, fully manned and open on a full-time basis and when the Meath East area will be brought into the Drogheda Garda division.  We are coming into winter, when we always see an increase in the number of burglaries and other crimes, and my constituents feel abandoned.  Do we have a date for when they will see a fully resourced and fully complete Garda station brought under the Drogheda division?</p></speech>

Through the Vivian Guerin report, there has been a great amount of investment in our communities and supporting the Garda across Louth and even into the east Meath area.  The Garda Commissioner has visited a number of stations in the area the Deputy has mentioned and there are plans afoot to make sure that we have a 24-hour response and the services that people require.  However, I do not have dates for any changes or information on when or where resources are going to be put in place.  That is a matter for the Garda Commissioner but I assure the Deputy that this Government and I are absolutely committed to increasing the Garda workforce, including both Garda members and staff.  Some 11,000 people applied to a recruitment campaign and the interviews, fitness tests and everything else that needs to happen to get those candidates through Templemore and into places like east Meath, Drogheda and all of the surrounding areas are under way.</p></speech>

As a former member, I have taken a special interest in the issue I will raise today.  This week marks a year since Katie Hannon's documentary, "Women of Honour", was broadcast on RT&Eacute; Radio 1.</p> <p>For the first time since the research done by my colleague, Senator Clonan, the voices of those who suffered horrors and injustices at the hands of their superiors in the Defence Forces were heard.  After that documentary, the Government scrambled to cobble together an independent review group, IRG, to pay lip service to these very genuine concerns.  The Women of Honour are not happy, to say the least, specifically in relation to the IRG, which has not been able to build any confidence.  They were assured of a collaborative approach but that was not the case.  They wanted a copy of the interim report and that did not transpire.  There is a complete lack of transparency.  This week, as we celebrate the International Day of the Girl, it is not good enough to see female victims of male oppression in an organisation treated in such a manner.  Will the Minister act on the previous commitment by the Taoiseach that he would move to a statutory process?</p></speech>

I am aware that the Women of Honour issued a public statement yesterday.  I heard some commentary on that in the media last evening but I am not fully across all the details.  When the review was established, it was regarded as a critical first step.  It is significant that it has not attracted the support of the women themselves.  That is a concern and a disappointment.  I will relay the Deputy's comments to the Minister for Defence and ask him to respond to her directly.  It was always envisaged that the judge-led independent review group, chaired by Ms Justice Bronagh O'Hanlon, was to be regarded as a first step.  However, it is clear that it does not have the confidence of the women concerned.  That is a significant matter.  I will ask the Minister to respond to the Deputy.</p></speech>

HSE workers were paid quite quickly after that but there are other workers across the State and in every community in Ireland, who would have worked extremely hard during that period and exposed themselves to Covid, whether they were in the fire service, cleaners in our hospitals and healthcare providers, nursing home staff or in the Defence Forces.  A lot of these people are getting very frustrated.  They feel they have made just as much of a contribution as many others.  It has now been nine months.  The HSE has said that there are various complications and so on but this should have been anticipated from the start when this was announced.  Nine months on, when are these front-line workers, who worked so hard and served us all, going to get their bonus payments?</p></speech>

I know many of them are very frustrated at the delay in these payments being issued.  It should be acknowledged that almost 124,000 staff have received the &euro;1,000 pandemic recognition payment.  In essence, those are the people directly employed by the HSE, which includes many section 38 voluntary hospital staff, but many others are waiting.  The Deputy identified a number of different categories.  This issue has been discussed in recent days at a political level.  It is a priority that we get these payments issued quickly.  The Department of Health has brought in additional help to support it in working through some of the complexity that is there.  It should not have taken this long but we are determined to get this completed as soon as possible because all these workers deserve these payments quickly.</p></speech>

It is a completely unsustainable approach which makes reaching our climate targets even harder.  Now, to add insult industry, the Minister for Finance has confirmed to me that data centres will be eligible to receive &euro;10,000 a month each from the public purse because of the temporary business energy support, TBES, scheme.  Does the Minister not agree it is utterly obscene that those who are suffering from energy poverty will be paying to subsidise the electricity usage of some of the biggest corporations on the planet?  Does he agree that the scheme must be amended immediately in order to exclude data centres from it?</p></speech>

It is based on the relative increase in the per unit price of energy for a particular business.  Many of those companies the Deputy has identified, because of their scale and their ability to enter into longer-term futures contracts and so on, may not qualify.  However, it is a broad-based scheme.  I will relay to the Minister for Finance the concerns the Deputy has expressed.</p></speech>

In Laois-Offaly, we are in crisis.  The Minister is standing in for the Taoiseach today.  I want to get this addressed.  The public scheme is not functioning properly.  Dentists are not interested, in the main.  Dentists have stopped taking patients for the dental treatment services scheme, DTSS, full stop.  Services cannot be gotten and people cannot access them.  Those are the facts.  The school scheme has also collapsed.  In Laois, there are 16-year-old and 17-year-old children - teenagers - who have not yet seen a dentist in their lifetime.  Those are the facts of it.  The services in Laois-Offaly are in the dark ages.  Services across CHO 8 are in severe difficulty.  There is a budget and I am trying to find out how much it is.  If the Minister could give me the figure, I would welcome it.  I have been looking for it from the HSE.  There is a budget and we have no service.  Given that failure, will the Government now decide to train, recruit and employ public dentists-----</p></speech>

I have been contacted by several providers in Mayo who state that their businesses will no longer be viable if increased capitation is not put in place.  Despite positive support for employees in early childhood care in this year's budget, the Federation of Early Childhood Providers is asking for more funding to cover the costs of administrating core funding.  Children with additional needs are only funded to get support during the ECCE preschool session.  Early childhood care providers say the related funding stream aims must be expanded.  The Federation of Early Childhood Providers has balloted its members and is now planning two closure days next month.  This will have a severe impact on working families.  I ask the Minister to engage with these groups to see if a solution can be found.</p></speech>

In 2023 we will spend more than &euro;1 billion on childcare for the first time ever.  That is going to deliver, on average, a 25% cut in fees for parents.  Importantly for providers, this also allows us to put more money into core funding.  Core funding in this academic year will grow by &euro;52 million and in the second academic year will grow to &euro;287 million.  ECCE services are funded by core funding as well.  It is important to reference that ECCE services benefit from core funding.  The majority will see significant increases in income under core funding.  That will allow them to better pay their staff under the employment regulation order, ERO, that has been negotiated, allowing for the expansion of services across the country and assisting them to meet their overheads as well.</p></speech>

It relates to changes in benefit-in-kind in the new year.  In January, the benefit-in-kind rate will increase from 6% to 9%, which means certain car owners will have to pay thousands of euro more to do their jobs.

If you do not report on assessments of need, how are you meant to improve on them for next year?  This week, a constituent told me they are taking the legal route because they cannot wait any longer.  Their child's future is being destroyed.  Another constituent's little boy is losing the chance to speak.

The scheme was presented as a universal measure from which all families and children would benefit in a &euro;9.6 billion budget in the Department of Education.  A total of over &euro;50 million is being spent on free books but this does not apply to children in fee-paying schools.  We have just heard from the Taoiseach in the Oireachtas Committee on Gender Equality, who spoke about gender budgeting and universal measures that benefit gender budgeting.  Could the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform look again at this scheme, calculate the additional money that would be needed to make it universal and to include all children and explain the rationale for leaving those children out when their parents are taxpayers and this was presented as a universal measure?</p></speech>

As a property professional, I can tell the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform that the proposal is counterproductive to the Government's own balance sheet and to our policy to promote housing.  In addition, will the Minister also use the opportunity to extend the very welcome &euro;500 tax relief on rental properties to the many parents throughout the country who are paying exorbitant accommodation costs for students?  The Minister might take these points on board as the final touches are put to the Finance Bill, as I think the public would greatly welcome them.  We are not talking about a huge amount of money , namely, &euro;80 million on the blocks scheme and &euro;500 for our students nationally, who are paying up to &euro;1,300 per month on rent.

That said, we must raise money to ensure we can fund what is a major remediation programme in respect of mica and the State must make decisions as to how it responds to the apartment defects report as well.  Deputy MacSharry and other Deputies have made a number of points in this regard and I am sure he will engage when the Finance Bill comes here on Second Stage and goes on to Committee and Report Stages.  The Minister for Finance will consider those points carefully in addition to the rental tax credit, which must be embedded in primary legislation in the form of the Finance Bill.  That will provide an opportunity for parliamentary engagement.</p>  <p>  In response to Deputy O'Donnell, I understand that the Minister for Health will be bringing proposals to the Government shortly in respect of certain elective hospital projects.  The specific case raised by the Deputy is best left to the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, to come back to the Deputy having consulted with the HSE.  </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-12a.182" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1453" speakername="Thomas Gould" time="13:12:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022101200027#Z01200"><p>I move:</p> <blockquote> 	That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to amend and extend the Derelict Sites Act 1990 and to provide for related matters. </blockquote>  <p>I have spent a lot of time over the past 13 years as a public representative, particularly the past two years as a Deputy, raising the issue of dereliction.  I have walked around the dereliction in Cork, met with local authorities, raised it in this Chamber and questioned witnesses at the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  So often I have heard the same phrases from those in positions to resolve dereliction.  They include &ldquo;dereliction is complicated&rdquo;, &ldquo;there is no one solution&rdquo; and &ldquo;it requires a lot of manpower&rdquo;.  Yet there is a tool available to local authorities that could actually have a significant impact on their ability to tackle dereliction.  </p><p>The Derelict Sites Act was introduced in 1990.  A key tool in this Act is the derelict sites levy.  It is not an optional tax.  It was supposed to be a fine paid by land hoarders for leaving homes to rot.  There are properties that have been on the derelict sites register since it was established.  We are talking about properties that have been sitting on the register empty and rotting for at least 32 years and in some cases, for far longer.  Many local authorities have failed to do their job by not putting sites on the register and not collecting the levy.  Successive Governments have turned a blind eye because they did not care or did not want to know.  They have always preferred to line the pockets of developers than to tackle land hoarders and speculators who are at the heart of the dereliction problem.  In 2021, 19 local authorities did not collect a single red cent in derelict sites levies.  Some of these councils are owed well in excess of &euro;100,000.  Overall, local authorities collected on average 32% of the amounts levied.  There is still an outstanding debt of over &euro;12 million that needs to be collected.  </p><p>This is a significant improvement on where we were in 2020 when local authorities collected less than 7% of the amounts levied on average.  This shows the impact those of us working on dereliction are having.  We have seen huge progress in Cork City Council's collection of the levy.  We are still not there but people like Jude Sherry and Frank O'Connor and others are raising the issue of dereliction and this is starting to make a difference.  However, the reality is that there is still &euro;12 million in untapped revenue in this State.  This is money sitting in the pockets of speculators and land hoarders that could be used to transform derelict Ireland.  If local authorities collected the full levy, this additional money could be transformative.  We know that the sites on the register are only a drop in the ocean of dereliction.  Galway County Council, for example, has only one site on its register.  </p> <p>That is not a true reflection of the situation in Galway.  Full collection of the levy means extra resourcing for inspecting sites to value them and put them on the register.  This legislation is a simple tool to increase accountability, transparency and collection of levies.  Ultimately, we want to stop people leaving homes to rot.</p> <p> This Bill will require local authorities that collect less than 75% of the levies owed to produce a comprehensive report.  In this report, they will need to outline how they will collect the outstanding levies and why they did not collect them in the first place.  The Minister will have to respond.  This means we will finally have answers.  If local authorities need more resources, it will be in black and white and will be the responsibility of the Minister.</p> <p> People are right that there is no one solution to dereliction.  This Bill will not resolve it but will be a step forward and another tool in the belt of those of us who want to end dereliction.  We are in the middle of a housing crisis.  We have tens of thousands of families, workers and young people without a secure home or accommodation.  We have hundreds of thousands of people locked out of long-term home ownership.  It is time to stop dereliction and stop homes lying idle.  This is a way to help solve the housing crisis and end dereliction.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-12a.191" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1488" speakername="Pa Daly" time="13:22:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022101200028#AA00900"><p>I move:</p> <blockquote> 	That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to amend the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 and to provide for related matters. </blockquote>  <p>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for granting me time to introduce the Bill.  I thank the staff in the Bills Office and the Office of the Ceann Comhairle for their assistance.  Particular thanks are due to the Office of Parliamentary Advisers, OPLA, and Niamh McKenna, who helped me tease out the considerable legal issues involved while preserving the policy intent of the Bill.  I will share time with my colleagues, Deputies Paul Donnelly and Cronin, who are co-signing the Bill.</p><p>Nobody questions the importance of the system of Garda vetting introduced in the 2012 Act.  It is an important measure to protect children and vulnerable adults in combination with other safeguarding measures.  Garda vetting is used in many professional and voluntary contexts in relation to both paid and voluntary roles.  I am sure many in this House have engaged with it for local sports clubs and voluntary organisations.  It helps organisations and companies feel confident in the people they hire and enables compliance with legal obligations where sensitive work or vulnerable people are involved.  However, the system is burdensome for many, especially when volunteers find themselves having to be vetted by multiple organisations, even with no criminal record.  It puts people off.</p><p>This Bill sets out to provide a register of generalised consents, particularly where a number of vetting applications have to be made.  It allows an individual to apply for inclusion on this register and will allow approved organisations for judo, for example, and the GAA and HSE to vet the individual without having to complete the full process every time.  Ideally, we will look at the general review.  I urge the Government to look at adopting the Bill's provisions or instituting a full review of vetting legislation.</p></speech>

The purpose of the Bill is to keep the practice of vetting as effective as possible while making the process as efficient as possible for the community, the garda&iacute; and, through them, wider society.  It applies to people who have no criminal record or criminal issues outstanding.  While Garda vetting is essential it can be burdensome, especially for volunteers.  I have met them and been the person who has to go through it several times.  We have a proud tradition of volunteerism in Ireland and it greatly enhances our communities.</p>  <p>  We propose a register of generalised consents, where a person can apply to be added to the list instead of having to make multiple applications.  It is a nightmare trying to remember if it was May or June when you moved from whatever house.  This will keep the system at the security level necessary to protect society and make the process quicker and easier.  With this Bill we can make it easier for volunteers to make their extraordinary contribution to our communities.</p></speech>

I was a child welfare officer in my local GAA club, St. Peregrines, and I know the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, was a child welfare officer in his club, St. Brigid's, in the same constituency.  I am sure he understands the predicament and how difficult it is.</p>  <p>  I fully support and agree with the Garda vetting process but it can be overly bureaucratic, cumbersome and difficult for people to remember.  I have often had people come back to me trying to figure out where they stayed when they were students.  It can be difficult to go through the process over and over.  At one stage I was vetted as an employee of Tusla.  I was vetted as a mentor.  I was then vetted because we had children staying over for a f&eacute;ile and, finally, as somebody who worked with Youthreach through the ETB.  It is the same process over and over.  It is a vital tool to protect our children and young people.  Nobody argues with that but this Bill supports and protects young people and will help communities, voluntary groups and other organisations to get volunteers on board and retain them.  That is what we want to see.  I look forward to the Bill coming into effect.</p></speech>

It has been a long road to get it here and there has been a lot of work involved with the committee, colleagues and with public consultation too.  As Deputies are aware, the past year has seen a surge in applications for employment permits.  That has put a lot more pressure on the system and shown the need to have legislation to modernise the system.  My Department has deployed massive resources to ensuring that permit applications can be processed as efficiently as possible.  A range of measures have been introduced.  These include the removal of multiple doctor applications from the system.  That was done in conjunction with the Department of Health and has been quite useful.  These measures have enabled us to improve response times and drive down the backlog.  We have also introduced measures which reduce the administrative burden on permit holders and their employers.  But we also need to consolidate, modernise and reform the legislation governing employment permits to further improve efficiency and the customer experience.  Alongside that, we have probably quadrupled the number of people working in this sector in the Department.  Kevin Daly, Sandra O'Reilly and the team are here.  They have been concentrating on our response over the last couple of months to bring the waiting list down and to reduce the time it takes to process permits down to three or four weeks, and less in many cases.  There has been great focus on this and we believe this legislation will help strengthen the work they have been doing to improve the system over the last year so that it is responsive to everyone's needs.  I thank the members of committee for their co-operation on this Bill at pre-legislative scrutiny.</p>  <p>  This Bill is part of our response to the Department&rsquo;s review of economic migration policy undertaken in 2018.  It is also vital to help deal with the recent increase in demand for employment permits by businesses seeking to secure suitably skilled people for their operations.  The review of the economic migration policy concluded that while the employment permit system provides a robust framework to supplement skills and labour needs in the State, the current legislation imposes considerable inflexibility in its operation.</p> <p>The review recommended that new legislation be initiated to increase the responsiveness of the system, to modernise it and to ensure that it can respond to rapid changes in the labour market.  This Bill incorporates the recommendations of the review.  It takes into account inputs to the public consultation on the general scheme, such as support for the seasonal employment permit, while retaining the core focus of a vacancy-led employment system centred on delivering the labour needs of the State.  The Employment Permits Bill 2022 will consolidate the existing employment permits Acts, namely the Employment Permits Act 2003, the Employment Permits Act 2006 and the Employment Permits (Amendment) Act 2014.  This will bring clarity and consistency to the legislative framework in this area.</p> <p> I again thank the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment for its consideration of the general scheme and for its pre-legislative scrutiny report published in November 2021.  The legislation I am presenting takes account of concerns raised by the joint committee.  The proposal for a special circumstances employment permit has been removed and the option has been added for a new condition to the grant of permits which would develop talent in Ireland.</p> <p> While I recognise the concerns raised by the joint committee regarding the seasonal employment permit, I recall that the 2018 review identified a clear demand for a time-limited permission for roles of a seasonal nature.  Ireland is an outlier internationally in not offering such a permit.  The case for the inclusion of a seasonal employment permit was further confirmed by the level of support for the proposal during the public consultation on the general scheme and in subsequent engagement with stakeholders.  I do, though, recognise the concerns expressed by the joint committee and we can deal with those together on Committee Stage.  The detail will be elaborated on then and the members of the joint committee can provide input into the design of the permit.  The proposals I will bring forward on Committee Stage arise from a detailed consideration of the challenges associated with this permit and of international best practice, as well as a recognition of the increased vulnerability of this cohort of migrant workers.  I hope we will be able to work together on that Stage, be able to get agreement and reassure the members of the joint committee regarding their concerns.</p> <p> The Employment Permits Bill 2022 was originally listed for inclusion in the spring 2022 legislative programme.  By that time, however, the lifting of Covid-19 restrictions had brought new challenges in the form of a significant increase in demands on the system and consequent backlogs.  The Department has worked simultaneously on reducing the backlogs and finalising this Bill.  In so doing, it has been able to review and improve proposals in the new legislation with the objective of avoiding future backlogs.  As a result of this extra work, the new Bill provides a streamlined and flexible framework to mitigate the possibility of future backlogs arising.  Government approval for publication of the legislation was granted in July and, following minor technical amendments over the summer, it was published on 4 October last.  Having provided the background and purpose of the Bill, I will now outline its main provisions.</p> <p> The Bill contains 71 sections.  These are divided into seven parts and two schedules.  Part 1 contains preliminary matters common to legislation: citation and commencement; interpretation; regulations; and repeals and revocations.  The Bill includes a definition of "employer" based on the existence of a contract and in so doing allows wages to be paid by an entity other than the employer.  Where an agency is the employer but the foreign national is carrying out work for the client of that agency, it is now possible for the client of the agency to pay the wages while the agency itself remains the employer.  This will make the system easier to navigate for agencies and simplify processing such applications, as well as the monitoring of permits thereafter.  This section also includes a definition of "subcontractors" which allows these to avail of the contract for service employment permit in the same manner as a standard contractor.</p> <p> Part 2 relates to the employment in the State of foreign nationals and contains sections 7 to 39, inclusive, subdivided into eight chapters.  Section 7 sets out the requirement that a foreign national working in the State do so subject to a valid employment permit.  Section 8 sets out the cohorts who do not require a permit.</p> <p> Section 9 sets out the types of permit available under the scheme and broadly replicates those established in the existing Acts.  The list now includes the new seasonal employment permit.  The special circumstances permit I mentioned earlier, which appeared in the general scheme, will not be pursued following concerns expressed by the joint committee.  The challenge this proposal was intended to address, namely permits for niche skills, can be addressed in conjunction with our development agencies, such as Enterprise Ireland.  Another recommendation of the joint committee, the dependant-partner-spouse employment permit will now be called the dependant employment permit and will only apply to dependants of critical skills employment permit holders.  Spouses and partners are now subject to a separate permission process under the auspices of the Department of Justice.</p> <p> Section 10 establishes the rules for making an application, including which parties may make the application and any restrictions on who may apply, as well as inclusion of a fee, if any.  The information to be provided in an application is detailed at section 11.  Section 12 provides clarity on who may apply for a dependant permit.  Section 13 provides powers to the Minister to amend certain errors in an application to avoid rejecting or refusing an application which might otherwise be granted, subject to regulations.</p> <p> Sections 14 and 15 re-establish, from the existing Acts, the possibility of recommendation letters being sent by enterprise agencies to support applications and also the possibility for the Minister to consult experts in considering an application for a sports and cultural employment permit.</p> <p> Section 16 establishes the issues to which the Minister shall give regard in considering an application.  The Minister may take steps to establish the accuracy or authenticity of the information provided.  Importantly, the Minister may return incomplete applications without further consideration with a written notification to the applicant along with a portion of the fee to be prescribed and any documentation received.  The Minister may return the fee to the person that paid the fee originally or to a nominated person.  The Minister may give priority to the consideration of applications for certain employment permit types as he or she considers appropriate in light of the economic context.</p> <p> Section 17 establishes that the permit is granted to the foreign national directly and for the role specified on the application and that the permit shall be subject to maximum validity periods under regulations.  The foreign national must commence the employment within a certain period after the permit is granted.  That period will be prescribed in regulations.  This is to protect the domestic and European Economic Area, EEA, labour market and ensure that there is no suitable candidate available within those jurisdictions at the time the foreign national starts work.</p> <p> Under section 18, if the Minister grants an employment permit, he or she is obliged to cancel any existing permit for that foreign national as only one permit may be held at a time.  The foreign national and employer shall be notified in writing of the cancellation.</p> <p> Section 19 sets out the information to be provided on the permit to support the holder in understanding his or her rights.  These include the applicability of the National Minimum Wage Act 2000 and the right to apply for a new permit.</p> <p> Section 20 carries forward the 50-50 rule requiring an employer to hire a workforce consisting of at least 50% of workers from within the EEA or Swiss Confederation.  This section is a key tool for protecting the EEA labour market.  Under the Bill, this cohort is extended to include citizens of the UK who have a right to live and work in the State under the common travel area.  This section also sets out waivers to the rule.  Employers benefitting from a waiver for a sole employee will no longer be restricted from further recruitment.</p> <p> Section 21 also protects the EEA labour market and fulfils our obligations under the EU's community preference principle by establishing that a role must be advertised in Ireland and the EEA initially under the labour market needs test.  The various waivers are also set out.  Crucially, the form an advertisement must take is now moved to regulations.  It is no longer required to be published in hard copy newspapers.  The minimum period for which the role must be advertised has also been moved to regulations to allow for increased flexibility.</p> <p> Sections 22 to 24, inclusive, set out the conditions for grant of an intra-company transfer permit and contract for service permit, including remuneration factors, and provide for the Minister to amend the permit in line with a transfer of undertakings.</p> <p> Sections 25 and 26, dealing with refusal grounds, are largely unchanged but a discretionary ground for refusal is added in the case where conditions which may have been attached to the grant of a permit under this Bill have not been respected. I think this is something the committee also flagged.</p> <p> Section 27 allows the fee to be returned to the person who paid it or to a nominated person.</p> <p> Under section 28, the stipulations around a review of a refusal decision are largely carried over from the current Acts.  However, it will now be possible for an entirely new decision to be made at review stage if new information comes to light.  This means the applicant still benefits from a review if that decision is in the negative.</p> <p> Sections 29 to 32, inclusive, largely re-enact the rules around renewal of an employment permit.  The reasons for a refusal to grant and renew are separated out to more clearly identify that the refusals for a renewal are less general than the refusal reasons for the initial grant of the permit.</p> <p> Sections 33 to 36, inclusive, largely re-enact previous provisions around revocation of a permit and termination of employment.  It is now possible for a new decision to be made on a revocation where new information comes to light.  The employee and employer must both inform the Department if the employment is terminated.  This is in recognition that the use of e-permits now renders the surrender of a permit impractical.</p> <p> Sections 37 to 39, inclusive, re-enact the existing provisions in cases of redundancy.  They include the possibility for the Minister to grant a permit for a new role even if the occupations lists have been amended in the intervening period.  This is to protect employees and to give them the opportunity to continue in the same field and at a similar salary as before.</p> <p> Part 3 relates to the making of regulations by the Minister.</p> <p> The detailed sections 40 to 43 largely re-enact the provisions in the existing legislation.  These give the Minister the power to make regulations on subjects such as maximum number of permits, qualifications, remuneration and any conditions pertaining to the permit as well as fees which may be waived.  Section 43 focuses more on regulations about the procedures for making an application including the form of the application and evidence to be provided.</p> <p> To increase the flexibility of the employment permits system, the Bill proposes that almost every instance of a quantifiable operational requirement be prescribed in regulations.  Drafting has been guided by the Office of the Attorney General in order to ensure that the provisions of the Bill are in line with current jurisprudence and that any criteria moved to regulation is securely anchored in primary legislation.  The joint committee, in its report, expressed concern at moving these into regulations, but we believe it is very important that we do so.  This is a major aspect of the Bill because it gives us the flexibility to adapt and to swiftly change regulations as need be.  I commit on the floor of the House that we will consult the committee on the regulations.  We will even try to have them ready for Committee Stage in order that we can tease them out.  I give my absolute commitment that if the regulations are not ready in time for Committee Stage, that I will bring them to the committee for discussion.  We are not trying to hide anything here.  This is an open book.  Having operated the system for some years, we genuinely believe that the measures are much better set in regulation than in primary legislation.  I hope Deputies will accept the Department's good faith in that regard.</p> <p> Part 4 is focused on enforcement, offences and penalties and serves to protect workers&rsquo; rights.  Section 44 provides powers to appoint authorised officers under the Act and sets out rights and obligations with regard to these officers.  Section 45 establishes that a warrant to search a premises may be issued following an offence under this Act in line with previous Acts.</p> <p> Sections 47 to 49, inclusive, establish offences for using a permit for a purpose or an employee not named on the permit, for making deductions for the cost of the permit or holding personal documents of a foreign national and for providing false information.  These stipulations are in line with previous Acts.</p> <p> Under section 50, the Minister may bring proceedings for these offences within 24 months.  Under section 51, offences can apply to a body corporate or a natural person.  Section 52 replicates provisions of the current legislation.  They apply to a foreign national who works without an employment permit but has taken all reasonable steps to ensure compliance with the Acts.  Where that person is paid insufficiently, then the Minister may take civil proceedings on his or her behalf to recompense the foreign national for work done or services rendered.  The right of the foreign national to institute proceedings under this section on his or her own behalf is also set out, but so doing would preclude the Minister from taking proceedings.  We can discuss the matter further.  Section 53 prohibits penalisation of an employee in cases such as making a complaint to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, whether that is through dismissal, demotion, intimidation or other means.</p> <p> Under sections 54 and 55, certain presumptions can be made under this Act.  For example, if a person is witnessed carrying out work in a premises, it shall be presumed he or she is employed to do that work.  Other presumptions relate to receipt of notices and the authorship of documents.  Section 56 requires an employer to maintain records for inspection by authorised officers for five years.</p> <p> Part 5 sets out the miscellaneous provisions of the Bill.  Section 57 requires the Minister to hold the register of employment permits.  Section 58 provides for the delivery of notices to employers and employees and is updated to allow delivery via any type of post rather than specifying ordinary prepaid post.  Section 59 places the obligation on the parties to a permit to notify the Minister of any change of address.  Section 60 provides for the delegation of functions to an officer of another Minister.</p> <p> Section 61 provides for data exchange with the Department of Social Protection, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Department of Justice, the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Revenue Commissioners.</p> <p> Part 6 contains the transitional arrangements applicable to permits granted or procedures instigated under the Acts of 2003 and 2006.  Part 7 sets out the consequential amendments applicable to Acts other than the current Employment Permits Acts.</p> <p> I wish to add a word on schedules.  A discretionary ground of refusal is included at section 26(1)(c) in circumstances where an employer has been convicted of an offence, under this legislation or a list of named Acts, in the preceding five years.  Section 33(1)(b) establishes a discretionary ground of revocation if the employer has been guilty of an offence under the same list of Acts.  That list is set out at Schedule 1.</p> <p> Section 53(3) states that an employee cannot be penalised for giving evidence under this legislation or making a complaint to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The redress for failure to comply is set out in Schedule 2.</p> <p> It is essential that we enact this Bill to provide the State with the powers necessary to deliver on the demand for skills and labour in the economy in an agile and efficient manner.  That reinforces the need to make changes by regulation.  The Bill achieves this important function while protecting the domestic labour market and the rights of workers who contribute so much to our economy and are so valued.  I commend the Bill to the House.  I look forward to engaging with the Deputies on this matter on the floor of the House today and on Committee and Report Stages as well.</p></speech>

This is a very important area, one that we need to get right.</p>  <p>  This Bill is a challenging, technical, and lengthy piece of legislation.  I acknowledge the work of the officials in the Department.  A not inconsiderable amount of effort has gone into producing the Bill.  I understand the need to modernise our employment permits legislation and Sinn F&eacute;in wants to see progressive legislation to improve the system.  We support the fair and sensible use of employment permits where there are shortages of necessary skills in our economy, but such a system must also protect the migrant workers who are in receipt of those permits.  That is why we have some concerns with the approach the Government has taken in the Bill.</p>  <p>  As it currently stands, the Bill is heavily focused on increasing flexibility for employers, but there is not a great deal relating to workers' rights.  We must redress the balance.  The Bill aims to increase the agility and effectiveness of the employment permit system, while retaining the policy focus of supporting the economy and the labour market through evidence-based decision making.  While we accept this aim, especially in the context of the current need for economic recovery, we have concerns about the manner in which the employment permit system operates in practice.  In particular, the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment received evidence that, in some cases, the employment rights of workers under the permit system - including their level of pay and their conditions of employment - are not observed or enforced.  In addition, such workers experience uncertainty in relation to their future prospects and the position of their families.  At the same time, the employment permit system enables the State and employers to overlook the potential to provide training and upskilling to the workforce already in place so that they could avail of the job opportunities that become available.  These issues should have been fully rectified in the Bill.</p>  <p>  While the Bill is not without merit, it ignores the advice of the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment's pre-legislative scrutiny report on a number of matters.  The committee made several vital recommendations as part of its report on the Employment Permits Bill.  If several of these recommendations were implemented, they would grant the same basic rights to all work permit holders and protect them from serious exploitation.  The Minister of State outlined that he would be willing to work with us on Committee Stage.  We have a hill to climb.  We might have a fair bit of work to do, but Committee Stage is a good point at which to tease out any issues and reach agreement.</p>  <p>  The joint committee recommended that workers with general employment permits are provided the same rights as those who are employed with critical skills permits, and that a holder of a general employment permit should have the right to gain access to the labour market after two years instead of five, which would make it easier for them to challenge exploitation and substandard conditions.  The joint committee also recommended that holders of general employment permits should be given improved rights in relation to family reunion and the access of family members to the labour market.  It further recommended that the Ministers for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Justice should address this matter in conjunction with the Bill.</p>  <p>  The joint committee indicated that it had not seen sufficient evidence to support the proposed introduction of a seasonal employment permit and that, instead, the scope and terms of the general employment permit should be adapted to meet the need for seasonal employment with the protections and provisions under the existing scheme not diminished, and workers' rights must not be undermined.</p>  <p>  While some of these can be legislated for directly in the Bill, others, like the granting of full access to the labour market after two years require collaboration with the Department of Justice.  In its report, the joint committee recommended that this collaboration with the Department of Justice would take place in conjunction with the Bill.  As far as we can see, these recommendations have been entirely ignored, leaving workers at risk of severe exploitation.  As the Minister of State is aware, these are very vulnerable workers.  The very least we can do is ensure that workers who come here to fulfil a need we have are treated with the same respect and dignity that is accorded to every worker in the State.</p>  <p>  As already stated, the Bill as it currently stands is heavily focused on increasing flexibility for employers, with not much attempt to protect workers' rights.  The Minister could have used this opportunity to give the same basic rights to all employment permit holders so that they can work safely.  It is regrettable that this has not been done.</p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in totally opposes any move that opens the possibility of an exploitative employment model in certain economic sectors through the introduction of seasonal employment permits, which is neither an ethical nor a sustainable solution for the sector concerned.  I note what the Minister of State said about Ireland being an outlier, but it would be good if we were an outlier in terms of providing leadership for people who need it and in terms of providing protections for vulnerable workers.</p> <p>What all workers within these sectors need is a living wage, decent pay and conditions, the right to organise and collective bargaining coverage.  Only progressive changes such as this will future-proof our economy, make work pay, attract workers to sectors that struggle because they are low paid and have poor conditions and ensure all current and future workers in these sectors are afforded decent pay and conditions.</p> <p> This is not the only divergence from the recommendations of the committee.  It stated that proposals to amend operational details of the permit system by way of regulation would lead to a lack of transparency and make scrutiny by the committee and others more difficult, and I welcome what the Minister of State said about working with us.  Nevertheless, the Government has ploughed ahead and given fairly extraordinary powers to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment of the day to make changes to the employment permit system by way of regulation, effectively bypassing the D&aacute;il and the Seanad.  Changes in the Bill that will allow subcontractors to make use of the employment permit system are also concerning.  We fear that this could lead to the abuse of migrant workers.  There are already serious issues with bogus self-employment and breaches of employment law in the area of subcontracting.  We feel this is incredibly risky and, as with seasonal employment permits, not an approach we can support.</p> <p> Another area of concern relates to the continuation of a section that was inserted into employment permit law in the Employment Permits (Amendment) Act 2014, which continues to allow an enterprise development agency to make recommendations to the Minister for employment permits to be granted.  Similarly, our reading of section 20 suggests that the 50-50 rule can be circumvented by subsection (2) on recommendations of an enterprise agency or the Minister.  This is an important rule in employment permit legislation and we hope this matter can be clarified as soon as possible.</p> <p> As for section 25, on the mandatory grounds for the refusal of an employment permit, we want to see this section strengthened considerably.  In particular, Sinn F&eacute;in wants a mandatory refusal of an employment permit application for any company that has been found in breach of employment law in the previous five years.  The Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade, and Employment received evidence that, in some cases, the employment rights of workers under the permit system, including their level of pay and conditions of employment, are not observed or enforced.  We must ensure such unscrupulous employers do not have the opportunity to offend again and that there will be repercussions for any breaches of employment law.</p> <p> A further area we want the Minister of State to clarify concerns the remuneration of workers.  It must be made clear that where accommodation and board is provided to a worker, this cannot not abused as a way to provide substandard accommodation and board or, indeed, substandard wages.  It must also ensure that any accommodation and board provided will be properly overseen by the Government and the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, to make sure that the valuation placed on it as remuneration is correct.  I have seen at first hand some of the conditions people are living in and, for want of a better phrase, you would not put a dog in them.  I have not seen examples for a long time, not since I became a Deputy, but when I was working in the union, I saw up to 13 or 14 people squashed into caravans, freezing cold, while their employer would have the neck to deduct money out of their wages at the end of the week for their bed and board and for the luxury of accommodation.  There needs to be some sort of oversight of that.  These are very vulnerable workers.  There is often a language barrier and they may not be present in their community even though they work there, and we need to do some work on that.</p> <p> The number and scale of WRC inspectors has to be seriously increased.  If the purpose of the Bill is to increase the number of people coming here on work permits, we will have to increase the number of labour inspectors at a corresponding rate.  That stands to reason and logic.  As I said and as we all acknowledge, these are vulnerable workers and they need that little bit of extra protection.  In the year to date, more than 30,000 work permits have issued and a record number of people are in employment, but there are scarcely more than 50 WRC inspectors investigating for exploitation and breaches of employment law.  We also want the legislation to be amended to ensure that before workers arrive to begin employment, they will be given a full online course in workers&rsquo; rights provided by the Department in conjunction with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.</p> <p> Will the Minister of State explain why the rates of pay for workers in the meat-processing industry have not increased since 2017, assuming the Department is continuously monitoring the sector due to the high prevalence of employment permits?  Of the top five companies in receipt of employment permits, three are meat companies.  The wages for meat processors and deboners were set in 2017 at &euro;10.85 and &euro;13.65 an hour, respectively.  The rate for meat processors will increase this year, but only because the minimum wage has increased.  Why has this sector, which has many workers in receipt of employment permits, not seen wages increase in five years?  If these sectors are being monitored by the Department, why are the wages stagnant?  Why is nobody asking that question?  There has been pay movement virtually across the board, even if much of it is not enough to keep pace with inflation, but these people's wages are not moving at all.  Surely somebody in the Department is asking why wages are remaining stagnant in an industry that is a high user of work permits.  We do not need a colouring book to join up the dots on that one.</p> <p> Sinn F&eacute;in has been clear on certain matters relating to employment permits.  First, any changes to the system must have the interests of workers at their core and ensure equality for all holders.  We totally oppose changes that would allow an inequitable and exploitative employment model to develop, which is neither ethical nor sustainable.  On top of this, we need to ensure all workers, whether migrant workers or not, will receive a living wage, decent pay and conditions, a right to collective bargaining and a right to organise.  Second, we have always insisted, in the context of the critical skills employment permit, that the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment needs to develop a greater working relationship with the Departments of Education and Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science to ensure we equip students with the necessary skills for areas of the economy where there are skills shortages.</p> <p> Sinn F&eacute;in supports progressive improvement of our employment permit legislation that will support and protect migrant workers and benefit the economy.  However, we feel that the Bill needs to be amended in order to make it fit for purpose.  We will amend it on Committee and Report Stages and any support will be contingent on the Minister engaging with us and our concerns and accepting the sensible and constructive amendments we will put forward.</p></speech>

We have also spoken about the workforce advisory group, which is meant to be working to ensure there are enough home carers in the context of permits and visas.  There is an acceptance that there is a shortfall of positions across the board and, therefore, there is a need to update this legislation.  Even so, we cannot do that at the expense of employees' rights, and that is where we need to see a good deal of interaction from the Minister of State, so I welcome that he indicated that this is going to be the case.</p>  <p>  I thank those employees who were employed through these permits during the height of Covid-19.  These people played a vital role and we are all very grateful for that.  As I said, the employment permits legislation needs to be modernised and we have concerns about how the Government has so far dealt with the Bill.  There are some positive elements, such as the index-linking of wage thresholds so as to keep them in line with salary growth, which is very welcome, but the Bill needs many changes to make it fit for purpose, both for employers and for those migrant workers the system could leave vulnerable to exploitation.  There is wider work that needs to be done on workforce planning, and the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science will have to play a vital role in this regard.  It is not just about ensuring that there is enough training; a significant cohort within this State who are well removed from both education and the workforce will probably require work to be done before they are ready for that level of training.  That aspect is missing but it is vital in the context of breaking the poverty trap in which people can sometimes find themselves.</p>  <p>  As it stands, the Bill is lopsided.  It offers much to employers but little to employees.  Its focus is primarily on increasing flexibility for employers but we need to see a lot more in order that it will protect workers' rights.  Its aims are quite reasonable and fundamentally focus on improving the effectiveness of the permit system in supporting the economy and the labour market, but there continue to be concerns about how the system operates in practice.</p> <p>I believe members of the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment heard various testimonies that in some cases, the employment rights of workers were neither being observed nor enforced.  Others spoke of the uncertainty workers face regarding their future prospects and how they are overlooked for training and upskilling opportunities, leaving them unable to avail of alternative job options.  This is not okay.  Recommendations were made by the committee on how the Bill could be improved.  We have not quite seen that in the legislation in front of us.  That needs to be fixed.</p> <p> Workers employed through the general employment permit scheme should be granted the same rights as those employed with critical skills permits.  Why should those employed through general permits be unable to access the labour market after two years but rather must wait five years?  If these employees must wait five years, they are stuck in possible exploitative and substandard working conditions.</p> <p> There was a particular concern regarding the introduction of seasonal employment permits.  It was suggested that the general employment permit should be adopted instead to meet this need.  There are a number of recommendations.  I welcome the fact that the Minister of State said he will interact with us.  There is much work to be done to make this legislation fit for purpose.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-12a.213" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1585" speakername="R&eacute;ada Cronin" time="14:07:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022101200033#LL00200"><p>I am happy to speak to this Bill on Second Stage.  We all agree it is a very technical and lengthy piece of legislation.  I believe there is also agreement on the need to modernise the work permit system on which so many of our services depend, be it agrifood, IT, hygiene or caring.  The Covid-19 pandemic, which still ongoing, exposed how dependent we are on so many of these workers and how they rose to the challenges and demands made of them in extraordinary difficult and, indeed, risky circumstances.  While some people could ride out the infection in airy homes and gardens, time and again, they were the people who repeatedly went out to the front line.</p>  <p>  While we accept the need and desire to modernise the permit system, we have ongoing concerns that it could be done in a way that makes no attempt to protect workers&rsquo; rights.  I am particularly concerned that while significant efforts are made to look after flexibility for employers, there is not the reciprocal concern for the protection and welfare of workers.  I believe the Minister of State is missing a bigger opportunity here to really look after workers' rights and well-being in the same way it appears he is concerned about the employers.</p>  <p>  People who are far from home are not just cogs in the wheels of industry or a means of getting to the bottom line of profit.  They are spending important years of their lives here with us in Ireland.  They arrive as workers but often end up as neighbours living their lives in their communities.  Equally, as the Minister of State will be aware, evidence was presented to the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment that under the permit system, the rights, pay and conditions of some workers were not being upheld.  They also face insecurity and uncertainty on their future prospects and the position of their families.  As Irish people who went to work wherever people would have us, through centuries and generations, often in very poor conditions, we have a particular duty to get it right for the workers who come here to live and work on our shores.  At the same time, however, the State should not be letting itself off the hook in failing to train our own people to the requisite standards of those who come here to work.  There is serious work to be done that regard.  While we must recognise that workers' permits and people going abroad to work can have a great equalising effect, that is not the case if those workers are going to be exploited, as Deputy O'Reilly already outlined.  I saw this first-hand during the early years of Covid-19 when County Kildare went into lockdown because of bad practices in workplaces around meat factories.</p>  <p>  It is regrettable that the Bill has chosen to ignore so much of the excellent advice that came from the committee, particularly the path of advice that would give all permit holders and workers strong and equal opportunity and protection.  If taken and implemented, it would also protect workers' families, for example.  The committee recommends that the holders of general employment permits would be given better rights with regard to family reunion.  Those family members could also then be welcomed into the labour market.  This is something the Minister of State and his counterparts in the Department of Justice could look at in terms of making Ireland a compassionate, respectful and modern working destination where rights are upheld and opportunities offered.  I am glad the Minister of State is open to amendments.  I hope he will look on them favourably in order that we can improve the Bill.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-12a.214" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1551" speakername="Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in" time="14:07:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022101200033#LL00300"><p>I welcome the Minister of State and commend this legislation.  My colleague, Senator Sherlock, who sits on the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment, informed me that quite a number of recommendations that came from the committee were not adopted by Government when it came to this Bill.</p><p>It makes us wonder why we have cross-party pre-legislative scrutiny.  To be honest, committee rooms are where this Oireachtas works best.  Often, when visitors come into the Gallery, they see the back-and-forth drama and theatre that goes on in the Chamber and hear the one-liners for clips on Facebook.  All the real work happens in the committee rooms, where people generally try to work on a cross-party basis to improve legislation, which is the point of the exercise.  Therefore, when a group of Deputies and Senators who are Oireachtas Members from different political parties collectively come together to make recommendations to Government on what they feel, having dispassionately, if you like, scrutinised legislation, one would hope that what they say would make its way into the Government's Bill considering that those who signed up to these recommendations include members of the Minister of State's party and other Government parties.  I will shortly give a reminder of these recommendations.</p><p>Some of the flags raised about this Bill came from the Migrant Rights Centre Ireland, MRCI.  I remind the Minister of State that the MRCI is a highly responsible NGO that works with those who have been described as the most vulnerable workers in our economy.  It has had endless successes in these Houses for promoting, amending or suggesting legislation.  It works with Government in order to improve things and it has been endlessly successful because of the manner in which it carries out its business.  Therefore, when the MRCI flags something, it is because it is genuinely concerned.  We know in our political lives that when we get comments on legislation, we must make sure the representation is on the money.  When a representation comes from the MRCI, however, we must take it seriously.</p><p>As was said, migrant workers in this country are disproportionately exploited and poorly paid.  They are disproportionately women and, as I said, on a lower pay scale.  Therefore, when legislation like this comes across our desks to be debated in the Chamber and passed into law, we must keep them to the forefront our minds.</p><p>The committee's report on the pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill states:</p> <blockquote> 	The Committee recommends that workers with General Employment Permits are provided the same rights as those employed with Critical Skills Permits.  A holder of a General Employment Permit should have the right to gain access to the labour market after two years instead of five, which would make it easier for them to challenge exploitation and substandard conditions.<br /><br />The Committee recommends that holders of General Employment Permits should be given improved rights in relation to family reunion and the access of family members to the labour market, and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Minister for Justice should address this matter in conjunction with this Bill. </blockquote>  <p>It goes on to state that:</p> <blockquote> 	The Committee has not seen sufficient evidence to support the proposed introduction of a Seasonal Employment Permit, [which is a key issue] and it is also concerned about the lack of detail in the proposal.  The Committee recommends that instead of introducing the Seasonal Employment Permit, the scope and terms of the General Employment Permit be adapted to meet the need for seasonal employment.  The protections and provisions under the existing General Employment Permit scheme must not be diminished, and workers&rsquo; rights must not be undermined.  </blockquote>  <p>What has been said, and what my colleague, Senator Sherlock, told me is that these recommendations of the committee are effectively being ignored in this Bill.  The &quot;bias&quot; within this Bill, if we can use that word, is with the employer and to allow flexibility for the employer and not to protect the employee.  The Minister of State graciously said with an open heart and with generosity, as he always does, that he will work with Members on Committee Stage.</p> <p>It is my experience, and others will agree with me, that it has been possible to work with the Minister of State on Committee Stage.  However, it does not augur well when at this early stage of the passage of this Bill the recommendations put down by those who are tasked with doing pre-legislative scrutiny and trying to work best across parties to give the Minister of State advice on this have been ignored.  It also does not augur well that agencies such as the MRCI are so worried about the balance of this Bill being about what is in the best interests of an employer and not in the best interests of protecting the most vulnerable of workers.</p> <p> I suggest to the Minister of State that we are working with him and that we will be seeking amendments to this Bill in order to redress that balance.  In all these conversations we tend to have, the balance of conversation in these Chambers seems to be about what is most important for the employer.  Whenever we have a conversation about sick pay it always comes down to what will be best for the employer and the same goes for wage structures etc.  When it comes to the energy crisis we are facing into this winter and what companies, businesses and small enterprises will go through, that struggle for the employer to keep the lights on is always mentioned but not enough of this discussion is focused on the potential for employees to lose their jobs or be on reduced wages.  We need to rebalance that.</p> <p> While taking the Minister of State's comments at face value and while we want to work with him on it, I ask him to reflect on the fact that those who in good faith made recommendations to him during pre-legislative scrutiny in the committee, from the Government benches and from the Opposition benches, particularly around the seasonal employment permit, were ignored or feel they were ignored.  I ask him also to reflect on the fact that an agency such as the MRCI, which I have worked with closely and which I hold in huge regard, is also saying it is deeply concerned about what the Government is proposing.  This is Second Stage of a Bill so anything can happen and we can make changes but the Labour Party asks that at this early stage in the passage of this Bill the Minister of State would reflect on the comments I have made.</p></speech>

They could have done with a few more quips and one-liners and fair play to them for sticking it out as long as they could.</p>  <p>  I both agree and disagree with Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in on the value of the pre-legislative scrutiny process.  I do not serve on the Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment so I have not had the benefit of hearing it discussed to the same level of detail that Members who are on the committee would have.  Some good work happens in that Committee Stage pre-legislative scrutiny but this Bill is not entirely blind to the work the committee did at the pre-legislative scrutiny stage.  What we are seeing on Second Stage has improved as a result of that committee work.  There is also Committee Stage to come and it is a Bill that has a road to travel.</p>  <p>  I also disagree with Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in's characterisation of this Government always being on the side of the employer.  I scribbled a few notes from memory as he was speaking and under this Government we have introduced sick leave for the first time.  We have also introduced domestic violence leave, increased parental leave and a right to request remote working.  I know that it will probably be tomorrow at this stage by the time we see Second Stage of the work life balance and miscellaneous provisions Bill.  I am not sure I can agree with that characterisation, therefore.  A range of rights have been introduced by this Government that favour workers and employees and that is something I am proud of.  I acknowledge the thankless work of the officials in the Department on this Bill, which is a substantial piece of work, and I acknowledge the huge amount of work that must have gone into it.</p>  <p>  One of the recurring phrases I see in describing this Bill talks about agility and flexibility and that is 100% required in an economy where we are struggling to get people who have the appropriate range of skills.  I will give some specific examples later but I sometimes worry that phrases like "agility" and "flexibility" can lead to a bonfire of regulations.  We need to make sure we can be responsive in supplying the labour market.  We know the challenges we have across a range of sectors such as housing.  Those challenges include retrofitting, the roll-out of solar panels, the green economy and all those things that I, as a Green Party representative, would be interested in pushing forward.  It is so difficult to recruit the required skill sets into those areas at the moment but we cannot allow that to happen by undermining workers' rights.  It cannot be the case that we allow people just to come into this jurisdiction and undermine, for example, the rights to collective bargaining that have been so long fought for by unions and so on.  We need to strike that balance, which this Bill does, but we need to be careful about it.  We need that flexibility and to move away from a preponderance of provisions in primary legislation so that we can do things through regulation or secondary legislation and be more responsive but we have to make sure the rights of workers are protected in that.</p>  <p>  I said I would reference a specific example and the following is a good example of where we need the type of flexibility where we have skill shortages within our economy.  I have had a local company in contact with me and it wants to bring in 20 bus drivers.  The case of heavy goods vehicle, HGV, drivers has been resolved and we can bring them in.  I have 20 qualified bus drivers who are looking to come in, who are fluent in English and who are used to driving on the left-hand side of the road, which is important when you are trying to recruit a driver in the economy.  However, we still have issues around that kind of responsiveness and this is where this Bill comes in.  We want to be able to identify those sectors where we want to bring people in but we have to make sure we do that in the right way.</p>  <p>  We could look at the likes of the fisheries industry and we know there have been problems there and that workers have been recruited under practices that we might not be comfortable with.  We have to acknowledge that increased vulnerability of migrant workers who come here for seasonal employment.  We need to make sure those people are afforded the type of protections that I would expect to be in place in my economy.  We have to also acknowledge that the labour shortages we are seeing are a function of a well-performing economy.  In particular, I note with interest the increased participation of women within our workforce.  That was unexpected and it is largely to do with the possibility to request remote and flexible working practices.  That is positive as long as we have those in-built protections but it is positive that we have an economy that is performing that well.</p>  <p>  I take the opportunity to welcome platform working.  I know Deputy O'Reilly and Senator Sherlock have engaged with SIPTU on this.  This is a difficult to reach sector of the workforce, not just in this jurisdiction but all across the EU.  We are struggling to adapt our legislation to account for something that is not quite employment and that certainly is not quite self-employment either.  Often they are migrant workers from a different jurisdiction who might be here on a student visa and who are doing some work.  They are difficult to reach but they need to be protected.</p>  <p>  These employment permits can be issued to those whose skills are required in the State, where those skills are in critical short supply and that shortage is likely to hinder growth and economic opportunity.  It is that point on growth and economic opportunity that I want to dwell on for a moment because maybe those are not the only factors that we want to consider.  Maybe there is room for things like reaching our climate targets.  I referenced those specific skills but is there scope for that?  It also chimes with the idea that maybe we should be looking at an Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, TRIPS, waiver for intellectual property on technology to fight climate change such as climate carbon and storage.  I know that is not quite to the point but I am saying that growth and economic development might be slightly too confined as criteria within which we would consider these work permits.</p></speech>

These include the index-linking of wage thresholds to keep them in line with salary growth and the provision for additional conditions for granting an employment permit, such as training and accommodation support for migrant workers or making innovation or upskilling a condition of granting, which may decrease future reliance on economic migration.</p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in supports the fair and sensible use of employment permits where there are shortages of necessary skills in our economy.  For example, on the back of a Sinn F&eacute;in motion on services for children with disabilities in March this year, a number of therapist positions, including physiotherapists, occupational therapists and speech and language therapists, were added to the critical skills list in June.  That was a necessary and welcome intervention.  However, this should only be done when necessary and should not be used if we are not first ensuring we are equipping our students with critical skills in areas where we have skills shortages and also improving the pay and conditions of workers.  Doing that is important to ensure we have the requisite skill sets across our economy and to retain those skilled staff.  To this end, it is vital that the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment works closely with the Departments of Education and Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, and other Departments where appropriate, in planning for future skills requirements.</p>  <p>  While my party and I understand the need to modernise our employment permits legislation, we have some concerns about the approach the Government is taking with this Bill.  As it stands, the legislation is focused solely on increasing flexibility for employers, with absolutely no attempt to protect workers' rights.  Many of these issues were highlighted during pre-legislative scrutiny and in a report published by the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment, which made several vital recommendations the Minister of State seems to have ignored or disregarded.  Several of those recommendations, if implemented, would grant the same basic rights to all work permit holders and protect them from serious exploitation.</p>  <p>  I do not have time to go through each of the committee's recommendations, most of which have been dealt with by colleagues.  However, there are two points I want to raise.  First, the section on the mandatory grounds for refusal of employment permits needs to be strengthened.  In particular, there should be mandatory refusal of a permit application for any company found to have been in breach of employment law in the previous five years.  We should ensure unscrupulous employers do not have the opportunity to offend again and that they are punished for breaching employment law.  Second, I would like to see the legislation amended such that before workers arrive, they are given access to a full online course on their employment rights, provided by the Department in conjunction with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU.</p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in supports the improvement of our employment permits legislation but it must be done in a progressive manner that supports and protects workers and also benefits the economy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-12a.218" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1489" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="14:27:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022101200035#NN00200"><p>Immigration is a net positive for this country.  People who come here from abroad improve our culture and the country is richer for it.  The State has a responsibility to those workers to ensure they are treated equally and fairly and to protect their rights as workers and also as individuals.  This is not a responsibility the State has upheld very well to date.</p>  <p>  With that responsibility to ensure equal treatment in mind, this Bill raises a lot of red flags.  It is clear from the contributions of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment at pre-legislative scrutiny stage and elsewhere that the Bill is written first and foremost to benefit employers.  Workers' rights are very much a secondary issue in this legislation.  Making the employment permits system more flexible to the labour market is not a bad idea in itself but flexibility without parliamentary oversight and where there are limited workers' rights is unacceptable.  The employment permits system pits workers against each other and provides different rights and protections dependent on how much the Department values their profession.  This is not fair and it leaves workers - the same essential workers we all praised over the past few years - in incredibly vulnerable positions in some workplaces.  It limits their ability to put down roots, save money, be promoted and even the ability to change their employment when working conditions are poor.</p>  <p>  The response from the Government to these concerns will be the usual thing we hear, namely, that all workers in the State are protected and we all have the same rights and protections regardless of where we come from.  That is not the reality, however, and we all know it.  We can see evidence of this in the minimum remuneration thresholds under the various employment permits.  Those thresholds are &euro;32,000 for a person with a degree on the critical skills list, which is below the living wage, &euro;30,000 for a general employment permit, &euro;27,000 for staff in contact centres and &euro;22,000 for horticulture workers and dairy farm assistants.  Even before the most recent spike in inflation, we all knew there was an issue in this country with the very high cost of living.  It is difficult to see how the Minister can justify the Department working towards a living wage while simultaneously allowing these thresholds to be in place.</p>  <p>  One of the most critical factors in determining a migrant worker's experience in the labour market is his or her experience of the point of entry, which is tied together with immigration status.  Employment and immigration status are a constant worry for migrant workers, particularly when they have work permits that tie them to their employer for their first 12 months in this country.  Such a status limits their ability to negotiate with an employer for better conditions and terms of employment, with employers holding power over their employees' ability to work and reside here.  I am not suggesting for a minute that all employers exert this power; far from it.  Most really value their employees but there are some who abuse their power.  Even when that power is not abused by the employer and the latter would not even dream of doing so, workers still feel there is a power differential.  It is always there and is perceived as a threat.</p>  <p>  Tying workers' immigration status and access to the labour market to a single employer is a fundamentally poor idea.  The exploitation of workers under such schemes has been well documented and they benefit the employer alone.  The Department should be working on phasing those schemes out rather than creating new ones.  The Migrants Rights Centre Ireland, MRCI, which has been referred to on numerous occasions in this debate, has recommended that a sector-based permit system be introduced, which would afford workers the ability to switch employers within a particular sector.  That ability would give them leverage to negotiate and would force employers to improve pay and conditions to retain staff.  This would benefit good employers and allow for flexibility.  It makes a lot of sense.  Has the Department examined that suggestion from the MRCI?  I would like a response on that from the Minister of State.  The proposal seems to address the labour shortages in particular sectors on the critical skills list while also removing opportunities for exploitation.</p>  <p>  It is my understanding that in the 11 years of the existence of the critical skills list, no occupations have been taken off it.  There are many provisions within our laws on employment permits to protect Irish and EEA workers and ensure employers are not always looking abroad for staff.  The critical skills list is supposed to have a dual purpose, that is, to identify the skills shortages we need migrant workers to fill and to identify the areas in which domestic workers need to be upskilled to ensure there is some movement on the list.  It is clear the latter has not been done.  What is the view of the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science on this?  What is being done to address these skills shortages?  It would be useful to have a response from the Minister of State in this regard.  If the Government is looking for employment permits to be made flexible and responsive to the needs of the labour market, then our education system must be flexible as well.  It is clear, however, it is failing in that regard and I would like to know why that is.</p>  <p>  As I said, I have concerns the Department is crafting this legislation primarily from the perspective and interest of employers.  The move in the Bill towards the use of regulation as opposed to legislation for changes in the system really is not acceptable.  It fundamentally reduces the democratic oversight of the system, which is one that needs more daylight shone on it, not less.</p> <p>I understand, from the employer's perspective, that the ability of the Department to make quick changes to the skills list would be very attractive.  That is not so for the workers, whose employment conditions, and therefore immigration status, could be changed overnight without any warning.  We cannot presume it always goes in one direction.  It provides far less certainty and security for workers.  Some particularly convincing lobbyists or an economic downturn could mean that people's whole lives are uprooted.  We must think about the fact that these are individual people.  It is their lives and livelihoods that are impacted.  The system we have in place operates on the assumption that workers on permits are here temporarily.  That is not the case for many in practice.  Migrant workers build lives here and they stay.  The system has to recognise their contribution to the country and give them a clear avenue to permanent residency and citizenship.  People who are recruited on temporary permits need to have the ability to transition into long-term status if they meet the requirements of other permits.  Treating migrant workers fairly and equally is not just the right thing to do morally, it is the smart thing to do economically.  We need people to come here to work.  Ireland needs to be as attractive a destination as possible for workers, because people do not emigrate across the world on a whim.  They shop around and survey their options.  If Ireland is not providing good working conditions, pay, family reunification and a pathway to permanent residency, then workers will go elsewhere.  To continue to treat migrant workers as expendable temporary labour who will plug a gap in the market and then be asked to leave is foolish and morally bankrupt.  Very often, skill sets are enhanced by virtue of the fact of being embedded in the local culture.  All of that is lost if migrant workers leave.<br/><br/>When discussing employment permits, workers' rights and the dangers of having one's immigration and working entitlements tied to an employer, we have to raise the issue of the appalling conditions in the Irish fishing industry.  Despite the clear need for labour in the industry, fishers have not been included on the critical skills permit list.  Instead, a bespoke scheme was put in place, the atypical working scheme, which is absolutely rife with exploitation.  The Government has been sitting on recommendations to reform the sector since last March, showing very little regard for the incredibly vulnerable workers in the sector.  I was particularly struck by an interview in the <i>Irish Independent</i>last month with Adel Sallam, an undocumented fisherman who lost his job last May when two of his fingers were severed in an accident on board a trawler.  He came to Ireland, with over 20 years of experience in the fishing industry in Egypt, to fill a gap in our labour market that the Department of Trade, Enterprise and Employment will not acknowledge on the critical skills list.  The International Transport Workers Federation estimates there are between 250 and 300 undocumented fishers in the State, with at least 200 of them having been documented at one point.  The exploitative working conditions at sea, including incredibly long hours, inevitably lead to fatigue and accidents.  From 2016 on, the US State Department, the International Transport Workers Federation, the UN special rapporteurs and the Council of Europe have all expressed the view that the atypical working scheme does not have enough safeguards in place to prevent human trafficking and exploitation.  Despite some changes to the scheme over the years, conditions have worsened.  The new regulations are not enforced and when inspectors are sent on board boats, migrant workers feel unable to talk to them or are prevented from doing so.  There is a power and inequality issue here.  One worker in the system said it was like a visa into slavery.  We have to deal with that comprehensively.  The WRC carried out 454 inspections up to June 2021 on fishing boats, and found that 323 instances breached conventions.  These reports have been consistent.  They have come from workers, journalists, unions, international bodies and human rights organisations.  To date, the State has refused to take them seriously.  The review of that scheme has been completed.  It needs to be released as soon as possible, and the working conditions of vulnerable people in this sector need to be regularised.<br/><br/>I wish to finish by saying that I think the pre-legislative scrutiny, as part of the legislative process, is really beneficial when it is done right.  It saves us from having to really interrogate the various angles and interest groups later on in the process.  The problem is that when it is not done correctly or when some of the issues are not taken on board, it is very difficult to make changes later on.  If we are going to have that scrutiny as part of our legislative process, we have to set aside the time to do it and take on board the issues at that point.  It is very difficult to get them in later on.  I like pre-legislative scrutiny as a process and I have been through it with some committees.  In some cases, it is very good and in some cases it is not.  It is a mixed bag.  We have to take the scrutiny process seriously and really pay attention on Committee Stage, which will enable us to have most of the work done by Report Stage.  I support that approach.  It takes the same length of time to deal with legislation anyway because if we are going to spend a lot more time on Report Stage or Committee Stage, it defeats the purpose of having a really good pre-legislative stage.  That can really benefit that.  </p></speech>

Indeed, I have just expressed my gratitude to the Minister of State in the Chamber for his assistance with so many different representations received over the last number of years in particular, from employers and workers alike, who are caught in what is quite a Byzantine system.  I would like to start by picking up on a point made by Deputy Catherine Murphy on the need, not just within this legislation but more generally, to have a formulised pathway to long-term status for people who originally come here on a work permit, and particularly the short-term skills-necessary permits.  I think it is in our interest not just as an economy, but more so as a society, that when welcoming people to come here and carry out really critical jobs and fill gaps in our labour market, we do so in a generous manner knowing that ultimately it is in our interest and their interest for them to be able to make a long-term home in Ireland and make this a really welcoming place.  That is how we can develop a thriving sector in each part of the economy, and crucially, make Ireland an even more attractive economy to come to for many different workers, as well as ensuring that employees and employers alike have the necessary skills.  I think that requires a bit of work not just in the Minister of State's own Department but also with the Department of Justice.  Coming out of a pandemic with changing and shifting economic tectonic plates, there is a real opportunity in Ireland not only as an investment hub but also as a hub for talent.  We want more and more people to come here to complement a very talented indigenous workforce.  We do so with an eye on longer-term prosperity for worker and economy alike.</p>  <p>  I think we all have to recognise that there is a severe labour shortage in our economy in every single sector, and it is shifting.  While I welcome the change of occupations and the ongoing work of the Minister of State and others, and particularly the work of Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, in her previous brief, to review the occupations, I think we have to move to a situation where the definition is far more flexible.  The nature and method of work and the requirements of employer and employee alike are changing.  We should be able to bring more and more talented workers into this jurisdiction in more holistic environment, for want of a better word.  Some of the occupations have been far too prescribed in the past, which means that there are far too many anomalies, where people simply are not fitting the exact requirement.  The nature of what once was defined as an occupation has changed so drastically, particularly over the last couple of years, that it needs to be reviewed.  Looking at the key areas in our own constituencies, of which we are all aware, from the care and hospitality sectors to bookmaking, there are so many gaps.  I am inundated with representations from small business owners across my constituency, who are constantly looking to plug gaps.  They are increasing wages and improving conditions, but still there is a shortage, whether it is of chefs, bookkeepers or technicians in the ICT sector.  We must realise that there are only so many training courses and courses in this country that can address that situation.  </p> <p>We must examine how to make this a more attractive jurisdiction for people within the EEA and, crucially, to be generous and outward looking.  We must consider the level of talent we could be bringing in from outside jurisdictions.  </p> <p> When considering those severe labour shortages, we must also examine the issues around the recognition of qualifications and encourage a more swift standard of mutual recognition of qualifications.  Look at drivers of heavy goods vehicles, HGV, in the past couple of years.  There are only five or six jurisdictions outside the EEA that match the standards in Ireland.  We need to bring other jurisdictions into play in more situations by recognising their qualifications.  That requires us in Ireland to put more effort into research.  It should not always be a matter for the applicants to prove themselves or for the third-party jurisdiction to look at its standards.  We must go out and investigate their standards and make the decision for ourselves.  That could save an awful lot of time and effort in the long term.  </p> <p> I particularly welcome a couple of aspect of this legislation which I consider worthwhile.  The waiving of the 50:50 rule is welcome and far-sighted.  Considering the changing nature of the ownership of businesses and the potential make-up of the workforce in the coming years, that change is a welcome reflection of reality.  It has happened in other jurisdictions, both within and without the European Union, to the betterment of all.</p> <p> I also welcome the introduction of the conditionality of training for existing staff.  We talk about continuing professional development but that is also the role of the employer.  Many employers have a great niche in that regard.  The employer has a role in constantly improving the abilities and capabilities of staff members and employees to serve the needs of that company but must also ensure the future career prospects of those employees.  All of us in this House are employers and have a duty of care to the people who we employ in our offices not just so they can serve our offices and political ambitions but so we can serve them, as individuals.  That is a responsibility we should all take seriously.  We need to lead by example.  That is a particularly welcome aspect of the legislation.  It is an area where the Government needs to have a hands-on role with the representative bodies to ensure that companies are in a position to do this and embrace it.</p> <p> The make-up of those employers seeking permits, and indeed those individuals seeking permits, is changing greatly.  The demands are changing and many of the people who are engaging with the system are now doing so for the first time.  They did not think they would need a talented staff member from outside Ireland or the EEA.  It is still quite an intimidating process.  The level of outreach and simplicity in the system needs to be considered again to ensure that employers are not making mistakes.  It is welcome that the rules around the refusal of incomplete applications are changing but we must ensure we do not get to that stage.  It should be easy for an employer to bring in a talented individual to a good job on a good salary with good conditions.  It is not be something we should ever try to make difficult.</p></speech>

Employment permits are an important factor in filling vacancies or meeting employment demands in areas where there are shortages of the necessary skills in our economy.  Exceptional circumstances may, therefore, present the idea that it is right and proper that our employment permits legislation be adopted to address these shortcomings.</p>  <p>  At the Committee on Public Petitions, we heard of the needs of the hospitality sector.  We heard there is an incredible shortfall of staff in the sector.  We heard a call to add certain skill sets to the critical skills list in the sector.  The discussion dealt with the educational qualifications to become eligible under the list and so on.  It displayed for the committee the changing nature of needs within particular sectors and the requirement for further suggestions on how to address legislation that has been described as tired and dated.  All perspectives must be listened to and examined for their pros and cons, their potential benefits and pitfalls.  While this Bill may be of benefit to the sectors in need of skilled workers, we must ensure it does not come at the cost of the workers' rights.</p>  <p>  The Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment has also heard there is evidence to suggest that the employment rights of workers under the permit system, such as levels of pay and conditions of employment, are, in some instances, ignored.  There are concerns in this House that the Bill, as it currently stands, is focused solely on increasing flexibility for employers with no attempt to protect workers' rights.  Take the suggestion of introducing the seasonal employment permit.  I can understand why it is seen as an option but if one looks more closely, there is a lack of detail that the committee has identified.  Members raised concerns over the temporary nature of these permits, the protection and enforcement of workers' rights and entitlements, and noted the need for ongoing monitoring of any impact of the permit in depressing wages and to ensure the protection of workers' rights.  The committee has suggested that the general employment permit should be adapted to meet the need for seasonal employment.  I urge the Department to look again at the committee's recommendations.</p>  <p>  The Bill is not all bad.  I welcome that it provides for additional conditions for the grant of an employment permit, such as training or accommodation support for migrant workers in some circumstances, or making innovation or upskilling a condition of the grant.  We feel the Bill needs additional amendments to make it fit for purpose.  It still leaves migrant workers open to serious exploitation.  While permits are an important contributor to various sectors, the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Education and Higher and Further Education, Research, Innovation and Science must focus on equipping students with critical skills in areas where we have skills shortages, as well as improving pay and conditions and the attractiveness of the positions.</p></speech>

That is what it is.  It is a Bill, therefore, to undermine the rights of all workers.  It is a Bill written in the interests of the employers in particular sectors.  Evidence of that is contained in the fact that the minimal recommendations made by the Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment, of which I am a part, which were signed up to by even the Fine Gael members of the committee, have been ignored.  Minimal attempts to strengthen basic workers' rights have been ignored yet again by this right-wing Government.</p><p>Some of those recommendations included the proposal that workers on general employment permits would have the same rights as workers on critical skills permits and would be allowed the right to gain access to the labour market after two years instead of five years.  The recommendations would allow them better rights to family reunion and would allow family members the right to work.  The committee also recommended against introducing the proposed new seasonal employment permit.  It is obviously intended as a <i>carte blanche</i>for employers in industries such as hospitality and fruit-picking to treat migrant workers like so much disposable cutlery; tools to be discarded without a second thought at the end of the season.</p><p>It is not only People Before Profit that is saying the Minister has ignored workers' rights in this Bill.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions agrees.  It says the legislation addresses the needs of employers only, not workers, and has no proposals to enhance workers' rights.  Migrant Rights Centre Ireland, which represents many migrant workers in this country, also agrees.  It says that the committee's recommendations have been entirely ignored, &quot;leaving workers at risk of severe exploitation&quot;.  The centre stated that this Bill, as it currently stands, is focused solely on increasing flexibility for employers with absolutely no attempt to protect workers' rights.  That is the scandal.  The centre is absolutely correct.  The Bill is about flexibility for employers and has absolutely nothing to defend the rights of migrant workers and all workers in this country.</p><p>Particularly cynical is the Department's ongoing refusal to provide anything near the level of resources required for the Workplace Relations Commission to actually enforce workers' rights.</p> <p>More than 30,000 work permits have been issued so far this year, yet the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, only has approximately 50 inspectors across its entire remit, which is much broader than just dealing with these permits and the rights connected with them.  That is a joke on the same level as the three regulators allocated to oversee Anglo Irish Bank and Bank of Ireland combined before the financial crash, or the current risible underresourcing of the Data Protection Commission.  They are all systems of State regulation designed to fail so that big business can do whatever it likes and who cares about the consequences for workers or society as a whole.  Will the Minister of State at least have the decency to acknowledge that workers&rsquo; rights have been disregarded in the drafting of this Bill and that he, his Department and this Government have entirely caved to the demands of employers and employers&rsquo; lobbyists on this?</p> <p> I note several returns in the Register of Lobbying relating to the employment permit system from former Fine Gael Deputy turned lobbyist, Mr. Tom Neville.  It seems he has been energetically lobbying his former colleagues in Fine Gael on this, including the Minister of State and another Fine Gael Minister, Deputy McEntee, on behalf of a recruitment agency for non-EEA workers, Workforce Ireland.  This latest version of the Bill before us includes provisions enabling recruitment agencies to in effect become sponsors of permits, rather than the actual employer.  This reinforces another parasitic layer of exploitation and control of vulnerable workers.  Mr. Neville's demands and requests in respect of the Bill cannot be seen in the lobbying register, but perhaps the Minister of State can fill us in on what he and his officials spoke with Tom Neville about on between two and five separate occasions between September and December last year when the general scheme of this Bill was being drafted.  Is there any correspondence between the Bill&rsquo;s favourable provisions for recruitment agencies and the lobbying the Minister of State's former Fine Gael colleague, Tom Neville, on behalf of one such agency?  According to the lobbying register, Mr. Neville registered his lobbying firm, Neville International, in September 2020 - it clearly has international ambitions - just seven months after losing his seat in the February 2020 general election.  That is a lot less than the one year cooling-off period for relevant designated public officials-----</p></speech>

That is a lot less than the one year cooling-off period for relevant designated public officials under the lobbying Act.  Of course, Mr. Neville is not covered by that because Deputies are not covered, which again reflects how weak our legislation is regarding the rotating door of people moving from politics to lobbying.</p><p>To return to the committee&rsquo;s recommendations, the fact that even the Minister of State's own party and Government colleagues on the committee endorsed them means these were very minimal asks by the committee.  Even then, the Government was not able to accept them.  People Before Profit demands much more.  We are opposed to the EU&rsquo;s unjust and racist immigration policies, which the Minister of State, the Government and the Minister of State's European Parliament colleagues have consistently supported.  Together with the establishments across Europe, they are responsible for creating and reinforcing a fortress Europe that has caused the deaths of 25,000migrants in the Mediterranean Sea so far, many of them young children.  Their only crime was to seek a better life for themselves and their families as generations of Irish people have also been forced to do.</p><p>We want nothing less than equal and improved rights for all workers, regardless of nationality or immigration status.  Equal pay and conditions for equal work are entirely basic demands.  It is an indictment of the capitalist system that we are still fighting for this in 2022 and that it is so generally accepted that migrant workers can be treated as &ldquo;less than&rdquo; and discriminated against purely on the basis of their nationality and country of origin.  We are opposed to the whole system of employment permits.  Tying workers to an employer for any period is a form of bonded labour that leaves them vulnerable to super-exploitation.  We will therefore oppose this Bill as it reinforces the State-sanctioned system of worker exploitation, which is what the system of employment permits really is.  In doing nothing to improve meaningfully the rights of migrant workers, the Government undermines the rights of the whole working class.</p><p>The point is that this is a battle for the entire working class.  If we improve the rights of migrant workers and get rid of the super-exploitation that is allowed, that will benefit all workers.  When the horrific exploitation of Turkish workers at Gama was exposed and was defeated by an organised struggle and strike led by socialists and the workers themselves, that was a blow for all workers.  Similarly, the whole workers' movement needs to stand united against these permits, against this super-exploitation of migrant workers and for workers' rights for all.</p></speech>

That statement is incredible, as is the fact that a Government Deputy points towards the fishing industry as an example of anything in this country to do with jobs, recruitment, workers' rights and decent treatment.</p>  <p>  I will comment on the review of the atypical work permit scheme for non-EEA fishers that was published last night.  Before I do so, let us look at the conditions that have existed under this scheme and the shocking levels of exploitation that took place under it.  If these conditions were described as Dickensian, that would probably be an understatement.  I recently tabled a parliamentary question for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Varadkar, and received a response from him, regarding the issue of contraventions of legal entitlements of migrant fishers since the introduction of that scheme in February 2016.  I will read into the record of the D&aacute;il some of the information that was provided to me in the Minister's reply.  It is shocking information that includes chilling statistics.</p>  <p>  Contravention notices were served on 95 of the 126 vessel owners, in other words, three quarters of the vessel owners in question.  Some 392 contraventions were detected by WRC inspectors.  I ask Deputies to bear with me as I read out 11 headings under which contraventions took place.  Contraventions took place relating to the employment of non-EEA fishers without permission; failure to co-operate with the WRC inspectors; the provision of false information and false documents; failure to pay the legal national minimum wage; the provision of annual leave; denial of public holiday entitlements; unauthorised deductions; failure to keep records; failure to issue payslips; failure to issue contracts of employment; and hours of work and hours of rest.</p>  <p>  Despite this - bus drivers beware - Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh stated during this debate that in order to have more flexibility in the recruitment of bus drivers, we have to look towards the fishing industry.</p> <p>My God, does that not say something about this Government and the parties participating in it?  Last night, we saw the overdue publication of the review of the atypical work permit scheme for non-EEA fishers.  The review essentially calls for the scheme to be effectively wound up.  That is positive.  I welcome it and it will be welcomed by migrant fishers throughout the country.  The review recommends a more advantageous work permit scheme.  What that scheme will look like in reality is not yet known as there is a year-long process of engagement to be undertaken.  However, it is understood that there will be a pathway towards visa stamp 4, full labour market access and family reunification, if desired.  I repeat that I welcome that, as will the fishers.  I congratulate the International Transport Workers Federation for its relentless campaigning work in highlighting these issues and in putting the Government and the State under pressure on them.  Its work was the key driver of the changes that are about to take place.</p> <p> There are some weaknesses in this review, however.  I will highlight two specific weaknesses.  First, there are more than 250 undocumented fishers in this State who fell out of the atypical scheme for any of a number of reasons.  The two main reasons were injury and, in some cases, serious injury preventing them from carrying on working as fishers in the industry and people walking away after disputes with exploitative employers who would not pay proper wages or give proper hours or who undertook the other actions I have given examples of.  The majority of these more than 250 undocumented fishers were not catered for under the scheme for the undocumented introduced by the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee.  They are in limbo and this review does not address their needs.  It needs to do so.  These are people who have been treated very poorly by their employers when guests of the nation here, as the information I gave earlier indicates.  A hand needs to be reached out to these people.  They need to be given satisfaction and a decent arrangement needs to be put in place for them.</p> <p> The second weakness is that the review had an unnecessarily defensive tone to it.  For example, dozens of cases of having been trafficked into this country have been reported to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na by non-EEA fishers.  The report says that those claims were shown to be without foundation by the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP.  The DPP never said that those claims were without foundation.  That is false.  It is a distortion of the reality and the truth.  What the DPP said was that there was insufficient evidence.  There is a world of difference between saying that there is insufficient evidence, which is what the DPP said, and saying that the reports were found to be without foundation, as is indicated in the report.  That should be corrected and officially changed.  It is false.  While I am at it, the DPP's office has never successively taken a case on the issue of labour exploitation.  This is a key reason for this State consistently scoring very poorly, year after year, in international trafficking reports.  That needs to be highlighted and I would welcome a change in the position.</p> <p> I have more or less concluded my remarks.  I have two minutes left on the clock.  We need an end to what is effectively bonded labour in this State.  We need to focus on improving workers' rights and conditions rather than all of the time tweaking things to suit the needs and demands of employers.  If bus drivers or any other group of workers are listening to this debate, they should pay attention to the comments of Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh because saying that we have to look towards the fishing industry for anything other than an example of the exploitation we need to combat or of how we need to do things very differently is mind-blowing.  I will leave it at that.</p></speech>

I constantly speak to business owners, machinery operators and farmers.  The message I have been getting for a long time now is that there is a major shortage of workers for key parts of the economy.  I am consistently contacted by employers, particularly in the services and hospitality industry and in agrifood production, who are looking for people to start work.  It is a very positive place to be in the sense that we are seeing record levels of employment but many businesses are coming under increased pressure to continue operating with skeleton staffs.  A hotel owner I know fairly well has stopped answering the phone at times during the week because the hotel cannot take any more requests for rooms or for tables in the restaurant at night due to the chronic shortage of staff.  The teenagers and young adults going back to college really exacerbated the situation and has put pressure on staff numbers in an awful lot of industries.</p>  <p>  I want to talk about the red tape and the bureaucracy involved in getting work permits through the system.  The bureaucracy involved in the entire employment permits system needs to be removed or drastically reduced.  We need to cut away the red tape and the unnecessary delays in getting badly needed workers here.  I have been working on employment permit applications with a constituent for a long number of months.  Between all of the bureaucracy and the issue being passed from one place to another, we have had to work with four separate Departments to try to get an outcome.  While it is one thing to get permits for workers to come to Ireland to work, getting visas approved is another obstacle.  All of these processes take time.  They are slowing the flow of workers into the country when they are badly needed.  All of these processes are frustrating businesses to such an extent that some are now telling me that, if the issues are not resolved in the coming months, they will simply have to cease operations.</p>  <p>  I am dealing with a mushroom producer.  This industry is facing one issue after another, from the lack of availability of peat to the substantial increases in the cost of energy.  The lack of availability of labour is now putting businesses in jeopardy.  Some horticultural producers, especially in the mushroom industry, are leaving some of their tunnels idle because of the lack of a workforce.  The frustration among business owners is clear as they try to work their way through these processes.  There are workers who are ready and willing to come here to start employment and they cannot source employees here.  They are not operating at capacity and it is taking months upon months to get the workers here to resolve the issues.  For these permits to have the greatest impact, the entire process needs to be streamlined, the bureaucracy removed and faster processing of businesses' applications guaranteed.  If this is not achieved, the numbers being approved are just numbers while businesses struggle to operate at a much reduced capacity.  It is time for strict timelines to be put in place so that prospective employers applying for a work permit will know they will get an answer within ten, 14 or 21 days or whatever the time limit is.  The same should be done for visa applications.  There should be strict timelines in place for employers who locate workers and organises the paperwork to get them here to work.</p> <p>They should know within 21 days or 28 days that these workers will be available to come here to work, whether that is in the hospitality sector, horticulture or wherever.  The process needs to be streamlined.  It is the same with the dairy industry.  There is a severe shortage of labour there as well and there are huge opportunities.  I urge the Minister of State to streamline the process.</p> <p> This Bill is most welcome, but unless we reduce the red tape, employers will just say they cannot put up with the hassle.  The delays are completely unacceptable.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-12a.236" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1482" speakername="Se&aacute;n Canney" time="15:17:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022101200040#SS00200"><p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  When I worked in the private sector, I had experience of trying to get permits for people coming into this country who were specialised at the time.  That is going back a number of years ago.  It was an arduous process to get the people we needed to work for us and who were specialised.  Every year they had to reapply and we had to prove that they were specialists.  It cost a lot of money and involved very uncertain terms and conditions for people because they were only being taken on on a yearly basis.  That has probably changed.  What I am hearing from industry at the moment, whether about school bus drivers, chefs, general operatives on building sites or production workers on factory floors, every employer I have spoken to has told me it is impossible to get people to work.  I was talking to representatives of independent private nursing homes today and they told me that trying to get nursing staff from abroad is very arduous and can cost up to &euro;8,000 per application.</p>  <p>  This country effectively has what we call full employment.  We have demand for our products because we have a good record of producing good-quality goods and services.  We have a fantastic medtech industry, especially around Galway, and the companies involved are crying out for additional workers.  The problem they keep repeating is that it is becoming more difficult to get people in because the system is very bureaucratic.  It is without timelines and extremely complicated.  If we are to try to capture the opportunities that are there in terms of job creation, building economic growth and producing more tax to pay for all the bills we are putting money into the moment, we have to look at the issue of work permits to make it easier for people to get skilled workers into this country.  We cannot treat them as something we will only bring in the minute we need them.  At this stage, it is a foregone conclusion that we need plenty of workers in this country.  When we bring them in, we have to treat them as equals.  We have to make sure their personal public service, PPS, identification is done as quickly as possible.  I know of a case of a particular business in my own town that took somebody on and they were four weeks waiting for a PPS number so it could not pay the person.  That person was living on fresh air while they were waiting for the PPS number to come through.  By rights, the person should not have been working because they did not have the PPS number but in order to keep the business going they had to get the work done.</p>  <p>  Our systems can become very convoluted and we can create a lot of paperwork in respect of something that is very simple.  We should have very clear training and information for employers on how to go about recruiting people and how the State will assist them in applying for the permits, rather than telling them what they have done wrong when they submit something.  The communication process around that is very important.  Most companies would say that apart from the cost of production, electricity and energy, their biggest issue is trying to keep their workforce going and trying to keep production going at the levels that their orders demand.  Manufacturers and suppliers are becoming cagey as to how many orders they will take him because they do not know if they will have the personnel to actually fill these orders.  We are losing potential in that.  I am sure the Minister of State will take this on board.  Having simple and clear processes through which we can get permits for people is important.</p>  <p>  I know there are issues around security and identification and who is coming into the country.  In the main, the people who are coming here are people who want to work and contribute to society, who will pay their way and pay their taxes.  We should be opening our arms to the people who want to do that.  They are not coming here on a freebie looking for something from the State.  After Covid, a lot of people who came from eastern Europe and worked here went back home and have not come back to us since.  That has created a void in the labour market and we have to react to it fairly fast.  I hope this Bill will allow us to do that.  I hope we are not creating more layers of bureaucracy.  The bottom line is that we need to make sure any employer that wants to make an application has a clear pathway by which to do it and that they do it right.  They should know what to do rather than taking chances and being told afterwards that they were wrong and they have to do this, that and the other.  The communication between the Department and employers needs to be better.</p>  <p>  It would be worthwhile to host a number of workshops around the country, through IBEC, to help businesspeople better understand the processes involved.  We have to educate the HR fraternity as to how to make these applications and how to make them right so they can get them through faster.  It is only reasonable that we think about this in order to make sure we are doing things right.  The economy will benefit from it in the long run.  The country will benefit from it and every aspect of life will benefit from it.  We have a great country.  We need to just realise the potential we have in the demand for our products and services.  Let us capitalise on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-12a.237" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1622" speakername="Verona Murphy" time="15:17:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022101200040#SS00300"><p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on what I would consider to be a very important Bill.  In my years as president of the Irish Road Haulage Association, I saw first-hand how many times the work permit situation caused major problems for companies when it came to hiring staff, particularly heavy goods vehicle, HGV, drivers.  If we take the example of a driver from South Africa looking to take up employment in Ireland, one of the first steps would be to verify their licence with the Road Safety Authority.  That is before they would even be given a work permit.  The process is currently taking about nine months.  If a haulage company recruits a driver who wants to come to work in Ireland and contribute to keeping the Irish economy moving smoothly, by the time the company can actually give the go-ahead, the driver will have found work somewhere else, in a country that does not have the same cumbersome system we do.  I am not sure if this Bill will help that situation in any way but the Minister of State is aware of the issue now.  I have written to him and I received a response only today.  I also wrote to the Department of Transport.  I was not happy at all with the response I received but we can take that up again.</p>  <p>  It is very important that systems run smoothly to deal with genuine people, as my colleague, Deputy Canney, said.  Their purpose is to come here to work, to contribute positively to our economy and support their families while supporting our economy and our businesses.  There is a problem that exists in abundance in the health service.  Every time I have had the opportunity to question HSE officials about the lack of services, a common answer is to point to the issues in recruitment and retention.  We need to ask ourselves why we have these issues in recruitment and what steps we are taking to solve those issues.  One obvious step is to train enough people here and pay them well enough to stay.  We have a ludicrous situation within the HSE whereby we offer up to &euro;4,000 for emigrant Irish nationals to return home and work in the health service.</p> <p>Why can we not offer the &euro;4,000 to those who are leaving and do exit interviews to ask why they are leaving?  Currently, we do not do that.</p> <p> I could included everything my colleague, Deputy Canney, said in my speech.  I could have written his speech.  The reality is that every sector and business is finding it difficult to get people to work.  I had a call yesterday from a very distressed employer who received eight CVs from Irish citizens.  Given the gaps between employments outlined in those CVs, he identified that they were probably from individuals who are on some form of social welfare.  He arranged six interviews and not one person turned up.  How long are we going to say that we are at full employment in circumstances where people just do not turn up for interviews?  Perhaps the people involved got other jobs.  I am casting no aspersions.  The frustration for the employer is that he cannot afford to operate the permit system apart from the fact that none of the criteria relating to the employment his is offering match the eligibility criteria relating to permits.  We must look at where we are going with the economy.  We should be training our own people.  We have almost &euro;1 billion sitting in the national training fund earning nothing, although it might earn something in the next couple of weeks due to interest rates.  The reality is that almost &euro;1 billion is sitting in this fund and employers are still contributing to it.  We need to catch up, and I do not mean just with regard to the permits system.  We need to catch in the context of the apprenticeship system.  We need to train people who will be actively available to us on our own soil and who are prepared to live here.</p> <p> Work permits are arduous.  They cost a lot of money.  They are given for a year or for a maximum of two years in some cases.  The eligibility criteria relate to every sector.  We cannot depend on the lists available to us.  I will talk about what I know, namely, HGV drivers.  We can choose drivers from four countries, three of which make no sense - Japan, South Korea and Australia.  If we could pay what the Australians pay their drivers, we would be doing very well.  I doubt they will come here to work for us.  In the same vein, Japan and South Korea are not really the recruitment areas we are looking for.  The Minister of State has been asked to expand it to the Philippines and Argentina because we have been at it for some years in South Africa and that market is almost exhausted.  The reality is that when you look at what we are hearing today from the National Car Testing Service in the context of having cars tested for roadworthiness, it is able to bring workers from Spain and the Philippines.  We need to go and market Ireland as a place to come and work.</p> <p> The other significant factor in attracting people is having houses for them to live in.  We are really behind on two counts.  We are at full employment but are doing nothing to further attract employees.  We have not broadened the eligibility criteria and the sectors that are eligible to come into the work permits scheme and we are not building houses for them to live in when they do get here.  I would be pretty concerned as to how the economy is going to function without a workforce in the same way as I am concerned about small and medium enterprises that are receiving CVs and making arrangements for interviews but are getting nothing back or having invitations for interviews accepted and then nobody turns up.  How are we policing our own social welfare system?  If we are saying that every sector needs employees, the reality is that we must work together.  If we are at full employment, we cannot wait.  We must do it now.</p> <p> All sectors say that the system is too slow.  I wrote to the Minister of State about a migrant worker who was here as an asylum seeker.  She was based in Offaly and got a job in a nursing home in Wexford.  She took two buses to get to that job and there was one simple request.  The request was that international protection accommodation services, IPAS, would find accommodation in Wexford in order that she could continue in employment.  No effort, and I mean no effort, was made to that so not only are we accommodating people in a way that is costing the economy money, we are not prepared to accommodate the businesses that can offer them jobs.  That is the issue.  I cannot understand how we do not make every effort to allow these people to avail of our jobs and us to avail of their employment.  It makes no sense.  I have heard nothing from the Minister of State in that regard.</p></speech>

It is a ridiculous scenario.  Inevitably, this nurse had to give up the job in Wexford.  There was no job available to her that she could reach by means of public transport in Offaly, which is a sad state of affairs.  We are not prepared to accommodate those who are here but we are prepared to give work permits to those who are not here.  The system is not working.  I ask that we concentrate on making jobs and permits available and assisting those who are here.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-12a.251" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1598" speakername="Fergus O'Dowd" time="15:27:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022101200041#TT01400"><p>I reiterate what the previous speaker said, namely, that we need to do an awful lot more in terms of people who are qualified to take up vacant posts in our country and who are living here regardless of whether they are asylum seekers or something else.  If they are at all suitable and the need is there and if it is an unmet need in local employment terms, we should make sure those people can get their permits and work here.</p>  <p>  I welcome the excellent job the Minister of State is doing, the changes he is making and the changes he proposes to make.  Time and again in my office and, I am sure, in the Minister of State's office, we see families qualified for home care help.  The money is available.  There is no issue providing money for home care, but there is nobody to do the work.  As a result, a person who has significant unmet medical needs, who wants to live at home and whose family wants them to live at home ends up in a nursing home.  There are many people who either do not need or do not want to be in nursing homes.  Home care is the direction in which this society is moving.  I met representatives from Home Instead recently.  They informed me about something like 6,000 vacancies nationally for home carers, which is a huge number.</p>  <p>  We saw the controversy about the Ukrainians and the asylum seekers in Killarney.  I agree with the Government opting to reverse the decision to move those mothers and children out and put men in their place.  The latter just did not make sense.  I wonder how many of those men would be suited to, capable of and want to fill the vacancies that are there.  In response to a question from Deputy Shortall in May, the Minister of State indicated that he had removed a number of healthcare occupations from the ineligible occupation list.  I did not hear him speak because I was elsewhere.  I know it is his intention - if it has not already happened - to lift the ban on other people coming in.  As our country changes, we must grasp the opportunities that exist.  If people are here and are capable of and want to do the work, we must let them.  This is the core of it.</p>  <p>  The other point is that we must pay people for the work they do.  Looking at all the media coverage and reports regarding the appalling incidence of Covid and the thousands of people who died here - hundreds of thousands died around the world - people gave their lives.  Some home care assistants and healthcare workers died serving and looking after those people.  If we had sufficient and adequate home care, many of those people might not have ended up in the places they were in.</p> <p>The evidence is clear that people who lived and were looked after in their homes generally had a better health outcome than those who died in nursing homes and other institutions.</p> <p> It is strong and it needs to happen.  The vacancies are there.  We need to pay them appropriately but let us make sure asylum seekers who fit the bill can get jobs and our residents, particularly older people, can stay in their homes and be looked after for a longer period of time.</p></speech>

I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  Yesterday I chaired an important meeting of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Environment and Climate Action.  Senior officials from the SEAI were at the committee to discuss the progress they are making and the challenges they face in carrying out their ambitious task of overseeing the upgrading of 500,000 homes to B2 standard by 2030.  The policy and plan are clear and SEAI is moving strongly in the right direction, but the officials pointed out their ability to deliver was somewhat constrained by the fact that our economy is at full employment and the labour market faces shortages.  I do not want to single out SEAI because this challenge faces all sectors, not just the retrofitting sector.</p>  <p>  As a Government and Oireachtas we have set ourselves the monumental task of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2030, based on 2018 levels.  I will not say it is easy to set targets, but it is certainly more difficult to plot the path to achieving them and more difficult still to stay on that path.</p>  <p>  The offshore wind challenge vies with the retrofitting one as being the largest infrastructure project in the history of the State.  We have brought in special framework legislation and set up new State agencies to oversee Ireland becoming a net exporter of energy.  That will be a total change from our current status, where we import more than 90% of our total energy.  We will need thousands of planners, ecologists, engineers, technologists, administration staff and human resources personnel for his sector.  We need to train our citizens and develop a workforce that matches the needs of our rapidly changing economy and society but, being at full employment, we have to look overseas and enable the people with the skills we need to come here and help us achieve our critically important objective.  The skills we need are in short supply across Europe because we are not the only ones embarking on a radical and necessary transition.</p>  <p>  We have to be creative in how we attract people to this country.  Ireland is an attractive country to come to for many reasons.  I do not need to go into those because we are well aware of them.  However, we have to remove the unnecessary barriers.  I will not repeat the points that have been ably made by colleagues across the House but I do not think it has been mentioned that it is not as simple as inviting people over and giving them work visas.  New workers will bring new families and they have a major demographic impact.  In the last five years, the population of Ireland has increased by about 10%, and that is beyond the projected increases of Project Ireland 2040, the national planning framework.  It has put immense pressure on our ability to house people and provide adequate health, education, childcare, public transport and other services.  These new people coming to Ireland will put further pressure on those services, which are at breaking point.</p></speech>

We have a huge issue.  We are known as Ireland of the thousand welcomes or c&eacute;ad m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte and we just welcomed visitors from the Gambian Parliament here a few minutes ago but we have a huge problem with delays in employment permits.  I do not understand the reasons.  We never get the reasons.  I know of one person who has worked here, has a partner here and wants to come here to work, and it is going on for nearly four years.  That partner is a brilliant, hard-working, dedicated man and he has come to the conclusion that he will try to reverse and go the other way.  He is a skilled HGV driver who works 19 or 20 hours per day in the milk season and will be a huge loss to his employer, community and, above all, his elderly mother, family and friends.  It is a huge change for him to move so far from his native shore.</p>  <p>  I have come from a committee where we discussed the hospitality industry.  I condemn out of hand any practices whereby workers who come here work extortionate hours and do not get proper rates of pay.  We must not have any truck with that.  We have to have checks and balances but the hospitality industry is on its knees.  They tell us we are at full employment.  I do not believe we are but those are the statistics regurgitated out to us every day.  It is difficult to know.  </p>  <p>  That industry has been lobbying the Minister of State and us.  I heard criticism earlier of a former colleague of the Minister of State who has become a lobbyist.  There should be some distance from Members of this House as well as the public service, including county councillors and senior officials.  When they leave, there should be time before they take up any lobbying position.</p>  <p>  Everyone knows about the hospitality industry but we must also deal with the extortionate rates that industry is charging in Dublin because it is damaging the brand of Ireland of a thousand welcomes and the work of F&aacute;ilte Ireland and all the good people in tourism.  My good colleague, Deputy Danny Healy-Rae, will not be happy with me but there are one or two, I believe, in Kerry as well that have huge rates.  It is giving a bad name to the whole brand.  In New York, they had a special rate for hotels compared to the rest of the country.  I believe we will have to do the same here.</p>  <p> Getting back to the issue at hand, farm and forestry contractors of Ireland are crying out for labour, as are the building industry and many industries, including horticulture and the poultry and pig sectors.  It is difficult and arduous for permits to be got.  The vast majority of employers are good, caring and responsible and they respect the workers.  While there is always one or two, that happens in every walk of life, unfortunately.  We must do something to make it easier.</p>  <p>  I am not saying we should have no checks and balances and let anybody and everybody in here.  I have a concern about the influx of people.  We saw the saga in Killarney and I am glad that is reversed for the moment.  I heard one of the Ukrainians this morning, a lady, who was delighted she was not moving that distance but she did not know where she was sleeping tonight.  That will resolve itself, I hope.  Apparently it is because one of the companies in Mayo will not take international refugees while they will take Ukrainians.  Are we picking and choosing?</p>  <p>  I was contacted during the week by a gentleman who said he had 3,500 places for Ukrainian people fleeing the war and was in a logjam.  I was contacted by one of the people in the chain of supplies he has.  I can give the Minister of State details.  It was an-chara liom in Tipperary town, a gentleman I will not name.  He has had his premises kitted out at a fair amount of expense, is ready and waiting and has not heard a dickeybird, n&iacute;l aon pingin amh&aacute;in, and has not had a penny.  He entered into this in good faith to deal with the situation, as the Government had asked, and did up his premises, but he has not seen anybody come and has no idea.  I am alarmed to think a company, or a man, a gentleman or whatever- I did not speak to him; it was my office - has 3,500 places in the middle of a housing crisis for so many people.  I do not know what is going on.  I am bewildered as to how this is happening but if that man is a co-ordinator or whatever we call him and can pick up those kind of places, how come the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage and the Minister of State, who is in that section as well, cannot get their hands on these places?  There is something wrong.  Is the money so lucrative for the other?  There are question marks.  We need to deal with it but we need to be sensitive and to understand contractors are in a bad way for staff.  Many contractors have been forced out of business this year - I know a half dozen in south Tipperary - because of the price of fuel, the cost of insurance and the lack of support.</p> <p>Yet for some reason the Minister has refused to meet the farm contractors of Ireland.  I appeal to the Minister of State to be more understanding and sensitive.</p></speech>

Work permits come up all the time.  Last week, a plaster was on to me looking to get a plasterer in from another country.  He has been held up all year.  He went through all the hoops.  He had to advertise in the local paper and had to do so a second time.  He had to contact social welfare in writing so many times.  It costs more than &euro;2,000.  The system needs to be streamlined.  In these scenarios, whether it is a worker in construction, hospitality or farming or drivers, excavator drivers or lorry drivers, they can have all the accreditations, tickets and so on but you do not really know until they arrive whether they are suitable or not and whether they will they work out.  There should be some sort of a temporary certificate or permit that you could get for three months or so to see how they work out.  After all, it costs more than &euro;2,000 and takes an awful lot of work.  There are about four Departments involved with which you have to make contact to get a person through.  At different times over the last couple of weeks, I have raised the possibility of training Ukrainian women to do home help.  We have a dire need for home help workers in Kerry.  Elderly people have been allocated so many home help hours by the HSE but no one turns up because we are told it does not have the staff.  It would be ideal if those women could be trained, including those who have cars and those who have English.  They have to be English speaking to deal with elderly people.</p>  <p>  The system we have is too intricate for small employers.  It may be all right for professionals, doctors and so on, their CVs will stand for themselves, but it is not enough if you employ a driver who will say he drove this and that.  He may have tickets for it but when he arrives he may not be able to drive a pram.  The &euro;2,000 cost and the amount of red tape involved is too much for many of the people I have talked about.  I ask the Minister of State to streamline it in some way so that it would be possible to get in workers on a temporary basis.</p>  <p>  The story in Killarney has been mention where 193 asylum seekers arrived a number of days ago.  They arrive at the Quality Hotel on the Park Road in Killarney where there was already 135 Ukrainian women and their children, many of whom had settled and integrated into the town.  They were working in hotels and the children had been bought school uniforms and were at school but they were given 48 hours to leave the hotel and go to Westport.  We saw the Government at its best, playing politics with these poor people in this unfortunate situation.  The Government accepted the 193 men and directed them to the Quality Hotel in Killarney where there was already 134 women and children.  Then we had Deputy Griffin, the deputy Government Chief Whip, challenging the Government of which he himself is part for bringing them to Killarney.  Last evening, the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, said there was no going back and that the Ukrainian women and children would have to leave Killarney and go to Westport even though the children had got their school uniforms and were integrated into the community.  Then this morning, some time after 10 a.m., the Minister, Deputy Foley, announced that she had got the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, to allow the Ukrainian women to remain in Killarney even though I was made aware at 3 p.m. yesterday that they would be allowed to remain there.  The Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, said yesterday evening that there was no going back but then the Minister, Deputy Foley, came out this morning with an announcement, saying she was a great woman and had it all sorted out.  However the locals-----</p></speech>

I want to take the opportunity to thank the staff in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  I do not want to single out anyone but there is one specific lady who is outstanding in her job and bends over backwards in every way, shape and form to help us get permits for doctors, chefs and many others.  That lady is more than willing to help with any work permit that we have to make representations on.  Sometimes we forget to thank people who work in the Departments.  We maybe critical but you should call a spade a spade too.</p>  <p>  At the moment, I am dealing with a doctor in west Cork.  It is very annoying.  He has been working in Ireland for more than five weeks but he cannot get a PPS number.  While I am making representations for him, I find it hard to believe that in these times of technology and fast turnaround times that it can take so long to get a doctor a PPS number.  The man needs to get paid and without this number, he cannot be paid.  He feels his hands are tied and that if he does not get his PPS number soon, he will have to go back to his own country.  It is hard to believe when we can give out PPS numbers to people fleeing war-torn countries with no identification that we are having trouble getting a PPS number for a doctor.</p>  <p>  I know of another lady in west Cork who came here on a stamp zero.  She is a grandmother.  Her daughter came to Ireland years ago.  She married an Irish man and had children.  The grandmother has no brothers or sisters and no other family member in the country she is from.  She only has her daughter, her son-in-law and her grandchild in Ireland.  The problem is that when the family originally applied for her to come here, they had plenty of money themselves.  Now, because of Covid and other factors, they do not have the same amount of money available to them.  They are being told that this poor lady, the grandmother, may have to go back to the country she came from where she has no family.  Her family is here and she should be able to stay at least on compassionate grounds.  There are a lot of issues like that where small frivolous reasons mean a person has to return even though they may be elderly and their nearest relatives are in Ireland.</p>  <p>  There is also another man in west Cork who came to Ireland to work.  He was working for an employer who applied for a work permit but he did not like the job.  That can happen.  He is a human being.  When you apply for a job, you might not fall in love with it when you get it.  He has the opportunity to move to another job.  That should be facilitated in some way.  I know it is difficult to strike a fair balance but unfortunately he was not allowed to do so.  I know of a restaurant in west Cork, which is waiting for work permits for two chefs but the hoops they have to jump through are enormous and the waiting period before they can apply is ridiculous.  I appreciate that we get a lot of help through the Minister of State's office to sort out a lot of issues.  This is a huge issue in west Cork, especially during the tourism season.  I look forward to working with the Minister of State to make sure these people get the opportunity to stay.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-12a.261" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1499" speakername="Richard O'Donoghue" time="15:47:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022101200043#VV00700"><p>The labour supply is a huge issue in the agricultural and equine sectors.  The pig and dairy industry are heavily reliant on labour.  That is especially so in spring for dairy and throughout the year in the pig industry.  Work permits are critical to the survival of the industry and also for the mental health of farmers who are trying desperately to keep in line with climate change and ensure the viability of their farms and piggeries.</p> <p>I cannot stress enough the urgency of addressing the labour shortage.  Does the Minister of State have any idea of the cumbersomeness and clunky nature of the process of applying for work permits for farm workers?  A non-refundable charge of &euro;1,000 is payable upfront and several advertisements must also be published in the local newspapers.  Accommodation must also be provided to give a net income of &euro;30,000.  Shortages of labour for next spring stand at 500.  This is not just about having an extra pair of hands but the survival of farms.  In addition, there are continued charges to the immigration department.<br/><br/>Equally, it seems farmers must pay higher wages than the meat industry.  That industry pays &euro;22,000 annually for non-EU workers, while the farming industry pays &euro;30,000, and more if farmers are using an agency.  If the dairy, pig and equine sectors are to continue to expand and to contribute to the rural economy, someone will have to take charge and get this process up and running.  Otherwise, there will be severe consequences.  Examples would include impacts in the areas of the mental health of farm families and animal welfare.  The equine industry is at its wits' end trying to get workers.  It seems the most appropriate location for advertisements for roles in that industry is<i>The Irish Field</i>, which is not considered to be an Irish publication and, therefore, cannot be used for the placing of advertisements.  Could this application process be made any more difficult?  <br/><br/>Currently, 2,181 applicants are waiting for permits.  This covers the farming and pig industry, as I said, as well as the hospitality, haulage and construction sectors.  I reiterate that 2,181 people are waiting for permits.  Yet people are arriving here with no paperwork, because of the circumstances they are coming from, and we are providing them with refuge, which this is 100% right.  Last week, I raised the issue of a large influx of men being brought into a town near us where women and children were already being housed.  The same thing has now happened in Killarney.  The Government has had to reverse this proposed action.  Therefore, the Government did not learn from the issue I brought up last week and this has now happened again in Killarney.  A total of 195 males were coming to that town.  The Government was going to move the women and children out of a hotel.  Again, there must be a small bit of cop-on.  <br/><br/>The Government is not learning from its mistakes.  It is not listening to the people on the ground.  I have been in construction all my life and thank God I still am.  Hopefully, my family will be able to continue in the business in future.  Many people here who are in the farming sector and other sectors might not be as lucky because of the difficulty of being able to get people to help on farms and elsewhere.  Why is this?  Every time there is a change of Government, the regulations change for farming.  It does not matter if we are talking about pig, dairy or beef farmers.  The regulations change.  These are the only sectors where the regulations are changed every few years by a city-led Government which has no understanding of rural living.  The members of the Government understand it when they are sitting around the table and eating.  They understand it when they go into a hotel and buy food but they have no understanding of how the food gets there.  Therefore, this industry suffers every time under new Governments.  This must change, as must city-based Governments and Cabinets.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-12a.263" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1549" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="15:57:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022101200044#WW00200"><p>Having 258,000 more people at work than before Covid-19 struck is an extraordinary achievement by the Government.  This has brought prosperity to every region.  We have record levels of work permits being issued and record levels of inward migration, with 92,000 people, gross, last year, or a net 60,000.  The Minister and his Department have handled that huge surge well, despite the emerging pressures.</p>  <p>  We must, however, take a more strategic approach to managing migration.  I say this based, essentially, on two grounds.  First, as a mature, high-value economy, we want to ensure high standards of workers' rights.  In that regard, we are bringing in measures such as auto-enrolment, parental leave, sick pay, a living wage and remote working entitlements.  This means we are strengthening the position of workers, as we should do.  It also means, of course, that we should take the same attitude towards migrant workers and ensure they also enjoy good working conditions.  I worry that the way in which our system has grown in recent years means it has tended to treat migrant workers in ways that are quite discriminatory.  We have not given those who are approved for general work applications the same rights to move away from their first employer and to work with others.  We have also not given those workers the same rights for their families to join them.  I point this aspect out because, by and large, these are people who are making a long-term commitment to Ireland to work in sectors like farming and healthcare.  We must move away from issuing permits linked to employers in this rigid way and give people who have come here and who are accepted better access to the labour market, faster family permits and more support to ensure they are properly integrated.</p>  <p>  Second, we are facing severe infrastructural deficits.  We run the risk that reactionary political pressures will grow in respect of the rightful decisions we are taking to accommodate people fleeing violence in Ukraine and to accommodate the growing needs in this regard.  We must, therefore, ensure that our approach focuses on infrastructural deficits.  I fear some sectors are continuing to rely on migrant workers when they should have moved to develop the sort of apprenticeship and training models that would give them permanent support within their own sectors rather than continuing to depend on migration.  We must focus the contributions of migrant workers in areas where we face particular challenges, such as in retrofitting and in building to address the housing crisis.  Equally, this must also happen in the sectors identified by the high-level group on skills: artificial intelligence design, zero carbon housing, etc.  These are very important.  Therefore, we must move to a more strategic approach in this area.  It must be one that looks beyond narrow supply and demand factors and considers the wider economic context to ensure we protect the sustainability of our economy.  </p></speech>

Over the last year, I have made many representations to him and his team in the Department on behalf of employers concerning employment permits.  This legislation is before us because of the Minister of State's determination to modernise the system.  This includes not only reforming it but also streamlining the process, which is welcome.  In fairness to the Minister of State and his Department, turnaround times for processing applications have reduced in recent months.  This is significant, especially when the number of applications in hand has increased by 50%.</p>  <p>  Many employers, however, still find the process of applying for work permits frustrating, with applications taking far too long to process.  As part of the reforms being introduced, I ask the Minister of State to establish a new website, similar to one deployed by the Passport Office, where applicants can monitor the progress of their applications.  I strongly believe that posting videos on such a website to advise people on how to apply for work permits and identifying the common issues which lead to unsuccessful applications would be advantageous.  Employers who contact me often complain they cannot get any feedback from officials once an application is lodged.  This must also change.  </p>  <p>  I looked at the critical skills occupation list and the list of ineligible occupations and I will give one example in this regard.  The Clare Youth Service contacted me this week.  It wishes to employ a person and it has advertised the post for the last several months.  It cannot get anyone.  Youth and community work, however, is on the ineligible list of occupations and, therefore, it is not possible to secure a work permit for someone to undertake this role.  I ask the Minister of State to examine this issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-12a.265" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1523" speakername="Colm Burke" time="15:57:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022101200044#WW00400"><p>I welcome the Bill.</p> <p>It is extremely timely.  In particular when there is a significant growth in jobs in this country, it is important that we have people who are able to fill the jobs.  An amazing change has occurred in the past ten years in terms of the unemployment levels coming down and employers now finding that there is a shortage of workers, and therefore we must respond accordingly.  It is important as well that we provide protection for people who were born here, who have gone through the education process and who have qualifications.  It is appropriate that the Bill provides full protection for Irish people in the jobs market as well, and that people are not exploited.  There is an interesting change in the Central Statistics Office, CSO, figures, which show that more than 700,000 people are living in this country who were not born here.  That is a big change.</p> <p> Regarding permits, it is important that there is flexibility as well.  I have come across a number of people who have come here on a work permit, who have gone back to further education and got additional qualifications but they find it difficult to move on to jobs that are vacant that they want to fill.  There are many difficulties with that.  We must have flexibility with work permits to ensure mechanisms are in place to accommodate people who have made the effort to further advance their situation and in order that we can protect people.</p> <p> One issue I wish to raise concerns agency contracts.  It is important that we do not have any abuse or misuse of that system.  While we need flexibility, it is important that we have protection for workers at all times.  It is extremely important that we do not have a scenario where a lot of money is being paid to agencies for people to be able to get employment and then deductions are made from the workers.  It is important also that we provide safety mechanisms and protection, even if we do allow some change in how agencies bring people here.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-12a.267" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1518" speakername="Michael McNamara" time="16:07:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022101200045#XX00200"><p>I agree with some of the previous speakers from Fine Gael, in particular Deputies Colm Burke and Bruton.  Given that Deputy Bruton was a Minister in the Department I urge the Minister of State to listen carefully to what he had to say.  We are introducing seasonal work permits.  People are coming here to pick a commodity but we must be very careful that they do not become a commodity or that they are not treated like a commodity because they are human beings with inalienable rights.  According to the Judaeo-Christian philosophy behind the Constitution, they are made in the image and likeness of God, but that is certainly not how they are treated by Irish bureaucracy and Departments.  While I very much welcome Deputy Bruton&rsquo;s presence during the debate and his contribution, I am disappointed that neither the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Deputy James Browne, nor the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, is present because there is a significant disconnect between the employment permit regime, as good or bad as it is and how the Department of Justice treats this issue.  I acknowledge that there have been improvements in the operation of the employment permit scheme in the past 12 months, in particular with the reactivation of the employment permit scheme, which is very important.  However, there is a disconnect between the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Department of Justice.  I want to give a couple of examples in the time available to me.</p><p>A number of criteria must be examined when the Minister for Justice is determining whether to issue a deportation order in respect to somebody who is here unlawfully.  One of the criteria we look at when determining whether it is in the best interests of the State to deport somebody is his or her employment prospects.  I have seen numerous decisions as a practitioner in the area of immigration where it was said that their employment prospects were poor because it is not lawful for them to work.  Of course their lawful employment prospects were poor if they could not lawfully work, but that is an incredibly circular argument.  It is one on which there is a certain divergence of case law in the courts.  A policy must be put in place to deal with the matter.  In a country of full employment, where somebody has demonstrated that he or she has offers of employment, how can an official in the Department of Justice say a person&rsquo;s employment prospects are poor because he or she cannot work in circumstances where the person has offers of work if the person could lawfully work?  It is not a criticism of the individual who is doing his or her job.  He or she is applying a version of the law but it seems to be State policy.  Even in a case where a person might have five different offers of work, often a deportation order is made in respect of the person.  I am not saying deportation orders do not have to be made in certain instances.  There are other criteria, as there should be, in determining whether a deportation order is made, but the sort of bland assertion that the employment prospects of anybody who is not here lawfully are poor is contrary to common sense at a time of full employment when we have heard numerous examples across the floor where people simply cannot get somebody to work.  That is something that must be examined.</p><p>A person&rsquo;s good character is looked at in a citizenship application.  In the case of Martins <i>v</i>. the Minister for Justice and Equality, Mr. Justice David Keane found that the fact somebody had worked unlawfully led to him deciding that he was of bad character.  The person was here for several years and had a PPS number.  He paid tax throughout his life in Ireland.  The decision was based on the fact that the person was breaking the law of the State.  I want to be very clear that this is not a criticism of Mr. Justice Keane&rsquo;s judgment in any way.  The judge is there to determine what the law of the land is and to apply it.  If we do not like the law of the land, then it is our job to change it.  Mr. Martins came here as a minor to join his parents who had a work permit.  He entered employment and worked for a very long period but was found to be of bad character because he was working unlawfully in the State.  There was very little prospect for him to work lawfully in the State or to apply for a permit because, generally, once a person is unlawfully in the State, whether he or she comes on a tourist visa or otherwise, one cannot apply for an employment permit.  I understand the reasons the Department of Justice does not want that, although the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment might be less concerned as it is not within the Department&rsquo;s remit.  The Department does not want to incentivise people to come here and then apply, it wants people to arrive at the frontiers of the State with an employment permit.  Even at that, there are cases currently before the courts where the Department has granted an employment permit for somebody on the basis of the need for workers in a particular area, and it is happy a person has fulfilled the criteria for working in the area, but when a person applies for a visa to come to the State because he or she is not from a visa-exempt country, the Department of Justice states it does not believe the person has the skills necessary to fill the job.  I do not know what training and skills the officials in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment have in determining first, that there is a necessity to bring in employees in a particular area or somebody&rsquo;s suitability for a job, but whatever training they have to so do, I would have thought it was closer to the central remit of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, rather than the Department of Justice, yet the latter can turn around and say that it is interesting that a person has an employment permit but it does not think the person fulfils the criteria and he or she will not be given a visa.  The employer and the employee have gone through the rigmarole of getting the work permit, only for someone in the Department of Justice to say he or she does not think the person is suitably qualified.</p> <p>There is always going to be a degree of subjectivity, but how suitably qualified does a person have to be?  In a time of critical need and shortages in the workforce, I am sure employers are employing people they wish were a little better qualified.  They might have some qualifications and be able to be trained up but it seems the Department of Justice does not like that approach.  That has also been challenged before the courts and upheld in a number of judgments because the courts, including under Mr. Justice David Keane and in more recent cases, have found that two completely different statutory regimes are in place and that it is for the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to determine the work permit issue and for the Department of Justice to determine the other one.  There have been judgments suggesting that if the Legislature does not like that, it can, of course, amend that.</p> <p> I do not like that idea; it is incredibly bureaucratic and it is a huge waste of resources in both Departments.  Perhaps more important, it is a waste of the resources in that potential employee's life and in his or her employer's life because, as far as they are both concerned, one of them is going to work and the other has a worker and then suddenly they are told that is not the case.  I ask the Minister of State to consider this.  I appreciate he cannot bring in legislation amending something within the remit of the Department of Justice but he might pick up the phone and see whether all these anomalies can be sorted out because they are a blockage.</p> <p> Moreover, we have a big problem attracting foreign doctors.  I appreciate that the Minister for Health has done something about this, given they could not get on trainee schemes because they were not from Ireland or even the European Economic Area, so they did not qualify for training schemes to advance their careers.  Generally, there is a predictable career progression for doctors and they want to stay on that path so, naturally, they do not stay in Ireland.  That is being sorted out but there is also the issue of their family members.  I recall when I was previously a Deputy, between 2011 and 2016, dealing with the case of a doctor who eventually asked why on Earth he would stay here with this nonsense and try to get his wife and children in here while he was working in our quite crappy healthcare system.  He admitted he might be getting well paid for it but he had no prospects of career advancement, he could not get his family here and he could not advance his life.</p> <p> This is with regard not just to doctors but to any worker who comes here.  People are more than workers; they are human beings with a life and we need to acknowledge that.  People's life circumstances change.  How many Irish people have left Ireland to go on holidays and ended up happily married in another country, with a life, years thereafter?  Likewise, how many people have come to Ireland and ended up married, with a life, years thereafter?  Some, however, have a very different life from that of others, and that is largely determined by an accident of birth.  If they were born in the European Economic Area or they hold a purple passport, they will get on fine.  If they are American, we will generally treat them okay because we would like the US to treat us okay, but if they are Asian, South American or African, the hurdles they will encounter as they try to develop a life here are a different story.  They are all human beings who deserve the opportunity.  They are not commodities, even if they might be here to pick a commodity in the case of seasonal workers.</p> <p> I am concerned about the seasonal workers aspect of the legislation, which needs to be teased out more.  There is already a differentiation between general work permit holders and critical skills work permit holders in the right to bring in family members and I wonder how justifiable that is.  Would it be found to be discriminatory under the European Convention on Human Rights?  I do not know.  It might not be; who knows?  In any event, I do not think that discrimination should exist.  Are we to introduce a further tier of discrimination?  If a seasonal worker here ends up overstaying his or her permit - I presume a person&rsquo;s visa will be linked to his or her permit - will he or she be able to avail of the reactivation scheme, which I have welcomed for specific reasons I will come to presently?  Will such a seasonal worker be able to avail, or apply for, a general work permit while being a seasonal worker or thereafter?  These are important considerations.  It seems to be fundamentally wrong to bring somebody across the world and into the State and then to say they are just here to pick apples.  I have been talking about fruit workers, although there is not a huge horticultural sector in Ireland.  Nevertheless, it came very much to the fore earlier during Covid, when there was general uproar that people would be coming here to pick fruit for us to eat.  I just never understood it.  The people who brought them in, rather than allow the fruit to rot into the ground, were vilified in the media and in certain sections of this Parliament, and to this day I do not understand that.  Seasonal workers are not just people who will pick fruit; it is far broader than that.</p> <p> Each and every one of them is a human being.  Life goes on for all of them, as it does for us, and we cannot deprive people of the opportunity to move forward and develop a life.  Sometimes within the Department of Justice there is almost a paranoia whereby before we know it, these people will be having kids and will have a right to stay under the Zambrano case or something like that, but people move on with their lives and have children and our laws need to acknowledge and facilitate that, rather than, as some are prone to do, cast them into the shadows of society.  Doing that is dangerous and I do not think is not beneficial.  From a societal perspective, it is damaging, but also from an economic perspective.  People who want to work should be allowed to do so, people with something to contribute to our society should be able to do so and people who have something to contribute to our economy should be able to do that.</p> <p> Even so, the system has improved, not least with the reactivation scheme.  I recall asking the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, a parliamentary question once about an issue in my constituency.  Deputy Carey was in the Chamber earlier and he, like me, will be aware there is a large Brazilian community in Gort.  Most of them came here to work in a meat plant, the meat plant shut and many of them found themselves in precarious, if not unlawful, employment.  Many of them are renowned for how hard they work, yet some of them are horrendously exploited, including by farmers, I might add as a farmer from Clare who, in the long-distant past, has sometimes employed them.  It is next to impossible to get workers as a farmer but I paid them, which was the least I could do after the work they did, even if it was not for very much.  It is common for farmers to have to resort to that, although the phrase "have to resort" makes it sound as though farmers are almost dirtying themselves by giving work to people who want to work, but that is not how it should be.  In any event, there was a firm that wanted to employ people and because these workers were already in Ireland, some of them for most of their adult lives, it could not employ them.  They did not hold work permits at the time and were not lawfully in the State, even though they had been here for most of their adult lives.  At least the reactivation scheme goes some way in that regard because, where such workers have ever held a valid work permit, it seems that if they apply under the reactivation scheme, they can have it reactivated.  I welcome that, but we need to be clear that other categories, and at the very least seasonal workers, will be able to avail of it.  If not, what we are doing, I regret to say, is just treating them in the same way as the commodity they are here to harvest, and that is unacceptable, although I do not want to be negative and I acknowledge the advances that have been made.</p> <p> When we talk about exploitation, the Covid pandemic shone a light into many crevices in Irish society, one of which related to the exploitation of people who hold a work permit tied to their employer, in particular in the meat sector.  I am sure the phenomenon of a person being exploited because his or her work permit is tied to a particular employer is not unique to the meat sector but it certainly became very apparent there, as did the appalling work conditions of some of those workers as well as their appalling living conditions.  For many of them, it was all perfectly lawful because they were agency workers.  Like most Deputies, I think our economy needs people to come and work.</p> <p>Indeed, our economy needs more people to come and work but no economy can sustain itself based on exploitation.  I worry that is the road we risk going down unless we fundamentally reform the work permit scheme, in conjunction with the Department of Justice, in a way that this Bill, in my view, does not fully do at the moment.  I invite the Minister of State to look at how it might be strengthened on Committee Stage, perhaps in conjunction with the Department of Justice.</p></speech>

First of all, I wholeheartedly welcome the announcement today that it has been signed off that fishers from outside the EU and the EEA will be able to avail of proper work permits.  It is something for which I advocated as soon as I came into this D&aacute;il.  I have to be grateful to the Minister of State, Deputy English, in this regard because I had brought it up in the D&aacute;il Chamber with him previously.  He promised me there would be movement on it and there has been.  I must also mention the efforts of the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, who met some of these non-EU workers when they came to the gates of Leinster House to state their case.  He listened and he has delivered.  The Minister of State, Deputy James Browne, also took a question in the D&aacute;il on this very issue and I know he pushed for it.  Fishing is also big in his constituency of Wexford.  The Minister, Deputy McEntee, is obviously the line Minister who brought this forward to get to where we are today.</p>  <p>  It is really welcome news for all those non-EU fishers who for years have not being on an equal footing with the same fishermen with whom they have worked alongside on boats.  They have not had the same rights.  They have had to go back and forth to their home countries in order to keep the old atypical system alive.  Sometimes, they have not been able to return to their families for the same reason.  It has caused nothing but hardship.  When the fishing sector protested in Cork city and Dublin, it did so on many issues, including quota share.  One of the main issues on which people protested, however, was the whole area of this atypical visa and the fact that it had to be scrapped and a new work permit introduced.  It is fantastic to start with that very welcome news.  I am so proud that it was announced today.</p>  <p>  This Bill includes efforts to speed up the whole process from start to finish in terms of permits being allocated and granted.  I really hope this legislation improves the situation in the hospitality sector for restaurants and chefs and for cafes and hotels.  Businesses are in this constant battle where they cannot get chefs or workers in the domestic market.  They have to go abroad.  It is really important that this Bill provides that function and expedites those permits.</p>  <p>  I could say the same for the trucking sector.  I have received calls as recently as this week about truck drivers who are going through that same arduous, slow process when they apply for work permits to work here.  It is a big issue.  There is a shortage of drivers.  We know the importance of having a good haulage system in place in terms of the speed of delivery of goods and products.  I really hope this legislation also addresses that.</p>  <p>  My final point is on the critical skills list.  There are workers who I believe should be placed on the critical skills list because of the importance of the service they provide, namely, those who work in nursing homes.  There are nursing homes right throughout Ireland, particularly in my constituency, where there is a significant demand for the service but the staff are not available domestically.  There is a shortage of  staff so they cannot provide the service.  They are not able to fill the beds in these homes and that is a big issue.  There is a way that can be addressed.  I am not sure how flexible the critical skills list is or how quickly additional sectors can be added to that, but I would really advocate for nursing home staff to be included on the critical skills list.  It is really important.  They provide an important service.  I would like to see that happen</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-12a.274" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1487" speakername="Michael Healy-Rae" time="16:27:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022101200047#ZZ00600"><p>The purpose of this Bill is to consolidate and update the legislative provisions that regulate the employment permit system, namely, the Employment Permits Acts of 2003 and 2006.  The conclusions of the Review of Economic Migration Policy of 2018 endorsed the robust fundamental structures of the existing system to increase its responsiveness, modernise it and ensure that it is capable of adapting to the changing needs the labour market of the future.  The review obviously then recommended that new legislation be initiated.</p>  <p>  Coming from County Kerry and dealing with an awful lot of employers, whether they are involved in the hotel and hospitality, construction or haulage sectors, fishing, farming, forestry, horticulture, spas, or whether they are agricultural contractors, hairdressers, barbers and beauticians, one thing that comes up on a continuous basis is the awkwardness and contrariness of the procedures involved in trying to get work permits for wonderful people who want to come here to work and earn their living.  They want to make this their home and get on with their lives and they have chosen Ireland to do that.</p>  <p>  Now, more than ever, with our increasing population and the way Ireland is evolving, please God and fingers crossed we can keep things going from an employment point of view and keep jobs in this country.  When people want to come here, I always say we have to try to make it as easy and streamlined as possible for them to do so.  However, the big thing is not just to come here but to work here.  What comes up repeatedly is that people always say the Irish were welcomed when we went to England, America and Australia.  Of course we were welcomed; we worked.  Our brothers, sisters, uncles, aunts, parents and grandparents went and worked.  They did not go and get anything for nothing.  They built London and New York.  They went down to Sydney and all over the world and everywhere they went, they left the mark of their hand.  They left the sweat from their brow and broke their backs working, in many cases.  However, they were very glad of that opportunity.  I want to see us give other people that same opportunity.</p>  <p>  We are not a State with endless money.  We are not digging gold, oil or anything out of the ground.  We do not have endless resources.  Therefore, the only hope we have to survive in Ireland is work.  An awful lot of people in this D&aacute;il seem to have very little regard for work.  I hear people in here talking on a continuous basis about the four-day week.  The only reason they want a four-day week is because they could not clean their own heads, never mind anything else.  It is because they do not want to work themselves.  The example they want to set in the D&aacute;il is the sooner we have a four-day week, that is better for Ireland.  It is not.  We all want work.  We want as much work as possible.  Work in itself creates more work.  We have people involved in all those industries I highlighted to the Minister of State and they want workers to come here.  When I say to the Minister of State that we are fortunate enough that people in other countries want to come here, I look on that as us being fortunate that they chose Ireland.  They will come here and raise their families, work, earn money, pay tax and help our economy to grow.  We must do an awful lot of things to allow all that to happen, however.  The changes proposed in the Bill will give effect to those recommendations while retaining the key policy focus of supporting the economy and labour market through evidence-based decision-making.</p> <p>Again I would ask the Minister of State to make it easier to get these work permits.</p> <p> The number of applications for employment permits for workers outside the European Economic Area has increased in 2022 and it has reached a record high in the past 13 years.  Data published by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment showed that from the beginning of January to the end of August 2022 a total of 27,653 permits have been issued to foreign workers, while another 2,210 have been refused and 1,466 have been rejected.  However, this year's figures show a staggering almost 250% jump in the number of permits awarded in the same periods in 2020 and 2019.  I mention the eligibility criteria to get these permits.  There are something like seven or eight criteria one has to fill and the general employment permits must have a minimum salary of &euro;30,000, based on a 39-hour week.  This can be difficult for employers to attain and we have to look again at the common-sense point of this.  If the people issuing the permits know that if these people come here there is a reliable and respectable employer willing to vouch for them and that he or she will have work for them, is that not all we want?</p> <p> That brings me to the fact that the vastly increasing numbers of people coming here to live will need to find places to stay.  The increase in people coming to Ireland on work permits alone will outstrip the number of projected new builds.  Similar demands will be placed on all other sectors, from transport to education and health.  Where will the 40,000 people who will obtain a work permit in Ireland in 2022 live?  That is a very important question.  Clearly they will drive up the demand for housing and the cost of renting and buying.  Are these factors being considered by Government?  To add to this, we also have the separate issue of the Ukrainian refugees, who are most welcome, coming here at the same time and we are struggling to house them.</p> <p> We heard about the situation in Killarney in recent days and I was glad to play my part in ensuring they got alternative accommodation.  These people had made a happy home away from home because they did not want to be here but now that they are here they settled extremely well.  Their children are going to school, they are learning the language, many of them have secured part-time work and they are involved in the services that were available in the Killarney area.  The principals, teachers and all the different professional people who were dealing with them were most upset when these families were told they would have to leave and go to County Mayo.  I have nothing against Mayo but if you have settled and made your home in Killarney - many of them have been there since last March - surely it was wrong and a bad decision to move them.  I am grateful to the people in the Department who secured other accommodation for them in Killarney and that they will not have to leave.  That was common sense and the system working as it should, for the betterment of people, and most particularly for the betterment of  innocent children who are here, not because they want to be, but because they have to be.</p> <p> The highest number of employment permits, a total of 7,608, were issued for information and communication activities, followed by a total of 6,609 permits issued to workers in health and social work activities.  On the nationality of employment permit holders, a large share, 10,171, were Indian nationals.  These were followed by: 3,322 Brazilians; 1,387 Filipinos; and 1,277 Pakistanis.  We have to look at the sectors that are still crying out for more workers.  We have to ask ourselves what we can do in this legislation to make it easier for employers who are suffering because of another issue that is happening.</p> <p> I do not know if people in the Government realise this, but in the past two weeks the mass exodus from Ireland to Australia and New Zealand was pointed out to me.  It is predominantly young boys and girls between the ages of 19 and 25.  The number leaving is staggering.  We have to encourage young people like that.  If they want to go, it is a free world and we wish them nothing but health, happiness and good luck in their journeys.  I know many of them personally and there were a couple of parties for them in recent weeks.  I am genuinely sorry to see them go, but I remind them that the planes go both ways and that we want them to come back again.  However, there is a difference between wanting to go and having to go.</p> <p> It does not make sense to lose nurses because they feel the careers that are available to them here are not as good as what they could achieve abroad from a monetary and work satisfaction point of view.  We all know the basket case the HSE is, to be blunt about it.  If 1 million people are waiting for procedures to be carried out in a country with our population that does not look good for the health service.  That is not a reflection on the people working in it but it is a reflection on the management of it.  I am just picking on that sector and if we lose a young nurse and he or she goes away to the other end of the world or somewhere like that, perhaps we are losing that next generation, including their children and grandchildren and they are gone from us, perhaps forever.  We should think of the parents and grandparents at home who would dearly love to see those people stay.  I want those work opportunities to be here for those people and I want the recompense they would get to be of the same benefit to them as they will get abroad.  We cannot do much about things like the weather but by God we can make working conditions for these people attractive to make them stay.</p> <p> A lot of those working in construction, agriculture, plant hire and so on are leaving.  Why is that?.  Whether we are in the Government or in the Opposition we all have a responsibility to take care of those people.  We cannot stop people going abroad to work if they want to go, but I do not want them to have to go.  For example, in the 1950s many of my aunts and uncles left because they simply had to go.  There was not &pound;1 to be made here and there was nothing here at the time.  When they went abroad they just worked and worked and that is how they got on.  That was a case of having to go but we want to try to make it attractive for the people who are here now.  I ask the Minister of State, the Minister for Health, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and all the different Ministers to wake up to the fact that we are losing thousands of people every week from this country.  This has been happening more in the past six months than was the case in the past six years and I would like the Minister of State to address that when he speaks later.  Does the Government realise that is happening?</p> <p> I would welcome anything that can be done in this legislation that would make it attractive for these people to come here, through all the different sectors I have outlined, and to make it as cost effective, streamlined and as attractive as possible for people to be welcomed into this country to work.  I would remind some Deputies, who seem to have a hang-up about work, that there is nothing wrong with wanting, looking for, needing, encouraging and creating work and employment.</p> <p>To be honest, what we are lacking at the moment is people to do some of those things.  We need to show a bit of leadership in this House.  I would love to put a ban on any Deputy standing up and talking rubbish about a four-day working week and how the sooner we get to it the better for everybody.  I do not use bad language but if I were anywhere else than here, the word I would use would be something along the lines of "balderdash".</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-12a.277" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1577" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="16:47:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022101200049#BBB00200"><p>I am last to speak but I hope not least.  I remind Deputy Michael Healy-Rae that not too long ago, the Government mantra, like that of other Governments before it, was to work towards a four-day week on the logic that we would be much happier and healthier and more effective and productive.  However, the mantra changes depending on the market.</p>  <p>  I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill, even though I am the final Deputy to do so.  I pay tribute to the Department and the library and research service for their work on it.  I will try to be as quick as I can and hope colleagues stay awake, but there is a lot to refer to on this subject.  I know what the Bill intends to do and, on one level, it is very positive.  Its provisions have been clearly set out by the Department in its briefing note and by the library and research service.  As noted by other speakers, the purpose of the Bill is to consolidate the existing legislation and make it more focused.  It also seeks to introduce a seasonal employment permit, which I will come back to with reference to the committee that looked into this; provide additional conditions for the granting of an employment permit, which I welcome; facilitate third-party subcontractors, which I am a little unsure about; provide for automatic indexation of salary thresholds, which is quite basic; and improve efficiency and provide flexibility.  All of this is very welcome.</p>  <p>  However, we must also consider these provisions in the context of what we are trying to do in this area, particularly in the context of the belated publication today by the Department of Justice of the report on an atypical working scheme for non-EEA fishers in the Irish fleet, which I have in front of me.  The issue dealt with in that report is not covered by this legislation, which raises the question as to why that is so, given the report was completed in March and we are now in October.  The report has been published today and we are trying frantically to read and understand it.  It is very much related to what we are talking about in the debate on this Bill.</p>  <p>  The background to the Bill includes the pre-legislative scrutiny work done by the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  I am sure the Minister of State has read the committee's report because he takes these things very seriously.  The Chairman of the joint committee, Deputy Quinlivan, says in the foreword to the report: "The pre-legislative scrutiny of the General Scheme of the Employment Permits Bill has probably been the most challenging one undertaken by the Joint Committee to date."  I am sure it was challenging on lots of levels but particularly on a human level in terms of considering the situation of migrant and seasonal workers.  We all in Ireland come from a background in which our natural feeling is to empathise with people.  I go to Achill every year.  In the past, there was a constant flow of people from there to Scotland, made up of seasonal workers who did just about everything.  That has left a huge mark on the island and on people there.  It is the same in Connemara, which people left to work in different areas.  I would never like to see a repetition of what the people from Achill and Connemara endured in England and Scotland, although I pay tribute to those places for taking a lot of our people when we did not look after them.  The Minister of State knows the point I am making about the very difficult conditions for seasonal workers.  We know that very well.  There is a double obligation on us, one of which is a moral obligation and the other an obligation on a human level, to bring in legislation that protects workers.</p>  <p>  That is what we are trying to do in this Bill but we must consider the concerns that have been expressed.  I educate myself by reading the Bill digest, the briefing information and then, depending on time, I try to read the pre-legislative scrutiny that takes place in committee.  Like most Deputies, I am always under pressure.  In this instance, the committee has raised ten serious concerns and made eight recommendations.  Those concerns and recommendations jump off the pages of the report and the Minister of State has taken two or three of them on board.  He has gone with the joint committee in getting rid of the special circumstances employment permit.  I welcome that, although I think he may come back at it in another way.  Let us see.  He went with the recommendation on conditionality, which is very good.  He is also going to make the system more flexible by removing many of the proposals for making operational changes by way of regulations.  That is to be welcomed in one way but it means there will be much less scrutiny and oversight of the system and much more power for the Minister.  I will come back to that point presently in reference to the absence of oversight of the atypical scheme the Government is now recommending be stopped.  Oversight is very important.</p>  <p>  In this Bill, we are amending and overhauling three items of legislation.  In fact, we are getting rid of two, if that is the right way to put it.  I am losing my legal terminology as I spend more time here.  The 2014 Act was brought in to put certain rights on a statutory basis.  Now we are deciding that approach was too rigid and we are going down a less official route.  I have serious concerns about that because I am not sure what analysis has been done to highlight the inadequacies of the 2014 legislation, which was introduced to copper-fasten rights on a statutory basis.</p>  <p>  As I said, the joint committee made eight recommendations and outlined ten key concerns in respect of this Bill.  In the Bill digest, the authors do not make a judgment but ask the question of the Department as to whether it has taken on those recommendations and concerns.  The Minister of State is of the opinion he has taken them on but he does not really seem to have done so.  I hope this will all be teased out on Committee Stage.  I have only read the joint committee's report once, which was the best I could do, but we must take on board its serious concerns.  It is an all-party committee and no member said he or she is against the report or offered any alternative or amendment to it.</p>  <p>  There is a balance to be struck in these matters.  We need workers but there is a balancing of rights in that and a balance to be found in ensuring our own people are trained, upskilled and provided with opportunities.  Reading all of the documentation, what jumps out at me is the slowness to remove some of the skills from the critical skills list, which should be happening because we, as a nation, have upskilled our people to fill those vacancies.  That does not seem to be happening.  I welcome diversity.  It is good for any country to have diversity but it is also good for us to look at how we are first upskilling our own people here in Ireland to ensure we do not continue to see an absence of critical skills.</p>  <p>  I have fallen into the trap with the Minister of State, for which I take the blame, of asking whether home care workers could be put on the critical skills list.  On reflection, he was right to say "No".  We used to have the problem of getting somebody assessed as being in need of home care hours or packages.  That was the big battle for us.  Now people are assessed very quickly, or relatively quickly, but there are no care workers to provide the hours.  We have allowed a situation to develop in which we simply do not have care workers.  I could list the day centres in Galway that do not have staff to provide disability services.  There is also the problem that goes along with that of using rented buildings instead of using capital funding to build facilities.  Day centres and respite services are not open and home care packages are not being implemented because there are no staff.  What do we do?  We Deputies come in here and ask that these role be put on the critical skills list in order that the staff can be recruited from somewhere else, but that is not the answer.  The answer is to upskill and train people in this country and provide good working conditions for them.  That is what should be done within our country and it certainly and equally is what should be done for workers we want to bring here.</p>  <p>  Representatives of migrants have expressed concern about the continued tying of the employee to the employer.  When I looked into this, I was told that in certain situations, workers can move from their employer and certainly can do so when there is abuse, misuse or a failure to have the employment contract enforced.</p> <p>What vulnerable employee is going to move?  That should not be there.  The idea of giving permits to a sector, rather than an employer and an employee should definitely be looked at.<br/><br/>Of course, all of this is premised on the review from 2018, which set out seven basic principles.  It is worth reading out some of those principles, where the vulnerability of the sector is identified.  It is set out in the 2018 report and repeated in different documents. The Review of Economic Migration Policy sets out the seven guiding principles, including the preference for having workers from the EEA area, and so on.  It goes through them.  I am not picking and choosing, because they are all very important in setting out the principles.  However, under principle 6, on employment rights, the review states:</p><blockquote>	Migrant workers are often a more vulnerable class of people, particularly in the lower skilled end of the labour market.  Language difficulties, cultural differences, and lack of social networks can disadvantage migrants and increase the potential for abuse by unscrupulous employers. Ireland has a very thorough employment rights legal framework. Careful consideration is given to the potential for abuse and many of the criteria in evaluating employment permit applications focus on the bona-fides of the employer and the protection of the permit holder. </blockquote> <p>Migrant workers are identified, within the seven principles, as a very vulnerable group of people.  <br/><br/>A report was also published today, which I have tried to read as quickly as I can.  It is inexplicable that it should be published today when Second Stage of the Bill has already commenced in the D&aacute;il.  No explanation has been provided for why the Report of Review of Atypical Working Scheme for Non-EEA Crew in the Irish Fishing Fleet is dated March 2022.  First, the recommendation is that this group of people come under the permit system.  I am not sure why that was not done.  Can it be done on Committee Stage?  The report published today seems to say that it will take a year.  It seems daft to be going through the Employment Permits Bill 2022 and not include this group of people.  Looking at the executive summary of the report of the review group, it makes two recommendations.  It states:</p><blockquote>	The Review Group was in full agreement in relation to its conclusions and recommendations.  The key recommendation of the group is that the employment of non-EEA crew in the Irish Fishing Fleet be provided for under DETE&rsquo;s Employment Permit scheme instead of the Atypical Working Scheme. </blockquote> <p>However, it goes on to state that it will take some time for this to be implemented, and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine will lead on the work.  I make a strong appeal for it to be included in the Bill as it progresses through the D&aacute;il.  The second main recommendation of the review group is that &quot;any AWS Fisher with a current immigration permission, and who wishes to do so, have their existing immigration permission extended for a period of time, to be agreed by the relevant Departments, to allow them to remain in the State to apply for an employment permit under the DETE&rsquo;s employment permit scheme and receive a decision on that application.&quot;  Those are two strong recommendations in respect of people who find themselves in that position.<br/><br/>This report deserves to be praised because it is making a positive recommendation.  However, we cannot do this in isolation.  We have to look at how this was ever allowed to happen in our country, with our history.  The atypical working scheme, AWS, for non-EEA crew in the Irish fishing fleet was established in 2015 because a previous review found that we needed to do something quickly because of how badly workers in this sector were being treated.  The AWS was brought in and a monitoring group was set up, but it was given no terms of reference.  I do not know how we can have trust in the system.  I want to be positive about this Bill, but when I look at the report published today, I see the gaps.  The oversight committee was established and a memorandum of understanding was agreed in February 2016.  However, the oversight committee met on an informal basis.  By 2019, a mediated agreement was required.  Imagine an oversight group being set up to monitor the AWS for the group of vulnerable people that we are saying should no longer be in the scheme but should have permits, and the oversight group needing a mediation settlement to tell it what to do in relation to monitoring the system that was brought in following the task force report in 2015.  Here we are now in 2022, and no cover is provided for at all within this Bill.  There is no learning either.  It seems daft to me.  &quot;Daft&quot; is not even the word for it.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine was in charge of it and a mediated agreement was concluded.<br/><br/>When I looked at that, I asked myself what led to an atypical scheme, and a scheme that was not monitored, being brought in.  On pages 31 and 32 of the report, it is stated that:</p><blockquote>	Since the introduction of the Atypical Worker Permission Scheme in 2016, the WRC has: <br /><br />- Carried out 7 enforcement operations <br /><br />- Participated in a Garda-led operation <br /><br />- Carried out almost 500 inspections of the 170 vessels in the Scheme<br /><br />- Completed 228 investigations <br /><br />- Detected 365 contraventions of employment legislation <br /><br />- Brought 20 prosecutions against fishing vessel owners.  </blockquote> <p>According to the report, the WRC found that 42% of vessels inspected had been compliant without WRC intervention.  However, 54% only became compliant after WRC intervention, and 2% of vessels remain non-compliant.  The report also sets out the contraventions that were found between 2019 and 2021, some of which I believe Deputy Barry read out earlier.  I will not have time to go through them all, but the report lists all of the contraventions.  They include 29 contraventions of working without permission, 24 contraventions of national minimum wage not being paid, 18 contraventions in respect of annual leave and 21 contraventions of not complying with an inspector's direction.  They are detailed on page 32 of the report.  <br/><br/>We can see the importance of the matter.  It is one thing to bring in good legislation that is grounded in human rights, but we are not even managing that.  Hopefully, when it goes through Committee Stage that is what will happen.  It is another thing to monitor it.  I will finish by saying that when I read this report, I was aghast.  The report highlights that there is no evidence of human trafficking and no prosecutions have been made.  The review group seems to think that is good.  The Minister of State will remember the debate we had on the Criminal Justice (Smuggling of Persons) Act 2021.  In that legislation we swapped around the burden of proof, so hard was it to bring a prosecution in human trafficking.  At least that is what the Minister of State, Deputy James Browne, told us.  The burden of proof was reversed so that humanitarian organisations on the ground now have to prove that they are not trafficking human beings.  They have to prove their innocence.  In the report of the review of the AWS, the review group takes great comfort from the fact that there were no prosecutions, as opposed to analysing how it happened that there were no prosecutions for human trafficking, particularly when the US State Department's Trafficking in Persons, TIPS, reports, a report by Maynooth University and reports from the International Transport Workers Federation all tell us that there are serious concerns in relation to human trafficking.  Over time, the US TIPS reports have repeatedly criticised the AWS.  We were downgraded and put on a tier 2 watchlist, although the Government has argued against this.  The 2021 TIPS report stated that Ireland did not &quot;meet the minimum standards for the elimination of human trafficking&quot;, but it said that we are &quot;making significant efforts to do so&quot;.  The 2022 TIPS report also outlines the failure of the State in relation to human trafficking.  It stated that one alleged trafficker's case was thrown out, &quot;in part due to the government's failure to inform the four victims of their opportunity to testify&quot;.  It went on to note that &quot;In 2021, government officials raised concerns the workplace relations commission (WRC) did not sufficiently understand its role in identifying trafficking victims or have adequate trafficking training, and the separation between immigration, labor, and trafficking enforcement was unclear to all officials.&quot;  It is worrying.  These concerns are set out and highlighted in the US State Department's TIPS reports year after year.  I became familiar with those reports in relation to the Criminal Justice (Smuggling of Persons) Bill 2021 which became law a year ago.</p> <p>While I give a cautious welcome to this Bill, I must ask why the Government has not dealt with the concerns of the cross-party committee, why the report was not published and why provision was not made for employees under the atypical scheme.</p></speech>

I welcome the interest in this Bill and the discussion and debate around it.  I thank my colleagues who have stayed for a long time.  I recognise there is great interest in this legislation and I look forward to working with Deputies on Committee Stage to bring through the Bill.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge there is annoyance that we did not take on board all the matters raised during pre-legislative scrutiny.  It is not possible to always take everything from pre-legislative scrutiny.  It is an important process and I totally agree with it.  Pre-legislative scrutiny certainly enabled me and my officials to make some positive changes to the Bill on foot of the advice we received.  We will tease out other parts of that on Committee Stage.  However, there is no guarantee that recommendations made at pre-legislative scrutiny will always be accepted.  It is a worthwhile exercise from which everyone gains.  We have certain reasons for not accepting all the recommendations, which we will tease through.  I will deal with the issues touching on atypical employees.  Deputy Connolly is leaving the Chamber but I will chat to her about the issue another time.  The advice which emerged from pre-legislative scrutiny is there and we will have the next stage, with Committee Stage as well, in July.</p>  <p>  In response to Deputy Connolly, the report that was published only went to the Cabinet yesterday.  That is why it was only published yesterday evening or today.  It involves a number of Departments.  It is worth reading the full report.  I am conscious Deputy Connolly has only had the chance to speed-read it and she likes to do things in detail.  I am happy to engage with her on the issue.  Her main question was why we have not allowed for atypical employees.  This legislation sets out the criteria for the various lists that were recommended.  We do not name in this legislation all the categories of people who would be able to avail of a permit.  The recommendation in that report is, thankfully, that we now allow the fisheries sector to avail of a permit scheme.  It does not have to be specifically referenced in this legislation.  This legislation is, however, clearly about that matter.  It will deal with the process they can now engage with.  I know the Deputy needs to rush off.  I will engage with her again on this matter.  There are many issues in the report.  In fairness to the fisheries sector and the many stakeholders involved in it, they were asking to be permitted to go into the general employment permit system.  That is what we are now doing and will do.  It is a positive.  There are issues in that regard going back a number of years.  I am not going to read the report now because I did not bring it with me.  I am happy to engage with the Deputy another time.  I have no doubt the committee will want to do so too.</p>  <p>  Many Deputies asked if the legislation will erode the employment rights or workers.  I want to be clear that it will not.  Employment permit holders have exactly the same protections under Irish employment law as any other worker in the State.  The employment permit system has been designed to ensure that the employment rights of migrants are observed.  The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is responsible for regulating many aspects of the labour market and works to ensure that opportunities for labour exploitation are minimised.  The legislation supports employment rights compliance in the State and the protection of employment rights for migrants by, for example, ensuring a written contract of employment is in place, the permit holder receives the original copy of the permit and a summary of the employee's rights printed on the employment permit with contact details for the Workplace Relations Commission where the permit holder can access information in a number of languages.  The legislation prohibits deductions in respect of the application process from the permit holder's remuneration.  Employment permit holders may change employer within 12 months in circumstances such as redundancy or where the terms of employment are fundamentally changed due to events that were unforeseen at the time of application.  I acknowledge there is an issue around those 12 months but we must recognise this is a two-way process.  The employer has offered the job.  The potential employee looked for that job and applied for a permit to go with it.  They have worked hand in hand.  There is a cost to the process and we have to bear that in mind.  A 12-month period is an acceptable length of time for that permit not to be moved elsewhere.  There are exceptional circumstances, and we have dealt with that carefully in many cases.  We allow for different scenarios.  We work closely with people in that regard.  I think most people would recognise that the process works reasonably well but I am happy to tease it through at a later stage.</p>  <p>  All employment permit holders may change employer after 12 months.  Minimum remuneration levels are set.  The Bill will include additional control for meat processing and other professions with a threshold of less than &euro;22,000.  We will work with the meat processing sector controls.  The WRC's inspector or authorised officers for the enforcement of the Employment Permits Acts, and their investigation and enforcement powers, work to protect employees from abuses of the employment permit system by unscrupulous employers.  Such employers may be subject to fines or a prison term where they are found to be in breach of the Employment Permits Acts.  The proposed amendments do not impact any of these safeguards.  I want to be clear about that.  They do not impact on any of these safeguards.  There is an impression being given here that they do but they do not.  The provisions for training and accommodation which have been proposed will further contribute to the support for migrant workers in specified circumstances.</p>  <p>  There are a couple of issues there, as raised by Deputy O'Reilly, around the need for upskilling and training, and the conditionality of permits.  We agree with the committee about that.  We have also attached conditions to some of the various quotas and permits already.  We are as one on the need to do that.  We are also as one and very clear on the remuneration that for indexation must be allowed for.  That is fair and we want to allow for that to happen automatically and ensure it is not at the whim of a Minister to set or update the wages.  They should follow an indexation.  That is dealt with in the legislation.  We are as one on that matter, which the committee also raised.</p>  <p>  There has been a lot of debate about the need for permits and Deputies have asked whether training and upskilling can deal with the need.  There is a robust system here to judge the need when a permit is applied for or to judge the need for a particular skill to be on the critical skills list or the ineligible list.  It is about that need and the analysis of that sector.  We have an expert skills analysis team in our Department.  It analyses individual sectors along with the parent Departments and other stakeholders.  There is a cross-departmental working group to analyse all the various sectors and requests when it comes to managing these various lists under the legislation.  We always first look to see can the need be met locally.  We ask whether the need can be met within the European context or the EEA context.  We are clear about that.  It is a part of the European agreement.  It is part of the EU in which we operate.  We would also ask whether we can find the talent necessary locally through skills and development.  We ask can we close the skills gap by investing in skills and development.  I say to employers that there are now many opportunities to engage with the State through my Department, Skillnet Ireland and the training levy, as well as the Departments of Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science and Social Protection.  They are all involved in funding training and upskilling solutions and supports to allow potential employees to go on those courses.  They also work with employers with skills shortages.  As has been reflected in the debate, many sectors say they have skills shortages.  Nearly every business owner I talk to tells me they cannot find the staff they need and have a skills shortage.  There is an issue here.  However, close to 1 million people in this country are not at work for various different reasons.  They are not all availing of social welfare payments but neither are they in the work environment, for whatever reason.  We always say we must try to encourage those people back into the work system.  That means there must be good terms and conditions, as we have debated in this Chamber.  This legislation reflects the need for that.  There must also be a good tax system to ensure it is worthwhile going to work or taking on extra work or shifts at the weekend.  That is why I am glad we made changes in respect of the higher taxation rate in the most recent budget.  That was to encourage people to take on more work where there is a need to do so.  </p>  <p>  There are supports for people to go back into work.  The work that is done through the pathways to work scheme, led by the Department of Social Protection, is a useful means of getting people back into work, encouraging them to get back to work and assisting them to get back to work, and to ensure they do not lose out on entitlements because they went back to work.  A lot of work has been done across Departments.  I always encourage any prospective applicants for permits to look at that system first and to engage with it.  </p>  <p>  Many Deputies named the individual sectors that require permits.  Many of those sectors have engaged with us and we have asked them to go back and engage with the Department of Education, our education and training boards, Skillnet Ireland and the Department of Social Protection around trying to source talent locally.  That is a process through which they all have to go.  If we have gathered all the evidence and tried all those approaches but still cannot fill those skill gaps, then a resort to permits is often used.  It is only one part of the solution and should never be the permanent or only solution.  However, we must recognise that we are short of critical skills in some areas and need to bring them in.  In other cases in respect of general permits, we cannot source the people we need within the EEA and the permits are set out for that too.  The system is managed extremely well and reviewed quite regularly.  A number of sectors that Deputies want to have reviewed have been put forward.  I will not go through all the names involved.  We engage with the various parent Departments in that regard.  We try to respond, which we did over the past two years on a number of occasions by removing quotas or allowing for a certain number in various categories.  I will not go through the list now because this debate has gone on a long time</p> <p>We try to respond as much as we possibly can and will continue to do so.</p> <p> We are not too far off the recommendations made by the committee, in most cases.  There is a difference in respect of the seasonal permit.  The initial review that led to this change recommended a seasonal permit, as did the public consultation.  The committee's recommendation seems to recognise there is a need for such a permit but suggests a different way of doing it.  I accept that is its recommendation.  We are all agreed that there is a need to allow for some sort of seasonal permit.  We are one of the few countries in Europe that does not make allowance for it.  We believe we are right to allow for a seasonal permit.  I accept we do not have all the amendments to tease through in the Chamber but we will on Committee Stage.  Maybe we will be in a better place to move forward as one on the seasonal permit when people see the recommendations we are putting forward, in addition to the amendments and the regulations that will come, which will also be discussed on Committee Stage.</p> <p> The committee recommended that the special circumstance employment permit should only be issued following certification by a relevant agency.  We are not proceeding with that so we have probably gone further than the committee on that.  We can deal with that issue in other ways, with the agreement of the various sectors.</p> <p> From my reading of it, what we are saying on the 50:50 waivers is much the same as the committee recommendation.  There is possibly some confusion around that so if I need to tease through that on Committee Stage I will, but what we are saying is practically the same.</p> <p> On the committee recommendation on the proposal to amend the labour market needs test and other operational details by way of regulations, there is disagreement on whether that should be done through regulation or primary legislation.  As I have been a Minister of State in many different Departments at this stage - I must be getting old - I can see the benefits of having regulations and not always having the details in primary legislation because it makes it very hard to change things thereafter, when we want to do that in full transparency and in a way that is open to every analysis.  It is not a case of trying to avoid scrutiny but being able to deal with scenarios when they come at us.  Very often, our officials cannot do that or cannot make changes because we have to go back to primary legislation.  That can be a slow process and also means, when we consolidate Bills, that it is a long process to get everything right, whereas we can engage with all the stakeholders and Members to make changes in regulations a little more quickly, when the need is there.  It is not to abuse the situation in any shape or form.  If we need to work on that to get people's confidence in it, we will also do that on Committee Stage.</p> <p> The committee also recommended that "holders of General Employment Permits should be given improved rights in relation to family reunion and the access of family members to the labour market".  That is something that comes up quite a lot in debates in the Chamber.  There is certainly a change in tone on that in this House compared with what we might have had years ago from some, although that is not the case for everybody, which I accept - I got that stare from Deputies.  We are talking about employment permits.  We are not the Department of Justice but I will certainly make sure that this debate is reflected back to that Department and that can be kept in mind.  The Department of Justice recently brought forward its own scheme to deal with many scenarios where people were left in the shadows in this country.  More than 6,000 people, or possibly 8,000 individuals, will rightly benefit from that scheme.  That is a positive contribution.</p> <p> The Department of Justice is very much open to working with Members to get this right.  It has engaged quite a lot with us on employment permits in order to align our work and try to see how we can fix the system together in order to respond.  The situation in respect of doctors was one where we were able to work together, along with the Department of Health.  There are opportunities to make changes.  I will certainly reflect the tone that has been put forward during this debate around critical skills, the general permit and the length of time after which someone can bring their family here.  The period for critical skills permits is straight away but a general permit is 12 months, which we always believed was acceptable and is still recommended but we can tease that out a little more and I can also talk to the Department of Justice about it.  It goes back to the fact that general permits are not meant to be the full solution to a situation.  We would like to invest in skills, training and education locally to fill those jobs from within Ireland as best we possibly can.</p> <p> The committee also raised a concern around the link to an employer for the first 12 months.  We disagree on that.  We do not believe that is unfair for the first 12 months, once we allow for scenarios to be dealt with.  This legislation allows for that, as will the regulations.  We do not agree with its members on this issue, but we have justifiable reasons for that.  Most people generally come to this country on that permit and, in most situations, it seems to work extremely well.  Cases have been brought to our attention that are dealt with and, very often, dealt with effectively.</p> <p> The report further states that the committee would like to see the concept of conditionality in the work permit system developed.  We are at one on that.  We agree with that.  We have used conditions in the past and will do more of that in future.  We are all agreed on that.  It is not just about training for filling the potential role locally; it is about a person who comes here getting training.  The conditions for healthcare assistant roles are that there will be training, people in those jobs will be helped to attain qualifications in their first two years here, and we will then judge the second application for a permit based on that, rightly so.  We are in the same space on that one.</p> <p> The report states "the protection and enhancement of the position of employees should be at the centre of proposals to amend the employment permit system".  That is absolutely what it is.  It is to streamline the process for everybody involved in it, including the person who wants to work here and does not want to wait six, seven or eight months for that permit to be processed and the employer who is offering that job.  We are protecting people in this system.  That is what we are trying to do.  The employment permit system has been designed to ensure that the employment rights of migrants are observed.  We are very clear on that and very strong on it as a Department.  I have previously said in the Chamber that I am quite proud of Ireland's labour protection laws.  All those laws are fully available to people whether they are on a permit or not.  That is the way it is.  We are very clear on that too.</p> <p> I will try to deal with a couple of other issues that were touched on.  There was a lot of conversation around HGV drivers.  No quota on that is operated by us and there is no delay relating to the permits.  The question raised was around the recognition of qualifications.  We do a lot in our Department but we do not recognise people's qualifications for their ability to drive.  That is down to the Road Safety Authority and the Department of Transport.  Likewise, they will try to speed up that process and have dealt with individual countries in respect of that.  There have been some issues around the recognition of qualifications, for example, of many members of the Ukrainian community who have come here.  I have raised at European level that we should find a quicker way to do that across all professions and not just HGV drivers.  This issue is not dealt with by our Department but I will reflect it back because if we are able to approve a permit quite quickly, every other Department can come with us on that journey too.</p> <p> We try to align on this issue.  We have had a lot of luck in having the resources but we have a lot of backing from the Minister and T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, and our Secretary General to put additional staff and resources into our permit section in order that we can deal with our backlog and get through that.  Mr. Kevin Daly, who led that charge, is present.  We have dramatically increased the team and the skills.  The IT system has changed and is being changed dramatically for the future.  We have been able to respond at the level of our Department to clear that backlog and put a system in place to keep the processing time down to less than four weeks and, in many cases, two or three weeks.  Other Departments also want to do that and are talking to us about how to align our systems.  We will do that.  Legislation such as this makes it a little easier for us to be able to do our job in the Department in responding to all the needs.</p> <p> The issue of the home-care sector comes up quite a lot.  As with every other sector, I would argue that permits are not the only solution.  This was looked at previously and it did not pass the criteria.  The evidence was not there to indicate we should bring in those permits and we did not make changes to that.  We all still recognise that there is a major shortage of people in that sector who provide care in the home.  There a quite a large demand for it that is not being met.  There are different reasons for that.  We always say we have to look at terms and conditions, pay levels, issues around transport, the HSE contracts that are on offer and everything that goes with that.  A working group is now doing that and looking at all those issues.  The Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Butler, is in charge of that.  Out of that work, which is practically complete, that group will bring forward recommendations.  If there is an ask there for us to do something around permits, we will of course respond to that based on the evidence.  Again, the solution is a combination of attracting more people locally into that sector, with the skills, training and supports they need as part of their terms and conditions, in addition to the HSE playing its part.  There is a lot going on there.  We are willing to be part of that, if the ask is there from the Department of Health and the evidence is there to back it up.  That is what the interdepartmental working group is doing.  That report should be available for debate in the Chamber quite soon and will feed into the system.  I am well aware of the need in that sector and we are well prepared to work on that.</p> <p> Other issues were raised on different aspects of farming and agriculture.  We have engaged with many of those sectors and have made changes to the quota over the years but the evidence has to be gathered and has to come through the parent Department with a very clear ask of us.  We try to respond where we can.  We make changes quite quickly, when the evidence is there.  Some sectors were mentioned.  These sectors have to engage with the various Departments and prove they have tried to find some talent locally.  It is important we do that.</p> <p> On apprenticeships, traineeships and so on, there is a long history in our Department of saying to people in these various sectors to look at their systems.  Are they putting innovation and automation in place in their businesses to try to deal with some of their concerns?  Are they investing in skills and training?  Have they designed an apprenticeship?  Sectors were mentioned that took a long time to design their apprenticeships to respond to a skills shortage, even though it was highlighted by our skills unit many years previously.  A successful apprenticeship programme is a combination of that sector working with the education system to design it.</p></speech>
