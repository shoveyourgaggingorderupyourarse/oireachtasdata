A very happy International Women's Day to you and to all.</p>  <p>  The price of energy and fuel has literally soared over the past year and, of course, prices have risen even more rapidly following the criminal Russian invasion of Ukraine, which, as we know, has resulted in an unprecedented disruption in the global energy market.  The cost of petrol at the pumps has increased by 70 cent per litre since January last year.  We are now at a point where many people can no longer afford to put fuel in a car to get to work.  This is particularly difficult for people who live in remote and rural areas or places where there is no access to frequent public transport.</p>  <p>  In that same timeframe, since January last year, the price of home heating oil has doubled and households are now being charged more than &euro;700 for a half fill of oil.  Families now struggle to keep their homes warm and I know many people are layering with clothes instead.  Some are just heating one room or not heating their home at all.  Other people, particularly seniors, are staying in bed to stay warm.  These fuel cost hikes are not sustainable for any worker, family or small business.  As the Taoiseach knows, people are already hammered by extortionate rents, unaffordable house prices and ever-rising insurance and childcare costs.  The cost of living was out of control anyway.</p>  <p>  In fairness, the Government now recognises that what was announced in February does not go far enough to alleviate these pressures, but yet it seems it is not ready to take action this week to reduce the cost of fuel.  I put it to the Taoiseach that people cannot wait any longer for relief because they must put fuel in their cars today.  They must pay for home heating oil today.  Indeed, many wonder if they can afford to do that or if they will have to decide which bill goes unpaid at the end of the week.  It is wrong that people must make these kinds of choices and it is not a way to live a decent life.</p>  <p>  T&aacute; praghas ar bhreosla ag ard&uacute; ar&iacute;s agus n&iacute; f&eacute;idir le hoibrithe, le teaghlaigh agus le gn&oacute;lachta&iacute; beaga coinne&aacute;il suas leis.  Caithfidh an Rialtas dleacht m&aacute;il ar pheitril agus ar dh&iacute;osal a ghearradh agus &eacute; a bhaint &oacute;na leith&eacute;ide.  Tabharfaidh s&eacute; seo sos at&aacute; ag teast&aacute;il go g&eacute;ar &oacute; dhaoine. </p>  <p>  I will set out for the Taoiseach what we believe needs to happen.  The Government must cut the price of petrol and diesel through an immediate reduction in excise duty.  At the pumps we can get prices down by 25 cent per litre immediately by cutting excise duty.  Similarly, the spiralling cost of home heating oil could be cushioned with the immediate and total removal of excise duty.  The D&aacute;il will not sit next week so these measures must be introduced now as a matter of urgency, and it can be done.  A financial resolution to immediately reduce excise duty on petrol and diesel and to remove excise duty from home heating oil could be passed today.  This is the method used to increase or decrease excise duties in the budget, and as we know those changes are typically made overnight.</p>  <p>  I ask that the Government does this now so that people can see an instant price reduction at the pumps and in their home heating oil bills by midnight.</p> <p>I put it to the Taoiseach that he takes this course of action.  It would make a huge difference to workers, families, businesses, hauliers and many providing school transport.  They are literally at their wits' end.  I am asking that a Financial Resolution be brought to the House tonight or tomorrow night.  Sinn F&eacute;in will accommodate late sittings or whatever is required but we need to act on this matter now.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-08a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="14:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030800004#B00200"><p>I thank Deputy McDonald for raising this very important issue.</p><p>I wish everybody a happy International Women's Day.  We are all agreed that our thoughts are with the women of Ukraine who more than anybody have demonstrated extraordinary resilience in the face of the most enormous of challenges and the most impossible of choices as they bring their children to safety, leaving their husbands and partners apart.  We salute the women of the Ukrainian Parliament for resolutely defending democracy, staying in Kyiv, defending the democracy and territorial integrity of Ukraine.  If I could, I want to salute the bravery of journalism in the middle of this war, particularly women journalists.  On the front page of <i>The New York Times</i>we will have seen that horrific photograph of a family murdered by Russian forces, captured by Lynsey Addario, a person who has spent her career documenting war crimes and who has documented one here.</p><p>That brings us to the fact that one of the impacts of the Ukrainian war will undoubtedly be, as Deputy McDonald said, inflation on fuel and energy prices.  Prior to the war we already had significant increases in fuel prices.  The Government took steps in the budget of about &euro;1 billion and, most recently, &euro;0.5 billion, to deal with that phase of what was then described as a pandemic-derived cycle of inflation.  There is no question but that the war on Ukraine is going to increase further and has increased the escalation of fuel prices at the petrol pump, household costs and so on.  The Government is acutely aware of this issue.  We do not argue that the impacts on people are not sustainable at the rate these increases are occurring.  Russia's systemic role in energy supply will have significant impact on prices with implications for inflation and production costs.  Pass-through price effects are going to be felt in other areas.  We can see it in fertilisers, fuel and transport costs and food.  Food is another key issue of concern for Government given that Russia and Ukraine between them export so much grain to the West.  We have to take measures to try to offset what is likely to be an interruption in terms of those exports for one reason or another as a consequence of the war in Ukraine.</p><p>The Deputy is correct.  We know that the barrel of oil on international markets has soared from about $96 a barrel on 23 February to $126 or $130 today and rising.  There is speculation that it could hit $150 or $200 this year.  Natural gas has increased exponentially in price also.  I can say to the Deputy that there is an EU Commission paper on this.  A toolbox is emerging and hopefully within the next day or two it will be published and will be considered.  The Government is giving this very active consideration.  We do understand the scheduling in terms of the Legislature and so on.  I appreciate the Deputy's offer of facilitation of whatever outcome of the Government's active consideration of this issue will mean.  I do not want to get into specifics right now.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-08a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1466" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="14:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030800004#B00300"><p>Nobody is disputing the international context for these soaring prices.  I hope nobody is disputing, either, that householders, families, workers, hauliers and those providing school transport are now at their wits' end.</p> <p>Their crisis is now.  It is in the immediacy of now.  It is a question of how they get to work, get about and heat their home, today, tomorrow and next week.  I am well aware that the European Commission is bringing forward proposals and we certainly look forward to seeing them, but we would regard them as being by way of additionality to what the Government in Dublin needs to do now.</p> <p> I have made a very concrete ask of the Taoiseach.  I ask again that a financial resolution be brought before the D&aacute;il this week, either tonight or tomorrow night, that will have the effect of reducing excise on petrol and diesel and a 25 cent per litre reduction at the petrol pumps immediately for consumers, and that this resolution would equally have the effect of removing excise entirely on home heating oil to take some of the sting out of that soaring cost.  I am asking the Taoiseach to do this now.  Speed is of the essence because people are suffering and struggling now.</p></speech>

That is across a whole range of areas, some of which I outlined in terms of our humanitarian response.  Suffice it to say that the impact of the war will be very serious and significant for all nations across the European Continent and it will be a long haul in terms of our response to it.  What we would normally do in normal times will no longer be the approach we need to take as a society.  We will have to look outside the norm and outside the box in dealing with this crisis.  That applies to the specific issue the Deputy raised as well as other issues.  As I have said in reply to her, the Government is keeping this under very active consideration and will be responding once that process of consideration is concluded.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-08a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1564" speakername="Duncan Smith" time="14:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030800005#C00300"><p>All our thoughts are with the women of Ukraine on International Women's Day and, indeed, with all the people of Ukraine.  They are being indiscriminately killed throughout that country right now.  On a street in Irpin, a family with two children fleeing war, with everything they had in their suitcases, were killed by Russian shelling as they tried to get to safety.  In Sumy last night, Russian air strikes killed 18 people, including two children.  On Sunday, the world witnessed the death of Kirill Yatsko, an 18-month-old boy fatally injured by shelling in Mariupol.  President Zelenskiy confirmed this morning that a child had died from dehydration in the same city, where water and all other supplies have been cut off by the Russians.</p>  <p>  We must not turn our eyes away from what Russia is perpetrating on the Ukrainian people.  The UN has confirmed that the number of refugees fleeing the Russian war against Ukraine has already exceeded 2 million.  We are all aware that this is a humanitarian crisis on a level that has not been seen in Europe since the Second World War.  The Irish people have responded with urgency and generosity and are full of practical ideas on how to address the crisis.  It must be said that the Taoiseach went some way to capturing the mood of the nation last Friday night on "The Late Late Show".  However, capturing the mood of the nation and actually delivering in this House and for the refugees coming from Ukraine are going to be two different things.  Estimates of 100,000 refugees coming to Ireland have been put forward.  It will be a task for the country, the Government and all of us in this House to ensure we deliver on all areas, including housing, health and education, for everyone who comes to our shores.  Can the Taoiseach confirm whether the UK Government or the Home Office have raised any concerns with him or the Government about our policy on accepting refugees?</p>  <p>  While we cannot condone the lorry driver who crashed into the gates of the Russian Embassy, we can all understand what drove that action.  The Government has so far decided not to expel the Russian ambassador but we must recognise that the embassy is now a tool of the Russian war effort.  There are 31 staff known to be working there, which is reportedly one third more than the number working in the embassy in the UK, where there are 22 staff.  There are only ten staff in the Russian embassy in Poland, 12 in Germany and 19 in France.  Why are there are so many Russian embassy staff here when we do not have strong trade or cultural links with that country?</p>  <p>  Our Magnitsky Bill is being held up by Government red tape.  Can the Taoiseach confirm what Russian assets, if any, have been seized by the Government in the past couple of weeks?</p> <p>Has the UK raised any concerns with Ireland over how many refugees we are planning to take?  Why has Ireland so many Russian diplomats?  Will the Taoiseach now expel those who are surplus to maintaining basic diplomatic channels?  What Russian assets, if any, have been seized by the Irish State?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-08a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="14:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030800006#D00200"><p>First, I thank the Deputy for raising this key issue and his comments on a number of issues that spring from it.  I mentioned earlier the bravery of journalists.  Without journalists in battle, we would not have any picture at all of the atrocities and war crimes that are being committed by an evil regime that has clearly targeted women and children.  I mentioned Lynsey Addario's photograph that captured the family that was mowed down as they were leaving a war zone.  We have to continue to shine a light on such atrocities.</p>  <p>  On the response of the Government and people of Ireland, we are very clear: we work with the EU.  In working with the Union, one of the first things we did was offer visa-free accommodation and facilitation.  That is the first time ever this arrangement has been used by the EU, which illustrates the gravity of the situation.  Essentially, Ukrainians can flee a war zone and come to Ireland, where they can avail of all the rights of residency, access to healthcare, education, accommodation and other things.  What that means for us domestically - this morning the Government discussed this - is that in the context of a crisis such as the one we are now experiencing, the duration of which we are unsure, we will have to take steps to circumvent normal approaches to provide accommodation at the scale required and match it with access to childcare and education, in particular.  It will be an enormous challenge at a scale we have never dealt with before.  The pledge register that the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, has initiated has received an incredible response from across the country.</p>  <p>  The Government is meeting weekly.  The Secretary General is chairing meetings of all Secretaries General to make sure every Department works in a co-ordinated way on this crisis.  The key will be to move as fast as we can to deal with the numbers coming in daily.  We estimate that more than 2,200 have now arrived in Ireland.  All will have access to social protection, social welfare incomes and so forth, which is important.  That work is under way.  Therefore, a lot has been done in a very short space of time.  We have allocated &euro;20 million in humanitarian supports to go through established agencies in the UN, including UNICEF, and the Irish Red Cross to deal with the crisis on the ground close to the borders by way of providing vital supplies.  We stand ready in respect of any additional arrangements we need to put in place at that level and any response in the form of having experienced or expert personnel go to various locations to assist our colleagues within the EU.</p>  <p>  On the embassy issue, we cannot condone what happened yesterday.  It was a complete contravention of the Vienna Convention and in our view it was wrong.  Embassies all over the world in different locations must be allowed to operate in safety.  We will work in unison with our EU colleagues on all issues to do with sanctions and measures to be taken in response to the Russian aggression.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-08a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1564" speakername="Duncan Smith" time="14:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030800006#D00300"><p>We absolutely cannot condone it but believe it is a reflection of the anger many people are feeling.  Has the Taoiseach asked the Russians why they need so many people working in their embassy in Ireland given our lack of cultural and economic links?  What level of contact has there been with the UK on the taking in of refugees?</p>  <p>  Let me refer to what is needed practically.  I was contacted this morning by a man who owns one of six houses in Enfield, County Meath whose owners are willing to give them over for this effort.  Where can someone go?  The pledge site is not exactly ready for offers at this level yet, but these are very real, practical offers.</p>  <p>  Racheal Diyaolu from Carlow was studying medicine in Sumy State University.  She spent the last week hiding in a bunker at a hostel as Russian shelling intensified.  Through the help of two volunteer drivers, she has managed to make it to the border.</p> <p>It is to be hoped she can make it over the border and home to safety.  What is going to happen to her medical studies?  She is studying to become a doctor.  These are the practical responses that we need to take as a State for our citizens and for the refugees coming here.  It is not just about housing.  It is going to be about education, childcare and everything else.  What can we do for the likes of Racheal and everyone else coming here?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-08a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="14:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030800007#E00200"><p>On the question of the numbers at the Russian embassy, I have not asked about the numbers there.  Be under no illusions.  We have about six in Moscow, including three diplomats.  Any actions mean reciprocal actions on the other side.  We judge it necessary to retain diplomatic channels right now in terms of protecting and having channels to help Irish citizens in particular situations.  The Deputy has just mentioned the young student, Racheal Diyaolu, who is endeavouring to flee from Ukraine.  Channels must be kept open as a matter of pragmatism, as a way of protecting citizens and in terms of raising issues about which we are concerned.  That is notwithstanding the appalling provocation from earlier statements from the embassy that there was never going to be an invasion or a war, and we saw how false and untrue those statements were.</p>  <p>  In relation to the UK, my understanding is there have been discussions between the Home Secretary and the Minister of Justice, Deputy McEntee.  We have pointed out to the UK that we are part of a European Union-wide response in waiving visa requirements.  It is a humanitarian response.  That will continue to be our position in respect of prioritising the humanitarian response above and beyond anything else.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-08a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1478" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="14:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030800007#E00300"><p>The world is rightly horrified at the unfolding disaster that is being unleashed on the people of Ukraine with Putin's bloody, inexcusable and murderous invasion of that country.  Ireland's voice needs to be absolutely clear in condemning utterly that murderous invasion.  We need, as I think it is clear the people of this country want, to extend every form of humanitarian assistance and support to those suffering under the bombs, bullets and shells of the Russian military, and to those who are fleeing their homes to escape this bloody conflict.  We must provide refuge and be as generous as we possibly can in providing refuge for those fleeing from the Ukrainian crisis.</p>  <p>  I must say, however, that it is extremely worrying to me that it seems that there is a clamour of media commentators and, more seriously, the Taoiseach and leading Ministers, who seem to be trying to exploit this Ukrainian tragedy and crisis to argue that we need to move Ireland away from its traditional position of military neutrality and closer to NATO and the project of European militarisation.  We heard it from the T&aacute;naiste last week and we have heard it from the Taoiseach.  The latest example of this came from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Simon Coveney, who was speaking in New York to the US Council on Foreign Relations, a body packed with hundreds of senior government officials, arguing that we need to consider greater co-operation with NATO and increased arms expenditure.</p>  <p>  I find it absolutely extraordinary that in the face of the dire consequences of warmongering and militarism on the part of Putin, there is a thought that somehow more militarism, more arms expenditure and allying more closely with a military alliance that has also conducted and supported murderous wars elsewhere in the world is somehow a legitimate response.  If we are opposed to Putin's brutal and unjustifiable invasion of Ukraine, and we must be, we should not respond to that by joining an alliance dominated by powers that, for example, are supporting the Saudi dictatorship, which is conducting an equally murderous war in Yemen that has killed more than 300,000 people over the past four years and has now, according to the UN, brought 14 million people to the brink of starvation, or by continuing to ignore what Amnesty International is calling the crimes against humanity that Israel commits against Palestinians, supported and armed by the United States and the western powers.</p> <p>In the face of this tragedy, is it not time to recommit to Ireland's position of military neutrality, which does not mean ignoring this crisis, but being a voice for sanity against the madness of warmongering and militarism?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-08a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030800008#F00300"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising the issue.  I agree that Russia stands condemned in the international court of opinion for its appalling atrocities against the civilian population of Ukraine and for its unjustifiable and unprovoked war on Ukraine, its territorial integrity and its sovereignty.  Everybody else tried everything to stop Russia going to war.  Leading NATO countries the Deputy decries on an ongoing basis and accuses of being militarist in their orientation did everything they could to say to President Putin he did not need to go to war, that any security concerns he had could be transparently dealt with in terms of either missile deployment or troops deployment on the Continent of Europe, and that if he had issues with deployments in eastern Europe, he should talk and we should have a forum for discussion.  That needs to be acknowledged and the Deputy needs to acknowledge it too, because I can recall two or three weeks ago he was describing NATO as the warmongerer in the situation when it has been far from it.  There has been only one warmongerer here and that has been Russia.</p>  <p>  In terms of what the Deputy might describe as the clamour of media commentators around the issue of neutrality, that is called democracy.  We might not like views, but that is democracy.  We cannot decry the clamour of commentators.  We should actually embrace the clamour of commentary because that represents diversity of opinion and viewpoints and the rights of people to reflect.  This crisis does cause a need for further reflection on the overall security architecture within Europe and within the wider world.</p>  <p>  Ireland has a tradition of military non-alignment or military neutrality.  We have never been politically neutral.  Indeed, even in 1939, when the German representative came to the Irish Government, it was made very clear to that representative of the closeness and how Britain would always have to get consideration.  De Valera himself said that.  He said it rendered it inevitable for the Irish Government to show a certain consideration for Britain.  Likewise, as we have evolved through our membership of the European Union, we developed in 1999 the Partnership for Peace with NATO to sustain interoperability if we were on peace missions or peace enforcement missions with NATO countries.  We have been part of permanent structured co-operation, PESCO.  We have been part of battle groups, none of which were ever deployed but which ensured the Irish Defence Forces were at a certain modern competence and capacity to enable them to do what we do best, which is peacekeeping.  Ireland does peacekeeping well.  We have the longest unbroken record in terms of peacekeeping since about 1957, when we first started our peacekeeping role in the world.</p>  <p>  We do need a discussion on this, however, although not right now.  In the middle of a terrible war we should be concentrating our resources on helping the people of Ukraine in a practical way.  I think we could look at a citizens' assembly to discuss these issues in the fullness of time, where detailed prepared submissions and perspectives from a wide range of opinion could be articulated.</p></speech>

He went on to say that, lately, we have been picking our fights, and the more we do so, the more we lose our integrity.  He asked me to urge this House to keep the faith with military neutrality for that reason.  That is the problem.</p> <p>If we oppose the madness we are seeing unfolding in Ukraine, we have to be consistent in opposing all militarism and all imperialism and not be selective.  Absolutely, we must condemn Putin's brutal invasion, but are we going to condemn less what the Saudi dictatorship is doing in Yemen now, supported by the US and the UK, who are members of NATO, and are armed to the teeth by the West, or what Amnesty International describes as crimes against humanity on an ongoing basis against the Palestinian people, or say nothing about it?  Does neutrality not mean standing against all warmongering and all dictators, and do we not have to hold fast to that tradition that indeed helped found this State, with the ideas of people like James Connolly and the rebels of 1916 rebelling against the madness of the First World War?</p></speech>

That is because we have pursued an independent foreign policy as members of the European Union, the greatest characteristic of which has probably been our nuclear non-proliferation initiatives.  This began with the then Minister for External Affairs, Frank Aiken, as part of the Irish resolutions at the UN in the 1950s.  He was a true architect of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.  Those are the kinds of issues that need to be worked through in respect of anybody&rsquo;s reflections on how we might evolve our independent foreign policy within the European Union context and our solidarity with European Union nations.</p>  <p>  To be fair to all the commentary so far, people are pointing up that the world is changing.  President Putin has fundamentally changed the multilateral rules-based order by the nature of his unprovoked attack on Ukraine.  It would be foolish to ignore that reality.  The European Union is exposed security-wise-----</p></speech>

I think, in particular, of the staff I have in my own office who do a great job when I am not there and I wish them well.</p>  <p>  On Ukraine and all that has been talked about here today, I wish to make a suggestion in the context of what we will be doing next week in celebrating St Patrick&rsquo;s Day and week, when we will be showcasing Ireland globally as the small island nation that we are that has spread throughout the world.  Ministers and Government representatives will travel to the far ends of the world in celebration of that, and rightly so, because it is a great thing that we can do that.  It is a great occasion for people on these foreign soils to see our Ministers there celebrating our Irishness.  The Taoiseach himself alluded to the peacekeeping role we have and the fact we now have a seat on the United Nations Security Council.</p>  <p>  Effectively, we have a great reputation but we are basing that on a success story of struggle for our independence.  I am asking the Taoiseach, as a mark of solidarity with Ukraine, that we consider for next week raising the Ukrainian flag with the Irish flag at every embassy and, where we are greening our Irish buildings across the globe, that we also include the colours of Ukraine as a mark of respect and solidarity with these people?  It would be important for people across the world to say how we in Ireland, with our great reputation, are going to share our day with the Ukrainian people, bearing in mind all the atrocities they have got undergone in the past ten days.  It would be a noble gesture, a small one for us to do, but would be a giant indication right across the world of what Ireland thinks about what is happening right now.</p>  <p>  It is an opportunity and will cost nothing, other than a few bulbs here and there with an additional flag to be raised.  The Taoiseach might consider that.</p></speech>

We have considered this in Government and I agree with the Deputy.  As a result of the appalling situation and war in Ukraine, we have evolved our tone and theme of St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day next week from an overt focus on Ireland to a broader focus on the fact Ireland is an active, engaged and fully committed member of the international community that stands by democracy, the rule of law and human rights.</p> <p>We will use St. Patrick's Day and that week basically to highlight our solidarity with Ukraine and the values for which the Ukrainian people are standing.  That is a key issue.  The theme of St. Patrick's Day was about reconnection coming out of the pandemic, with people reconnecting in person nationally and globally, and illustrating the connectedness and interdependence of the world.  Again, that has been demonstrated in respect of the people of Ukraine standing up for fundamental values that we all share and want to see protected - freedom, democracy and human rights.</p> <p> In all the various speaking occasions, we will highlight the situation in Ukraine and Ireland's solidarity with the people of Ukraine.  Members of the Government will represent Ireland in approximately 30 countries across Europe, America and Asia, and they will use those occasions to reassert our unequivocal commitment to democracy and to the people of Ukraine.  National day receptions will go ahead where possible overseas, and we are looking at ways to recognise Ukraine and its people at official receptions that will be organised.  No Russian or Belarusian representatives will be invited to any official St. Patrick's Day events.  Speeches at receptions and events will make appropriate reference to the situation in Ukraine as it prevails at the time they are delivered.  More than 70 bespoke virtual receptions are in full production and will make appropriate reference to the situation in Ukraine as it prevails at the time they are delivered.  The Global Greening programme in partnership with Tourism Ireland has been an enormous success over the years.  We are re-examining that for St. Patrick's Day in terms of how we can interweave it with a Ukrainian theme as well.</p> <p> We believe we can use the unique access that St. Patrick's Day gives Ireland around the world as a platform to express our solidarity with the people of Ukraine and to seek to strengthen the global coalition of support for Ukraine and its people.  It is appropriate we do so, as an active, engaged and fully committed member of the international community of free and democratic nations and to reassert out solidarity with the people of Ukraine.  I take on board what the Deputy has said.  We are of one mind; that is the way we have been thinking about this since the war broke out.  We need to act in solidarity and use the occasions to highlight what is happening.</p></speech>

It is important we enhance our reputation as peacekeepers and use this opportunity in the 30 separate locations across the world mentioned by the Taoiseach.  Having been at St. Patrick's Day celebrations in China and in eastern Europe, I fully understand the value of making sure we promote Ireland.  However, on this particular occasion it is important we use it to support the Ukrainians in their hour of need and to ensure they are not forgotten in any part of the world.</p>  <p>  I also suggest that the Taoiseach invite the President of Ukraine to address both Houses of the Oireachtas through Zoom at some stage.  He is due to that this evening in London.  It would be a way to show we are with him and his people in this hour of need.  When we had our hour of need, we had allies.  We must ensure we continue to make the Ukrainian people aware we are with them in whatever way we can, humanitarian or whatever else, to ensure we get them over their hour of need.</p></speech>

We have maintained contact with the Ukrainian Government.  I spoke last week to the Prime Minister, Mr. Denys Shmyhal.  On behalf of everybody, I committed our continued humanitarian support and, in terms of the sanctions, our full support of a very proactive policy on sanctions to act not just as a deterrent but to try to put pressure on the Russian regime to end the war, have a complete cessation of violence and to allow dialogue to happen to create an environment for people to escape from the extraordinary terror and anxiety to which they are being subjected at present and which we see on our television screens every evening.</p> <p>This year St. Patrick's day will be different.  It will be different because on all our minds will be the plight of the people of Ukraine.  This must govern our actions and shape how we respond.  It is as simple as that.</p></speech>

It is particularly apt and important right now in the context of the past 12 days.  It would have shown a clear signal of solidarity and our determination to stand with the people of Ukraine.  It has not proven possible for, in truth, technical reasons.  I listened carefully to what the Taoiseach said earlier on Leaders' Questions, that we have to look outside the norms in this crisis and look outside the box.

They will discuss the Russian invasion as it impacts on the economy and on energy supply.  No doubt they will also discuss military matters.  Of course they will.  Perhaps no official decisions will be made in this regard but a process will be got under way without a doubt.  Yet there are no statements on that meeting in the House this week.  There should be statements on this issue in the House this week.</p> <p>When there is a meeting of the European Council, we have statements beforehand.</p></speech>

Let us have an informal debate.  When the European Council meets, we have pre-meeting statements and post-meeting statements.  This meeting is more important than 95% or even 99% of the European Council meetings held in recent times but there are to be no statements.  Why not?  I propose a special meeting of the Business Committee this afternoon to arrange such a debate.  Will the House agree to that?</p></speech>

I would be grateful if the Business Committee could hold an urgent meeting with regard to scheduling such an engagement.  We spoke to the Ukrainian ambassador this morning and she is very much in favour of the proposal.  She has agreed to contact the President's office directly, pending, of course, the approval of the House.  I would be grateful for the support of the Government and all parties and Independent Members in the House in that regard.</p></speech>

Conclusions will not be drawn from it.  I would not be as conspiratorial as the Deputy about it.  On the one hand, it will deal with a number of issues pertaining to the strategic compass.  On the following day, the economic repercussions of the war and of the Covid pandemic and the economic future of Europe will be discussed.  It will be a general discussion and more exploratory with regard to its breadth.  On Thursday, I anticipate discussions on the security crisis arising from the war in Ukraine.  We expect to be briefed on the war in Ukraine and where matters lie in that regard.</p><p>On Deputy Berry's point, that is fundamentally a matter for the Oireachtas.  The Government will co-operate with and be of assistance to the Oireachtas in facilitating President Zelenskiy addressing the D&aacute;il or a joint sitting of the Oireachtas.  I would have no issue with that, subject to facilitating President Zelenskiy because every presentation of this kind he undertakes carries security risks from his perspective and that of Ukraine.  We will do whatever we can to be of assistance.  We are well aware of what Ukraine wants and what it is seeking from the European Union.  We have provided our full <i>per capita </i>contribution to the European peace facility.  We have also provided humanitarian aid and have agreed with the European Union in respect of visas and so on.</p></speech>

Agreed.</p></speech>

We are witnessing the largest displacement of people in Europe since the Second World War.  To stop this humanitarian disaster, we have to stop the war.  Members of the Government have speculated that Ireland might be required to accommodate up to 100,000 refugees.  This is a huge scale of people seeking refuge and the question arises as to how a system that is already stretched can accommodate a challenge like this.  Where will these refugees live and what is the accommodation plan?</p></speech>

It is farcical in itself but makes no sense at all from a Covid perspective.  Covid has not gone away.  I just have to say that.</p></speech>

I just had to get it off my chest because I found it incredible what we did, as a collective group in an enclosed space, when we have technology available to vote and enable a vote to be done.  We really should cop on a small bit.</p>  <p>  In regard to the biggest humanitarian crisis we have seen since the Second World War because of the war on Ukraine, every effort will be made by the Government to co-ordinate and do what we can.  There are no immediate answers, but what it will mean is that some of the norms that would characterise business as usual will have to be put to one side in terms of enabling facilities and allowing work to be done to create accommodation.  We no longer have the luxury of saying we cannot have this development over here or that development over there.  The crisis is going to be so big, in my view, that we will have to pull out all the stops as quickly as we can, as a society and as a Government, to do what we need to do.</p></speech>

This illness is suffered by up to 100,000 women in Ireland but we do not know the overall figures.  I have three questions for the Taoiseach in this regard.  What will the Government do to tackle the waiting time for diagnosis of endometriosis, which can take up to nine years?  Is the Government seeking to upskill GPs and provide adequate screening tools to help diagnose the illness more quickly?  Will the Taoiseach commit to a national strategy for endometriosis, such as exists in France and Australia?</p></speech>

The rate of the increases is raising many questions as to whether it is solely down to global factors or if there is a possibility that price gouging is happening at the pumps as we speak.  Will the Taoiseach investigate whether there is price gouging?  Otherwise, there is no guarantee that any mooted VAT or excise reductions will be passed on to consumers.  It is an important issue.</p></speech>

There could be evidence of some price gouging going on but, clearly, there is a broader issue of an increase in fuel prices, which is receiving the Government's active attention right now.  I take the Deputy's point and do not disagree with the need to be vigilant to make sure price gouging is not occurring.</p></speech>

I trust the Government is doing everything possible to assist Irish citizens in getting out.  By now, there are numerous and credible reports of blatant racism against refugees trying to flee Ukraine, including racism both by the Ukrainian military and by, for example, Polish border guards.</p></speech>

As a correspondent with experience covering a number of wars, he has said he cannot get over the comprehensive and very efficient response of the Polish authorities to an enormous migration of Ukrainians into Poland.  Nobody would tolerate or accept any racism being applied to any migrants, but we have to be balanced on this.  The Deputy said there is wholesale racism.

Following negotiations during the summer of 2021, in which the Taoiseach and I were involved, the centre accepted an interim funding agreement with the Department based on a commitment that talks would continue and a framework would be put in place to provide for sustainable payment and security of jobs at the centre.  Will the Taoiseach update us on the framework?  Will he provide us with an update on the out-of-school provision report, which was initiated in 2017?  When are we likely to see it published?</p></speech>

The centre plays a very important role in providing an holistic educational service.  As a result of discussions, a package of support of &euro;175,500 and 6,000 teaching hours to the centre for this school year is now being provided.  It is important to state this level of co-operation is a baseline level of provision for the centre from both the Department of Education and the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.  The scope of the review of the out-of-school sector, which the Deputy talked about, includes Cork Life Centre.  The recommendations of the review will inform future policy.  It will be published shortly.</p></speech>

As we celebrate it, many of us are thinking of the women of Ukraine who are fleeing their home country because of a war of Russia's making.  I fully support Ireland's commitment of 100,000 welcomes to 100,000 Ukrainians, but unfortunately, many of the women who will be coming here from Ukraine will still face inequality when they get here.</p> <p>In the spirit of International Women's Day, how do we plan to support Ukrainian women arriving here in Ireland in terms of housing, healthcare, childcare and community provision?</p></speech>

The accommodation piece will be very challenging, as will education, in terms of the provision of interpreting and translation services and matching numbers.  Some schools will be in a position to absorb numbers and others will not be in a position to absorb such high numbers.  It is going to be very challenging, but we will do everything we possibly can.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-08a.164" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1550" speakername="Cian O'Callaghan" time="15:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030800019#T00400"><p>I move:</p> <blockquote> 	That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to create an offence of requiring or accepting sex as a condition of accommodation and an offence of arranging or facilitating the requirement or acceptance of sex as a condition of accommodation. </blockquote>  <p>This Bill seeks to introduce a specific criminal offence for the practice of demanding sex in lieu of rent.  It will also create a specific offence for the advertising of sex in lieu of rent, both for individuals placing such advertisements and also for anyone, whether platforms or publications, publishing or accepting such advertisements.  The intention in the Bill is clear.  The penalties that are outlined in it include imprisonment of up to seven years or a fine.  The Minister for Justice has confirmed to the D&aacute;il that no specific criminal offence for this practice currently exists.  The Garda has informed the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage that the PULSE system does not record sex for rent complaints as a specific category.  This is not surprising, as the practice is not a specific criminal offence in legislation currently.</p><p>In a crisis, there are always people who will seek to exploit others who are vulnerable and in desperate need of accommodation.  This practice shows the depraved depths of the housing crisis, where a small minority of grossly exploitative landlords expect sexual favours in return for putting a roof over people's heads.  It is completely and utterly unacceptable.  It is an abhorrent practice.  No one should be subjected to these kinds of demands when they are looking for somewhere to live.  It is particularly worrying that migrants, who often have reduced access to support networks, information and advice, have been targeted in particular.  Unfortunately, no comparable research has been done in Ireland, but research done in the UK by the housing and homeless charity Shelter suggests that 30,000 women in the UK were propositioned for sex in lieu of rent between March 2020 and January 2021, which is a period of less than a year.  That shows the extent of the problem.</p><p>I commend Ann Murphy of the <i>Irish Examiner</i>, who has highlighted this problem through her very high-quality investigative journalism.  She has done a very important piece of work in giving visibility to what some renters have been subjected to.  One young Italian woman told the <i>Irish Examiner</i>that trying to find a room in Dublin &quot;is like falling in a dangerous hell&quot;.  She made that comment after she had been on the receiving end of multiple requests and demands for sex in lieu of rent.</p><p>We are seeking cross-party support for this Bill and calling on the Government to ensure the speedy passage of the legislation.  While this kind of exploitation can be more severe during a crisis and people can take advantage of the crisis, it is very important to reiterate that no one is suggesting that this type of abhorrent behaviour is any way reflective of landlords in general.  In fact, rather than it being a practice linked to traditional landlords, there is some evidence it is linked, in some instances, to people who are attempting to sublet rooms.</p><p>Before I conclude, I wish to reference one example that Ann Murphy covered in the <i>Irish Examiner</i>.  She told the story of one woman in Waterford city who responded to an advertisement for a room in October 2021.  After the woman moved into the accommodation, the landlord told her she could live there without paying rent in exchange for sex, and she moved out.  The landlord then tried, on multiple occasions, to contact the woman.  After that, the landlord actually turned up at her workplace, which is utterly unacceptable.  That level of intimidation has no place at all in Ireland.  Renters should not be subject to such exploitative behaviour that makes them feel unsafe.  Women and migrants should not be subjected to these attempts of gross exploitation when all they are seeking is simply somewhere safe to live and shelter.  I ask for cross-party support for the Bill.  The Government has committed to do something about this issue.  The Bill is ready for the Government, if it wants to progress the legislation.</p></speech>

The board is chaired by the Secretary General to the Government and its membership consists of all Secretaries General of Departments and heads of major offices.  The board meets, in general, once a month and the minutes of these meetings are available on the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform web page on <i>gov.ie</i>.  The Civil Service renewal programme management office, based in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, co-ordinates and drives the Civil Service renewal plan.</p><p>Civil Service Renewal 2030 is a ten-year strategy that looks to build on the achievements of the 2014 Civil Service renewal plan.  The strategy is centred on three core themes, namely, delivering evidence-informed policy and services; harnessing digital technology and innovation; and building the Civil Service workforce, workplace and organisation of the future.  The ten-year strategic framework, throughout its lifetime, will deliver the following: a continuous improvement approach to our policy development capacity, including investment in strategic policy infrastructure and improved policy co-ordination across the whole of Government; and enhanced transparency as to how and why public data is being used to inform policy development and benefit society.  In terms of digital first and innovation, the framework will ensure 90% of applicable public services will be available and consumed online and designed with the customer at the centre, while the work of staff will augmented through appropriate analytical, automation and other digital tools.  In terms of workforce, workplace and organisation of the future, there will be strategically planned workforce requirements based on capacity, capability and skills needs and the use of flexible working models for greater impact and agility.  There will also be an equal, diverse, inclusive, engaged and empowered workforce.</p><p>The strategy will be implemented through a series of three-year action plans.  The plans detail the precise goals and initiatives that will progress each of the strategic priorities.  Our progress on the commitments within these action plans will be continually measured, evaluated, and reported on.  The first such action plan, Civil Service Renewal 2024, has been published and will deliver on specific actions over the next three years.</p></reply>

My colleague, Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell, raised the issue of the board's work with the Taoiseach last month.  The Taoiseach confirmed then that the board had not met in some time.  In fact, it has not met since 2016.  That is six years ago.  Has the board been stood down?</p><p><i>4 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p>If so, is that because it had concluded its work?  If so, was the decision to stand down the Civil Service accountability board formally announced at any stage?</p> <p> The Civil Service management board, by distinction, does meet regularly and is tasked with strengthening the performance of the Civil Service, strategic oversight and delivery of stringent governance, as the Taoiseach described, but it does not seem to have any accountability function.  The Civil Service Renewal 2030 strategy published last year briefly notes the strategy will build a Civil Service that encourages - that is the word it uses - accountability and this work will be supported by accountability mechanisms, but those are the only references to accountability in the entire strategy.  What body or board is currently responsible for ensuring effective accountability of Civil Service and public service management?  Specifically, I ask the Taoiseach to answer my questions in respect of the Civil Service accountability board which, as I stated, has not met since 2016.</p></speech>

How many employees of Departments are currently working remotely, in percentage terms or in real terms?  Every time I, one of my staff or even a constituent picks up a phone to seek to talk to somebody within a Department, we are met with an answering machine.  Strangely, many of these answering machines actually declare the messages will not be checked.  We are living in 2022.  This is a tech island and it is really difficult for people to understand that phones cannot be diverted to people who are working remotely.  I am very much in favour of people working remotely.  It is a good thing.  I represent Meath West.  Half the people of County Meath are forced to leave the county every day to go to work.  It is a good thing that people are able to work from home.  Can we not have a system, however, whereby phone calls are diverted to key staff so we can talk to them and gain an understanding of questions on which we are working?</p>  <p>  I raised a question with the Department of Transport in respect of salaries within the Department.  I was told the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, has a PR adviser on a salary of more than &euro;93,000 per year.  We have been talking about largesse in Civil Service wages for a long time.  That salary is incredible because this particular role does not provide anything whatsoever of benefit to citizens.  Does the Taoiseach have any PR consultants?  What wages are they on?</p></speech>

When I was briefed by the Department of Finance, it said the war in Ukraine and the impact on energy prices was going to add another 4% on top of that in terms of further inflation.  I ask the Taoiseach to confirm that and update the House on it.  In that regard, when public servants, of whom the Government is the employer, are limited to 1% increases, that means the people the Government employs are going to be suffering significant wage cuts in the coming period.  In that context, does the Taoiseach think we need to revise that and give pay increases to public and civil servants, and indeed all workers, but particularly the ones this Government employs, to compensate for the spiralling cost of living?</p></speech>

There is a growing movement demanding a four-day week, understanding it would cut carbon emissions by up to 20% and, obviously, provide significantly more work-life balance for workers.  Workers understand that productivity has gone through the roof yet the hours people work and much of the wages they get have remained the same, with the benefits going to the bosses, by and large.  According to the OECD, workers in Ireland add $110 to GDP for every hour they work, twice the level that pertained in 2008.  GDP per hour worked has doubled in Ireland in the past 15 years but where is the reduction in working hours and the increase in wages?  Is this something the Civil Service management board has considered?</p></speech>

It has not met since 2016.  In fact, two Governments have now passed and we need to reflect on what are the best accountability mechanisms in terms of civil servants more generally and otherwise.  There are internal accountability mechanisms, of course, within the various pieces of legislation, such as the ministerial Act, that govern the role of the Minister and the role of Secretaries General in terms of accountability, benchmarking, standards and so forth.  The Civil Service management board was established under the 2014 Civil Service renewal plan.  It comprises Secretaries General and heads of offices and is chaired by the Secretary General to the Government.  It provides a forum, mainly for sharing issues and challenging and strengthening the performance of the Civil Service as a collective.  The immediate focus of the board is on overseeing the implementation of the priorities in the Civil Service renewal plan and implementing the ambitious programme of reform in the Civil Service Renewal 2030 strategy and the Civil Service Renewal 2024 action plan.  As I stated, the minutes of that meeting are available on the website of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p>  <p>  In terms of wider issues of accountability, there are accountability mechanisms within each Department according to the layers of staff and so on and at different levels-----</p></speech>

It just happened around 2016.  I will have to check that out again and come back to the Deputy on it.</p>  <p>  In relation to the point raised by Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n, I do not have a figure here in terms of how many people within the public service are working remotely.  There was during the pandemic a general view that if we could facilitate off-site working, obviously for public health objectives at the time, we should do so.  That was achieved but workers are now returning to work.  I will endeavour to get some assessment for the Deputy in respect of the numbers and the situation in terms of how many staff members are availing of remote working, how many are coming back to the office and what type of pattern will emerge into the future in terms of how many days are worked in office and how many days are worked out of office. </p>  <p>  I will follow up on the Deputy's point regarding phone calls being directed to key staff.  It is a reasonable point that there is a need to get access to public servants who are in decision-making mode or who can answer or respond to a query, as opposed to getting an answering machine.  There are other mechanisms, as all present are aware, in terms of seeking responses on issues or in terms of information that Deputies may seek from given Departments.  That should be readily available.  Departments generally take a proactive approach in that regard.  For example, the Department of Social Protection, Revenue and others provide information up front on websites and so on.  That will continue to be the case.  It is also the approach in terms of publishing strategy documents and so on.</p>  <p>  As regards the final point raised by the Deputy, I am not aware of the specific position.  I do not employ a PR consultant in my Department.</p></speech>

I can recall right throughout the pandemic the clarion call was for more communications on issues of vital importance to employers, employees, the general public and various sectors of the economy.  Communications are important in that respect and information is given and presented to people.</p>  <p>  In respect of the points made by Deputy Boyd Barrett around spiralling inflation, I agree with regard to the situation prior to the war in Ukraine but, again, security-related issues and issues in relation to the management of oil stocks and in terms of the release of oil and gas from Russia all had an impact, along with the pandemic.  As economies are coming out of the pandemic, an imbalance between supply and demand has arisen.  Demand rose dramatically as societies emerged from the pandemic.  There was an inability to meet that with supply, and inflation occurred.  It was 5.7% in February.  I cannot confirm right now what the Deputy is saying in respect of it rising to 8% or 9% but that could be the case.  Given what has happened in Ukraine, it is likely to increase.  The Deputy is familiar with the fact that the price of a barrel of oil on the international markets has gone from $96 on 25 February to approximately $130 today.</p> <p>That shows how international and global this problem is.  Likewise, the UK natural gas and wholesale markets are now trading at approximately &pound;5.70 a therm, which is a near-record high after prices more than doubled last week.  This day last year, gas cost 45p a therm.</p> <p> The latest Central Statistics Office data on wages show that average hourly earnings in the fourth quarter of 2021 were up 2.6% from a year earlier and were up 8.2% from the fourth quarter of 2019.  The average annual consumer price index inflation rate was 2.4% in 2021 and -0.3% in 2020.</p> <p> We are actively considering the situation right now because of the war in Ukraine.  We took measures a couple of weeks ago to the value of &euro;500 million.  We introduced an electricity rebate and lowered the drugs payment scheme threshold.  Transport charges are being reduced from the end of April, which will benefit 800,000 users.  A fuel allowance lump sum payment of &euro;125 will be paid to 390,000 recipients.  Those measures will have an impact but the Government is giving active consideration to the current situation arising out of the war on Ukraine and its impact on oil prices.  </p> <p> Deputy Paul Murphy raised the issue of a four-day week within the public service, which we have not given consideration to.  There have been various discussions and debates but in real terms I consider that this proposal is some time off yet in terms of where we are now.  Full research needs to be undertaken in respect of such an initiative, which would have a very significant impact all around.  We have announced an extra bank holiday the day after St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day, which will be on St. Brigid&rsquo;s Day every year after that.  I believe I have covered all of the questions raised.</p></speech>

I met the German Chancellor, Olaf Scholz.  We discussed the extremely concerning situation in Ukraine which has deteriorated significantly since our meeting.  Ireland stands with our EU partners in making clear that there can be no compromise on Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity.  The invasion by Russia of Ukraine and its attack on its people is an outrageous and immoral breach of the most fundamental and basic principles of international law.  Our thoughts are with the people of Ukraine in their most difficult hour.</p>  <p>  The Chancellor and I discussed bilateral relations between our two countries.  Ireland and Germany are old and close friends and relations between us are growing stronger all the time.  We looked forward to deepening even further our economic and trade links and to strengthening cultural connections between our two countries.  We also work closely together in the EU, where we are of like mind on so many of the vital challenges we face.</p>  <p>  The Chancellor and I also discussed a number of issues on the European Council's agenda, including economic recovery and investment.  As we drive forward with the green and digital transformations, we need to ensure we take advantage of these new opportunities to deliver high-quality and high-skilled jobs across the European Union.  Our Governments share a high level of ambition on climate action and we both support the EU's climate goals for 2030 and beyond.</p>  <p>  I was glad to have the opportunity to thank the Chancellor in person for Germany's support and solidarity throughout the Brexit process.  I also took the opportunity to brief Chancellor Scholz on the difficult political situation in Northern Ireland, and the importance of ensuring a period of calm ahead of the Northern Ireland Assembly elections in May.  Both Ireland and Germany want to see a strong and durable partnership between the European Union and the United Kingdom in the future.  For this to happen, existing agreements, including the protocol, need to be implemented in good faith.</p>  <p>  While in Berlin I had a meeting with Dr. Christian Bruch, CEO of Siemens Energy, and representatives of IDA Ireland, during which we discussed the outlook for renewable energy development across Europe and here in Ireland.</p>  <p>  Before departing Berlin, I laid a wreath on behalf of the Government and the people of Ireland at the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe.</p></reply>

It is absolutely telling that when the Taoiseach finished his comments, he mentioned that he laid a wreath at a memorial to those who perished in the Holocaust.  Just last week, we saw the graveyard of many people who had been killed by Nazi soldiers in Ukraine bombed again.</p>  <p>  My four supplementary questions might not relate directly to the Taoiseach's recent meeting but might be relevant to future discussions.  I would have liked to have talked a great deal more about the economy and Ireland&rsquo;s bilateral relationship.  I will put my four questions.  First, do the Taoiseach and the Chancellor believe there is scope for further EU sanctions against Russia?  I believe a great deal more can be done in respect of tying up loopholes.  Second, what discussions were there on future energy divestment?  I refer not only to moving away from a reliance on fossil fuels but also and in particular from a reliance on imported gas and oil from Russia.  Third, an area that needs real focus is greater co-operation between Ireland, Germany and all partners in identifying security threats.  Fourth, has there been any discussion on organising refugee airlifts from Poland?</p></speech>

Russia&rsquo;s violation of international law and its succession of war crimes have played out and continue to play out before the eyes of the world.  Nearly 2 million men, women and children are estimated to have fled.  As today is International Women&rsquo;s Day, we are particularly mindful of the Ukrainian women who have fled in such numbers with their children and we send our solidarity to them.  Under the Geneva Convention, Russia has an international obligation to open humanitarian corridors to facilitate evacuations and to enable NGOs to provide food, water and medicine for those who remain.  As a respected non-aligned nation with a long and distinguished history of peacekeeping and a seat on the UN Security Council, I believe we are very well placed to press for that.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-08a.219" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1478" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="16:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030800021#V02100"><p>Today, the Taoiseach once again rightly, as we all do, condemned the crimes against humanity of Vladimir Putin in the invasion of Ukraine.  The Taoiseach has cited his support for sanctions and so on against Russia, with the possible replacement of Russian gas and energy.  The Taoiseach may be interested to know that as one response to this, President Joseph Biden&rsquo;s advisers are considering that he should go to Saudi Arabia to replace Russian oil with Saudi Arabian oil.  I wonder what the Taoiseach thinks about the irony of this because Saudi Arabia is a brutal dictatorship supported by the US and the UK, armed by them, and engaged in a bloody war in Yemen.  Does the Taoiseach think it would be consistent to replace the oil and gas from Russia, one despotic warmongering country, with the oil of another despotic warmongering country, Saudi Arabia?</p></speech>

If not, will he raise it at the meeting in Versailles?  This is a demand from ordinary people in Ukraine for a cancellation of the debt which is a crushing burden on the economy.  The total foreign debt of Ukraine is $125 billion and debt-servicing expenditure for 2022 is expected to be around $6.2 billion, or 12% of all state budgetary expenditure in the year.  The IMF component of that debt is approximately one half.  The people of Ukraine are subject to a brutal austerity programme by virtue of an IMF so-called bailout.  The people of Ukraine are saying that this debt needs to be completely cancelled.</p> <p>That is an immediate assistance that could be provided to the people.  Will the Taoiseach raise this at the meeting in Versailles?</p></speech>

Some of us met the Ukrainian ambassador earlier.  She is calling for the Russian ambassador here to be given his marching orders and, beyond that, to cut off seaports and such to the Russians.  This creates difficulties, particularly for Germany.  What conversations have there been in that regard at EU level?  I also accept Deputy Boyd Barrett's comment with regard to Saudi Arabia and the fact that the west has failed to deal with other sets of oppressors and invaders.  Was there any conversation about the dangers of hybrid and cyber attacks?  What mitigations are there in respect of the energy costs we are dealing with?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-08a.223" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1591" speakername="Barry Cowen" time="16:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030800022#W00300"><p>Did the Taoiseach discuss the energy crisis during his meeting with the German Chancellor?  For example, did the Taoiseach seek the German Chancellor's support were he to raise at the meeting in Versailles the option for the European Union to champion the provision of a European renewable super-energy grid, combining the potential of Ireland's west coast offshore capabilities with southern Europe's solar potential?  While this would surpass the programme for Government commitments in this regard by the Government, it would be the beginning of a solution that would see us at the start of a pipe rather than at the end of one for Russian gas.  This creates a huge opportunity for our country and for Europe and I hope the Taoiseach will initiate a process in the leadership meeting to allow Europe to return at the next meeting with a response to that request.</p></speech>

Presumably, he will attend the meeting of European leaders in Versailles this week and, no doubt, will encourage other European leaders to follow his example.  Who will provide a voice of sanity at this gathering and say, "No"?  Europe should not engage in a massive arms race.  The Continent should not be divided into armed camps.  Will anyone dare to point out that a German rearmament, an arms race and increased co-operation with the United States and NATO will play into Putin's hands and make it easier for him to rally Russians behind him and try to undermine the anti-war movement in that country?  Will Ireland provide such a voice of sanity, or will the Irish Government join with the other leaders and take further steps down the road of militarising Europe?</p></speech>

The reduction of VAT and excise duties would drastically reduce the cost of fuel immediately.  Many other countries have done it, yet this Government appears not to have even asked the European Union if it can do it.  Also, with regard to OPEC, what pressure is this country and the international community putting on OPEC to increase the supply of oil into the market to help with the cost spikes?</p>  <p>  Finally, should this time not be used to redouble our efforts to decarbonise the economy for global warming reasons, cost-of-living reasons and geopolitical reasons?  Should we not be looking to increase the number of microgeneration units that can have access to the grid with a feed-in tariff?  Should there not be more of an effort now to provide grants for electric cars?  Should there not be a stronger effort to reduce our level of dependence on carbon fuels?</p></speech>

That is the ultimate way out of this, so that countries do not have leverage to shield and protect their despotic regimes.  That is the lesson.  Germany has worked very hard for decades to reach out the hand of friendship to Russia, to work with Russia and to have strategic patience in terms of how Russia might develop and so forth.  I do not decry, and we are in no position to lecture, Germany now.  Germany has not invested in its military to the same extent as others have for decades, for obvious historical reasons.  However, this attack, turning the world's rule-based order upside down, means Germany has to take the action it is taking.  I cannot criticise Germany for what it is doing.  Germany must make sure that its people and its way of life are protected.  It is vulnerable.  Europe is vulnerable now, if one looks at the array of military hardware that was on display at sea, in the air and on the ground by Russia in the last month or so.  We have to wake up and smell the coffee.</p></speech>

The most recent formal meeting I had took place on 15 April 2021 when I met with the leaders of the all-island Christian churches, including the Roman Catholic Church, the Church of Ireland, the Presbyterian Church, the Methodist Church and the Irish Council of Churches.  We discussed the ongoing contribution to peace building and the work churches undertake on an ongoing and daily basis at community level in Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  The church leaders and I recognised the remaining years of the decade of centenaries as profoundly important and sensitive moments in engaging with the shared history of these islands, and agreed that it would be important to promote a sensitive, inclusive and respectful approach in the marking of the centenaries still to come.  I briefed the church leaders on the Government's shared island initiative.  Both the church leaders and I recognise the importance of dialogue, engagement and respect for all communities and traditions on these islands.</p>  <p>  The church leaders and I agreed that the pandemic has posed challenges for all citizens in terms of their mental health and well-being, and recognised the importance of faith to the spiritual and mental well-being of many people and communities.  Thankfully, restrictions have been lifted and places of worship are now fully open.</p></reply>

In this country, church organisations have played a pretty terrible role, historically, in their treatment of women and their denial of rights to women.  This is something we have begun to overcome with the successful campaigns to repeal the eighth amendment, for marriage equality and so forth.  Yet, it is still the intention of this Government to pay for the new maternity hospital we need, but to leave it in the ownership of the Sisters of Charity.</p> <p>This is an organisation that was part of the Ryan report and the residential institutions Bill; in other words guilty of abuse of women.  It will be leased from them through a company that will be owned by the Sisters of Charity.  By the way, at present, as I highlighted last week, they are just about to evict a blind 70-year-old woman who was in one of those institutions on that site.  She still has not received compensation for her treatment at the hands of the Sisters of Charity.  She is now being evicted by them.  This is the organisation to which the Taoiseach will give the national maternity hospital.  The Sisters of Charity have cancelled the lease with the HSE, which provided disability housing for this woman.  Does the Taoiseach really think this organisation, which is doing this to women such as Eleanor, should be handed the national maternity hospital?</p></speech>

This is after a decade of talk following the forum on patronage in 2012.  At this rate it will take 3,000 years to finally have a secular primary school system in this country.  Even more alarming are the reports today that the church may be doing with these schools exactly what Deputy Boyd Barrett explained in respect of the national maternity hospital, that is, hanging on to ownership of the schools and expecting the State to pay it rent every year for the use of the schools.  Will the Taoiseach clarify whether the schools are being fully transferred into public ownership or will they be leased from them?  When will the full details of the deal be published?  We stand for fully secular, fully public education and healthcare.  They should be taken fully out of the control of the church and into the hands of the State, democratically controlled by staff, parents and the communities they serve.</p></speech>

The Bill would remove the issue of a school's ethos as grounds for not fully teaching objective sex education.  In the aftermath of the killing of Ashling Murphy I suspect there is massive support in society for a range of legislative changes, including the passing of such a Bill.  One in five detected sex crimes reported to garda&iacute; involved people aged under 18 as victim and perpetrator.  Is the Taoiseach prepared to tell church leaders that school ethos can no longer interfere with the teaching of objective sex education?

Needless to say, this is very disappointing; it is alarming actually.  The Taoiseach did not indicate whether he has had this discussion with the religious leaders.  What progress has the Minister made in his discussions with the Church of Ireland on these matters?  Has he formally requested a meeting with Archbishop Eamon Martin to discuss these matters?  It is important to say, although this is known, religious orders require the approval of local bishops to open any of these homes.  We know from testimony and State records that the Catholic church and the Church of Ireland were deeply involved in the operation of these institutions, all under the watchful eye of the State.  Will the Taoiseach shed some light on this?  On the issue of the redress scheme itself, I appeal to the Taoiseach on behalf of children who were boarded out and who experienced heartbreaking exploitation, neglect and abuse in the families and communities in which they were placed.  The Government cannot proceed with any redress scheme that excludes these victims.</p></speech>

It has been a while since her death.  It is horrendous that when Deputies discuss this shocking event they bring into question the role of the education system in this country.  They bring into question the role of the curriculum, the teachers and the people who have been delivering education in this country.  There is no link between the two and efforts to make a link between that shocking event and the education system is absolutely wrong.  I listened to the debates when they happened a while ago.  I refused to get involved because I did not want to politicise that shocking event in any way.  It is an awful pity that it is still being done in the D&aacute;il.</p>  <p>  We live in a pluralist republic.  In a pluralist republic Catholic, Protestant and dissenter should be able to be who they are to their full extent without fear or favour from the State.  Parents should be able to select the education system they want for their children.  No two children are the same.  The idea we should create a uniform education system to replicate the uniform education system of the 1950s, except with a different ethos, is absolutely wrong.  Pluralism should be the goal of this Republic.</p></speech>

The Government is not handing anything over to anybody.  That is the first point I will make on the national maternity hospital.  The original objective of all of this, in terms of clinical advice, was that a new maternity hospital should be aligned with a tertiary hospital.  This was recommended 20 years ago.  It happened in Cork with the maternity hospital we built.  Two public maternity hospitals agreed to go to a new site at Cork University Hospital.  At the time we got a state-of-the-art maternity and neonatal hospital built.  The idea was that it would be alongside a trauma and level 4 hospital.  The same was to happen in all of the Dublin hospitals but this has not happened and we need to reflect on this.</p>  <p>  The reason clinicians say we need it to be adjacent to a tertiary hospital is for the best outcomes for women.  In certain cases where women could get into difficulty in pregnancy being adjacent to a tertiary hospital, where immediate intervention could occur, could save the life of a woman.  Likewise with a neonatal unit available the life of a baby can be saved.  This was the original motivation behind Holles Street engaging with St. Vincent's hospital.  We seem to have forgotten this in the debate that has ensued.</p>  <p>  Governance is very important.  If the State is investing 100% in a full facility - and it is the State that will finance the hospital - then the State has to be on the board and in the governance structures.  It has to be reflected because it is a long-term operation.  I also think in terms of ownership it has to be reflected.  Prior to the Government coming into office Mr. Kieran Mulvey had been asked by the previous Government to engage in a process of mediation, which he did.  He came up with an outcome that at the time was agreed and accepted all round.  It was raised again.  Approximately one year ago we were not happy with some aspects of it and there was a big public debate.  There have been further discussions with all of the stakeholders.  The objective remains to build a state-of-the-art maternity hospital adjacent to a tertiary hospital of the quality of St. Vincent's that will provide for women for the next 50 to 100 years.  The current conditions are appalling.  They are absolutely not acceptable in the 21st century.</p>  <p>  People say we should go somewhere else as if we could just click our fingers, switch on the light bulb and get a new site somewhere on its own and develop a new hospital.  I only wish it were so simple.</p></speech>

It has gone on far too long for the well-being of women in particular.  I read the recent correspondence from consultants who are adamant.  Everybody who has anything to do with this is adamant that all procedures, operations, diagnostics and everything allowable in this country will take place in this maternity hospital.  What worries me is that from the time of decision, because of all of the discussions that have ensued in the past year with the stakeholders, we will then have to get to design, then tender and then get the hospital built.  This will take its own time.  The balance is not in the debate at that moment.  This is genuinely my sense of it.  The Minister will bring forward a memorandum to the Government that we will bring before the House where it will be debated.</p> <p>I am very clear that there is an imperative to get this hospital built and that there should be no religious ethos underpinning it or having any role in it, good bad or indifferent.</p></speech>

That is nine above the 2009 figure of 150.  At post-primary level, the number of multidenominational schools has increased by circa 11%, from 321 in 2009 to 359 in 2020.  That is 359 out of 800 or 850, if I am not mistaken.  I can check that figure.  It has moved much more quickly at post-primary level.</p>  <p>  I accept elements of what Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n said.  In 1998, the idea was to establish a pluralist basis for education and to give parents the right to choose a particular form of education.  There were different patrons, including Gaelscoil patrons and Educate Together.  By the way, as Minister for Education, I facilitated the growth of Educate Together by reducing the contribution that patrons had to make towards site acquisition.  At the time, that condition was very prohibitive and was the biggest barrier to building new schools.  There are other patrons for religious ethos schools, including Church of Ireland and Catholic schools, and various trusts have been set up as the orders have declined in numbers.  What has evolved over time is a pluralist system of provision.  That has been made possible by State investment.  It is a more expensive model than simply providing one uniform type of school across the board.  </p>  <p>  I favour greater involvement of the education and training boards in any new schools at primary level because they have capacity and resources to provide for schools.  When I was last in government, that Government was the first to develop State-owned vocational education committee, VEC, primary schools in the Dublin area, where there were fast growing populations and a need for such schools.  Multidenominational patrons and Educate Together have grown their administrative capacity to be able to accommodate the expansion of multidenominational and non-denominational education.  Equally, if parents want to send their children to a school with a particular religious ethos, they are entitled to do so.  Plebiscites are held in given locations.  There is transparent election in which parents vote for their choice of school patron.</p></speech>

Women face particular challenges and hardships in times of conflict and it is important that any response to conflict and the displacement of people specifically and particularly acknowledges the needs of women and children.  I know that everyone in this House is thinking today of the women facing impossible choices as they try to protect their families from war.</p>  <p>  Anuraidh, ar L&aacute; Idirn&aacute;isi&uacute;nta na mBan, labhra&iacute;omar faoi thionchar na paind&eacute;ime ar mhn&aacute;.  I mbliana, t&aacute;imid i riocht i bhfad n&iacute;os fearr agus srianta &aacute; scaoileadh againn ach caithfimid f&oacute;s a bheith aireach ar na tortha&iacute; fadt&eacute;armacha a bheidh ag na freagra&iacute; ar an bpaind&eacute;im ar fhosta&iacute;ocht ban agus ar dhualgais ch&uacute;raim.  Tugann an ghluaiseacht gan fasach i dtreo na cianoibre deis d&uacute;inn r&aacute;ta rannph&aacute;irt&iacute;ochta saothair na mban a mh&eacute;ad&uacute; ach beidh g&aacute; le monat&oacute;ireacht ch&uacute;ramach ionas nach bac eile a bheith ann do dhul chun cinn gairme na mban.</p>  <p>  At this time last year, we were reflecting on the impact of the Covid-19 restrictions on women.  Twelve months on, we are in a better place when it comes to the pandemic but now is the time to apply some of the lessons we have learned from that experience.  For example, work-life balance should not be a choice between a successful career and a fulfilling family life.  The pandemic has reminded us all of the value and benefits of time with family.  Parents should be able to feel like they can continue to have a better balance in their lives and the Government is committed to introducing measures to support this.  Significant advances in the provision of family leave have been made over the past few years, beginning with the introduction of paid parent's leave.  This provides an entitlement to each parent individually to encourage a sharing of the care of a child in their earliest years.  Unpaid parental leave has also been extended.</p>  <p>  The Family Leave and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2021 extended the provision of paid parent's leave to five weeks for each eligible parent and made important changes to the arrangements for adoptive leave, providing, for the first time, choice in which parent avails of the leave.  Parent's leave is due another extension in July this year, which will bring the entitlement to seven weeks for each eligible parent to be taken within the first two years of a child&rsquo;s life or adoptive placement.  The Government will also shortly consider legislative proposals to transpose the remaining elements of the EU work-life balance directive, including a right to request flexible working within the terms of the directive and an entitlement to leave for medical care purposes.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately, the gender pay gap remains significant in Ireland and around the world.  It is indicative of the work still to be done to ensure that women have equal access to economic empowerment.  The effects of the gender pay gap are lifelong and result in women experiencing poverty at higher levels later in life.  According to the latest figures published by EUROSTAT, the gender pay gap in Ireland in 2018 was 11.3% while the gender pay gap across the European Union overall was 14.1%.  </p>  <p>  This Government is serious about further reducing the gender pay gap.  The national strategy for women and girls includes specific commitments on the issue while the programme for Government promises to legislate to require publication of information on the gender pay gap in large companies.  The Gender Pay Gap Information Act 2021 introduced a legislative basis for gender pay gap reporting in Ireland and reporting by organisations with more than 250 employees will begin this year.  Regulations to give effect to this legislation are in preparation and will be published in the coming weeks along with guidance for employers.  Reporting requirements will then be rolled out over the next few years to organisations with more than 150 employees and then to organisations with more than 50 employees.  These requirements will eventually encompass approximately two thirds of employees in the State.  Gender pay gap reporting will help employers to identify the drivers behind their individual gender pay gaps and employers will be required, as part of the reporting process, to explain their gender pay gaps and to propose measures and steps to be taken to address them.  It will also provide transparency for employees on which companies are doing the most to address their gender pay gaps.</p>  <p>  Another area where women have been let down in the past is their health.  Women have specific physical, mental and social health needs and, over too long a period, these have not been sufficiently recognised and invested in.  The Government I lead is committed to changing that.   Today, my colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, joined by all his female colleagues in Government, launched a new women&rsquo;s health action plan for the coming two years.  This plan will see a massive increase in investment in women&rsquo;s health.  For context, in 2020 we spent &euro;4 million on new funding for targeted women&rsquo;s healthcare measures.  In 2022, we will spend &euro;31 million.  That is &euro;48 million in a full year.  We will embed the initiatives we introduced over the past year and we will significantly grow the available supports, services and expertise in contraception, breastfeeding, menopause care, women&rsquo;s mental health and gynaecology.</p> <p>I am grateful for, and acknowledge, the enormous effort from the diverse range of stakeholders who came together to develop this strategy with the Minister.</p> <p> The Citizen&rsquo;s Assembly on Gender Equality made 45 recommendations.  In line with the programme for Government commitment to consider each of the recommendations, Departments are examining the recommendations in detail.  The recommendations are comprehensive, covering care, social protection, education and leadership, as well as recommendations for constitutional amendment.  The Joint Committee on Gender Equality will play a valuable role in the consideration of these recommendations and I know that detailed briefing has been provided by the relevant Departments to assist the committee in its work.</p> <p> Tugann L&aacute; Idirn&aacute;isi&uacute;nta na mBan deis d&uacute;inn f&eacute;achaint conas at&aacute;imid &oacute; thaobh comhionannais inscne de.

While some progress has been made, there is still much work to be done.  Last year, 2021, was a very challenging year, not least in terms of the national reckoning on the issue of violence against women.  In the coming year, we have the opportunity to demonstrate that we meant what we said about things needing to be different in future.  I believe that this can be a watershed year when it comes to gender equality and I look forward to working with Deputies from all sides of the House to try to make it so.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-08a.274" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1502" speakername="Helen McEntee" time="16:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030800025#Z00200"><p>I start by wishing everyone, particularly my female colleagues, a happy International Women's Day.</p>  <p>  Over the past ten days or so, the images reaching us of the devastation from Ukraine have been shocking and almost incomprehensible.  One of the dangers for us, at this remove, is that we become inured to the violence and suffering, that the repetition and relentlessness of these images and stories simply becomes too much, that we become desensitised, that we turn away.  It is important that we guard against this and that today, on International Women's Day, we continue to consider and reflect on the particular plight of Ukrainian women and their families.  Today, and in the days and weeks ahead, we must not succumb to a sense of helplessness or apathy as we see images of more and more Ukrainian women fleeing their homes for sanctuary in desperate circumstances.  They are often fleeing with young children or elderly relatives and often having left their partners behind to continue fighting for their country and for their freedom.  We must give what support each of us can give.  That may be solidarity or it may be charity.  It may be prayers or it may be the offer of sanctuary.  It may be a combination of all of these things, or something entirely different, but we all must do what we can.</p>  <p>  Closer to home, I am also conscious of the need to support women here at their most vulnerable.  Extensive work on the new national strategy to combat domestic, sexual and gender-based violence continues ahead of it being brought to Government next month.  The strategy has been developed in partnership with the sector to ensure it is targeted, comprehensive and effective in achieving all the goals set out.</p>  <p>  Last month I updated those working in the sector and presented them with the final draft, and there has been a follow-up workshop.  In parallel, a public consultation on the strategy is ongoing and will finish this Thursday.  I encourage anyone who has not completed this survey to do so.  The outcome of the workshop and public consultations will be used to finalise the strategy.  It is a strategy that recognises that while both men and women can be victims or survivors, women, girls and children are disproportionately affected by violence.  As a result, there is an emphasis on protecting and meeting the needs of women and girls.  However, much work needs to be done not only to protect and help women, but also to ensure that women's voices are heard at all levels and that women are encouraged to make their voices heard.</p>  <p>  It is obvious that we have work to do in politics to provide better supports and to tackle one of the themes of International Women's Day, which is breaking the bias.  There are still many barriers to women entering politics.  Just 23% of Deputies in this D&aacute;il are women.  Just four out of a total of 15 Ministers are women who hold full Cabinet positions.  I know many women are interested and involved in politics but may not have the confidence to run for office, and, crucially, may not feel that the supports are there for them, be that childcare, working hours or female mentors.</p>  <p>  To support, protect and empower women in all walks of life and at all stages of life we need to do more.  To ensure every woman and girl has equal opportunities and full equality we need to do more.  Until we can objectively stand here and say that no woman is left behind, we need to do more.  We need to lead on the changes required to secure equality and empowerment for women.  While each and every one of us on this island has a responsibility to work with us to deliver this, those of us fortunate to be where we are today must be prepared to lead.  Until we have well and truly broken the bias, we all have more work to do.</p></speech>

As Minister for Health, improving the outcomes and experiences of women in our health system has been, and will remain, a top priority for me.  Step-by-step, we have been tackling big issues that matter to women.  Today we bring that work together in an action plan that will have a direct and tangible impact on women across the country and at all stages of life.</p>  <p>  This action plan tackles a taboo in Irish society, menopause.  We are shining a spotlight on better menopause care for women by strengthening the supports available at primary care as well as opening three specialist menopause clinics nationally.</p>  <p>  The action plan pushes reproductive rights for women further forward by giving young women access to free contraception and better supports to make informed contraceptive choices in partnership with their GP.  At the end of the year, we will have a national network of 20 see-and-treat gynaecology clinics.  These clinics are reducing waiting times for women and providing care in just a few hours on one day instead of multiple visits over many months and sometimes years.  We are opening special clinics in endometriosis.  We are launching initiatives to tackle period poverty.  We are opening new services in mental health, including supporting self-harm, eating disorders and perinatal mental health.  We are fully funding the national maternity strategy for the second year.  We are doubling the number of lactation consultants, opening fertility hubs and much more.</p>  <p>  We do not need incremental change in women's healthcare.  We do not need things to get a little bit better each year.  We need a revolution in women's healthcare.  This plan is a big step on that path.  All of this work and more have been supported through budget 2020 with the allocation of a milestone figure of &euro;31 million specifically for new developments in women's health services.  The full-year cost of these measures is nearly &euro;50 million.  We did this to support our goal of improving women's experiences in the health sector by ensuring our action plan for women's health was fully funded from day one.</p>  <p>  Today, International Women's Day, marks day one.  It is a day to celebrate and to shine a light on the many voices of women who worked with us over the past two years to shape and inform this action plan.  Women told us again and again that they wanted a health service that is empathetic and responsive, and that gives women access to expert and compassionate care when they need it.  They were clear with us that the issues prioritised in this action plan need to be urgently addressed.  They asked us not to delay, not to create the perfect plan, but to act.</p>  <p>  I thank women and men throughout Ireland who joined us and shared their experiences with us.  I thank the health professionals who have worked with us to shape the ideas and initiatives in this plan.  I thank our partners on the women's health task force who worked with us to build so much momentum for change in such a short space of time.  I thank the many Deputies and Senators who have campaigned so well, sometimes for years, for many of the measures contained in this plan.  The publication of the plan marks a new era in women's health in our country.  With this plan, we reaffirm our commitment to keep listening, our commitment to keep acting and our passion to support a health system that prioritises women's health outcomes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-08a.276" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1614" speakername="Mary Butler" time="16:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030800025#Z00400"><p>I welcome the opportunity to speak in the House today as we mark International Women's Day.  My immediate thoughts are with the women of Ukraine and the monumental challenges they are currently facing - the mothers, daughters, grandmothers, sisters, aunts, wives, sisters-in-law and friends.  Yesterday, I was very struck by a picture on the front of the <i>Irish Independent</i>of a mother and her four children.  Out of context, it might appear like a normal picture of a mother taking her young children on a forest walk on a cold spring day.  They are wrapped up in warm winter jackets and woolly hats.  The eldest of the children is running forward, leading the way as the siblings eagerly follow behind and the mother helps her youngest along at the back.  The image mirrors so closely the peaceful woodland walks we, as mothers and families, enjoy so much at this time of the year.</p><p><i>5 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p>The stark reality, however, is one few of us can comprehend.  This woman and mother, who had lightly said goodbye to her husband for possibly the last time just days earlier, was fleeing the carnage the war had brought to her home, to her very doorstep.  In the photograph she is guiding her four children over an isolated train track through a Ukrainian forest to a border crossing in south-east Poland.  She is the only one carrying a small backpack with provisions for the five of them.  Such expeditions are being undertaken by women and children throughout Ukraine as 2 million people have fled from the borders in what is now the worst refugee crisis since the Second World War.  I believe it is only right on International Women's Day that we recognise the fortitude and bravery of so many courageous Ukrainian women who have been charged with the gravest of responsibilities to navigate literal life-and-death situations while keeping their children and elderly loved ones safe as their partners are forced to go to war.</p> <p> On Sunday, I joined many colleagues and the people of Waterford when we met Ukrainian refugees who had come into the county only the day before.  I spoke through an interpreter to one couple who had managed to bring five children to safety and I will never, ever forget the woman's face - her picture was in the media yesterday - and that look of fear and exhaustion, of sheer distress and terror, knowing she had left her mother and her elderly grandmother behind in Ukraine and may not see them again.  The women of Ireland and around the world should take inspiration from these women's strength in facing our own challenges here at home.</p> <p> Gender-based violence is still a scourge in our society.  Combating all forms of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence is a huge personal priority.  The terrible murder of Ashling Murphy was a chilling reminder to us that, as a national community, we face the harsh reality that many women in Ireland are, unfortunately, living in fear of violence.  We must reflect deeply on that and the picture it portrays of our so-called modern society if women do not feel safe in their own communities.  Our goal has to be very clear: zero tolerance of violence and abuse against women.  Everyone has a contribution to make to this movement, which needs to start from the ground up and requires a whole-of-society approach.  We must not and cannot accept the normalisation of fear and harassment and violence against women to any degree.  We cannot be bystanders; we must call out all misogyny, intimidation and violence against women wherever and whenever we witness it.</p> <p> I wish to touch on the announcement today by the Minister for Health on the Women's Health Action Plan 2022-2023.  This morning, following the launch of the plan in Dublin Castle, I visited the Rotunda Hospital.  As Minister of State with responsibility for mental health and older people, I just felt like going there and meeting the perinatal mental health team that is in place.  I am delighted that all 19 perinatal mental health midwives are in place across the country.  This is a hub-and-spoke approach.  Today I met the multidisciplinary team in the Rotunda.  There are ten members of the team.  I was absolutely shocked to hear that 9,200 babies were born in the Rotunda last year but approximately 2,000 women looked for mental health supports.  The perinatal mental health midwives are in place to support people before, during and after pregnancy, for up to 12 months.  It is important to get the good news out as well, and I am delighted that we now have 75 clinicians working in perinatal mental health throughout the country together with the 19 midwives.  I felt that today, on International Women's Day, it would be nice to go along and thank the team for all the work they are doing.  It would be remiss of me not to think of all those who have worked on the front line for the past two years.  Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leo go l&eacute;ir.</p></speech>

Each has shown courage, resilience and humanity that has won the support and admiration of people across the globe.  Of course, the priority now has to be to stop this war, end the conflict and secure a Russian withdrawal.  Our country, Ireland, must be a voice for peace, justice, demilitarisation, disarmament, freedom and democracy.</p>  <p>  International Women's Day is a time to recognise and celebrate the achievements of women in pursuit of equality.  In Ireland there has been much progress.  Generations of women have stepped forward and campaigned tirelessly and relentlessly for change.  These are women who have stood up to a system that sought to hold us down and to keep us in line and in our place.  Is iad sin na mn&aacute; at&aacute; ag obair le ch&eacute;ile agus ar son a ch&eacute;ile, at&aacute; i gc&oacute;na&iacute; chun tosaigh sa streachailt chun &aacute;r gcearta agus todhcha&iacute; n&iacute;os fearr a bhaint amach.  The State cannot continue to be the blockage to progressive change.  That means the Government must stand up in tangible and meaningful ways.  There can be no delay in implementation of the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly on Gender Equality.  Its members were definitive and their sense of urgency leapt off the pages of their report.</p>  <p>  We know that the mindset that sought to subjugate women has not gone away.  It lingers still in the halls of power in new forms and different expressions.  The outworking of this circuitry of misogyny is the lived experience today of every girl and woman in the persistence of the gender pay gap and the feminisation of poverty.  We see it also in how both the austerity era and the pandemic deepened gender inequality.  We see it in the lack of ambition on the part of successive Governments to tackle areas of public policy that have an acute and disproportionate impact on women.  When childcare is unaffordable, it is always women who pay the highest price for their aspirations.  When social protection measures are weakened, it is always women, particularly single mothers, who have to shoulder the greatest burden.  When there are failures in healthcare, it is too always the lives of women that are restricted, ruined or lost.</p>  <p>  Of course, we see the most extreme manifestation of this in the horrendous violence and abuse perpetrated against women.  T&aacute; for&eacute;igean inscne in &Eacute;irinn ag leibh&eacute;al tubaisteach.  Whether it is at the hands of strangers in public spaces or intimate partners in their own homes, women are coerced and attacked, women are raped and women are murdered.  These horrific acts of violence do not just happen; they are the result of the insidious culture that normalises everyday degradation, harassment, bullying and humiliation of women and girls.  To truly turn the tide on violence against women and girls, the Government must deliver the legislation, the policies and, critically, the resources and funding urgently needed.  The third national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence must be fully resourced and urgently implemented when it is published.  Ministers and agencies must work hand in glove with existing services because that is where the solutions will lie.  The crisis in provision of refuge places must be brought to an end, full stop - no excuses, no equivocation, no delay.  Women and children in desperate need of an escape route out of violence do not have the luxury of waiting.  They need safe haven, not just with a bed but with wrap-around services such as childcare and counselling on site.  That is what real refuge is.</p>  <p>  The women of Ireland will not be denied our futures.  T&aacute; mn&aacute; agus cail&iacute;n&iacute; chun tosaigh leis an athr&uacute; seo agus t&aacute; siad ag &eacute;ileamh &aacute;r gcearta.  I am absolutely certain that this generation of women and girls will be the generation to realise a new Ireland rooted in the equality and dignity denied to our sisters, on whose shoulders we so proudly stand today.  I for one look forward on this International Women's Day with confidence, hope and optimism.</p></speech>

I have just stepped out temporarily from the Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, where we are discussing a large number of amendments to the Birth Information and Tracing Bill 2022, which, as we know, came as a result of the mother and baby institutions.</p> <p>That is one of the negative parts of our history and of how we treated women and children.</p> <p> I will focus primarily on the early years and childcare sector, mainly because we know through numerous studies and surveys that one of the key reasons women are locked out of the workforce and returning to education is trying to access and afford childcare.  It is also a predominantly female sector.  Of the approximately 27,000 people working in the sector, easily over 90% are women.  It is not the only workforce where women are in low-paid employment.  If one looked through all the low-paid work that exists, women would, unfortunately, top that list time and again.</p> <p> We hear many excellent speeches and I feel honoured to be in this Chamber.  We talk about various things we would like to see happen, including the progression of women, whether through returning to education, getting back into work or going from part time to full time.  Many women try to take parental leave in their job, which obviously affects their career progression.  People say it does not but we all know it does.  It also has an impact on women's pensions when they come to that age.  Many of us do not think about that until later in life but it is important.  If we are serious about the progression of women, we have to be serious about tackling the issue of the cost of early years, and those working in the sector need to be respected with proper terms, conditions and wages.  They should not have to sign on to social welfare over the summer and parents should not be paying, according to the Government's research, in the region of &euro;1,350 per month per child for childcare.</p> <p> In 2020, we launched an initiative called My Childcare Story and had a number of people give us feedback on that.  Some 90% of people said childcare costs were a barrier to them returning to the workforce, while 73% had serious difficulties accessing a place.  I want to take the opportunity, when speaking on issues particularly affecting women, to look at that.  There are many issues and I am always torn about what I want to say when we speak about the various things that impact women, but that is one of the key things.</p> <p> I will touch on gender-based violence.  Our first week back after Christmas was one of the few times I saw the House seemingly in agreement on an issue, which was on tackling gender-based violence.  We cannot just have the odd day where we come in here, say it is terrible and we had better do something about it, then all go away and nothing gets done.  We need to see that strategy published and properly resourced.  I welcome that the strategy is going to be under one Department.  That is key because it does not allow for passing the buck when things are under one Department.  It is important that it be resourced properly.  We know already we do not have enough refuge beds and, in my constituency, we have an entire county with no refuge for women fleeing domestic violence.</p></speech>

On International Women's Day, I express my solidarity with the women of Ukraine, Palestine, Yemen, Syria and Afghanistan, and with all women who are struggling at the moment.  We know and are in contact with them and we know what they are suffering.  We need to acknowledge that, globally, there are women struggling and their fight and struggle should not be forgotten today.</p>  <p>  I raise an important workers' rights issue that directly impacts women on a number of levels.  Yesterday, I met with Emma Reidy and the team in Aoibhneas in Swords.  I know from the number of referrals I make to them from both of my offices and from talking to them that they are overstretched.  They provide a lifeline for women and children in Swords, Fingal and the surrounding areas.  It has been over a decade since they had a pay rise.  In that time, landlords have had plenty of pay rises, the cost of living has skyrocketed and the managers of services are struggling to hold on to workers who have built up relationships with the women they are working with but who cannot afford to live in Dublin anymore.</p>  <p>  There is a clear need for a joint labour committee, JLC, or other wage-setting mechanism for this important group of workers.  We need them in Swords, Fingal and throughout the State.  We would be lost without them.  Aoibhneas, like other shelters and refuges, is struggling to hold on to staff.  The cost of heating and lighting the refuges has also risen, with no consequent rise in the level of support.  Where is the money supposed to come from to keep the lights on and the vital services running?  The Ministers will know that if there are no workers, there is no service.  They are struggling to hold on to the workers.</p>  <p>  The sector was told to professionalise itself in 2007 and did so.  Workers upskilled but have never received professional wages to go with the professional job they do.  Those working in the sector recognise they need to be able to offer decent wages to be able to retain staff and deliver vital services, but they cannot do that unless the Government recognises there has to be an increase in the supports they are given.  It is not that long since we all stood in this Chamber and collectively said "Never again", but unless we recognise that we have to reward properly the workers providing services to get women to safety and keep women safe, we cannot say "Never again" with any credibility.</p></speech>

We all share the solidarity we want to send to the hundreds of thousands of women and girls fleeing Ukraine, and many who have stayed behind and are actively involved in resisting the Russian invasion.  I offer my unwavering solidarity at this deeply distressing time.  We all recognise the importance of sovereignty and the right to self-determination.  I hope the compassion rightly shown across the EU for Ukraine is shown to women throughout the world.  Some 62 million people are fleeing conflict as we speak.  Other women have been displaced.</p>  <p>  I will come back to women in our country.  They have a right to live without fear but, unfortunately, many women will go to bed tonight afraid they will not wake up in the morning and of what will happen to them and their children overnight.  Some of it is as simple as not having anywhere to go and not having an alternative housing arrangement.  Many women have told me in recent weeks that they want to go, need to go and are in a dangerous place, but they do not want to be homeless.  That is the dilemma women throughout this country face.  Words are fine but, as my colleague Deputy Funchion said, we must do something about it as a matter of urgency.</p>  <p>  I remember carers today.  We rightly thank them, but when the opportunity came to give them the Covid bonus, we turned our backs on family carers again.  That is not good enough.  Too often we pay lip service but do not follow it up.  We know family carers save us about &euro;20 billion per year by the work they do.  By giving their time to care for a loved one, they keep hospital beds free for others and reduce the need for State-funded care facilities.  They have suffered during Covid and have not had any respite, yet we turn our backs and refuse them the Covid payment.  We all need to question ourselves in terms of the decisions made around the distribution of wealth in this country.  We are one of the wealthiest countries in the world.  We need to show it and to share it.</p></speech>

In 2018, I was proud to chair the V&oacute;t&aacute;il 100 programme celebrating the centenary of women's suffrage in Ireland.  In the 100 years since Constance Markievicz was elected as the first woman Teachta D&aacute;la, we have undoubtedly come a long way.  We saw the repeal of the eighth amendment in 2018 and a real groundswell of support for feminist principles.  There is, however, so much more to do.  I am glad to be playing a part, on a cross-party basis, in seeking to bring about further change in my role as Vice Chair of the women's caucus, ably led by Senator O'Loughlin, and as the Chair of the new Oireachtas Joint Committee on Gender Equality, with Senator Pauline O'Reilly as the wonderful Vice Chair.  We are seeking to make progress on equality for women and on equality for all.  Gender equality cuts both ways and must look at how gendered inequalities affect men and women.</p> <p> I commend Dr. Catherine Day and the Citizens' Assembly which produced for us 45 clear and concise recommendations, what I have called a blueprint for gender equality.  Those recommendations set out substantive policy changes that must be made to ensure a more equal Ireland.  They address a range of issues, including gender-based violence, stereotypes in education, leadership, politics and the workplace, childcare, and care more generally.  We commenced our public hearings with Catherine Day last week.  We will be holding another public hearing this Thursday, when our cross-party committee will be looking at constitutional change.  I hope that one of the first tangible outcomes of our committee, which will be reporting in December, will be a referendum to be held early in 2023 to remove the sexist and outdated language about women and mothers from our Constitution.  There is no longer any excuse for having retained this gendered language in 2022, which refers to mothers as having "duties in the home" but that gives no recognition to fathers, which means it is also sexist in its view of men.</p> <p> I also want us to act, as the Citizens' Assembly has required, to extend the gender quota in politics to provide for clear gender quotas in politics but also across public life and concerning companies and boards as well.  We heard today at an International Parliamentary Union, IPU, event that I addressed how poorly Ireland is doing in respect of women in politics.  We all know that, when we look around this Chamber, less than one quarter of Deputies are women.  My election last summer brought us up to the dizzy height of women constituting 23% of the House, meaning more than three quarters of our Deputies are men.  Yet this is the highest proportion of women Deputies we have ever had.  Therefore, we must do more with positive action measures to address this situation.</p> <p> I welcome today's announcement by the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, regarding gender pay gap reporting.  It is very welcome, albeit long overdue.  Some years ago, I introduced a gender pay gap Bill in the Seanad that would have had a broader application to a wider range of companies and employers.  It also provided for stronger sanctions and an enforcement mechanism through the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC.  I am, however, glad to have seen this Bill at last being introduced.  It will be revealing to see the required statements setting out employers' understanding of the reasons for the gender pay gap, as well as what they propose to do to address it.  I refer to the action plan, which has been seen as being so crucial in other countries.  This is a welcome measure and something the Citizens' Assembly recommended we introduce.</p> <p> Clearly, however, this is not enough to tackle gender inequality in the workplace.  What we must see, essentially, is far greater recognition and acknowledgement of women's disproportionate share of caring responsibilities.  The Citizens' Assembly has again given us a blueprint for change regarding care, particularly for childcare, but also concerning elder care and support for carers more generally.  The Citizens' Assembly has also called for a radical change to our childcare provision to ensure we have a publicly funded childcare system, which I have called for in terms of a Donogh O'Malley moment in childcare provision.  I refer to a situation where every preschool child has a guarantee of a place.  In my constituency of Dublin Bay South, and in every constituency in Ireland, parents are faced with greatly concerning increases in fees for childcare spaces and a real challenge in even obtaining childcare for their children.  We must move away from that situation and ensure all children have a right to a place in childcare.</p> <p> My party, the Labour Party, has a proud history of fighting not just for the rights of workers but specifically for women at work and for women across society.  Some of our achievements include the introduction of the Equality Acts and the creation of the Low Pay Commission.  We have also seen the great impacts of campaigns led by Labour Party women such as equal early years in the context of ensuring publicly funded childcare as well as on issues such as abortion rights, access to contraception and much more.  On International Women's Day, I restate our commitment to continuing that campaign for equality to address all facets of gender inequality and sexism in society and ensure we break the bias in this regard, as the theme for this year requires.</p> <p> Turning for a moment to the intersection of women's rights and climate action, this is also a crucial aspect as we face this climate catastrophe.  The awful conflict in Ukraine is compounding energy and security issues and causing all sorts of other pressures too.  These issues will impact more on women than on men.  Women labouring in the textile industry, for example, work in dangerous conditions for poverty wages so that fast fashion companies can market discount clothes to women, girls and everyone in this country.  These are the sorts of interconnected issues we must address.  We must see the speedy introduction of mandatory human rights and environmental due diligence requirements at EU level and here.  We must act in respect of women's labour rights, recognise the gendered impact of the climate crisis, as UN Women has noted, and ensure this year's other theme for International Women's Day, gender equality today for a sustainable tomorrow, amounts to a rousing call to action for all of us, women and men alike.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-08a.285" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" time="17:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030800028#CC00200"><p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to today's discussion as part of International Women's Day.  Sadly, today's debate is taking place against the backdrop of the ongoing atrocities in Ukraine.  More than 1.5 million people have fled from Ukraine since the start of the Russian invasion, and the sad reality is most of those are women and young children, because Ukrainian men aged between 18 and 60 are remaining to fight.  Many of those women are leaving behind their husbands, partners, fathers and children, not knowing if they will ever see them again.  These are vulnerable women and children who are scared and who have had their whole world turned upside down.  Many of them will be arriving on our shores.  Indeed, more than 2,000 have already arrived here in the past week.</p>  <p>  My Department of Social Protection and my officials are working to ensure personal public service numbers, PPSNs, are provided swiftly to Ukrainian citizens when they arrive.  That will allow mothers and families arriving here to access immediately supports such as the supplementary welfare allowance and child benefit payment.  All the details in this regard are available on my Department's website, and this information has been translated into Ukrainian and Russian.  My Department, together with the Department of Justice, will also have a presence at Dublin Airport so we can help and assist people as soon as they arrive.  I ask any Deputy who knows a Ukrainian family already in the country to put them in touch with their local Intreo office.  The message is very clear: we are here to help.  If the Russian invasion and the actions of President Putin represent the very worst of humanity, then let our national response represent the best of it.  I just wanted to put that message on the record because it is vitally important on International Women's Day for us to let Ukrainian women and children know we stand by them and that these supports are available.</p>  <p>  In the time remaining, I will touch briefly on some of the other policies I am progressing across my two Departments.  I am a strong supporter of remote and flexible working.  Recent statistics from my Department show female employment rates increased during the pandemic and are now at the highest level ever.  I believe this is largely due to the move to a blended working model.  If one positive has resulted from Covid-19, it is that the pandemic allowed us to have the largest ever pilot project on remote working and it proved it could work.  The pandemic tore up the traditional view of the nine-to-five working day.  We do not all need to be sitting bumper to bumper trying to get into the office for 9 o'clock every morning.  There are better ways to manage our time.  If we can take a more flexible approach, that will allow women and men to balance their work life with their family life.  A blended working model presents significant opportunities to support women to get back into the workforce.</p> <p>As part of the Pathways to Work strategy I have asked my officials to examine the idea of "returnships", where we would work with companies specifically to help women who may have spent some time out of the workforce after having children to get back into employment.</p> <p> We now have approximately 220 remote working hubs on the Connected Hubs platform.  Those are dotted in towns and villages throughout  the country, close to local communities, schools and childcare facilities.  Those hubs can and will help to facilitate the move to remote working nationally.</p> <p> I know carers have been mentioned and my Department of Social Protection saw the carer's support grant increased in last year's budget to its highest ever level.  It is also a priority for me that carers get the pension for the time they spend caring for people in the home.  It is something that is very much a priority for this Government as well.</p> <p> I am a firm believer in the phrase, "if you cannot see it, you cannot be it".  That applies to politics, business, sport and right across our society.  We need more women in this House and there is no getting away from that.  We have made some progress in recent years, but let us be honest, we have come from a low base.  We all need to do more, and I include my party in that.  There is no point putting women on election tickets for the sake of it and just to make up the numbers or meet a quota requirement.  We need to put forward women in constituencies where they have a realistic chance of winning a seat.  As a Government, we have a target to have 40% gender balance on State boards but, ironically, the Cabinet has never in the history of the State met that target.  There are four female Cabinet Ministers currently out of 15, and that represents approximately 26% of the Cabinet, well short of the gender balance target we have ourselves set for State boards.  We should not fool ourselves on this or gives ourselves a pat on the back.  We have made progress but we have a long way to go.</p> <p> I am proud to say we have a wonderful generation of young people in Ireland, particularly young articulate women.  I was delighted to attend an event last night to celebrate International Women's Day in the &Iacute;ontas centre in Castleblayney.  It was organised by the local women's group, Blayney Blades.  At the event, a 14-year-old girl, Molly Ward, launched a book she has written on a trailblazing Monaghan woman, the late Sister Celine.  Sister Celine led and supported so many women and men in the local community.  As I said, if you cannot see it, you cannot be it.  Celine probably did not realise it but she certainly inspired many women, young and old, and women must support each other in all walks of life.  We also need the support of men to help us realise our full potential and ambitions.</p></speech>

Happy International Women's Day in particular to all the amazing women elected to the D&aacute;il, past and present, as well as all those in the Seanad and all women in politics.  We remember in particular the women and young girls of Ukraine today, fleeing conflict and war and leaving behind husbands and fathers.  We remember all women and girls fleeing or caught up in conflict.  The words of a great woman, Ms Patti Smith, come to mind:</p> <blockquote> 	And the armies ceased advancing<br /><br />Because the people had their ear </blockquote>  <p>We hope this war ends soon.</p><p>It is at times like this we cherish our democracy, flawed and all as it is.  In that regard, I will speak briefly to the role of the electoral reform Bill that was before the Cabinet today in helping to reshape democracy and make it more representative for and by women.  I will start by focusing on the submission of the National Women's Council on the electoral reform Bill.  Some of the observations it put forward were around promoting gender balance in political life and electoral contests, including necessary changes to support women's access to elected office, using a broad range policy role to engage groups facing barriers in participating in electoral systems, and safeguarding equity of access for all, including Travellers, young people, disabled people and people from minority ethnic backgrounds.  It advocated the creation of conditions for safe and fair elections, electoral competition and electoral communication.</p><p>There were a number of recommendations.  The council welcomed our inclusion in the Bill of the recognition of the need for anonymous registration where there are issues of a woman's safety due to experience of intimate partner violence and where such women may be compromised by having a name and address being publicly available on the electoral register.  There is the inclusion of a proposed register for young people aged 16 and 17 in schools before they become eligible to vote, and that will be included in the Bill.  There is also the question of ensuring equitable balance between women and men as members of the commission, and we will include that as well.</p><p>The Minister, Deputy Humphreys, mentioned general and local elections.  The impact of gender provisions was clear in the 2016 election, with a total of 163 women contesting the election, representing 30% of the 551 candidates.  This was a significant increase over the 2011 election, when only 15% of the candidates were women.  In 2016, 35 women were elected to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, representing 22% of the total membership, compared with 15% in 2011.  It is still not enough, although there was an increase in 2020.  We can see only a very marginal improvement between the 2014 and 2019 local elections, going from 21% to 23%.  I know the recommendation from both the National Women's Council and the Citizens' Assembly on gender is for gender quotas for local elections as well.</p><p>There is an onus on all of us in political parties to work together and go beyond these recommendations.  The commission will have an important role to play in changing our political system and make our council chambers and D&aacute;il more reflective and representative of those who live here.  We must look to ourselves and our political parties, as well as our independent structures, to ensure we go beyond mandatory quotas or token representation.  We must be proactive and reach out to women to ensure they can stand for election.  We must reach out to minorities and Traveller women and we must make party structures more welcoming to diversity and positive discrimination to women candidates.</p><p>The commission's awareness and promotion capacity will be built over time and it will play an active role in voter participation.  There is the idea of pre-registration of youths aged 16 and 17 and consideration of reducing the voting age to 16.  I have my own views on that and it is important we have an informed and impartial view of such concepts.  Greater participation in elections and referendums by more people of all ages and genders will, over time, transform how we as politicians and political parties engage.  It will transform a range of matters we are campaigning on in local, European and Oireachtas elections, with a focus on gender equality, climate, biodiversity, inclusion and diversity.</p><p>What will our next scheduled local election events look like if this works?  We could see at least 40% women candidates with targeted resources allocated by parties to help them get elected.  We could see greater diversity, with successful candidates from minority communities, including our Traveller community.  We could see a reduction in the voting age to 16.  We could see a more women-friendly schedule for council work and for work-life balance.  We should see a transformation but it will require our collective action to achieve it.</p></speech>

They are an inspiration to women everywhere.  More women have had to leave on foot or by car and train, taking elderly relatives and young children to safety to defend the next generation of Ukrainians.  To those who will come to Ireland, I say t&aacute; f&aacute;ilte romhaibh go l&eacute;ir.  We are thinking too of a young Irish woman, Ms Racheal Diyaolu, from Carlow, who is fleeing to the border with Moldova to get back from Sumy.</p>  <p>  Where are our values when all across the State we have carers, the majority of whom are women, effectively locked in their homes?  They are on paltry supports, despite the billions of euro they save the State.  Where was their voice last Saturday, when women rallied in Dublin?  Where are the voices of the women who have contacted me to say they are shattered and hanging on by a thread because they have received an eviction notice and they and their children have nowhere to go?  Our women carers are invisible women, wiped from public view because of poverty or disability in the family, leading to a precariousness in their position.  Today, on International Women's Day, it is important we bring their voices to their D&aacute;il.  I say to them that change is coming.</p> <p>When women can actually find childcare, and that is difficult enough to do in north Kildare, they have to pay the baby mortgage for it.  That is generally for the privilege of earning a percentage of what their male counterparts earn.  We women hand over our children, in the main to other women, to be minded.  There is solidarity in that act and women who mind these children deserve to be paid well.  Sinn F&eacute;in has a plan to reduce childcare costs by two thirds so there will be top quality, available, affordable and local childcare.  We have seen the neon signs blazing.  She believed she could do it but because she could not get childcare, she did not.  Please do not let us be saying that again this time next year.</p></speech>

I would like to pay tribute to the many women who are helping other women to navigate the misogyny that still exists all over the world.  I attended the rally at Leinster House on Saturday and the event that followed in the Gresham Hotel.  I heard many uplifting stories from Joanne O'Riordan, Karen Kiernan, Miriam Holt and Dr. Salome Mbugua.  The speaker who really resonated with me was Anne Clarke of the Offaly domestic violence support services, who is also a board member of Safe Ireland.  Her contribution struck a chord with me because of the epidemic of domestic violence my office has experienced in the past two years.  The Government must do more to help victims of domestic violence.  Every local authority area must have at least one domestic violence shelter.  Anything less is not acceptable.</p>  <p>  A lady I was helping recently was asked by a council employee would she not just go back with her abuser, it had to be better than living in emergency accommodation.  We are living in 2022.  Ireland has changed greatly in the past 30 years but there is still a long way to go.  I attended a Garda station this morning to discuss another domestic violence situation.  The Garda station was closed but I knocked on the door and it was answered.  I handed the garda some details about the situation and he said he could not discuss it with me.  He also said the Garda was aware of the situation and that the lady was not really willing to help herself.  I reminded him that there are children involved.  He agreed to call around but I am not really hopeful.  I wish these attitudes were isolated incidents.  We saw the scandal where the 999 calls were going unanswered.  There is a need for a change of attitude towards domestic violence.</p>  <p>  Anyone who has really tried to help victims of domestic violence will know the trauma that exists.  Civil servants and front-line workers must be given trauma-informed training to give them the tools to understand from a victim's point of view.  No more hiding behind excuses.  The women I assist know about hiding.  They know the cover stick make-up, the scarf, the long sleeved top and the heavy tights and prepared excuses.  Today should be a day of celebration to remember how far we have come but until domestic violence is stopped we have little to celebrate.  Things have to change.</p></speech>

Louise, as Members probably all know, powerfully captures the complexities and realities of being a young woman in Ireland.  She describes the ongoing issues girls and women face, the weariness of having to raise the same points over and over and over, and the disillusionment she feels when nothing ever changes.  I know exactly where she is coming from.  On one level it is great that statements on International Women's Day is almost a standing annual topic in the D&aacute;il.  Women and girls and the issues that directly affect them deserve and need that attention.  However, it is also symbolic of the tokenism that surrounds International Women's Day.  I genuinely considered giving the same speech I did last year.  Would anyone notice?  Would I notice?  I could talk about the same issues with a few updated statistics.  It is the same problems year after year.</p><p>There is amazing work being done by women and their allies.  Progress is happening, slowly, but it takes so much effort.  We still have to fight for places in leadership, for period products to be appreciated as essential, for female role models to be given a platform.  This year of all years we would have hoped for something different.  After the tragic killing of Ashling Murphy, the need for substantive change was palpable.  It took the death of another young woman and a national outpouring for the Government to eventually act.  Apparently we are moving towards more domestic violence refuge spaces.  Currently we only have about one third of the spaces required for our population because for years Governments have failed to meet our obligations under the Istanbul Convention.  When meeting the bare minimum of required spaces is championed as a good news story, it shows how far we still have to go.  In January there was an urgent need to change our culture around gender-based violence.  By February, banter was back.  Gender equality matters every day.  The support and solidarity and protest matter today but what is the point if they are not followed up by action on the other 364 days of the year?</p><p>Oftentimes we cannot even have today.  Online searches for International Men's Day spike on International Women's Day.  To all those asking on social media, International Men's Day is on 19 November and yes, I spoke then as well, highlighting issues affecting men.  What did you do?  If you are only concerned about men's day on women's day, it is safe to say we all know what is your real priority.  Given the evidence, it is clear that besides days like today, women's issues are sidelined.  We see it in uncertainty around control of the national maternity hospital, the lack of progress on eating disorders and the continuing disgraceful treatment of women affected by the CervicalCheck scandal.  The list goes on.  Incredibly important issues are allowed to drag on and on.  Too often, it falls to female public representatives to raise these issues and it is exhausting.  There are too few of us and there are too many issues.</p><p>The women in agriculture stakeholders group does incredible work supporting women in the sector and encouraging greater participation.  However, when the farming organisations are dominated by men and the Oireachtas agriculture committee has no female Deputy, progress is restricted.  We need consideration and conversation around how gender impacts all issues.  Housing is a women's issue yet the Government's Housing for All plan has worryingly little reference to the supports needed by women and children fleeing domestic violence.  Child support is a women's issue.  A lack of access to public transport is a social and economic limitation but it is also a safety issue.  Waiting for buses and trains in poorly lit spaces puts women off even going out.</p><p>Our policies also have to be intersectional.  International Women's Day is equally about disability rights, trans rights, migrant women and Traveller and Minceir women and girls.  Refugees are rightly foremost in our national conversation this week.  Women and children make up 80% of refugees and displaced people.  However, we have obligations to refugees fleeing all conflicts.  There are still Afghan, Syrian and other refugees we can and should assist.  Ireland has amazingly dedicated women working in communities driving action through solidarity on shoestring budgets.  West Cork Women Against Domestic Violence does literally lifesaving work.  The sexual violence centre is Cork is 30 years ago today.  Anew supports pregnant women and new mothers experiencing or at risk of homelessness.  I could go on all day.  We have a strong bottom-up approach.  What we need now is a top-down one.</p><p>I cannot help but return to the lack of women and diversity in the Oireachtas and in boardrooms.  The family friendly D&aacute;il reform committee has a report and actions which are ready to be implemented.  Political parties are getting more funding to improve their gender representation but this requires commitments to electing women, not just running candidates and putting names on tickets.  It is clear what needs to be done.  The question is whether it will actually happen.  I can only hope that things will be brighter next year, that we do not have to repeat the same speeches, the same talking points, form the same kind of committees and produce the same kind of reports over and over again to be followed by no actions.  In closing I will return to Louise O'Neill's words:  </p> <blockquote> 	&quot;On International Women's Day, I don't want to go for a Prosecco brunch with my best gals and I don't want to post a photo of my mother on Instagram, with a caption about strong women - may we know them, may we raise them, may we be them, etc.  I want real, institutional change.  I want a country that protects its women and girls.  I want to feel safe.&quot; </blockquote></speech>

I will use my time to highlight some of the areas in which we need to continue to make real progress for women.</p>  <p>  In recent years, we have delivered significant improvements in our country's approach to women's healthcare.  The repeal of the eighth amendment, for example, was a momentous achievement for all of those who campaigned tirelessly and for so long to achieve it.  Unfortunately, the legislation is not providing the access that many hoped it would.  I have heard heartbreaking stories of parents being told their baby has a fatal foetal anomaly, rather than abnormality, and limited chance of making it to full term, never mind surviving outside the womb.  These parents cannot legally be offered a termination in Ireland.  In 2020, in fact, one out of three women who travelled to the UK for an abortion were seeking a termination due to a fatal foetal anomaly.  When Ireland voted overwhelmingly to repeal the eighth amendment, this is not what we expected or intended.  I add my voice to the calls for a timely and practical review of the legislation to ensure it is serving the women of Ireland adequately.</p>  <p>  We know there are still counties with no abortion services and that needs to be addressed.  We know that part of the reservation for many GPs in providing a service may come from not wanting to attract protests and intimidation from anti-choice groups.  I have raised the issue of safe access zones before in this House and I again call on the Minister to enact legislation quickly that will protect women, couples and healthcare professionals from these cruel acts of intimidation.  Not only are protests are happening on a regular basis outside GP clinics and hospitals providing abortion services, but also we are now seeing anti-abortion advertising outside these healthcare settings.  It is really important that a ban on such abhorrent advertisements is included in our safe access zone legislation.</p>  <p>  In 2019, the women's health task force recommended that we improve supports for women experiencing menopause.  Last year, we saw the establishment of the country's first specialist menopause clinic in Dublin, which is very welcome.  Three more clinics are on the way and I have called on the Minister to work to deliver them as soon as possible.  The Menopause Hub reports that 22% of women experiencing moderate to severe menopause symptoms have missed three or more days of work and 85% of them felt they could not tell their employers the real reason for that time off work.  Almost half of these women have considered giving up work because their symptoms are so severe.  Many organisations are beginning to recognise the challenges of menopause for women and are doing more to educate their managers and broader workforce.  It would be great to see more employers designing organisational policies on the menopause as well as delivering menopause training for management and human relations staff to increase awareness of these issues in the workplace.  Women's healthcare does not begin and end at family planning.  It is multifaceted.  I hope we will continue to see further development in the area of menopause support.</p>  <p>  We often look to New Zealand as an example of progressive and inclusive leadership.  Its approach to miscarriage leave is one I would like to see replicated in Ireland.  A number of colleagues, including Deputy Carroll MacNeill and Senator Seery Kearney, and I have been advocating for statutory miscarriage leave to be introduced to provide women with the necessary support in the event of early pregnancy loss.  Sadly, one in very five pregnancies is lost in the early stages.  The trauma of early pregnancy loss needs to be addressed.  Women should be supported in taking the necessary time to heal, both physically and emotionally.</p>  <p>  The role of women in business is an issue that is really important to me.  I came to the D&aacute;il from the corporate world , where I saw at first hand the impact strong female role models can have in a company.  That is why I was delighted to bring the Irish Corporate Governance (Gender Balance) Bill before the D&aacute;il last year.  It will legislate for gender quotas at a boardroom level and require all company boards to comprise at least 40% female membership within three years.  Ireland is making progress in the representation of women in the boardroom and I welcome the further progress announced today.  However, that progress simply is not happening quickly enough.  Balanced boardrooms are proven to make better decisions, yet we still have five listed companies in Ireland without a single woman on their governing board.  In 2022, that simply is not good enough.</p>  <p>  I welcome the significant progress the Government is making on tackling the gender pay gap.  The Gender Pay Gap Information Act was signed into law last year and will require organisations to report on pay differences between male and female employees.  I urge State bodies and other organisations not to wait for the law to come into force but to start gathering that information now.  We have seen An Post lead the way on this.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately, it is well documented that women and children suffer disproportionately in times of war.  They are viewed as safe targets, deprived of their human rights and may become victims of trafficking or sexual abuse.  On International Women's Day, with everything that is happening in Ukraine, it is a time for us to have those women and children in our thoughts, prayers and actions.  It is very good news that we will be welcoming 100,000 Ukrainians to our shores in the coming weeks.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-08a.293" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1473" speakername="Neale Richmond" time="17:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030800031#FF00200"><p>I am delighted to speak on the important occasion of International Women's Day.  I am even more delighted to be following my good friend from college, Deputy Higgins.  We have soldiered together for a long time as politicians and friends.  There are three areas on which I will briefly focus.  I could speak for an hour on each of them, as could many others in the House.</p>  <p>  The first relates to the report commissioned by the Ceann Comhairle from the forum tasked with examining how the Oireachtas can be made more family-friendly.  I was very lucky to be part of that body, along with other Members and people from outside the House.  I want to use this time to say to the Government and the Ceann Comhairle that it is imperative that the many instances of low-hanging fruit recommended for action within the report are seized upon rapidly and the changes made very quickly, not just to make the Oireachtas a more friendly place for families of all shapes, sizes and formats but particularly for women.  A recommendation I was very keen on relates to privilege at committees.  There is no need for people to travel from outside Dublin on a Tuesday simply to speak at a committee meeting when they could participate remotely and have an extra day at home before they need to come here.  That would make a huge difference.  It would not amount to a massive change for the operation of the Oireachtas but would be a massive change for the individuals concerned.  There are some 53 recommendations in the report but much of the change needed comes down to the culture of the Oireachtas.  To be frank, much of that culture is not conducive to encouraging more women to go into politics.  A great deal of it comes down to the back-and-forth nature of politics, which certainly has changed a bit in my short time in politics but not quickly enough.</p>  <p>  A related point is the issue of mentoring.  This may not be something for which specific provision can be made but it needs to be offered to new Oireachtas Members.  When someone approaches any of us with an interest in getting involved in public life, regardless of which party they are interested in or if they want to be an Independent representative, we have a duty, as Oireachtas Members, to encourage them, particularly if they are young women or girls.  I was very lucky that I had a former Deputy, Olivia Mitchell, as my mentor.  I worked in her office for five years and am lucky to have counted her as a friend for more than 20 years.  She walked every highway and byway of Dublin South, now Dublin Rathdown, with me right up to the most recent general election.  If it were not for her mentorship, I do not think I would be here and, I would argue, nor would my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan.  This is an issue to which we all should give attention.  The next time we get an email or telephone call from a young or not so young person asking for a week's work experience or an internship, we need to consider how we can make that easier and whether we may need to go out of our way to make it happen.  I have in mind one intern who went on to have very different politics from mine.  I will not say which party he ended up working for but its Members are not sitting on this side of the House.  I was happy to take him on as an intern and teach him the intricacies of how to put a poster on a lamp post.  We need to do more of that, particularly for young women and girls.  Politics should not be intimidating for anyone.</p>  <p>  Another issue I feel very seriously about is that when it comes to issues that are perceived as women's issues, we, as the men in this House - unfortunately, there are a lot more men than women - need to take ownership and responsibility to break down some of the stigma, talk about the issues that affect the women in our lives and being their voices into this Chamber.  Earlier today, on the Order of Business, my colleague, Deputy Duncan Smith, raised the need for a national endometriosis strategy.  This is an illness that is impacting many women, particularly those around my age.  They are dealing with an extremely painful condition and sometimes are left bereft by the news that they will never be able to bear children.  We must bring their stories to this House and put pressure on the Government to follow the lead of other countries in this regard.</p><p><i>6 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p>There is a need for a greater focus on a publicly funded fertility system.  I am starting to hear a lot about this from my peer group or age group.</p> <p> My last point, which is on the issue of postnatal depression, is very much personal in that it has affected my home after the birth of both of my kids.  We must normalise the discussion on mental health.  Deputy Mark Ward has done so much in this area.  The men in this Chamber should know the signs of postnatal depression in their partners, wives, daughters and friends, but they should also be comfortable talking about it.  When identified, there are supports.  It should not matter what one's postcode, background or family circumstances are.  As a society and, more importantly, as a political collective, we must talk about these issues frankly in the Chamber.  These are issues that we do not need to score political points on.  These are issues on which we should all have a collective will.  Trying to fit all of these issues into a five-minute debate once a year is fine but they should be raised every day we have the privilege of being in here.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-08a.295" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1607" speakername="Martin Kenny" time="18:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030800032#GG00200"><p>Once a year, on International Women's Day, we come in here to talk about the issues that face half of the population.  We must recognise continually that we are failing as a society when we have to recognise that so many of our women find the rights for which they have struggled for so long have still to be achieved.  A century ago, it was about the right to vote.  We believe we have come such a long way since then but there is still so much to travel.</p>  <p>  Reference was made to the gender pay gap.  When I speak to many women in my constituency in professions dominated by women, I realise they are at a huge loss as to why they must struggle continually to achieve decent pay and conditions.  I am thinking in particular about women in section 39 employment, which usually involves healthcare and social care.  It is predominantly women in these sectors.  Every day they are fighting to get decent salaries so they will be independent if, as is often the case, they find themselves without a partner, with a difficulty in life or on their own trying to raise children.  All of these problems are in addition to the gender pay problem, and women continually find it is a struggle.</p>  <p>  Every day of the week, Deputies raise issues concerning childcare, time off and other such matters.  This indicates that we do not deal with them often enough.  I fully respect Deputy Richmond's point that we should not be discussing these matters here for five minutes once a year.  We need to take the initiative to make what is desired happen as quickly as possible.</p>  <p>  The issues that have dominated for the past couple of weeks, particularly what happened Ashling Murphy and how it resulted in a focus on how women are so afraid in society, show that we have so much to do to protect women so they will have a fearless place in society.  We have a lot to do to change men and their attitude regarding all this.</p>  <p>  I am conscious of what is happening in Ukraine.  In my community, I have been working with a family from Ukraine that has been bringing people over here.  In the past week, it has brought 18 people connected to it here.  All of them are women.  In one case, there were two small girls and their mother, grandmother and great-grandmother &mdash; four generations fleeing from war.  We should be very grateful that we are not in that position in this country.  However, at the same time, we have an awfully long way to go to have equal status for women.</p></speech>

Last week I was invited by students from Lucan Community College to hear their presentation on how church and State relations continue to affect women's rights in Ireland.  Taking on board what Deputy Richmond was saying, we have an obligation in this House to encourage all young people to get involved.  I said that if I had an opportunity to do so, I would let their voices be heard in the D&aacute;il.  Amber and Chloe, under the supervision of their teacher, Ms Mulhern, gave me a comprehensive report on how the church and State still affect women's rights today.  They gave me a history of contraception in Ireland from its prohibition to today, when there are still forms of financial prohibition, with a cost of up to &euro;20 monthly for the contraceptive pill and a further &euro;50 for doctors' fees and prescription charges.  The students welcomed the fact that there will be free contraception available in Ireland for women between 17 and 25 from later this year.  However, they pointed out that the average age at which a woman stops menstruating is 50 and that while the pill is a contraceptive, it also helps to regulate menstruation.  On that note, I acknowledge Ms Claire Hunt of Homeless Period Ireland, with whom I did a fair bit of work over the years, for providing free period products to girls and women who need them.  Periods happen every month.  I cannot wait for the day when a service such as Homeless Period Ireland is no longer needed and women and girls can avail of free period products when and where they need them.</p>  <p>  The pupils I was speaking to mentioned that while the repeal of the eighth amendment was really welcome, safe access zones need to be in place.  We cannot have anti-choice protests, intimidatory behaviour and inappropriate communications about abortion at the zones.  These need to be prohibited.</p>  <p>  Time does not allow me to talk about all I would like to talk about today so I will finish with the words of our party leader, Deputy McDonald.  At the weekend, she stated women demand the right "to explore every horizon, to reach for every dream, we demand the right to be free, to be ourselves, without fear, without apology and without humiliation &mdash; the right to live a full and free life together".  I do not believe that is too much to ask for in modern-day society.</p></speech>

Wars, like all emergencies, be they related to housing, health, poverty or climate change, always affect women and children disproportionately.  Of the 365 days in the year, we focus on this incredible inequality on only one.  It is remarkable how inequality has been perpetuated down through the decades and centuries.</p>  <p>  The oppression of women, sexism and misogyny stem from an economic system that devalues the labour of women in the home and assigns them to the role of raising the next generation as cheaply as possible for that system.  More than 100 years on from the first International Women's Day, our world may look different but the issues that have dominated are still the same.  These include unaffordable childcare; inadequate resources for the whole care sector, including family care and, in particular, home care; and unequal access to healthcare, especially reproductive healthcare and abortion rights.  Wages are always lower and conditions are poorer predominantly in female work in the care sector, nursing, retail and hospitality.  These are the real issues facing women.  Whatever progress we have made in the intervening years, we still have these problems and inequalities.  We still prioritise the needs of an economic system over human needs, particularly the needs of women and children.</p>  <p>  What the Russian revolutionary movement set out to achieve 100 years ago when Clara Zetkin named 8 March as International Women's Day is still unfinished business.  International Women's Day has a history based on opposition to war and a capitalist system that breeds war and oppression.  It is, in fact, working women's day in a struggle for equal pay, the right to vote and the abolition of the slavery of workers.  I do not think that, down through the years, most working women were concerned with the number of women who were on the boards of corporations; rather, they were concerned with the inequity in society and the fight to end poverty.</p>  <p>  In this country, we have been dealing with the legacy of systemic abuse of women in one form or another, and the issues in this regard have dominated the past two D&aacute;ileanna.  Included are the issues of the eighth amendment, childcare costs, mother and baby homes, the lack of redress, Magdalen laundries, symphysiotomy, CervicalCheck, gender-based violence, the lack of refuge spaces and the economic struggles that women have faced, including, significantly, those of the Debenhams workers, nurses and teachers, who are mainly women.</p>  <p>  I want to take time to deal with the national maternity hospital.  The historical role of the church in subjugating women and their reproductive lives has to be put to an end.  If we do nothing else in this D&aacute;il, we must ensure the national maternity hospital is publicly owned and controlled.  The State is paying more than &euro;1 billion for it but it is not going to be owned by the State.</p> <p>It is still unclear how all the procedures that should be legally available to women and other genders will be available under this arrangement.  There is a sinister and disingenuous attempt to paint campaigners as delaying this, when it really comes from the religious orders that refuse to hand over the freehold to the State.  We need to see the deal that the Minister for Health is allegedly due to sign off on.  We need a proper national reproductive care centre that is free of Church influence and is publicly owned and controlled.   For that reason, we need a full D&aacute;il debate on the issue.</p></speech>

In the pandemic, so many women were, and are, key front-line workers in health, education and retail.  In many countries during the pandemic, it was women who carried the banner for workers' rights.  In this country, they did so at Debenhams.  Hundreds of thousands of people turned out to express their grief and anger at the shadow pandemic of gender-based violence after the killing of Ashling Murphy.  I say to Government Ministers that they should respect that grief and anger.  I ask them to stop stonewalling the Women of Honour and not to push the goal of reaching the Istanbul targets on refuge places off to the medium or long term, when they report on them next month.  Capitalism's cost of living crisis has shunted millions of women from the front line to the breadline.  According to the World Economic Forum, if closing the gender pay gap was 99 years away according to trends in 2020, it had risen to 136 years by 2021.  On our TV screens, we see 2 million refugees - the old, the sick, women and their children.  We express solidarity with the women of Ukraine and all other refugees, who are often people of colour.  It was the strike of women workers on International Women's Day 105 years ago in Petrograd that marked the beginning of the end of the great slaughter of the First World War, as well as the beginning of the end for both tsarism and capitalism.  It is that system, the system of capitalism, which lies at the root of women's oppression in the world today, through gender-based violence, economic inequality and war.  On this International Women's Day, socialist feminists renew our commitment to fight for women's rights and to fight against that system which has denied those rights for so long.</p></speech>

They included updates on the launch of the women&rsquo;s health action plan, the roll-out of free period products in further education, the introduction of gender pay gap reporting, and research commissioned into gender-based violence against people with disabilities. We also had the first public sitting of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Gender Equality last week.  We are making progress, but today remains a particularly difficult International Women&rsquo;s Day.</p>  <p>  There are two issues that I want to highlight in my contribution today: the vulnerability of women who are fleeing their homes and countries and the dangers of war, and the trafficking and involvement of women in illegal prostitution against their will in Ireland.  Many colleagues have spoken today with passion and solidarity about the women of Ukraine, who are facing unimaginable challenges today.  There are women who have moved and are moving across Ukraine, with their children, their parents and their families.  There are women who are leaving their partners behind as they rush to get to safety.  There are women who are hiding in Ukraine.  They are hiding themselves and their children from the brutal indiscriminate violence of Russia - its illegal and unwarranted invasion of a democratic state and the murder of civilians that we have seen so repeatedly and desperately over the past 13 days.  These women are at huge risk today.  It must be said that many remain at risk, even when they reach the relative safety of the border.  We must remember that sadly, global conflict has many dark reaches and many dark opportunities for criminals to prey on the vulnerable.  We must be alive to that risk.  </p>  <p>  Today I met with the lead researcher from the Sexual Exploitation Research Programme, SERP, of the Geary Institute in UCD, Ruth Breslin, to discuss that concern, namely, vulnerable women in a time of war.  The concern of the Geary Institute and the reports it is receiving are of women and children in desperate circumstances.  Some - not all - women are being offered help, including lifts and accommodation, from strangers.  There are already reports of women disappearing from view.  This is not a new phenomenon.  When it comes to trafficking for sexual exploitation, one of the greatest risk factors for women and girls is being a refugee fleeing natural or man-made crises.  Exploiters will always prey on such vulnerability.  SERP has received many concerning reports of incidents of sexual violence and exploitation.  As a Parliament and as a member of the EU, we need to be alive to that risk as we respond to the humanitarian need of people coming from Ukraine.</p>  <p>  Of course it is just as important to highlight the risk to women in other countries.  This morning I had the opportunity to hear from Fawzia Koofi, who was the first woman second deputy speaker of the Afghan Parliament, the head of the Afghan Parliament's Women Affairs Commission, a staunch advocate for women and a Nobel Peace Prize nominee in 2020, to name a few of her achievements.  We were both panellists on an Irish Women&rsquo;s Day event hosted by the Department of Foreign Affairs.  Ms Koofi used her time to talk about the extraordinary existential risk to women in Afghanistan.</p>  <p>  The second group of women that I wish to highlight is women working in prostitution in Ireland today.  As of 12 noon today, International Women&rsquo;s Day, there are 744 women for sale on Ireland&rsquo;s main prostitution website.  That is 744 women for sale in Ireland alone.  This figure was checked and confirmed by SERP in UCD.  More than 90% of these women are migrants.  As Deputies will be aware, buyers select the women whose bodies they want to purchase sexual access to, with many returning later to the same site to rate each woman out of five stars on her physical appearance, the satisfaction she gave and the value for money she provided.  Some will also write about the details of the woman&rsquo;s appearance and the various acts they purchased from her, reviewing each woman not as a person but a product.  That is happening today.  As I said, more than 90% of these women are migrants.  The research carried out by SERP has shown that most of these women are young and vulnerable, drawn or forced into the sex trade by poverty, coercion or a combination of both.  Many are fleeing violence elsewhere only to meet new violence in Ireland, daily violence committed by perpetrators, members of organised crime gangs and others.  For fear of the criminals who control them, these women often fear the Garda, which has made so many renewed efforts to help and offer welfare interventions.  These efforts have been highlighted as important and positive interventions by the women who have engaged with SERP, notwithstanding their general fear of the Garda because of what they have been told.</p>  <p>  The HSE&rsquo;s women's health service is a lifeline as a specialist health service for women in prostitution.  Interviews conducted by the service with women who use the service demonstrate the extent to which the sexual and mental health of these women is harmed.  This is what is happening in our modern Ireland today, on International Women's Day, when women&rsquo;s rights are meant to be equal and protected.  Ireland&rsquo;s laws to combat the highly exploitative trade are currently under review.  For the safety and well-being of Irish women and migrant women who have come here for a better life, it is most important that we target every element of the trade, including the sex buyers, the pimps, the traffickers and the organised crime gangs profiting from abuse of vulnerable women.  Women are not products to be reviewed.  Vulnerable women remain at risk daily.   We need to be aware of that risk in all forms at this time.  We need to be aware of the risk to other women who are fleeing violence in Ukraine.  We must ensure the steps we take to protect them at every point in their journey, as they seek refuge in Ireland and across Europe, consider that risk.</p></speech>

European International Women's Day dates back to 1911, which is 111 years ago.  The UN first formally observed a global day of recognition in 1977, 45 years ago.  Regrettably, we are nowhere reaching its target.  While the world has changed dramatically in the years since the first days marking this occasion, and many improvements at home and abroad for women and girls have indeed been made, it occurs to me that more men need to become heavily involved in achieving the goals that are outlined within the movement, including delivering an equal society between both genders, and that barriers need to be removed not just within our society but also within this House, as my colleague Deputy Richmond highlighted.  We recognise that progress has been made, but it does serve as a reminder that a considerable body of work is yet to be achieved.  If we are truly honest with ourselves, it remains a sad reality that men and boys in Ireland today lead safer lives, largely free from worry or even consideration of harassment or unsolicited attention.</p> <p>They will not have to worry about impacts on their careers resulting from childbirth and rearing children.</p> <p> In an illustration of the scale of where we are today, the Central Statistics Office, CSO, reported that in 2019 only 26% of senior roles in large enterprises were held by women.  Only 11.5% of CEO positions and just 19.6% of board positions are held by women, while a meagre 7.4% of chairperson positions on those boards are held by women.  In 2018, 98.8% of recipients of the one-parent-family payment were women.  That is nearly all of the 39,000 people in receipt of that payment.   Those are just a taste of the realities faced by women in Ireland today, that is, that family responsibilities still fall too often on women alone and that top-level positions occupied by women remain too much of a rarity in comparison with their male counterparts. </p> <p> Despite the stark nature of these statistics, we have made progress on this issue in recent years.  Improving gender equality in Ireland is an increasing priority for this Government and I believe there is a broad consensus on the issue across this House.  The Gender Pay Gap Information Act and the Irish Corporate Governance (Gender Balance) Bill 2021 introduced to this House by my colleague Deputy Higgins are all examples of that progress, as well as expanding the rights of women over their reproductive rights.  There can be no doubt that empowering women and elevating them to leadership positions across society will benefit the entire country.  Our job in the weeks, months and years ahead is to ensure we are creating a country that is as open and as progressive as possible and that we bring in legislation that moves us closer to full gender equality.</p> <p>  Of course, legislation alone will not resolve many of the issues that remain.  We need an open and frank discussion in respect of gender imbalance in Ireland.  That is why I referred earlier to men having to play a greater role in accepting and addressing that issue.  There is an epidemic of gender-based violence.  I see no other way of describing the increasing trends in domestic violence calls to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the rising levels of anti-social behaviour and the casual sexism that has permeated through homes, businesses and social settings across Ireland for many years.  To tackle these issues, we must engage with all levels of society in different circumstances.  We have to engage in extensive educational supports that can begin to show these unacceptable behaviours for what they are.  We need the institutions of the State to reflect the modern country we have become and want to become.  I recently spoke in this House on the problematic patriarchal and engendered culture within the Defence Forces but the issue is not limited to that particular arm of the State.  The Constitution is something that most Members of this House hold dear, yet we are aware of the deeply insulting and problematic language contained within certain sections of it.  I have been listening to that being debated in this House since I joined it in 2011, yet we do not appear to be any closer to holding a referendum on it.  Article 41.2.1&deg;, commonly known as the women&rsquo;s place in the home clause, has been discussed for many years, as I mentioned.  Even if it is symbolic, it must be addressed, and promptly.</p> <p> I look forward to the forthcoming publication of the third national strategy on sexual, domestic and gender-based violence which my colleague the Minister, Deputy McEntee, has been preparing and remains committed to implementing.  It is an important step in planning our approach to tackling gender-based violence in the coming years.  </p> <p> In the few moments I have remaining, I wish to mention a delegation of Oireachtas Members of all parties and none that attended the Russian Embassy this morning alongside the Ukrainian ambassador, H.E. Larysa Gerasko.  I apologise if I mangled the pronunciation of the ambassador's name.   I was taken by a young woman who was there.  She is not Ukrainian but is from eastern Europe.  She spoke of the women of Ukraine who are currently facing war and are protecting their families, often without their partners who are engaged in the war.  If the women themselves are not engaged in the war, they are protecting their families.  The courage they, and indeed women in other war-torn regions such as Afghanistan and Yemen, demonstrate for all of society must be commended and remembered on this day.</p></speech>

The truth is that gender equality or, more properly, gender inequality comes into almost every aspect of our lives.  This year on International Women's Day we focus on breaking the bias, stop a chur leis an gclaonadh i dtreo dearcadh n&oacute; gn&iacute;omh &aacute;irithe n&oacute; cinneadh.  We must break the bias in society.  We must break the bias in childcare.  The crippling costs of childcare push many women, particularly single mothers, out of their careers, while early years educators are still facing unfair pay and precarious employment.  We must break the bias in education, where girls are less likely to get an autism spectrum disorder, ASD diagnosis and a lack of action on period poverty means many young women miss out on days of school every month.  We must break the bias in workplaces.  In politics, female Deputies, Senators and councillors still have no proper maternity leave scheme in place.  We must break the bias in the healthcare system, where women are waiting years for crucial and sometimes lifesaving gynaecological appointments agus go bhfuil taca&iacute;ocht mar is cu&iacute; f&oacute;s &aacute; di&uacute;lt&uacute; do mn&aacute; at&aacute; ag iompar clainne ag coinn&iacute; m&aacute;ithreachais.  We must break the bias for women escaping domestic violence.  Despite increasing demand for refuges in the past five years, shelters such as Mn&aacute; Feasa in Cork actually saw a 12% decrease in funding.  &Oacute; thaobh dl&iacute; agus cirt, na me&aacute;in, sp&oacute;rt agus gach &aacute;it, caithfimid an claonadh a bhriseadh.</p>  <p>  On this International Women's Day, we remember those who have suffered violence against women, such as Ashling Murphy and thousands more.  We must commit to not allowing this issue to slip off the agenda today, tomorrow or any other day.</p>  <p>  As a final thought, it is worth reflecting on the fact that there is a focus today on unseen care.  Covid has very much highlighted the fact that so much care that is often provided predominantly by women is completely undervalued economically, socially and in every other respect.  It is true to say that so much of society would collapse without it.  L&aacute; sona Idirn&aacute;isi&uacute;nta na mBan do ch&aacute;ch.  Let us continue to put the work in to ensure an equal Ireland.</p></speech>

I think in particular of my mother, who raised seven children in the north inner city in circumstances of great difficulty, as did many women at that time.  She really did a fantastic job in extremely difficult circumstances.</p>  <p>  I extend my solidarity to women across the world who are experiencing violence, fear, threats or intimidation in their homes, communities, cities or countries.  In particular, I extend my solidarity to the women of Ukraine, Palestine, Yemen, Syria and Afghanistan, as well as those in all other parts of the world where there is war and occupation by bigger and more powerful countries, in their struggle for justice and peace.  The pictures of tens of thousands of women and children fleeing war in Ukraine are heart-breaking.  We constantly see similar pictures of women in Palestine, Yemen and Afghanistan who are fighting for civil and political rights while also raising their families.  We saw the same in our country for many decades in the Northern Six Counties of Ireland under British state oppression.</p>  <p>  A short while ago, following the brutal murder of Ashling Murphy, Deputies stood in this Chamber and made promise after promise that this would never happen again.  We were repeatedly told neither funding nor resources would be a problem.  Unfortunately, I do not see a significant focus on ensuring that everyone who is experiencing domestic violence will have a safe place to go when they need it.</p>  <p>  I commend women whom I have met through the years who are the backbone of the struggle against oppression.  I refer to those in the anti-drugs movement, seeking civil and political rights or fighting against inequality, injustice and poverty using community development structures that, sadly, have largely been scrapped.  There is much to celebrate on International Women's Day.  However, there is still so much more road to travel to achieve equality, economic and social justice for all women.  </p>  <p>  I listened intently to the contribution of Deputy Alan Farrell.  His analysis of the inequalities women are facing was spot on but imagine what he could have done if he were in government for the past decade or more.  Oops, he was.  Sorry.</p></speech>

That is a positive, yet it is also a concern.  What should be a day of celebration across the globe to mark the achievements of women is instead an opportunity to highlight the ongoing obstacles they face in their everyday lives.</p> <p>These are obstacles that governments and society in general should have taken greater steps to address.  </p> <p> International Women&rsquo;s Day became official in 1975 when the United Nations started celebrating the day.  The first theme adopted was in 1996 when Celebrating the Past, Planning for the Future was chosen as the aim of the growing movement.  The intervening 26 years since that very first theme have seen progress but they have by no means seen the achievement of true equality for women.  Today the motto is calling to break the bias, the bias that still exists.  Women have a very clear message that has remained consistent.  They simply want fairness and the equality.  They are not asking to take over the world.  They are asking to take their rightful place in it and are asking that their contribution be considered equal to that of men, that their involvement be valued equally and that their participation be equally acknowledged in all walks of life.  Women are asking for respect, for protection from harm, to be valued, and asking for change to happen.  They are not asking men to make these things happen for them but are asking for men&rsquo;s help to make it happen.</p> <p> It is not good enough that in the year 2022 there is still a gender pay gap of 14% in this country.  It is not good enough that for every euro that a man earns a woman will receive 86 cent for the same work in many areas of employment.  </p> <p> It is not good enough that women do not have peace of mind to live their lives free from fear of harm.  How many women in any part of our country would confidently go out alone after dark?  This freedom is denied to women because we tolerate it despite constantly decrying it.  We tolerate laws that are not a sufficient deterrent to prevent men from intimidating, harassing and attacking them, or worse.  The vast majority of men do not live with this fear and women should not be expected to live with it either.  </p> <p> These are just two basic examples that happen in everyday life where change could happen.  This is change that could be brought about by men and women working together, which could bring about a difference and could pave the way for further change.  </p> <p> This is not a topic we should discuss in this House simply because today is International Women&rsquo;s Day.  The points raised by everyone addressing this topic are the everyday realities of life for women across the country.  They are not just the issues of International Women&rsquo;s Day but are the issues of a lifetime for women down through history who have had to fight for equality, to be heard and to fight for fairness.  They should not have to fight or demand and, in fact, they should not even have to ask.  </p> <p> The question of lack of equality between men and women should not even exist.  Our ancestors allowed it to take hold and subsequent generations allowed it to continue.  We must be the generation which wipes it out.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-08a.307" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1622" speakername="Verona Murphy" time="18:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030800035#KK00200"><p>For the second year running, I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak on the topic of International Women&rsquo;s Day.  In my speech last year I spoke primarily about the positive strides that have been made over the past few decades with regard to women in politics, education and in sport, while at the same time highlighting a number of areas that needed further attention.</p>  <p>  I spoke last year about carers and the fact that a large number of carers are women.  The programme for Government committed to a pension solution for carers.  I had hoped that in the intervening 12 months a pension solution would be in place.  It is disappointing that, as yet, a solution is not in place.  It would provide a level of security in latter years for thousands of people who have given of themselves so selflessly by dedicating themselves to the care of others.  These people are unable to build up the normal number of PRSI credits to qualify for a pension in the usual manner and deserve some flexibility.</p>  <p>  Last year I also mentioned the fabulous female sportspeople we have.  Since then there have been further wonderful achievements by Ireland&rsquo;s female sports stars.  Kellie Harrington&rsquo;s performance in Tokyo has cemented her place amongst Ireland&rsquo;s sporting greats.  Rachael Blackmore scaled new heights by being the leading jockey at Cheltenham Festival before becoming the first female jockey to win the Grand National only a few weeks later.  Earlier this year Leona Maguire became the first Irish female golfer to win on the Ladies Professional Golf Association, LPGA, tour while she also put in the best performance by a debutante in Solheim Cup history.  Katie Taylor won a further three fights bringing her unbeaten professional boxing record to 20 wins.  In recent weeks the Irish woman, Dr. Karen Weekes, sailed solo across the Atlantic taking 80 days to be the first Irish woman to do so.  Dr. Weekes worked for a period in County Wexford many years ago with Shielbaggan Outdoor Education Centre and, no doubt, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, it was the Wexford people who made her so resilient.</p>  <p>  Sophie Baker from my own town of New Ross represented Ireland with distinction at the Tokyo Olympics when she was part of the team to qualify for the final of the 400 metre mixed relay final.  I must also mention the women of Wexford who are involved in camogie, football, soccer, athletics, rowing, swimming, cycling, weightlifting and horse riding.  All and any sport that I have omitted, I congratulate everyone on their performances in 2021 for providing outstanding entertainment for us all with their commitment and dedication in all weathers.  </p>  <p>  Unfortunately, it has not all been positive.  In January, the horrendous murder of Ashling Murphy was a source of dreadful sadness for the entire country.  Upon hearing the news and the random nature in which it happened, shockwaves were sent throughout the wider Irish community.  Many people suddenly realised that if something like this could happen to Ashling, it could happen then to them or to a loved one.  That is certainly not a nice feeling to have when one is walking home at night or going for a run.  Our response should be to put a serious focus on issues such as the visibility of our garda&iacute; on our streets on a regular basis.  </p>  <p>  There should be a greater focus on how we deal with perpetrators of horrible crimes.  Unfortunately, there are too many examples of the justice system simply not giving criminals proper sentences for serious crimes.  Some of the sentences currently being handed down for serious offences such as assaults on women, rape and other violence, are recognisably soft.  Soft sentencing means that dangerous criminals are free, as we speak, when they should be behind bars.  We can have all of the hashtags and social media campaigns we like but we need to toughen up when dealing with serious criminals.</p>  <p>  Another area that requires serious attention is the provision of refuges for women.  There must be practical, helpful and positive steps to ensure that every county has refuge provision available for those women and children who need it.</p>  <p>  I also want to take this opportunity to thank the two wonderful women who work with me in my Wexford and New Ross offices, Mary and Sharon, or Sharon and Mary, who help me to help my constituents every day.  Happy International Women&rsquo;s Day to all.  I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.</p></speech>

As we celebrate International Women's Day, I am thinking of the women and children fleeing war in Ukraine.  We are all thinking and praying for Racheal Diyaolu who will hopefully be out of the country as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  We must also think of those who have fled war in the Middle East and in Africa.  </p>  <p>  I am thinking of women who flee violence in their own home and I am grateful for the hard work that is under way to put a refuge for County Carlow on the priority list.  I know that this comes from working locally with all of the stakeholders, the victims, and the local authority.  We must do all we can to keep women safe and if today shows us anything, it shows us that women's refuges are so important.  We need to put timescales on their provision and I have been contacting the Minister on the timescale for Carlow.  It is important that every one of the nine counties that does not have a refuge is provided with one.</p>  <p> When we open our doors, as we absolutely should to refugees, we must ensure that we have the correct information and the proper support and facilities.  We need to do that and it must be a priority for us.  I sat on a committee today to carry out pre-legislative scrutiny of the Birth Information and Tracing Bill 2022 and we debated just last week the Institutional Burials Bill in the House.  I reflect on the courage and conviction of survivors of mother and baby homes in their continuing search for truth, justice and answers.  I thank them for all of their work to date in pushing for accountability at every level.</p> <p>Legislation such as this provides space for amendments to be made.  I have called for redress for all who were in mother and baby homes, I have called for fast-track medical cards and I have joined others in voicing survivors' needs, not just on International Women's Day but every day.</p> <p> On a day such as this, it is great that we can have this conversation about how we can be more inclusive and more equal, and how to try to make the world a better place for women and children.  That is important.  Fianna F&aacute;il has a long history of supporting gender equality.  Today, it was announced that the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage along with Women for Election will create a data hub with historical and real-time information to show the participation of women in political life since the foundation of the State.  That is very welcome.  All of us will agree that we need to make sure we are there and that women are remembered and talked about.  In the 2020 general election, 31% of the candidates were female.  I encourage all women to get involved with politics, whether it is in their community on parents' associations or community committees or running for election.</p> <p> Although the EU has been moving towards gender equality at a snail's pace, Ireland ranked seventh in the EU on the gender equality index.  Gender inequalities are most pronounced in the domain of power in which Ireland ranks tenth.  Despite improving since 2010, Ireland is furthest away from gender equality in political decision-making.  If women are not at the table, they cannot shape policy.  I am a firm believer that women at the table can make a major difference.  We work hard and we multitask, but that divide is definitely there.  We need to ensure that we conquer it.  The 32nd Government of Ireland includes just four women as Ministers in the Cabinet.  Eleven Ministers are men.  There are five female Ministers of State, but there are 16 male Ministers of State.  We need to look at women as Ministers, and to look at women across all boards.  We can do more, because we have so much to offer.  It is great that we can highlight this today because it is so important.  Almost half of Finland's parliamentarians are women, yet in Ireland only 22.5% of Deputies are women.  We have a great deal of work to do, and all of us together have a part to play.</p> <p> I hope all women had a lovely day today.  We just need to do more.  All of us have a duty of care to women.  We must make sure we put no obstacles in their way, encourage women to be inclusive in what they want to do and make sure they know they can make the change.  We can do that.</p></speech>

I wish all women, men, children and those who are suffering in Ukraine at present well.  I do not think &quot;Happy women's day&quot; is the proper expression, but I wish them well in difficult circumstances.</p><p>We have come a long way.  I have listened carefully to the debate so far.  Despite what people say, we have come a long way from where we were.  We needed to as well, because we were a long way down the list.  We can think of the suffragette movement across Europe, the United States and in this country and the long road the women had to travel.  It was a long way, and it seemed as if it was going nowhere.  We can think as well about how our society developed.</p><p>I wish to comment on one issue.  There is a feeling that men are anti-women and violent towards women.  That is not the issue.  The issue is that we have become a more violent society.  I have dealt with situations, as I am sure have the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and other Members, where people who are smaller in stature and weaker are set upon by people who are stronger and more robust and are callously attacked in an unacceptable way.  Perhaps our society needs to learn, to pull itself up short and recognise that this is not the way to go.  It most certainly is not the way to go.  I am sorry that Deputy Barry is not here now because he was complimenting communism on the great work done in Russia and various other places over the past 70 or 80 years or so.  I visited behind what was called the Iron Curtain.  The women were working in the fields with spades, shovels and so forth.  Communism did not do a whole lot for them either.</p><p>We need to recognise that this is an issue that affects everybody.  The rights of women and the recognition of women affect everybody and must be addressed.  It cannot continue as it is because it leaves half the population at all times feeling that they do not matter.  In fact, women are slightly more than half the population.  On days such as this we must remember people such as the late Monica Barnes and Nuala Fennell as well as Mary Flaherty, who is thankfully still with us, and the work they did.  There is also Nora Owen, Avril Doyle, Madeleine Taylor-Quinn and numerous others who I have not time to mention.  I keep thinking of other names.  They did a great job.  They came into the public arena and had something to say about it.  They talked about the rights of women at a time when it was not popular to do so.  They faced a little bit more.</p><p>I hope we have learned a little in the time since then and that we recognise the need to bring forward that half of the population who have been left behind to some extent.  I compliment the women who are extroverts and who come into public life, like you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle - you did not think you were going to get away with that - and have something to offer.  It is important that we listen to you, who has come from that particular starting point to where you are now.  That is important.  Harold Robbins wrote famously about an era that is somewhat similar to now.  He wrote <i>The Carpetbaggers</i>, <i>A Stone for Danny Fisher</i>and many other books, which we used to read when we were not supposed to read them.  We did, and the fact is that we learned a great deal from them.  We learned how society was going and how people were treated in society.  We learned how people who did not have influence were treated in society.  We absorbed all of that to the best of our ability, to the extent that in some of the things that are happening today we recognise what was happening then, all those years ago.  While we did not resolve them all, we tried to resolve some of them.</p><p>Finally, it behoves us all to respect women.  I will conclude with that.  Respect for women is hugely important at present.  It is to give an example and show that we do not support bullying, sexism or racism, all of which there is a lot of nowadays.  We do not support ageism or all the other &quot;isms&quot; that we have had around us for a long time.  We seem to take them as normal and to be accepted.  None of those is acceptable.  Everybody has rights.  Everybody has the right to stand up and say their piece at any time and anywhere.  I hope we have learned sufficient down through the years not to allow them but to ensure they can do that.  I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this issue.</p></speech>

You have been a wonderful role model since you were first elected to this Parliament.  I love to listen to you when you speak.  I am blessed to have five wonderful daughters and six granddaughters.  Indeed, they are my support team.  I also wish to thank my staff and helpers in the office, without whom I could not manage, including Geraldine, Vivienne, May, Cathy, Triona, Mair&eacute;ad, Councillor M&aacute;ir&iacute;n and Caroline, who all do tremendous work for me daily.  When I am not there, they deal with the public.  They get many compliments.  Obviously, they do not always get success, but they are a brilliant support team for me.</p>  <p>  I compliment Rachael Blackmore, who could not miss on Minella Lad, and the Nallen family, Elizabeth and John.  I also compliment the Daughters of D&uacute;n Iascaigh, a wonderful group of people who came together to acknowledge the history of the suffragettes and everything else over the centuries.  They had a wonderful afternoon tea and open-air event in The Square in Cahir last Sunday, which was attended by hundreds.</p> <p>It was to raise money for the wonderful Cuan Saor refuge in Clonmel.  It does tremendous work.  It should be funded by the Government.  We are privileged to have it.  Many counties do not have a women's refuge.  I am delighted it does such work.  There are people such as Josephine Casey, Patsy McGuirk, Fidelma and many others.  It was a lovely and joyous occasion.  I was not at the function because it was female only.  They had a wonderful evening.  They came out in their finery and displayed wonderful courage, wonderful enjoyment and wonderful fun and contributed hugely to charity.  I thank all the women I come across and say sorry to any of them if I have ever offended them.  We must praise them as we go along.</p></speech>

In particular, I thank the mothers whom I often speak about.  They are in charge of mom's purse.  I have often spoken about mom's purse.  What I mean by this is that if all is well with mom's purse everything is good but if it is not everything is not good.  Ministers for Finance should always keep a very close eye on mom's purse.  At the moment, mom's purse is under attack because of the massive increased costs in fuel, energy and the basic things we need to live.  Mothers and people managing the finances in houses are finding it extremely difficult at present.  I thank people in the housing department in Kerry County Council who deal with young mothers looking for housing.  I also thank those in the homeless section who deal with people who are vulnerable and in need of assistance.  I thank the people who operate the women's refuge and women's shelters.  To be honest, there should not have to be a women's refuge.  They should not have to seek refuge from anybody or anything.  There should not have to be a rape crisis centre in County Kerry or any other part of the country.  Services such as this should not be required.  This is how I look at it.  I compliment the people who work in the services.  I respect the great contribution of mothers in particular and the contribution that all women make in their jobs.</p></speech>

No disrespect to the Minister of State but throughout the debate there has been a gentleman on the Government side instead of a lady.  It would have been more appropriate that a female Minister was here, no disrespect to the Minister of State.</p>  <p>  International Women's Day gives us all a chance to recognise the extraordinary contribution of women in Ireland and throughout the world.  We should all be proud of the extraordinary achievements of women.  Many women who are by our side have made great sacrifices while also achieving so much.  We all know inspirational women who impact on all our lives.  Unfortunately, despite this we all know there is a long way to go before women achieve equality in our society, whether in the workplace or in the community.  It is important to recognise we would still not know about the tragic circumstances that have faced many families in this country if it were not for the bravery of women.  Many of doctors, nurses, clinicians and HSE staff are women who have been willing to put their jobs on the line so we can learn the truth about mismanagement of the entire public health care system in the country.  This is what I call pure leadership.  Our broken politics are failing all women and individual families.  Our broken health system is also failing women and families.</p>  <p>  We need to remember our female sporting heroes.  One of my favourite heroes is Katie Taylor.  She is a true champion boxer.  There is no one better in the world at her level.  She is a woman who can keep her head, her religion and her beliefs and be the greatest in the world at her sport.  I wish all women the best on this day.</p></speech>

I would not be here today to represent Limerick without them.  I wish a happy International Women's Day to all the front-line women who looked after us during the pandemic.  Today I will mention some women who rarely, if ever, get mentioned.  These are the women of the haulage companies, bus companies and agricultural contractors.  I watch a programme on TG4 at 9.30 p.m. every Thursday.  I am very proud to say my two nieces, who are involved in the agricultural business, have been on it.  Many more have also been on it.  It is worth people having a look at it to see women who are not recognised for what they do.  They are mothers and partners.  They have families.  They help to bring in the harvest and drive our trucks and buses but they are rarely recognised.  To all the women who do jobs who are never recognised I say happy International Women's Day.  Whatever they do I recognise them.  There are four women in my office who make sure I do what I have to do.  I thank everyone.  Happy International Women's Day to everyone.</p></speech>

T&aacute; athair agam sna flaithis agus is d&oacute;igh liom go bhfuil straois ar a aghaidh go bhfuiltear ag caint f&uacute;msa mar eiseaml&aacute;ir.  Is rud greannmhar &eacute; sin.  I welcome the opportunity to say a few words.  The fact I have been referred to as a role model certainly has put a smile on my father's face, who is somewhere up in heaven.  I can say that openly.  Deputy Durkan said that we are making progress.  We are making progress.  Let me put the progress in context.  In 1918, Countess Markievicz was elected as the first woman Member of the D&aacute;il.  In the Second D&aacute;il, we had five women and then it went up and down.  In 1981, we passed the barrier of having ten women in the D&aacute;il.  Finally, here we are in this D&aacute;il and we have 37 women Deputies.</p>  <p>  If we look then at equality it is not just about women; it is about a thriving economy.  I always try to use the language of men when I am speaking about domestic violence and gender-based violence.  We cannot possibly have a thriving economy nor an equal society so long as we have appalling violence.  I am afraid we have appalling violence.  It makes it impossible for mothers and children growing up in it to take part actively in society in a confident way.  What progress have we made on tackling domestic violence?  A conservative estimate of the cost is &euro;2.2 billion.  I am always uncomfortable using this measurement because there are so many other aspects of gender-based and sexual violence that I would like to talk about but I try to use the language of patriarchy.  The cost of it alone might catch attention so people will say even on that level we should begin to look at it.  This is a conservative estimate.</p>  <p>  In 1997, the year my second son was born, we had a task force on violence.  There was a report of 337 pages.  We are still speaking about something as basic as a safe place and a safe refuge.  I do not know how long we waited for the report.  There was constant pressure and we finally got it to be told what we all know, which is that there is no safe place for women or men when they are subjected to violence.  This is the most basic thing we need.  I would have thought that at this stage we would have places that were multifunctional.  We have statements on the Irish language and statements on International Women's Day.  We should have the aim that at some point these statements will be redundant.   At some point refuges should be redundant and then we can say we have done our job.  There was the appalling murder of Ashling Murphy.  I want to use her name again. I have used it before.  "Aisling" means dream.  The challenge for us is to make the dream of zero tolerance of violence against women a reality in her memory.  She is one of many women who have suffered.</p>  <p>  With regard to International Women's Day and the national maternity hospital, as I said earlier it is an absolute insult that three wise men at the top, who have been duly elected in a democracy, think it is okay to have secret talks or to collude with secret talks about something as important as a national maternity hospital.  Earlier, the Taoiseach told us to use our Private Member's time.  It has been used three times.  Three different groups have used Private Members' time to say it should be a public hospital on a public site that is run publicly.  If we have learned anything, this is the most basic thing we need.</p> <p><i>7 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p>Only today, the Taoiseach was infantilising women all over again, as the institutions did.  The Government and the three wise men know best and this hospital will be built regardless of what this D&aacute;il has clearly said on three occasions, with the Government not once voting against the motion.  That is significant.  We called for a public hospital on public land to be run publicly but it never happened.</p> <p> With regard to women in politics, women just have to have courage and stand.  I do not know what other supports we can provide.  Of course, supports are necessary but women have to stand up and say they look on the world differently.  We do not need more women for the sake of having more women.  Neither do we need more men.  We need people who see that climate change is an existential threat.  We need Deputies who do not see war as inevitable.  Women can bring a different perspective, the perspective that war simply does not work.  I welcome the men who come along with that.  In the end, we have to sit down, engage in diplomacy, look at what causes war in the first place and deal with that proactively.  We must use our neutrality in that manner, rather than seeing it as something that is negative or not active.  We should use it in a very active policy and bring a different perspective, the perspective of a woman and of all of the men who want to share it.  That perspective says there is a different way of doing things.  Ultimately, we have to go home, look our children in the eye and say there is a different way.  The planet is burning, whether from climate change or from war, and there is a great nuclear threat hanging over us.  We flippantly talk about war when there is no way out of it.  I welcome more women in politics.  I also welcome more men who see life in a different way and who have the courage to stand up and demand that this not be done in our name.</p> <p> There are many other things I could say but the pension issue is a direct result of the inequality.  I will mention one specific aspect of that, which was recently pointed out in the committee.  As a direct result of the marriage bar, which is only one of many discriminatory bars that were in place, 57,000 women do not qualify for the State pension.</p></speech>

While we have made significant advances in recent years, as the Taoiseach noted, we still have much work to do.  The Taoiseach has outlined a number of initiatives the Government is undertaking to promote gender equality, particularly in the workplace.  However, gender inequality can arise in many aspects of society and it is important we can identify where those inequalities occur when developing policies.  The public sector equality and human rights duty, arising from section 42 of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014, places a responsibility on all public bodies to promote equality, prevent discrimination and protect the human rights of their employees, customers, service users and everyone affected by their policies and plans.  This includes having regard to gender equality and, in practice, means all public bodies should reflect on the gender equality implications of their work.  Departments integrate this work into their strategic planning and annual reporting process.</p>  <p>  The mainstreaming of gender equality into the budgetary process is also being promoted by the Government.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform took forward a pilot approach in respect of gender budgeting in 2018, integrating equality budgeting into the existing budgetary process, involving the existing performance budgeting framework and using the processes already in place.  A pilot programme on equality budgeting was introduced in six policy areas and extended in subsequent years.  The initiative is supported by an equality budgeting expert advisory group, which brings together expert knowledge on how best to progress this important work.  On 9 March 2021, the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Minister for Finance announced that the Government had agreed to mainstream the approach to equality budgeting and to build on the progress to date in this area under an equality budgeting initiative.  An interdepartmental network of senior officials, chaired jointly by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, has been established to implement equality budgeting fully in line with recommendations contained in the OECD review.</p>  <p>  Mainstreaming of gender equality is crucial if we are to avoid unexpected and unintended gender equality impacts from policy and funding decisions.  It must cut across all of Government, all policy developers, all budget managers and all service providers.  Work is under way between the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to identify further measures to expand our equality budgeting capacity further.</p>  <p>  The outgoing national strategy for women and girls provides a whole-of-government framework through which women's empowerment would be advanced.  The strategy set out six high-level objectives.  Five of these took a thematic approach and aimed to advance socioeconomic equality for women and girls; promote their physical and mental well-being; increase their visibility in society and equal and active citizenship; promote women's participation in leadership; and combat gender-based violence.  The sixth high-level objective focused on, and was aimed towards, embedding gender equality in decision-making.  These objectives were advanced through 139 actions undertaken by Departments and agencies in co-operation with social partners and civil society, as appropriate.</p>  <p>  The strategy had initially covered the years from 2017 to 2020 but was extended by a further year due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the implementation of actions under the strategy.  While the strategy has now concluded, much of the work undertaken as part of it continues.  Many of the initiatives outlined here today arose from actions under the strategy.  The strategy will be evaluated this year, alongside the migrant integration strategy and the national Traveller and Roma inclusion strategy.  The Government has committed in the programme for Government to developing and implementing a new strategy, which will reflect the concerns regarding gender equality in the coming years.  The development of any future strategy will be conscious of, and respond to, the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic on women.  Work on a new strategy is anticipated to begin later this year.</p>  <p>  I will now turn briefly to my own ministerial portfolio on engagement on gender equality overseas.  This has been informed by our own national journey.  Gender equality is at the heart of Ireland's foreign policy.  At the UN Security Council, we have been leading the charge to advance the women, peace and security agenda and to bring women to the decision-making table.  In September, when we held the presidency of the Security Council, we set a new record for bringing in women from civil society to brief that body.  In our development assistance, we focus on interventions that have a transformative impact on gender equality.  In 2021, we made new commitments to support women-led organisations and to provide dedicated funding for girls' education, which is arguably the most transformative investment of all.  Violence against women and girls is among the most egregious of human rights violations globally and is a key driver of inequality.  Ireland continues to advocate for, and invest in, efforts to end gender-based violence, especially for those most vulnerable and in areas affected by conflict.</p></speech>

This further assessment does not fall under the Disability Act so there are no statutory obligations for these assessments to be completed in a timely manner&quot;;<br /><br />&mdash; section 13 of the Disability Act 2005 mandates the annual reporting and publication of aggregate unmet need for the purposes of identifying gaps in service provision and the resources required to meet need, yet no report has been published since 2009; <br /><br />&mdash; 212 legal actions were taken against the Health Service Executive between 2018 and 2020 in relation to overdue AON, amounting to &euro;701,000 in legal costs for the State; and<br /><br />&mdash; in October 2021, the Minister of State with responsibility for Disability advised the Oireachtas that the children's disability teams were short 400 staff;  further notes that:  	&mdash; there are long waiting lists for access to occupational therapy, speech and language therapy, and psychology services, including: <blockquote> 	&mdash; 18,303 children on occupational therapy waiting lists;<br /><br />&mdash; 9,532 children on psychology waiting lists; and<br /><br />&mdash; 8,167 children on speech and language therapy waiting lists; and </blockquote>&mdash; a survey conducted by AsIAm in June 2021, &quot;Every Child Counts: A Report into Autistic Children's Access to Healthcare in Ireland&quot; found that 80 per cent of parents and guardians have had to wait a year or more to receive an autism diagnosis for their child, and 79 per cent said they were not in receipt of any support from either the Early Intervention or School Age-Going Teams;  condemns the fact that:  	&mdash; in many cases, parents are forced to pay privately for an AON and associated therapies and interventions for their children, in order to access the necessary supports and interventions; and<br /><br />&mdash; the current situation represents a gross and unjustifiable inequity in healthcare and education provision, where children whose parents cannot afford to pay privately, take legal action or who live in areas with long waiting lists, are at a significant disadvantage in accessing the supports which they need and deserve; and calls on the Government to:  	&mdash; cease using the SPO to skirt its responsibilities, under the Disability Act 2005, to children in need of support;<br /><br />&mdash; provide appropriate, comprehensive, and clinically ethical AON in line with best practice as outlined by the professional associations representing occupational therapists, speech and language therapists, and psychologists;<br /><br />&mdash; ensure prompt access to a diagnosis where required to access specialist health or education services and further statutory entitlements;<br /><br />&mdash; immediately inform the D&aacute;il of the measures it intends to take to ensure that all children receive a comprehensive AON within the timeframe set down by the Disability Act 2005, and to ensure that these children have real access to the services which they need;<br /><br />&mdash; publish a costed and timebound implementation strategy for the Disability Services Capacity Review which includes targets to meet staffing needs;<br /><br />&mdash; publish a cross-departmental strategic workforce development plan to train, recruit and retain enough health and social care professionals;<br /><br />&mdash; publish all waiting lists for AON, further multidisciplinary assessment following AON, the number of open cases per Children's Disability Network Teams (CDNTs) and the number of children with and without an Individual Family Support Plan, as well as lists for access to services and interventions which are past their due date;<br /><br />&mdash; establish CDNTs in full, including the establishment of governance arrangements with a family forum attached to each CDNT;<br /><br />&mdash; recommence reporting of data and publication of reports pursuant to section 13 of the Disability Act 2005, to provide an evidence base for future planning of service capacity for unmet need;<br /><br />&mdash; immediately ratify the United Nations Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities;<br /><br />&mdash; amend the Disability Act 2005, to provide for a multidisciplinary, needs-based approach to AON as recommended by the Ombudsman for Children's Office in the October 2020 report entitled &quot;Unmet Needs: A report on the challenges faced by children in Ireland who require an assessment of their needs&quot;; and<br /><br />&mdash; require the Disability Appeals Officer to apply for relevant enforcement orders where there are breaches of the Disability Act 2005, to avoid parents having to take lengthy court cases to vindicate the rights of their children.  </blockquote>  <p>I am introducing this motion because children's disability services are at crisis point.  At least 40,000 children are on waiting lists for assessment or intervention.  Families have lost confidence in the new progressing disability model as they witness services worsening rather than improving as time goes by.  The rolling out of the progressing disability model promised to ensure more equal access to therapies for all.  As one parents said, so far it is equal in the sense that no one is getting anything.</p><p>Parents of children with additional needs must fight for everything.  They are tired and they are worn out.  They are contacting me, my colleagues and no doubt every elected representative in this House saying their children are not receiving the supports they deserve.  Their concerns are well founded and confirmed by surveys conducted by AsIAm and Down Syndrome Ireland.  Children are entitled to an assessment of need under the Disability Act 2005.  This assessment should indicate whether the applicant has a disability, the nature and extent of the disability, the health and educational needs of the applicant and the services required by the applicant.  It is a comprehensive assessment.  This should be done as a multidisciplinary needs-based approach and completed within six months.</p><p>However, this has been replaced by the standard operating procedure with a preliminary team assessment, PTA, being carried out instead.  This preliminary assessment does not constitute a proper assessment of needs, AON, it is not fulfilling the statutory right under the Disability Act and it must stop.  This is clear given that the average time for the completion of an AON is 29 hours while this PTA takes an average of 90 minutes.  I acknowledge that not all children will require a full assessment of need and the preliminary team assessment was meant as a way of identifying those children with the most pressing needs.  The intention was that those children would then be admitted onto a team where supports and services would be provided and further assessment carried out if required.</p><p>However, the reality is children who undergo the PTA are then just being put onto another list, a hidden and unaccountable list, or simply being told they will receive services in a number of years.  The clinicians, such as psychologists, speech and language therapists, occupational therapists, physiotherapists etc., are not comfortable with this procedure.  There has been an exodus of clinicians from the children's disability network, CDN, teams due to this as they are not prepared to dilute their professional standards so that the HSE can evade its obligations under the Disability Act.</p><p>The professional organisations warned the HSE that clinicians would leave, yet it proceeded with this model anyway.  There are staff shortages on all the teams and it is proving very difficult to recruit.  Many therapists will not work for the HSE due to poor working conditions and the lack of progression in their careers.  Many of the teams are made up of newly qualified therapists.  They need guidance and support but that is absent.  There seems to be poor management, no targets and no performance indicators.  How can the HSE stand over this?  How is value for money being measured?</p><p>In the meantime, families are forced to fight for everything.  They are accessing services privately even though the cost is excessive and some are borrowing to provide support for their children that they should be receiving through the HSE.  We are reaching the stage where there is no availability privately either.  What can parents do if they are told it will be two years before their child will receive the speech and language therapy he or she needs?  What do they do when they are offered five or six sessions of therapy and then nothing, or one session now and another in five months?  A proper assessment of need can cost in the region of &euro;1,500 and parents in many cases have no option but to source that privately as a diagnosis is necessary to gain admittance to a special school, a special class or an autism unit.  Every parent wants whatever supports are necessary to ensure his or her child can be the best versions of himself or herself.</p><p>The State has been brought to court in hundreds of cases because it has not met its obligations under the Disability Act.  It is disgraceful that parents are forced to take this action in the first place but it is more incomprehensible that these cases are even defended in court.  Instead of taking measures to address the problem, the HSE has spent hundreds of thousands of euro defending the indefensible.  It is now trying to shirk its responsibility through the introduction of the preliminary team assessment.</p><p>The State is also in breach of the Disability Act.  Section 13 of the Act mandates it to produce an annual report and to publish the aggregate unmet need for the purposes of identifying gaps in service provision and the resources to meet need.  The last time a report was published was in 2009.  It is past time to rectify all the shortcomings of the progressing disability model.</p></speech>

The Minister of State would accept that parents of children with disabilities or special needs should not need to battle to get access to an assessment of need or services.  In recent days an Teachta Tully and I have met hundreds of parents in person and through Zoom whose experience is one of a constant battle.</p>  <p>  It was heartbreaking to hear parent after parent talk about how difficult it is to get an assessment, and even if they get an assessment through the standard operating procedure, they go onto a different waiting list for a multidisciplinary assessment, and very often, even after all that, their children do not get the services they need.  Inclusion Ireland will be publishing the results of its survey on Thursday.  We have been told the contents of that survey will confirm everything in our motion about how parents feel, the impact it has on their children and their constant battle.  It is a battle to get a comprehensive assessment.</p>  <p>  The 2005 Act made it very clear that it should be a comprehensive assessment that determines whether the child has a disability, the nature and extent of the disability, and the health and education needs of the child.  In many cases this preliminary assessment does not do that.  Many parents advise that assessment can take as little as 20 minutes.  I have been in GP surgeries and I have been in there longer than 20 minutes.  I believe it is a maximum of 90 minutes but it is much less than that.  There is no way a child's disability can be determined in that timeframe.  That is what advocacy organisations are telling me.  AsIAm, Inclusion Ireland, the Disability Federation of Ireland and many more all confirm that is the direct experience of families.</p>  <p>  It is a battle to get the assessment on time.  This goes back to why parents are forced to take the State to court.  Many of us in this House have children.  Imagine having a child with a disability or special needs and being forced to take to State the court.  How traumatic that would be.  The State should be there for families and their children, but they are left with no choice but to take the State to court because the State is not delivering on its obligations.  It is absolutely appalling.</p>  <p>  Under the 2005 Act the Government is meant to publish at least once a year the aggregate assessment of need and the services that should be provided to children.  It should be published once a year and set out the overall staff requirement.  I believe that has not happened since 2009.  Why is that the case even though we are being told it is happening?  I know the Minister of State is talking to her officials, but that is what I have been told.  Perhaps she can clarify if that has happened because we cannot get access to those reports.</p>  <p>  Over 80% of children who are fortunate enough to have an assessment of need do not get access to any services, as shown in last year's AsIAm survey.  Let us wait and see what is in Inclusion Ireland's survey on Thursday.  Why should parents have that constant battle?  I say this to the officials who are here, to those in the Department who are listening and to politicians in government.  For once and for all we must decide we are going to do something about this and then do it.</p>  <p>  In the first instance we need to listen to what the Ombudsman for Children said when he pointed to a number of recommendations relating to the 2005 Act.  It was very strong regarding the right to an assessment of need.  However, I think the standard operating procedure and what some parents quite rightly describe as a short screening is not a proper assessment.  However, it is for that preliminary assessment when the six months kicks in and the clock starts ticking, not for those who go on a separate waiting list.  That is not fair and rightly it seen as waiting lists within waiting lists - hidden waiting lists.  That is not what we should be doing.  The 2005 Act needs to be strengthened.</p>  <p>  The Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs, EPSEN, Act also needs to be strengthened.  We need a new autism strategy underpinned by legislation.  We need to communicate to parents in very simple terms exactly what their child is entitled to, how the child will get access to those services, that he or she will get his or her assessment on time and that he or she has a clear service statement or assessment of need which sets out exactly what services the child is entitled to.  We then need to set about trying to provide those services as best we can.</p> <p>What all the advocate organisations and parents have said to me is that the critical solution to this is a proper workforce planning strategy.  We need to train more therapists, including speech and language therapists, and child psychologists.  We need to recruit and to retain more staff.  If we do not do that, we will not address the problems and the waiting lists will get longer.</p></speech>

Deir na figi&uacute;ir&iacute; go bhfuil 300 duine ag fanacht ar mheas&uacute;n&uacute; riachtanas i ndeisceart chathair Chorca&iacute;.  T&aacute; 131 d&eacute;anach do staid 2 den phr&oacute;iseas sin agus t&aacute; 102 tr&iacute; mh&iacute; d&eacute;anach.  T&aacute; 204 leanbh ag fanacht le cr&iacute;ochn&uacute; an phr&oacute;iseas um meas&uacute;n&uacute; riachtanas.  The progressing disability services model is not fit for purpose.  Therapists have been removed from special schools without a functioning alternative to accessing these crucial therapies.  The children's disability network teams in Cork are very far from being up and running.  One such team in north Cork city is so under pressure due to staffing gaps that have never been filled that it has contacted parents encouraging them to complain to the HSE, its own employer, in the hopes of getting some support.</p><p>The figures in my constituency are dire.  Team 11, for the south east of the city, is missing a psychologist and 2.2 speech and language therapists.  West central Cork is missing 2.6 occupational therapists, 1.3 speech and language therapists and 2.2 psychologists.  It is the same story in Carrigaline, which is missing one physio, half a speech and language therapist post, more than two occupational therapists and two psychologists.  It goes on and on.  Family representative groups were meant to be set up under the progressing disability services programme to allow parents to be fully engaged.  Not one has been invited to participate.  I asked parents in Cork.  One local mother was told by an official in the office of the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, that funding would be given in order that therapeutic supports taken from schools would be reinstated in special schools.  That is still not happening, and the Minister of State said that on 28 January to that parent.</p><p>To put it plainly, this uphill battle, this fight for assessments of need and for reinstatement of crucial therapies, basic things to which these children have a right, cannot continue.  They are being denied the ability to meet their potential.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-08a.331" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1604" speakername="Claire Kerrane" time="19:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030800040#PP00300"><p>I too commend my colleague Deputy Tully on the work she has done in bringing forward this motion.  For a parent with a child who has additional needs, the battle for services and supports is constant.  A parent may notice something when the child is only two or three years of age: their balance, their eye contact or their inability to do things children of the same age can do.  That is just the start of a very long road.  Parents may know very little about the world they are about to enter when seeking an assessment for a child with a view to seeking a diagnosis and ensuring they get the child the help he or she needs.  Some parents cobble together the money to go private.  Some get into debt just to get that initial assessment and then realise the child has just been moved onto another waiting list.  Without that initial assessment, parents will struggle to qualify for the domiciliary care allowance.  They will not have enough medical evidence because they cannot get the assessment so they cannot get that really important income support.  The child starts school, has not been assessed and requires additional supports and they cannot get an SNA.  Everything is a battle, as has been said, from assessments to therapies to day services to respite.  It should not be a battle.  Why is it that, rather than fix the issue, that is, the delays and the waiting lists, the Government chooses to create something to make it look like it has done something when instead it misleads people and makes the situation worse?  As has been said, the Government has created what can only be described as a screening exercise, a pre-assessment to the assessment of needs, to cover up the failure to meet the obligation it should meet, as set out in the Disability Act.  It is of no benefit to the child or to his or her parents.  The child is no further on after it and instead moves onto another waiting list.  It is now common knowledge that you have to go to court in order to get your child the services he or she needs.</p>  <p>  In my constituency there are hundreds of children on waiting lists across speech and language therapy, occupational therapy and physiotherapy.  One mother in my constituency has a son aged 17.  He has autism.  She has fought and fought his entire life.  She is and always has been his voice.  She told me that a neighbour approached her the other day.  The neighbour is concerned about her own child.  The mother said she felt sick having to tell the young mother what she has to face into and the road she has ahead.  There is almost a fear of entering the system in the first place.</p>  <p>  The solutions have been brought forward.  They are in this motion.  I ask the Minister of State to fix the actual issue and to fix it now.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-08a.332" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="19:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030800040#PP00400"><p>I thank Deputy Tully for bringing forward this proposal.  Waiting lists for assessments of need for children across Laois-Offaly have been spiralling out of control for years.  In Laois-Offaly, according to figures supplied by the HSE, just 17% of assessments of need applications were completed within the legal timeframe of six months.  Overall, in CHO 8, the figure is 16%.  These are shockingly poor outcomes.</p>  <p>  A constituent of mine contacted me this week and told me, as she did again this morning, about her situation.  She is a single parent working full-time.  She has a six-year-old girl with a learning disability.  She is paying a mortgage and needs a car to travel to work at the other end of the county.  She is paying privately for physiotherapy and occupational therapy for her daughter.  Her child has been referred for an autism assessment and the mother said she just cannot afford much more and is watching her child suffer.  That child will now most likely be forced to go private to get the assessment she needs, which will cost more than &euro;1,000.  Many parents are borrowing the money for these assessments.  The Minister of State, Deputy Butler, hears of such cases and I hear of them.  That is the reality on the ground.</p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in has committed to trying to put forward proposals to end the constant battle of trying to get children's needs assessed.  This evening we are putting forward our firm, constructive proposals.  We are calling for a roadmap to be produced which would ensure that all children will receive a comprehensive assessment of need within the timeframes set down in the Disability Act, not a makey-up assessment that just clears a waiting list, after which a further assessment is required, as previous speakers have outlined.</p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in is also calling for a plan to be established - this is very important - to recruit and develop adequate numbers of health and social care professionals to deliver services in line with best practices.  We need that pipeline, and we have amplified that issue here a number of times.  That is a concrete proposal we are making.  Our 2022 budget proposals include costings for more than 150 additional psychologists, 100 occupational therapists and 250 speech and language therapists.  That is the least we can do to ensure that children are not left behind in their early years and that this intervention is made at that really important point in time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-08a.333" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1509" speakername="Maurice Quinlivan" time="19:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030800040#PP00500"><p>If there is one group that knows what is right for children with special educational requirements, it is their parents.  Their love for their children is unconditional and they will fight and lobby to ensure their children get the appropriate supports in a timely manner.  In my experience, the parents of children with special educational requirements are the bravest and most determined people I know.  They never, ever give up.</p>  <p>  Last Friday night I was delighted to attend a fundraiser in support of ASD Ireland at Our Lady of Lourdes National School, in Limerick, a fantastic school.  It was organised with the full support of the school by Helen Connolly, mother of Jack, who has autism and attends the school.  Her fight was not just for her son but for all the kids in that school.  This is so typical of parents of children with special needs.  They will do everything and anything for their child but they need the State to step up to the mark as well.</p>  <p>  The Government is failing children who have disabilities and additional needs.  Parents must battle tooth and nail to access supports for their children.  This is abundantly clear when we look at the backlog of assessments.  Parents should not have to contact my constituency office or any other constituency office to try to have their children assessed more quickly.  Waiting for an assessment is extremely stressful for parents, as is not knowing what the issue is.  In the mid-west region the waiting lists are extremely concerning.  As of October 2021, 148 children were waiting 12 to 18 months for an initial speech and language assessment, with an incredible 53 people waiting more than 24 months.  For even one child to be waiting that long is a scandal.  That is two years during which children and their development are damaged.  That is not just what I believe; it is what the experts say repeatedly.  This is not some sort of anomaly; unfortunately, it seems to be the norm.  These are young people in the best years of their lives and their development is being stymied because the State cannot provide them with assessments in a timely manner.</p>  <p>  Awareness of children with special educational requirements has come on leaps and bounds in the past decade.  Children with additional needs can live full and happy lives, as can their parents, if they are assessed early with the correct structures and supports put in place.  The Disability Act 2005 provides that an assessment of need must be commenced and completed within a six-month period.</p> <p>In too many cases, this timeframe is missed.  It is disgraceful that so many families had to take court cases against the State because of its failure to deliver prompt assessment of a child's needs.  Parents should never have to do that.  Initial assessment should be within the requirement set out in the Disability Act.</p> <p> Like most things in our health service, we have a two-tier reality when it comes to the provision of assessments.  Many parents, both those who can and cannot afford it, opt to pay for private assessment of needs and therapies as the child cannot afford to wait for public appointments.  The Government needs to end this debacle and outline what steps it will take to sort this issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-08a.335" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1614" speakername="Mary Butler" time="19:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030800041#QQ00200"><p>I thank the Deputies for tabling this motion.  I welcome the opportunity to restate the Government's commitment to children with disabilities and their families.  There are important challenges we must face if disability services in this country are to meet the hopes and expectations of those at the heart of the service and to enable them optimise their potential as they mature.</p>  <p>  It would be disingenuous to ignore the fact there have been difficulties in certain parts of the country in the implementation of the progressing disability services, PDS, programme by the HSE which have resulted in delays for families in accessing much-needed therapies for their children.  That position is regrettable and I offer the Government's sincerest apologies to any family experiencing such delays.  Such delays are unacceptable.  That is why the Government is not opposing the motion.  This House stands together on significantly reducing waiting times for children who require therapy supports.  Every day delayed for a child is a day lost in his or her development.</p>  <p>  There is a strong possibility that each Deputy in this House has been contacted by a family with concerns around delays in getting an assessment of need, speech and language therapy, occupational therapy or other supports to help their child.  The sense of frustration and anger which comes across in the letters, emails and phone calls to our offices is heartbreaking, and parents' frustrations are entirely understandable.</p>  <p>  My colleague, Deputy Anne Rabbitte, was appointed Minister of State with responsibility for disabilities in July 2020 and I can say without fear of contradiction that she has been relentless in her efforts to champion much-needed improvements in disability services for children.  One of the issues the Minister of State sought to remedy immediately was the number of overdue assessments of need for children throughout the country.  At the end of June 2020, this backlog, for a number of reasons, had risen to approximately 6,500.  By working with the Minister for Health, the Minister of State secured funding to address this issue and clear the existing backlog.  When an issue arose concerning existing special schools-based therapy posts transferring off site to children's disability network teams, the Minister of State listened closely to parents' concerns and additional funding was secured and provided to the HSE to allow therapists to stay on site at special schools while allowing network teams to be strengthened through additional posts.</p>  <p>  I am sure the Opposition Members will acknowledge that the Minister of State has had significant levels of engagement with them since taking office, briefing them on the services for children in their constituencies while acknowledging problems and seeking solutions.  Future solutions are not the exclusive property of Government and the Minister of State is happy to listen to constructive suggestions, regardless of what side of the House they come from.  This is a challenge I issue to the Deputies participating in this debate.  Criticism of the present position is accepted but constructive engagement on these issues from all quarters is needed so that we can work together in getting an improved service for the children who need these supports.</p>  <p>  The implementation of the PDS programme is agreed Government and HSE policy.  This policy supports the reconfiguration of children's disability services to provide equitable child- and family-centred services based on need rather than diagnosis and aligns with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  The PDS model addresses the previous inequity in service provision, whereby there may have been an excellent service for some children and little or no service for others.  This variance may have been linked to diagnosis, age group or geography.  Regardless of the reason, it did not represent optimum practice.  Children's disability services are changing from diagnosis-based to needs-based so that all children with a disability or developmental delay have access to the right service based on their needs, no matter where they live.</p>  <p>  By the end of 2021, all 91 children's disability network teams, CDNTs, were established to provide services and supports for all children with complex needs in their respective geographic areas.  These teams comprise health and social care professionals, including nursing, occupational therapy, psychology, physiotherapy, speech and language therapy, social work and others.  The teams work closely together in a family-centred model, focusing on the child's and family's priorities.  The intention of this model is that every child with complex needs will have access to a team, regardless of the nature of his or her disability, where he or she lives or the school he or she attends.  Children and their families will have access to the full range of services and supports of the CDNT according to their individual needs.  This includes universal, targeted and specialist supports such as individual therapeutic intervention and access to specialist consultation and assessment when needed.</p>  <p>  It must be acknowledged that the implementation of PDS and the subsequent reconfiguration of services has not been without significant problems, the vast majority of which are related to recruitment and retention of the critical staff needed to service the needs of the children.  Since 2019, and including 190 posts announced in the recent HSE national service plan 2022, more than 475 development posts have been allocated to children's disability services throughout  the country in specialties such as speech and language therapy, occupational therapy, physiotherapy, psychology and dietary.  However, there are recruitment challenges in the disability area due to a combination of workforce availability and the significant level of employment opportunities across the wider health sector.  These opportunities provide these personnel with options on the areas in which they wish to work.  Working with children with complex needs is hugely rewarding but is also very demanding, and recruitment and retention of staff is presenting challenges to the HSE.  These challenges affect the capacity of the service being provided.  It is obvious that demand for therapeutic supports is outstripping supply and more therapists are required to meet this demand, but this is a recruitment rather than a resources issue, as evidenced by the funding provided to employ almost an additional 500 therapists for disability services since 2019.</p>  <p>  I reiterate my challenge to all Deputies in the House.  By all means criticise the Government where it is merited but support that criticism with fresh thinking and new ideas as to how this problem can be resolved.  No one in the House, irrespective of his or her allegiance, wants to see a child having to wait a year, month or day longer than necessary to receive therapy supports.  I assure all that this Government, and particularly my colleague, the Minister of State, will remain focused on providing the best possible services for children and adults with disabilities.</p>  <p>  Go raibh maith agaibh.  The Minister of State will respond at the end of the debate.</p></speech>

It will not even publish how badly it is failing to meet the crisis.  It uses doublespeak to hide how badly it is doing.  It shuffles children around and puts them in different categories to make it look like progress is being made.  It is dishonest and deceptive.  The way we are warehousing these children instead of investing in services and getting them the therapies and assessments they need is immoral.</p>  <p>  All the sleight of hand by the Government and HSE will not change the reality of 8,000 children on speech and language waiting lists, 9,000 waiting on psychology and 18,000 waiting on occupational therapy.  We are failing these children and causing them long-term harm.  The Government must fulfil its obligations under the Disability Act and we cannot have families being forced into taking legal action so their children can get an assessment or access to care.  We cannot deny vulnerable children their rights any longer.</p> <p>Without an assessment or early intervention, the quality of life for a child with additional needs regresses.  There is no early intervention in this State, not when waiting lists for urgent interventions by school age teams take long months or even years.  </p> <p> We are making the lives of families a misery by forcing them into legal action or to pay for costly private assessments, just to try to get their child on a waiting list for care.  What has been the Government's response to assessment waiting lists?  It has slashed the time that a child gets in an assessment, when he or she finally gets that far.  All a child gets now is 90 minutes, when it used to be 29 hours.  We are short 400 key staff across the disability teams.  A Minister stood here in October and told us that not one child in my area of CHO 7 was waiting for an assessment of need.  The HSE told me at Christmas, only a few months later, that 1,800 children had not even reached stage 1 of the process in CHO 7.  That is another example of the doublespeak from the Government.</p></speech>

Back in October 2020, the Ombudsman for Children's Office, OCO, published a report, Unmet Needs, which set out the challenges experienced by children with additional needs requiring assessments.  The report highlighted the violations of the rights of children with additional needs and delays to assessments.  The HSE is obliged to commence a full assessment within three months of a child's application and this must be completed within six months.  In most cases, this is not happening.</p><p>The length of time children are waiting has forced families to go down the private route and to pay for an assessment, as many fear their children are being left behind by this Government.  For other families, the private route is not an option.  Why is it that the parents of children with additional needs must fight tooth and nail to get their children what they are entitled to?  They must fight for housing, school places, special needs assistants, SNAs, school transport, speech and language classes and carers allowance.  They must battle for any and all kinds of assistance.  Yet the biggest fight they face is getting what they are entitled to from the State.  In the context of the Mind the Gap report, Dr. Niall Muldoon, the Ombudsman for Children, stated that: </p> <blockquote> 	It is high time that children with [additional needs] and their families stop having to battle to overcome barriers.  Our laws and policies must serve all of our children and allow them all to access the best education possible.  It is our duty to empower them to be the best they can be and the structures must be there to support their development.  It is high time for the State to lead, not impede. </blockquote>  <p>In October 2021, the Minister of State told the Oireachtas that there were more than 400 staff shortages in children's disability services.  Is this going to be addressed?  This must be a priority for any Government.  Many parents are tired and exhausted from fighting the system to get their children what should be a given in any kind of society.  We are not much of a society if we do not look after children with additional needs and parents.</p></speech>

It is important and she has proved to be an important voice for children with disabilities and for their parents, and I thank her for that.  I do not doubt that the Minister of State wants to do something about this situation.  She knows about the waiting lists and about the parents, because if they are contacting me and my colleagues about these issues, they are also contacting the Minister of State.  I am also aware that she knows each and every case.  When parents look at their children and see that something is not quite right, perhaps because they are not behaving in the way their siblings might, they know something is wrong.  That is where the battle starts.  The parents battle and battle.</p>  <p>  I listened to the Minister of State's colleague who said that she wants suggestions and some solutions.  We need a new autism strategy and we need it urgently.  We also need a workforce planning strategy.  The Minister of State knows places do not exist to train speech and language therapists, psychologists and all the other disciplines we require across the board.  We need proper integration between third level institutions and the HSE, but it is not happening.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State knows the craziness in this regard.  Let us take the example of a speech and language therapist who gets the wonderful news that she is pregnant and is going to go on maternity leave.  When do we recruit for that position?  We start the recruitment process when that speech and language therapist leaves her post and not on the day it was announced.  It is the same situation when people hand in their notice.  Riddle me that situation.</p></speech>

That is a disgrace in itself.  It is not equal in all areas either.  When people come from rural areas, like where I come from in Mayo, in CHO 2, things do not work together.  Somebody must be responsible in the system for making things happen and making things work together, but that is not being done.  The Minister of State has responsibility for this portfolio and I want her to hold people accountable in the HSE.  I will finish up because there is another speaker.</p></speech>

This is a situation where many parents have come to me when they have not dealt with the system before.  Even people who are able to afford private care are shocked by the lack of any services available.  These parents struggle to get assessments and have to go private.  They are on waiting lists.  One of the people they were dealing with, a speech and language therapist, told them that the recommended caseload was 25, while the actual caseload to be dealt with was 400.  There must be workforce planning in this regard because the stress this situation has placed on parents of children has led to marriages breaking up and to making a difficult situation even worse.  A structure must be put in place to make this system as effective as possible for the children.  Early intervention can make the difference between a full life and a significantly diminished one.</p>  <p>  We have spoken before about the issues that affect children with special educational needs and this situation is getting more grotesque.  The courts are getting more crowded with cases that have been taken by desperate parents.  Mr. Justice Meenan recently questioned whether such cases were the best use of the resources of the justice system, given how many are settled, which is practically all of them, and costs awarded.  While constrained by the separation of powers, the judge has a point.  Cases may be settled, but the proverbial situation is one where no cases would have needed to have been taken at all if there had been proper provision of services instead.  </p>  <p>  That would avoid situations like the one we saw recently in Kerry.  As part of the scandal there concerning the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, children who needed special educational supports were left waiting.  They were sometimes prescribed antipsychotic medication when they were suffering from social anxiety and issues like that.  That harmed those children and compounded the developmental issues they were experiencing.  Permanent damage was sometimes caused to them, cutting off what could have been a fruitful developmental arc if they had received the proper supports.  In cutting corners and pinching pennies, the Government has created hostages to fortune.  It is, however, the lives of these children we are dealing with.  Urgent action in line with the steps outlined in our motion is required.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-08a.350" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1551" speakername="Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in" time="19:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030800042#RR00900"><p>I thank Deputy Tully for the work she has put into this motion.  In my work, several things strike me when I meet the parents of children with additional needs.  I refer to the exhaustion and the frustration, as well as the challenge of dealing with a diagnosis that can be quite difficult.  It is a learning process.  Parents can be dealing with a diagnosis they did not know anything about and which they must endeavour to understand better.  They must try to understand the terminology involved and then empower their wider family.  Then, they must be at least a part-time campaigner, if not a full-time one, to wage war against the State.  That is what is so disappointing about this situation.</p> <p>Parents live their lives as citizens of this republic and do everything they feel is right.  They pay their taxes, obey the law and live a good life, but all of a sudden they have a child in their care who they love deeply and they can see the State is coming up short.  That leads to a major level of resentment within a family and it can feel as if nobody is really speaking, caring, advocating for their child or empowering their child.  It leads to incredible issues within the family unit.</p> <p> I have come across families who are absolutely exasperated and exhausted.  It feels as if wherever we turn in Irish society, other people are stepping up.  The average GAA club takes on all-star sections to encourage children with additional needs to play Gaelic games.  I know of initiatives to make towns and village centres around the country autism-friendly and we are trying to encourage that in Raheny and Donaghmede in my constituency.  There seems to be an awareness and understanding among lobby groups of the need to listen better to organisations like AsIAm, Inclusion Ireland and others.  There seems to be a uniformity of approach to empower, understand and listen to families and the likes of the Ombudsman for Children, who spoke today.</p> <p> The one area where we feel there is a lack of evidence of stepping up, unfortunately, is with the State.  The Ombudsman for Children remarked today about the fact that more than 34,000 children are waiting over a year for community health services, which is a stunning statistic.  When I meet people who work in the HSE, they speak of the retention and recruitment issue, which has been referenced in the Minister of State's remarks.  However, the Labour Party made suggestions last April in a Private Members' motion that was, again, accepted by the Government.  It advocated that the State should bring forward a national autism strategy.  The Government is not opposing this evening's motion and it did not oppose our motion last year.  Unfortunately, the action is lacking.  I can go to services in my constituency, such as ABACAS school in Kilbarrack, where I can see the conditions that children are expected to learn under.  When I meet the parents, they feel that once again, for whatever reason, their children are not at the top of the political priority list.</p> <p> I understand the Minister of State saying this is not a resources issue and there are other factors.  This is not a new problem and it has been evident for a number of years.  Parents have been trying to access school places in my constituency.  When they do so, they are handed a list of schools by the special educational needs organiser, SENO, with the State again stepping away from the responsibility to find a school place.  A parent has to go to school after school, even 17 schools in one case, to try to find a school place for a child.  A school place in Drogheda was suggested for a child despite the child living in Donaghmede.  There is an absolutely unbelievable type of expectation on parents who again are coming to terms with a diagnosis, terminology and challenges within the family that are absolutely exhausting them.</p> <p> I believe we can agree that we should have a vision of a republic where any child with a diagnosis, a need or a challenge would have the State enveloping the child with such compassion and the family with such empowerment that the family would feel proud to live in this country.  They should be able to say to anybody they know in another country that when they got the diagnosis, despite it being challenging, there was an immediate assessment of need and interventions.  They should be able to say the school was absolutely resourced to accept the child and build his or her education.  They should be able to say the community in which they live knew exactly how to interact with the child and family.  They should be able to celebrate eventually because they are enabled to learn so much from the child.  That could be the vision that we could achieve collectively.  What happens, however, is that a family gets a diagnosis and it is a devastating moment in life because they know the State will not help.  It is not a small decision for a family to end up in court and many of these families have never stood in a courtroom before.  It is not something that comes naturally to them.  How depressing must it be to walk into a courtroom and see the symbol of the country over the judge's head and know this republic is letting you down?</p> <p> Last April we put forward a motion on a national autism strategy and we were trying to bring all the different elements of government into one movement and make things better.  This was so families could feel as if they could point to a strategy.  Again, this is a political point.  When we have arguments over tax and spend in this Chamber, the Ministers of the Government justify tax cuts to the tune of &euro;500 million.  I always think of these families when that happens.  The Minister of State may say it is not about resources or funding but it comes down to that at some level.</p> <p> This is not a new problem or something that has just arrived today.  I have been dealing with it for at least three years.  I want the Minister of State to consider again a national autism strategy and make a commitment that we can drive down these numbers.  We must be able to say to the families of this country that they do not need to be exhausted or work as campaigners because this State will absolutely support and empower them.  I spoke about the ABACAS school in Kilbarrack, and nobody in the Government should feel the conditions there are acceptable.  The Ombudsman for Children, the Opposition, lobby groups and others are stepping up.  I have mentioned GAA clubs and community initiatives.  They all see across society the value in understanding and empowering.  It is deeply frustrating when the State does not appear to understand it too.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-08a.352" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1525" speakername="Holly Cairns" time="19:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030800043#SS00200"><p>I thank Deputy Tully and Sinn F&eacute;in for raising this very important matter.  The considerable waiting lists for assessment of need and the therapeutic interventions they should lead to form one of the primary barriers faced by children with disabilities and their families.  The Ombudsman for Children highlighted this disgraceful position in his 2020 report, Unmet Needs, and I will quote from it.  It states:</p> <blockquote> 	We have received many complaints from distraught parents whose children have been on a waiting list for years to access an assessment of need for their child.  Many have found that once their child is assessed, they struggle to get any or all of the services recommended to help their child talk, move, learn and grow. </blockquote>  <p>We are all aware of this and I know all Members are contacted about this issue weekly.  It is a continual topic at the disability matters committee.  Our health services are failing children and young people.  Not only is this position a breach of their rights but it will have a lasting impact on their capacities across their lives.  The earlier an intervention, the more effective it is and the better it is for the individual and society.</p><p>The waiting lists for assessment of needs should be of utmost concern to every Member of the D&aacute;il.  Assessment of needs is supposed to be the first step in a process providing children with a range of therapeutic and educational supports that they need to live as independently as possible.  It is a foundational intervention that has incredibly beneficial impacts on children and young people.  A proper wrap-around system of health supports to assist the development of children is one of the most powerful and empowering interventions that we as a society can offer.  However, if the first step does not happen, if it is delayed or it is not performed fully, children and the families concerned will have already been failed.  It has knock-on effects.</p><p><i>8 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p>Delays of months for young children can have profound impacts.  Parents know this.  They are incredibly worried and stressed.  Those who can afford to do so go privately for providers of assessments and therapies.  I use the phrase &quot;those who can afford to&quot; cautiously.  These are not necessarily wealthy families.  They are ordinary people who can manage to save enough money through hard work, sacrifice and borrowing to access services the State should be providing.  Then of course there are the families who cannot afford it no matter how much they save or borrow.  There are families from migrant backgrounds or in direct provision who cannot navigate the systems nor afford them.  There are whole groups of children who are being left behind by successive Governments.  No one wants this situation.  We all know it is disgraceful, yet it is a daily reality for many families across the country.<br/><br/>A worrying aspect of the situation as noted in the motion is the technicalities being used to work around the requirements to provide full and proper assessment of needs.  The duration and content of these assessments should be clinically defined by best international practice.  We know that before the introduction of the standard operating procedure, the assessment process took an average of 29 clinical hours to complete.  Now it is nowhere near that.  A child would be lucky to get even a fraction of that in therapeutic hours in west Cork, not to mind an assessment of that calibre.  It would seem that the administrative targets are being given priority here.  Children's assessments and treatments should only be decided on the basis of best clinical practice.  Unfortunately this situation sums up reality for so many children and adults with disabilities in Ireland.  Disability rights are in name only.  The rights to healthcare and education are being failed daily.<br/><br/>I am in contact with numerous families in Cork South-West and beyond who have to fight to get access to therapies and learning support.  Families have to travel hours to get occupational therapy or speech and language therapy appointments.  They have to wait around for cancellations of those appointments even, and fund-raise for special needs assistants.  They have to rely on community supports and donations to get suitable vehicles.  Despite Ireland eventually having ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, there is a massive gap between the law and the lived reality of individuals and their families.<br/><br/>The motion calls for immediate ratification of the optional protocol to the convention.  I have been pushing for this repeatedly at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Disability Matters and in this House.  The protocol is an essential mechanism to hold the State and State bodies to account in the provision of services.  The consistent and persistent failure to realise the UN convention points to the glaring need for the protocol.  Sin&eacute;ad Gibney, the chief commissioner in the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, stated:</p><blockquote>	'Optional Protocol' is a technical term that unfortunately does a disservice to its meaning and significance, and which masks the urgent need for action for people with disabilities and our society.  The Protocol is about empowering people with disabilities. </blockquote> <p>While the language is technical and it can seem divorced from everyday life, this is an incredibly important thing to help strengthen the rights of people with disabilities.  Far from being optional, it is a vital measure relating to implementing the convention.  It provides more local remedies and removes discriminatory laws and practices.  <br/><br/>At the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Disability Matters, experts including the UN Special Rapporteur on Disabilities and the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission have clearly said that the optional protocol can be ratified immediately.  It is a political decision.  The Government can ratify it tomorrow if it chooses.  Currently it seems there is an institutional aversion to the protocol as a tool to hold the State to account.  It took over ten years for us to ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  Individuals, communities and advocacy organisations are deeply concerned that ratification of the protocol is also years away.<br/><br/>Ireland is supposed to have a social model of disability, an approach which recognises how individuals are disabled by society, for example, by barriers put in place such as inaccessible buildings, needlessly complicated forms and a lack of Irish Sign Language services.  However, the State still seems to have a medicalised model of disability that defines these areas in terms of physiology.  The primary medical certificate is a prominent example of this.  The use of medical certificates and stringent criteria is not only antiquated, it is actively obstructing the independence and rights of disabled people.  We need a system that is less concerned with exact medical and physiological issues and more with the individuals and how they can be empowered to live as independent a life as possible.  We all know of cases where families have to fund-raise for adapted cars and vans for young children with disabilities.  The State is failing these children and adults who are just looking for a fair shot at being able to get an adapted vehicle.  Until the cultural understanding of disability is changed within all Departments and State bodies, these barriers will remain.  Disabled people will still be failed and we will still have to fight for basic services.<br/><br/>Before Christmas, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Disability Matters heard from a family who had moved from Australia to Ireland.  In Australia, their child received two hours of occupational therapy, one hour of physiotherapy, one hour of speech and language therapy and one hour of vision therapy every week with an extra intensive therapy period every three months.  The family moved to Galway.  Their daughter received considerably less but still got early intervention including regular physiotherapy, hydrotherapy, occupational therapy, speech and language therapy and even family respite.  The family then moved to Cork and the level of service plummeted.  Like many other families they have had to pay privately for physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech and language therapy and for carers because none of those services were available publicly in Cork.  Not only is Ireland providing significantly less support to children than other countries; there is a massive variation in services within Ireland.  It is literally a postcode lottery.  This is a terrifying reality for families in Ireland.  The motion outlines vital actions to realise the rights of children and provide them with the care they need.  It is essential that this motion is passed and, crucially, acted on by Government.  <br/><br/>I have 50 seconds left.  One of the issues I raised last week with the Minister for Education, the Minister of State with responsibility for special education, the Taoiseach, the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, and so on was in respect of our early intervention classes.  It was flagged that the NCSE had told a school in Cork South-West that its early intervention class was to close, that this was the national policy and that the classes would be phased out in favour of the access and inclusion model.  When I raised it with the NCSE it was very evasive and that made me more worried.  When I raised it with the Minister for Education she did not answer the question.  When I raised it with the Taoiseach who, to be fair, cannot know every single thing that is going on in every Department, he seemed sure that would not happen.  When I raised it with the Minister of State with responsibility for special education at the committee, she said it would not happen.<br/><br/>Based on all the previous things before that, I want to flag it again with the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte.  The access and inclusion model is not suitable for many children who go into our early intervention classes.  We obviously need more of them based on the waiting lists.  One of the things the NCSE and all those Ministers were saying was that it was a matter of providing them where they are needed but in that case it was needed.  There were staff in place, students enrolled and a waiting list but they were taking it away.  That decision has been reversed which is welcome.  I want to flag it with the Minister of State to ensure it cannot happen anywhere else.</p></speech>

I do want to welcome the motion and the issue Sinn F&eacute;in is highlighting.  One of the main demands, that we should scrap the standard operating procedures, is one we would like to echo.  This is a con job designed to massage the figures and give the impression that something is being done about the scandal that is the assessment of needs and how the State treats its most vulnerable.  Since I came into the D&aacute;il in 2016, I and my colleagues here have had countless constituents coming to us in exasperation and despair about trying to get their children the care and supports they need.  The first obstacle in a long list is the assessment of needs process.  Those who are forewarned can simply go private or, most often, struggle to do so.  Those who cannot go private will languish on waiting lists.  When we have submitted parliamentary questions on this issue, we have received astonishing replies from the HSE.  Dates were set at a year or 18 months into the future for an assessment.</p> <p>Then there was the whizz some genius decided on, namely, the standard operating procedure, to give the appearance that something is being done when, in fact, it is only an added process and obstacle - in effect, a queue to get into a queue.  We know the consequences and trauma caused by this and have done so for many years.  We know there have been serious staff shortages for years.<br/><br/>When we asked for the data on the number of children in each CHO and the time they were waiting to access the services identified in the assessment of needs, the HSE said it does not compile that information.  This is extraordinary.  All the statistics and all the supposed progress is about identifying the needs children have, not meeting those needs or supplying the services.  The explanation given in the responses to parliamentary questions for the rationale behind the standard operation procedure needs to be challenged.  The claim is that it is for consistency and that assessment officers and clinicians were &quot;erring on the side of requesting a wide range of assessments in as short a timeframe as possible&quot; because they were under pressure from the legislation.<br/><br/>It is worth comparing that bureaucratic answer with the experiences of a friend of mine.  Lynda is from Tallaght and has a son called S&eacute; who is nine and has Down's syndrome.  In an interview with <i>The Irish Times</i>last year, she explained that he has had sporadic supports over the years.  She said:</p><blockquote>	[S&eacute;] was referred for an autism assessment three years ago - it hasn't even been acknowledged.  There is maybe one occupational therapy session per year.  No speech and language for the first few years and then a block of six hours before he's signed off the system.  When I started fighting for services after S&eacute; was born, I was told I have unresolved childhood issues.  Instead of working together, it's about blame.  We've spent all our savings on private therapies and we're in a precarious position now. </blockquote> <p>In the same article, Dr. Irwin Gill says of the current process:</p><blockquote>	It's not a meaningful assessment; it does not help children and merely moves them to another waiting list for a more useful assessment, for which there is no statutory time limit and therefore no legal recourse.  The prevailing opinion is that this is a cynical attempt by the HSE to protect itself rather than act in the interests of children. </blockquote> <p>Clinicians on the ground reiterated this, with one of them saying they &quot;feel disheartened and many feel they cannot stay in the HSE if this is the future&quot;.  Another clinician said:</p><blockquote>	It's against all our ethical practices.  We cannot assess in 90 minutes as to whether or not a child has a disability, but if we say they don't, they won't get services.  So most of us will probably recommend further assessment and say we suspect a disability.  I feel despondent. </blockquote> <p>One of the serious questions that arises is why this crisis has been allowed to grow.  Despite all the rhetoric from the Minister for Health and his predecessors, the HSE has overseen catastrophic failures to provide the services needed by our children.  The assessment of needs issue shows again the deep crisis in our national health service in general and the attempt to suggest that somehow these issues are complex and inexplicable.  In fact, the roots of the problems are the multiple crises in the health system stemming from the fact we have supported and maintained a two-tier health system for years - a crisis-ridden public system and an ever-increasing and largely profitable private system.  This is the reason the private system is being grown.  There is a vested interest in private healthcare precisely because we have a dysfunctional public healthcare system.  There is a dysfunctional public healthcare system in order to promote the private system.  They are two sides of the same coin and any attempt to deal with one without the other does not understand this issue and the attempt will flounder.  We need a one-tier national public health system that understands that when we force nurses or public health doctors out on strike or drive them out of the service or the country because the conditions are so bad, we are deliberately undermining the provision of public health and facilitating the increased need for private, for-profit healthcare.</p></speech>

It is striking the length to which the State has gone to try to cover up the reality of the extremely long waiting lists for children who have special needs.  It is ingenious of the State to try to do so.  This stands in contrast with the absence of similar ingenuity matched with resources to provide children with the care they need.  If a little of the effort that went into covering this problem up went in, matched with resources, to providing the services, therapy and so on that children need, we would be in a much better place than we currently are.  As everybody here knows, the scandal is that we have families who should be able to focus on their children instead having to focus on fighting for things that should be a basic right.  They have to take court cases against the State and contact Deputies and Ministers to try to get something for their children.  For those who can afford it, and the point was well made earlier that often they can barely afford it, they are told to go private.</p>  <p>  I spoke to a woman, Kate, earlier today, whose son, Connor, has verbal or oral dyspraxia.  Today, finally, he got a public assessment of needs, after waiting eight months, but it will be 12 months before he begins to get the therapy he needs.  He will get it once a week for six to eight weeks and then it will stop for a period of months, after which he will get it again and it will stop, and so on.  It will be done in blocks, whereas all the best international expert evidence says it needs to be done regularly and continuously and there must be early intervention.  People like Kate and Connor should not be failed by the State in this way.</p></speech>

The Minister of State says the Government will support the motion and is sitting there nodding at all the criticisms people are raising.  This is really cynical stuff.  Is she going to inform the D&aacute;il immediately of the measures the Government intends to take to ensure that all children receive a comprehensive assessment of needs within the timeframe set down in the 2005 Act, or will she do what the Government has done with similar motions last week, the week before and the week before that, which is to vote for them and then keep on doing the same thing?  People will be watching closely in that regard.</p>  <p>  As the motion points out, a survey conducted by AsIAm in June last year, Every Child Counts: A Report into Autistic Children's Access to Healthcare in Ireland, found that "80 per cent of parents and guardians have had to wait a year or more to receive an autism diagnosis for their child, and 79 per cent said they were not in receipt of any support from either the Early Intervention or School Age-Going Teams".  Examples have been given of how parents who cannot afford it have had to borrow money to seek private treatment.  People who are not in a position to do so have had to go on the desperately long waiting lists and watch their children having to wait and fall behind.  Even when a child is diagnosed, multiple obstacles remain, such as a shortage of clinicians, including occupational therapists, and teachers being asked to cope with insufficient training.  All of this is extraordinarily stressful for parents.</p>  <p>  In Kilbrittain, there was a successful campaign by parents and teachers to stop the closure of an early intervention preschool.  The NCSE was forced to back down by the campaign but has refused to clarify whether closure of such preschools is now part of its policy, which would amount to cost-cutting under the cloak of the access and inclusion model.  Will the Minister of State clarify the position in this regard and rule out such a policy?  If she is voting for this motion, she needs to act, as she will be called on to do.</p></speech>

As members of the Joint Committee on Disability Matters, she and I have heard at first hand the experiences of witnesses who have come in over the past two years, including parents of children who gave harrowing accounts of what they have to endure when they discover their child has a disability or special needs.</p> <p>As a Deputy representing Galway East, I have had many parents in contact with me over the past six years, or since I was first honoured to be elected to the D&aacute;il, to relate the same experience.</p> <p> Parents first need time to adjust to the fact that their child might have a disability or special need.  It is a traumatic experience no matter what else happens.  The next stage is parents' realisation, as they get involved in the whole process, that they must fight tooth and nail for everything their child gets.  They have to fill out forms repeatedly and prove time and again that their child has a special need.  They try to get the services their child needs and deserves.  The initial assessment, assessment of need and pathway going forward are all in a fog.  The parents do not know where they are going.  They cannot see where they are going, and no caseworker is available to them to bring them through the process and engage on an ongoing basis.  The problem I hear in my office is that families may be waiting for six, eight or 12 months without getting a phone call or email back.  They may be waiting for an assessment or therapy, and it is all so stressful.</p> <p> With regard to the disability network teams that were set up, I still hear they are in the process of being reconfigured and all this kind of thing.  It is not good when you hear this.  It is as if the whole plan has been changed.  All of a sudden, people must learn how to deal with one another within the services.  It is important that every parent would have a caseworker to deal with their child from A to Z and bring them through the process.  These are not very technical matters.  It is about communicating in the first instance.  Second, it is about giving feedback and guidance to parents.   </p> <p> The biggest problem we have, which the Minister of State knows well, is that we do not have enough consultants, assessors and therapists in the various fields of care in which they are needed.  Throwing money at it will not work.  We need to start training people and encouraging more people to come back home to take up the positions.</p> <p> There are many children with complex needs.  They need more help, guidance and advice.  Sometimes we set up systems that deal with everybody in the same way.  Children's special needs do not all manifest in the same way, nor can their needs be assessed in the same way.  We are talking about individuals.  They are our citizens and we need to treat them equally.</p> <p> As we all know and have heard, early intervention is essential.  However, if you have to wait for six, eight or nine months to get an assessment, that is not early intervention; rather, it is the cause of six, eight or nine months of hardship and mental anguish for parents.  They must look at their child waiting to get a service they are not getting.</p> <p> Every parent prays for their child to get the best of everything they deserve.  Parents with a child with a disability, more than anyone else, want to ensure that child gets the best services and what he or she needs in terms of therapy, guidance and all that goes with that.</p> <p> The biggest fear of parents is what will happen to their child when they pass away.  They start worrying about it the day the child is born.  They feel that if the child does not get the early intervention and services, he or she will be worse off when they pass away.  They have a duty, but, as a State, we have a duty also.  Regardless of what talking we do, we must act immediately to help the children.</p></speech>

There is an ocean of window dressing in this State when it comes to inclusivity but the truth is that hundreds of thousands of citizens are excluded from life in this country daily.  Given the assessment waiting lists, lack of access to services and transport, and young people trapped in nursing homes, Ireland is a cold house for people with disabilities.  I believe the Government is failing in its obligations towards people in this country.</p>  <p>  In recent weeks, the inequality in access to public and private transport has been exposed and the abandonment of children with Down's syndrome by the HSE has been detailed extensively.  The mere 4,000 children on the waiting list for an assessment of needs has been indicated as well.  I raised just last week the case of Kifca McNamee, a woman in her 40s with a disability who has been trapped in a nursing home since long before Christmas and who simply cannot get a home care package that would allow her to get out.  I raised this with Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte in addition to Minister of State, Deputy Butler.  I hope a solution can be achieved in this case.</p>  <p>  Disability rights is a key objective of Aont&uacute;.  My party colleague, Cavan councillor Sarah O'Reilly, has been highlighting the crisis of waiting lists for an autism assessment locally and nationally.  The current waiting time for an autism assessment is two to three years.  Therefore, if you have a child of three in need of an assessment for autism, you must wait for another three years for a diagnosis.  This immediately puts your family at a disadvantage.  A six-year-old child is on the back foot in looking for a school enrolment and the services that come with it.  Many families, by the time their child is assessed, miss the boat for enrolling him or her in an ASD unit.  Places in these schools are at a premium.  Places are limited and fill up fast.  Many families have to go down the route of private assessment for a child under the age of three, at a cost of &euro;1,500.  For a child over three, the cost is &euro;950.  It is safe to say that parents who can afford the private assessment have access to services sooner and therefore obtain better outcomes for their children.  It shows there is a two-tier system in the country when it comes to children with disabilities.</p>  <p>  In my county, County Meath, there are several schools with classes for children with autism, yet such classes do not exist in secondary school.  Therefore, affected children have to go beyond the town of Trim to gain access to a school.  I know of twins who were affected.  One of them, who has autism, had to travel to a different town while his brother could go to the closest town, Trim.</p>  <p>  My party colleague in Louth, Mr. Michael O'Dowd, raised the damning figures in the recent Down Syndrome Ireland, DSI, report on access to therapy services.  Some 65% of those surveyed by DSI have received no speech and language therapy sessions in the past year.  Forty-four percent have received no therapy of any kind in the past year.  Parents have responded that no therapy sessions were received in over three years.  Forty percent said they had received no communication of any kind from the HSE in the past 12 months.  Nearly 25% of children with Down's syndrome under the age of five had received no therapy services.  Of young children, only 49% had been to a speech and language therapist, while merely 22% had access to an occupational therapist.  Upon entering school, 54% of children had not received any therapies in the preceding year, and 39% had never received therapies at all.  This is abandonment.  This is leaving children and young people with Down's syndrome behind in the State.</p>  <p>  I spoke to a party colleague in Cork, Ms Joanne Murphy, a mother of a child with autism.  She raised with me the tragic plight of people with disabilities in Ukraine.  There are 2.7 million people with disabilities currently residing in that country, and there is genuine fear that many of them will simply be left behind at the mercy of Putin's army.  War has already had a devastating effect on these people in the form of post-traumatic stress disorder, physical and psychological injuries and the complete destruction of their lives as they know them.  We have a responsibility in this State to reach out as best we can to people with disabilities who are in major difficulty in Ukraine and to make sure we offer them shelter and protection.</p></speech>

In many cases, it is the parents who first notice that their baby may not be reaching its developmental milestones.  The parents may notice that their baby appears different in some way to its peers.  When this undefined worry becomes a reality, it is reasonable for any parent to expect that he or she will be able to access services which will enable him or her to make the right decision about the care, education and health of his or her child.  However, recently in Ireland, this has not been the case.  My constituency office has received many complaints from distraught schools and parents whose children have been on a waiting list for years to access an assessment of need.  Many parents have found that once their child is assessed, they struggle to get any or all of the services recommended to help their child talk, move, learn and grow.  This means that children's rights are not being respected in the disability sector in Ireland.  Every child with a disability in Ireland has the right, under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, UNCRC, to the highest level of healthcare and education so as to fulfil their potential as human beings.  What is this Fianna F&aacute;il-Fine Gael Government up to?  I was the first to raise the issue of the crisis of the Kilbrittain National School early intervention unit here in the D&aacute;il about a month ago, and the suspension of funding for this great service from September 2022 onwards.  I fundraised for the unit a number of years ago for the people of Kilbrittain and its surrounds.  Following pressure mounted by me, the Government has reversed its decision and has granted funding for another 12 months from September 2022.  However, I am not at all happy on behalf of the people of Kilbrittain, Timoleague, Barryroe, Ballinspittle and Ballinadee, who use the service in Kilbrittain.  They deserve to have their children know that this excellently-run early intervention unit will be open for many years to come.  It is a challenge on which I will fight this Government every inch of the way in the months ahead for the people who use the Kilbrittain early intervention unit.</p>  <p>  I was asked to put up an advertisement on my Facebook page in support of Ballydehob National School fundraising next week for a SNA.  In the name of God, is this what parents, schools and communities have been reduced to, namely, fundraising for SNAs in their schools?  It is breathtaking, to say the least, that this Government can come down so hard on ordinary hard-working people, especially children with disabilities.  In the ten seconds I have left I will say that I am aware that the Minister of State met some people in relation to an autism centre in Dunmanway some months ago.  We will be pushing very hard to see if funding can also be obtained for that autism centre.</p></speech>

In a recent statement, the Ombudsman for Children said that the assessment of needs delays are not a Covid problem.  This has been an issue for many years.  The HSE needs to explain why these measures do not appear to be working.  The Minister of State must provide clarity as to exactly how many children are waiting for their needs to be assessed.  We need to know the average waiting time and what areas of the country are most impacted.  I can tell the Minister of State that in County Kerry, today was a typical day.  I just happened to check before I left the office, and since dinner time, I have had three inquiries from people in County Kerry - not outside of it - telling me that their children are waiting to have their needs and level of disability assessed.  They are awaiting a decision on the roadmap for their future.  While they are waiting, they are not able to avail of whatever services they need.  The assessment must be carried out in a timely fashion.  All we want for what I would call special children is that they are allowed to develop and grow into the best human beings they can be.  With the nurturing and the care of their parents, their families and their extended families, they will do brilliantly.  Each and every one of them will be terribly important people in our society and for their families.  They are wanted and loved.  We want them to get the best out of life.  It is up to each and every one of us.  It is up to us as politicians.  We would be useless if we did not come in here and tackle the Minister of State, tell her that it is her responsibility and ask her what she is going to do to ensure that parents will be able to have their little boy or girl to assessed in a timely and affordable fashion.  Parents are told to go down the private route.  Of course, parents would give anything for their child.  They would give their last euro to do something for their child.  However, in many cases it is not practical or feasible for them to do so.  All we are asking of the Minister of State - and we are not asking, we are begging - is that she help these parents and children to be the best people that they can be in the future.</p></speech>

There were 5,060 applications for assessments of need in 2018.  The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, acknowledged that there were 4,000 applicants in December 2021.  None of the timelines are met for any of those children.  In 2018, the percentage of assessments completed on time was only 8.8%.  We should note that the system is only diagnosis-led and not needs-based.  I am very concerned that a change to the new standard operating procedure has left parents with nothing.  An assessment is now being done that only acknowledges that the child has specific needs.  In truth, this one and a half hour assessment gives nothing to parents except another waiting list.  It seems that the assessment is used only to meet the legal obligations of the HSE.  All service statements vary, making it very difficult to get real answers and numbers.  Again, I ask the HSE what is happening.  Where is the accountability?  Where is the service agreement?  There is a child behind each of these statistics.  Moreover, this is only to get the assessment done.  What happens when a child's needs are identified following the assessment?  Parents then join a struggle to get any of the services recommended.</p>  <p>  The Ombudsman for Children has said that this is not a Covid problem but is an issue that has been going on for years.  During the pandemic, I opened my office to St. Gabriel's.  When the structures were changed in counties Limerick and Cork, County Limerick was left without any places in St. Gabriel's.  I opened my office, cleaned it out and left it open for use.  Thankfully, since then, St. Gabriel's has got funding to open another sector, which will be open shortly.  I thank the Government for that.  However, the HSE must be accountable.</p></speech>

I thank Deputy Tully for all the work she has put into it.  I am grateful to have the opportunity to speak again on this very important subject.  For all those parents who learn that there is something wrong with their child or baby, it can be very challenging, daunting and demanding.  Those parents would do anything to help their child and pay any kind of money.  However, sadly, whether the therapy is to be had privately or publically, it is always challenging for parents to access the services that are necessary for their children.  It is time that we had some assessment or medical report to determine the cause of so many children presenting with the diagnoses of autism, dyslexia or dyspraxia.  There seems to be an awful amount of them.  In my office on a daily basis, it is one of the problems that parents are raising most consistently in relation to their children.  Come August or autumn, when the special needs teachers are being assigned to schools, not enough of them are assigned.  Parents learn that their child is not going to get the level of attention that they require.  I am sorry to see the Minister of State shaking her head, because it is God's gospel truth.  First of all, early diagnosis is most important for these children.  They need a lot of personal attention in their formative years.  Intervention is vital in ensuring that a child develops to the best that he or she can be.  It is vital to bring out the very best in such children.  All parents want this for their children.  I believe that they are entitled to it.   Their children are our future and we need to invest in them.  We need to invest more in special needs children.</p> <p>The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, who is present, is a woman, as is the Minister of State, Deputy Butler.  I think they can and should do more for special needs teachers and the sector.  They should provide far more such teachers in classrooms because they are vital for so many children.</p> <p> I am concerned at the level of children who are presenting with autism.  We need to do more assessment or find out what is going wrong.  There are many scientists, doctors and what have you out there and they should be able to determine that there is something causing this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-08a.370" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1547" speakername="Thomas Pringle" time="20:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030800048#XX00200"><p>I fully support the motion and its call to remove the barriers that are currently in place and preventing many children from getting an adequate and timely assessments of need.   Early intervention is essential in appropriately meeting the educational and health needs of children with disabilities, yet there are more than 18,000 children on occupational therapy waiting lists alone.  This is not acceptable.  It is of utmost importance that the long waiting lists are addressed as soon as possible.  It is completely disingenuous for the Government to claim these waiting lists have been addressed when that is simply not the case.  The short preliminary assessment that was introduced does absolutely nothing to address the issue of waiting lists; it merely moves children onto another waiting list, for further assessment, with no obligation on the HSE to address their assessment within a specific timeframe.  The introduction of the standard operating procedure has done nothing but further frustrate families, causing them more distress.  It has actually inadvertently lengthened already long waiting lists.</p>  <p>  This has been an issue in County Donegal for some time.  Last year, I contacted the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, the Minister of State with responsibility for special needs and inclusion, Deputy Madigan, and the Minister of State with responsibly for people with disabilities, Deputy Rabbitte, on behalf of concerned constituents of mine.  I outlined my concerns regarding the proposed changes to the assessments of need system and my worry that, under the changes, children would not receive the opportunity to be assessed according to best practice.  I outlined how the Association of Occupational Therapists of Ireland, the Irish Association of Speech and Language Therapists and the Psychological Society of Ireland had expressed concern regarding the new and substandard screening system.  Each Minister told me the assessment of needs was under the responsibility of the Minister for Health.  However, despite having contacted the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, on 21 April last year, I have yet to receive a response on these concerns.  We cannot blame the HSE for that.</p>  <p>  It is very worrying that the HSE has become completely unreliable in providing people with the necessary services to which they are entitled.  Parents have said they cannot depend on the HSE for anything.  That is something we are hearing ever more often.  As the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, is aware, it is difficult for anybody to have faith in the HSE at this stage.  That might be the crux of the problem and what needs to be addressed.  It will be a big task.  I am not exactly sure how it can be addressed but it has to be tackled because even the Taoiseach is now saying it is not a problem of money as the money has been provided and all that kind of stuff.  It is as if the political system is okay because the Government is providing the money and the HSE is this mammoth standing in the corner that does everything and just eats up money.  As far as I know, however, the HSE works for us.  I have stated before in the House that the HSE works for all the citizens of this country but it seems to me that we work for the HSE.  It seems to me that the role of the Government to give the HSE money with which it can do as it pleases and then people have to put up with a substandard service from the HSE because that is what we deserve.  So long as the HSE is working and paying its employees big money, that is okay and everything else is grand.  Ultimately, that is the problem.  There needs to be a shift and rebalancing such that the HSE comes to terms with the fact that it works for us; not the other way around.</p>  <p>  Many parents have been pushed by the HSE into paying for private diagnoses due to unreasonable waiting times.  AsIAm conducted a survey, to which reference has been made already, that revealed 80% of parents and guardians had to wait at least a year for an autism diagnosis.  How is that acceptable in this day and age?  Many families are unable to pay the significant cost of a private diagnosis, so what has been created is yet another system of inequality and inaccessibility for lower income families.  Schools have provision to get a couple of assessments done every year, but they hold off on doing so in case they need them at a later stage.  Parents who need the service and may not be able to afford it then lose out because schools are holding on to the couple of assessments they are allocated.  That is just not acceptable in this day and age.  There is something seriously wrong when people are forced into private healthcare because the public healthcare system is unable to adequately support them.  That can be said about every area of healthcare.  However, the fact that children are not only struggling to get the treatment they need, but are unable to even get a proper assessment of their needs in the first place is particularly shocking.</p>  <p>  The healthcare system is overwhelmed and broken.  That has been the case for many years - long before the pandemic - and it demonstrates a significant issue in respect of how the system is set up and runs.  Unfortunately, I believe the Government lacks the vision and ambition to even address this broken system.  Not only that, the Government is actually failing to fulfil its legal obligations.  Under the Disability Act 2005, children have a statutory right to an assessment of need which must be carried out within six months of an application.  The inadequate preliminary assessment that was introduced is not a viable solution and does not speed up the waiting lists in any real way.  It is only a con to try to get over the fact that, under the Disability Act, the assessment has to be provided.  it only creates even more complex problems further down the line.  It increases the risk of inaccurate or incomplete diagnoses.  This has exacerbated the length of waiting lists that already contravene the Disability Act 2005.</p>  <p>  In addition, Article 7 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities provides, "States Parties shall take all necessary measures to ensure the full enjoyment by children with disabilities of all human rights".  We are not honouring our commitment to that international standard.  This is completely unjustifiable and more needs to be done to ensure children are receiving the assessments of need to which they are entitled.  The HSE needs to allocate funding to increase the number of staff and level of service available.  It needs to ensure the assessment of need process is comprehensive and identifies the full range of supports and services a child needs, rather than diluting the service that is delivered to children.  The current system is nothing short of neglect.  These long waiting lists are nothing short of neglect.  This needs to be addressed immediately, so I strongly support the motion.</p></speech>

It is important for me to make every minute count.  Sometimes I do not get asked questions or they are not selected for Oral Questions to the Departments of Health or Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, so when I get a motion like this, I welcome it because it gives me an opportunity to lay out my stall on the floor of the D&aacute;il.  I thank my colleague Deputy P&aacute;draig O'Sullivan who has kept me company all evening.  It is greatly appreciated.</p>  <p>  We are here to discuss what I believe is one of the most important and ambitious policy reforms in the health service in recent memory, namely, the implementation of the progressing disability services for children and young persons, PDS, programme.  It is clear from the debate this evening that the roll-out of the PDS has not been as smooth as we would like.  Several issues have been highlighted and it is important to outline some of the plans on which I am working to improve disability services.  I chose to speak at the end of the debate because I wanted to hear the contributions of Members.  I hope that somewhere in my contribution we will marry in agreement right across the House.</p>  <p>  I wish to put on record my sincere apologies to any family experiencing delays.  These families are angry and frustrated at a health service that is failing their children.  Parents should not be left fighting for services.  I am working to make our services better.  I am acutely aware of the issues facing families with children with special needs and it is incumbent on me to meet these families and hear their experiences, good and bad, in getting a service for their children.  I have done whatever can be done.</p>  <p>  Later this month, I will start a new parents' forum that will take place in every county and give parents an opportunity to air their concerns as well as to hear how PDS should be working for them.  I look forward to meeting parents as well as engaging with the HSE and the lead agencies on the matters raised.  I will have further details on the parents' forum in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  Investing in children's specialist disability multidisciplinary services is an important priority for the Government.  Through the two budgets I have introduced, I have created an additional 375 posts to strengthen children's disability services across the country.  This is on top of the 100 posts allocated in 2019.</p> <p>As well as increasing staff numbers and new recruits, we also need to stop the flow of staff out of the disability area.  To do this, there must be more career opportunities for clinicians so that they have the space to further develop their skills in disabilities and to stay working in this space.  I have been told by lead agencies and the HSE that there needs to be more senior grade posts and I can confirm to the House that disability services management will appoint more senior posts in 2022 than in previous years.  The HSE also informed me that it has indicated to the CHOs that the recruitment of staff at a senior grade, particularly with the goal of enhancing retention, can and will be accommodated.  The CHOs believe they will exceed their 2022 allocation and HSE headquarters will consider a business case to allow some increase in senior posts.  This is a very welcome change for 2022-23.  I will continue to engage with the HSE on the matter.</p> <p> The role of administration cannot be underestimated and I have secured more such posts in the 2022 budget.  Teams need to have a sufficient administration staff so that the clinicians can do their job.  We need to recruit into grades 3 and 5 to ensure clinicians are not doing administration work such as answering telephone but are delivering on intervention.</p> <p> Another important issue raised with me is the increased strain on psychologists.  To address this, a request has been made for the use of assistant psychologists on children's disability network teams, CDNTs, which would help ease some of the pressure on an already strained area of expertise.  The HSE confirmed to me today that it intends to open the recruitment and deployment of assistant psychologists in line with what was sanctioned and issued to the Department of Health in 2021.  We have seen how this use has been bolstered best in the mental health services.  We must ensure we are utilising all possible resources to support children and families.</p> <p> I hope the substantial investment by this Government in all of these resources will go a significant way in dealing with concerns expressed by parents and the Ombudsman for Children.  It is important to note that while I welcome this conversation, it is a shame more suggestions have not been made.  The assessment of needs process did not work in the past.  The standard operating procedure is under review and when that review is completed I will take on board all of the outcomes.  We have cleared 98% of the backlog in assessments of need.  The SOP was introduced prior to my appointment and I allowed it to go through.  I am now awaiting the outcome of the review because we have moved from one list to another and there is no denying that.  I will act in accordance with the findings of the review of the SOP.  The HSE and the trade unions are engaged in that review process.  As I said, I will await its outcome and pursue its recommendations and any potential changes it may suggest.</p> <p> On autism assessments and supports, I discussed this matter last week during a meeting with the WHO in Copenhagen.  Countries across Europe are trying to address issues similar to those we have here and no consistent approach is being taken.  All countries are looking around to see what may be the best model of support.</p> <p> An interesting point raised by the WHO was that in Azerbaijan, a regionalised assessment and diagnosis programme is in operation and appears to be working for that country.  It is something that I will look further into with the HSE as there could be lessons learned from it.  It involves having a preliminary assessment done by a diagnosis assessment team while, at the same time, the children come straight back into intervention.  One of our colleagues at the meeting set out clearly what was being done.  What is needed is an assessment of diagnosis and intervention, which should be needs-led rather than diagnosis-led.  An assessment should be intervention.  To be honest with the House, one of our colleagues asked what was going on and why everything seemed to go into diagnosis.</p> <p> Questions have to be asked of the education sector when schools state they will only accept children if they have a diagnosis and children will not get supports if they do not have such a diagnosis.  Nowhere in the Disability Act does it state that a diagnosis is needed to access education.  I accept Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in's point that the EPSEN Act and the Disability Act both need to be reviewed.  There is no doubt about that.</p> <p> We must strike a balance to ensure that no child is left waiting and I am determined to ensure that disability services are functioning fully and working for families, not leaving them stranded without support.</p> <p> I confirm to the House that I am working on a package of supports to provide the CDNTs with additional supports to address both the backlog of autism assessments and to provide additional therapeutic supports.  I hope to confirm that in the coming weeks.</p> <p> I assure the House that I will leave no stone unturned when it comes to finding the solutions we have discussed this evening.</p> <p> Regarding the ratification of the Optional Protocol to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Gorman, and I have indicated that we are open to an early ratification of the optional protocol, if possible.  Our approach to the UNCRPD since ratification of the main convention has been one of progressive realisation where we make progress towards full implementation step by step and year on year.  </p> <p> I acknowledge the work of parents and I again apologise to the parents of children who are on waiting lists.  I acknowledge the work of AsIAm, Involve Autism.  I am afraid I will leave people out but Inclusion Ireland and the Rainbow Club in Cork are doing phenomenal work in peer-to-peer support of parents but also in supporting children.  The Rainbow Club in Cork is not open even a year at this stage and is supporting 500 families in a particular area.  It is phenomenal to see what it is able to do in its community centre.  I also thank the Joint Committee on Disability Matters for putting such a focus on disability and allowing various voices to appear before it to share their experience and enable us to take from their learning.  </p> <p> Deputies asked what exactly is happening with the autism strategy.  A consultation document will be published in the coming weeks seeking an input from the autism community on what direction it believes the strategy should take and the priority issues it wants to focus on.  I have secured funding for the strategy and the next phase will be announced very soon.</p> <p> I thank both Ministers, Deputies Stephen Donnelly and O&rsquo;Gorman, for ensuring the funding I will announce in the coming weeks will be provided to deal with the backlog of assessment of diagnosis in respect of autism.  Many families are very frustrated about the waiting lists for assessments.  I need to ensure, however, that it happens in every CHO.  There will be substantial investment and a plan for addressing the waiting list.  It will only be as good as the integration into the PDS teams.</p></speech>

I have listened to all the previous speakers.  In CHO 4, 5,472 are waiting for speech and language therapy, occupational therapy and physiotherapy.  That does not make for good reading.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State asked for more ideas.  I have experience of cases involving young families who spent four or five years in the courts trying to get proper care.  I call on the State and the HSE to stop using State solicitors and public money to fight families in appeal cases.  That practice should be struck out straight away.  I have in mind one particular family which won its fight but it is not the only such family I know.</p>  <p>  It would be remiss of me not to thank Deputy Tully for introducing the motion.  I am very pleased the Government is not opposing it.  I agree with speakers from all sides of the House that if we work together, we can get this done.  I have worked with the Minister of State and I know she is passionate about this issue.  I have always been fair.  We are here to represent the people outside the House.  This is an urgent issue and if we can collectively work on it and do the right thing, it will reduce stress levels.  We have been discussing mental health issues, stress on families, marriage break-ups and so on.  Families with enough cash can go private and their child will be seen in a short time.  I cannot understand the reason for the competition between the health service and private practice.</p><p><i>9 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p>If we can work together on this and do the right thing, there is certainly an urgency for it.  I would like to say more, but other Deputies wish to speak.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-08a.375" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1451" speakername="Matt Carthy" time="21:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030800050#ZZ00200"><p>The most frustrating and angering part of being a Deputy is when one is dealing with parents who are getting in touch in order to expedite getting healthcare for their children.  It has to be said that no parents should have to contact any elected representative to tell that representative the most intimate details of the medical needs of their child to try to secure disability or occupational therapy or any other service that their child desperately needs.  No parent should have to fight for years to secure an assessment of needs, which the law states should be delivered within six months.  To reiterate, it is not just that the Government is failing those children and their families, the Government is breaking the law by doing so.</p>  <p>  In my HSE region, last October there were 1,956 children waiting for an initial assessment for speech and language therapy, 1,444 were waiting for occupational therapy and 1,105 were waiting for physiotherapy.  These numbers represent real children who are being denied the right to live full lives.  They represent families who are going through the hell of trying to deal with HSE bureaucracy or the hell of listening to broken promise after broken promise.  I met a mother today who travelled a long distance to be here for this debate.  She has two sons with special needs, who have been cared for and loved by their family all their lives.  However, they have been let down by the State every day of their lives.  They are still being let down.  Their mother, who has enough to contend with, had to establish a charity along with other families in order to provide her children with a service that should have been provided by the State.  It is not good enough; it is not fair.  In fact, it is a scandal.</p>  <p>  I commend Deputy Tully on the work she has done and on bringing this motion to the House.  I commend the motion and I welcome the fact that it is unopposed.  However, it must be followed through with real action and with the implementation of the words as well as the actions required in the motion.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-08a.376" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1449" speakername="Kathleen Funchion" time="21:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030800050#ZZ00300"><p>First, I commend my colleague, Deputy Tully.  I thank the Minister of State for her reply.  I was not present for the start of the debate.  I have two minutes so I wish to be focused.</p>  <p>  As other Deputies have said, it is very frustrating when parents are waiting.  Even if it is not for the assessment of needs, it can be for speech and language therapy and occupational therapy.  I am encountering many parents who are trying to borrow money, perhaps from a credit union but often, worryingly, from moneylenders or from family members, to try to pay for these therapies privately.  What is becoming a major issue, and I wanted to mention this especially, in the constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny and particularly in Kilkenny is the lack of ASD class places.  I know this is a matter for the Minister of State with responsibility for special education, but I want to take the opportunity to raise it.  I can immediately think of ten children who do not have an ASD class place for September.  These are children who are turning six years old, so they are out of the early childhood care and education, ECCE, system.</p>  <p>  Parents are at their wits' end.  The same parents are saying they have had to battle and fight for everything.  They have had to pay for a large amount of the services, be it private assessments or therapies.  Now they are not even being provided with school places.  Ironically, in the same week that children who are starting in junior infants are getting their letters and know they will be starting school in September, we are treating children with additional needs as second-class citizens who do not know where they will be going.  Some of them might be facing very large distances if they get the opportunity to get a place.  I wanted to raise that issue.  Again, I commend Deputy Tully on her work in this area.</p></speech>

I also thank the Government for supporting the motion.  It is an issue that is affecting children and families in all parts of the country.  We all agree it is an urgent issue that must be addressed.  Children cannot continue to wait for supports they are entitled to, and parents cannot continue to face ongoing battles for supports or to have to source services privately or take the State to court.</p>  <p>  We are calling for the CDNTs to cease using the standard operating procedure and instead ensure timely access to a full and proper multidisciplinary needs-based assessment.  The HSE is using preliminary team assessments to avoid being taken to court for not fulfilling its obligations under the Disability Act.  The preliminary team assessment is not an assessment of need as outlined under the Disability Act and the HSE should stop pretending it is.  I agree with the Minister of State that the Disability Act needs to be reviewed and updated.  It definitely does, and especially to recognise the fact that we have ratified the UNCRPD and we have an obligation to implement that.  If we do not, we will see a raft of actions taken against the State for needs being unmet.  I welcome the fact that the optional protocol will be ratified soon.  Again, however, it will allow people to take cases to the UN under the optional protocol for needs not being met.</p>  <p>  Other Deputies have referred to court cases, settlements and the HSE and the Department of Health using money for them.  It is our money; it is taxpayers' money.  We, the taxpayers, are paying for something we do not agree with.  We do not agree that the HSE should be fighting these cases in court.</p></speech>

A clear plan on training, recruitment and retention of sufficient health and social care staff is required.  The HSE needs to discuss this with the professional organisations that represent the various therapists and health professionals in the CDNTs.  At present, it is refusing to engage with them, and there are things that can help to address the issues there.  We need to take everybody on board and look at everything.</p>  <p>  We also need a fully costed and time-bound implementation strategy for disability services.  We have a disability capacity review and it identified significant unmet need.  There is no point in conducting reviews if we are not going to address their findings.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State mentioned another element of the PDS model that has not been enacted, which is the family forums.  I welcome the fact that they are going to be established.  Parents need input into the teams and to be fully informed of what is happening.  At present, they are not.  What they are being offered are online courses.  Many parents have already taken the courses.  However, they are basically being threatened that if they do not take the courses, they will be removed from the list.  That is terrible.  It should not be happening.  Parents have welcomed the courses alongside therapeutic intervention from a professional, but not as an alternative.  Parents are not trained therapists.</p>  <p>  Last year, the Minister of State paused the removal of therapists from special schools, but I am informed that the therapists have been removed.  They might be engaging with the schools, but they are not engaging with the students.  They are engaging with the staff.  It is not on the same level that it was.  Again, some are pointing out that there was no risk assessment taken of doing this.</p>  <p>  We need to see waiting lists published.  There must be comprehensive lists of who is waiting on assessments, who is waiting for interventions and so forth.  I feel we are not being told the truth about it.  Also, as I mentioned earlier, the Government must recommence, without delay, the reporting of data and publication of reports, pursuant to section 13 of the Act, so that it can plan for unmet need.</p>  <p>  All the teams must have clear targets and performance indicators.  There must be ongoing checks on how the service is operating.  Outcomes must be measured.  Otherwise, how will we know if the services are working?  People need to be held accountable if the outcomes are not being met.  The idea behind the establishment of the CDNTs was to ensure quicker access to services for children with more complex needs, but that is not happening.  The ones with less complex needs are supposed to go to primary care and those in need of mental health supports were supposed to go to CAMHS.  What we find is all the HSE bodies fighting among themselves for staff and saying, "We will not support that child.  That child should go to your service or to your service".  That is not fair, and children are being left out in the cold.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State mentioned that there will be more senior posts, but the PTA is a huge problem for senior clinicians.  They do not agree with it and I cannot see her getting them into the teams while it remains.  I apologise for going over time.</p></speech>

I know this is an issue on which Deputy Conway-Walsh and I will want to work together.  We will have a lot of work to do on English language supports.  I wanted to say this on my first opportunity to do so in the D&aacute;il.</p>  <p>  I am very committed to resolving the issue of the funding model for higher education.  It is priority issue.  It is essential for ensuring that our higher education institutions can effectively meet high standards of quality and achieve critical outcomes for our economy and society.  I will bring forward a proposal on a funding model to Government, which will be implemented as part of budgets.  Implementation will entail the sector delivering strengthened performance and enhanced outcomes based on a robust reform agenda.  The Deputy would expect this of me.  Students and taxpayers would also expect this.  This approach will be informed by the comprehensive economic evaluation of funding options which, as the Deputy said, has been carried out under the auspices of the European Commission's structural reform support programme.</p>  <p>  I brought this matter to the Cabinet committee on economic recovery shortly before Christmas.  This allowed me the opportunity to explore key issues with Government colleagues including the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste.  It was agreed that I and the Department would engage with the Department for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, to inform the Government's consideration, in particular undertaking technical work to update costings reflecting relevant funding decisions in the most recent budget and other issues.  I am please to inform the Deputy this work is nearing finalisation.  This work has sought to robustly assess the assumptions underpinning the economic evaluation and to take account of the significant levels of State funding which have been invested in higher education and student support in recent years.</p>  <p>  It is my intention to bring final proposals for funding and reform of higher education arising from this work to Government very shortly.  I mean "very shortly" sincerely.  I am very clear that, from a policy perspective, addressing the sustainability of the higher education system must proceed in tandem with measures which address the costs of education and ensure they are never a barrier to accessing higher education.</p></speech>

The committee has dedicated weeks of hearings on the future of funding of higher education.  These hearings were scheduled on the assumption the information would not be withheld and that it would be available.  The report is an economic valuation paid for by public money.  There is no commercial or privacy consideration to justify delaying it.  The Minister is forcing the committee to work in the dark.  We have had representative bodies of universities and the technological sector as well as trade unions and student unions all wondering why we have not been provided with the report.  It is the most important document for dealing with the current funding in higher education.  I and many others working in the sector would appreciate a clear explanation for why this is the case.  It would make it much more productive for the committee if we knew what had come back from Europe.</p></speech>

I certainly want to work with the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.  I assure Deputy Conway-Walsh that the new funding and reform framework will be provided to the Oireachtas committee once the Cabinet has considered the matter.  It will be published along with the DG REFORM-sponsored economic assessment report on the sustainability of higher education and the SUSI review.  I believe the Deputy will agree there have been many reports on higher education funding in recent years.  I do not wish to just publish another report.  I am trying not only to publish the economic assessment but to get the Government to make big decisions that will allow for multiannual inclusive processes allowing implementation to commence.  I know from engaging with the sector this is what it wants also.</p>  <p>  All of us in this House, including me, accept there is a gap to be closed in sustainable funding and core funding.  We also all accept there is work to be done on the costs of education.  We can debate how best to do this.  I want to try to publish the report alongside an implementation process and decisions.  This is why I need to brief Cabinet colleagues and make a Cabinet decision.  I assure the Deputy that straight after this the next group to be briefed will be the Oireachtas committee.  I will work with the Deputy collaboratively on the matter.</p></speech>

It is fundamental to the future of education.  Today we had trade unions and the Union of Students of Ireland, USI, before the committee.  They were unable to engage with the economic report and how we might address the underfunding in education.  Instead we discussed the effects of underfunding.  ICTU spoke of the creeping privatisation of the sector over the past ten years, when the Minister has been in government.  The TUI highlighted that in those ten years we have seen student numbers rise 28% while staff numbers fell 8%.  The USI highlighted the fact that most universities get more funding from private sources than they do from the State.  The Irish Federation of University Teachers, IFUT, raised the fact that in the late 2000s two of our universities were ranked in the top 100 internationally and one was in the top 50.  We now have no institutions in the top 100.  The fall in the rankings is directly linked to systemic underfunding.  The most obvious way in which the underfunding manifests itself is through the student to staff ratio in all the institutions.</p></speech>

Perhaps not everybody in the sector will agree with the following but let me be very clear on my position.  This will not be new money for old rope.  It will have to be accompanied by a reform agenda.  To be very clear to the sector, I accept there is an issue with core funding that needs to be addressed.  I also accept and know that reforms will be required in the sector.  These are reforms to deliver on a number of issues we discuss in the House on a regular basis, including a more inclusive education system, a system that is more open and responsive to the needs of people with disabilities and additional educational needs, and a system that recognises that learners come in many different shapes and sizes that need to be accommodated, such as part-time students, mature students, online learning and flexible learning.  I accept there are funding challenges in some areas.  I will also say on the floor of the D&aacute;il we now have funding back at peak levels.  We have also started the journey of improving student supports in a range of areas.  I am excited about the next piece of the jigsaw, which is once and for all settling the question as to what a sustainable funding model looks like for Ireland and getting on with implementing it after years of people debating this point.</p></speech>

If we were debating this a couple of months ago the first priority we would have had was making sure we could get the college campuses reopened and get students back on campus in a safe way.  We discussed this at great length in the House.  I thank everybody who worked extraordinarily hard to do this, including trade unions, student unions and management bodies.  The real collaboration we have seen in the further and higher education sector has resulted in our college campuses reopening.  I also thank them for the work they did on online learning during that time.</p>  <p>  The Deputy's question hits on a very important issue.  There were things we learned as a result of Covid about how our education system can be agile and flexible, how there can be different ways of doing things and how we can have a university without walls.  There is no doubt that while many people found it extremely difficult that college campuses were closed there were some students who said to me that by education being available online they were able to access it in a way they may not have been able to otherwise.  We need to acknowledge this also.  I am very conscious of the enormous efforts made by our institutions to respond to the various needs of learners during the pandemic.  This was marked by a highly collaborative approach, consideration of those at risk or otherwise vulnerable and the adoption of innovative practices to support learners.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to delivering civil and political rights to people with disabilities and the realisation of social and economic rights as espoused in the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  Public bodies have obligations under the Equality Acts, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act and other legislation.  The Department is working with institutions to deliver on these obligations and to further embed policies in areas such as universal design for learning.  It is up to everyone in the system to look at how we can retain and build on the innovations that we adopted during the pandemic.  For example, we learned a lot about how the digital divide can affect people.</p>  <p>  Institutions are autonomous bodies.  They have academic freedom and responsibility for their teaching and learning activities.  The question of me directing them does not arise.</p> <p>At a national and institutional level, I now want to sit down with stakeholders and look at how we can embed the good practice we have seen and I want to do this in the context of the publication of the new national access plan before Easter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-08a.395" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1551" speakername="Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in" time="21:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030800052#BBB00200"><p>I know the Minister cannot necessarily direct institutions but he does give them money and could attach a few conditions to that.  I agree with him that we need to think differently about education and learn something from the pandemic.  Indeed, the idea of having an institution without walls is something I am particularly attracted to.  However, the fact is that issues in respect of renting, the accommodation problems students are facing and disability were overcome in a way which showed a lot of ingenuity, forward thinking and thinking outside the box.  That is what we always want our institutions to do.  Will the Minister proactively interact with all the institutions of further and higher education to ensure that they have thought about every opportunity to break down those walls and that they will not say, in a post-pandemic era, that those solutions are a thing of the past?  They have to be brought into the next phase.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-08a.396" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1624" speakername="Simon Harris" time="21:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030800052#BBB00300"><p>The short answer is "Yes".  We should and will do that.  I agree with Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in in this regard.  I believe he will also agree with me that staff in our third level institutions, and across the public sector, changed their work practices and how they worked overnight.  They did so in an emergency scenario.  They showed great flexibility and I really respect and thank them for that.  However, as we move from an emergency phase of the pandemic - and we all hope we are doing so - it is important that we have discussions about how to make these changes more sustainable and what is required to embed them.  People did things on a one-off basis and went above and beyond but a precedent was not set.  We have to sit down and engage with stakeholders if we want to embed these changes into people's work practices.  We absolutely will do that.  I have no doubt that there are people who have accessed third level education as a result of these changes who may not otherwise have been able to.  I remember talking to Longford Women's Link and women in that group were accessing degree programmes in Maynooth University from rural Longford.  That shows how we can bring education to people who may not otherwise be able to access it.  While the Deputy is right that I cannot necessarily direct institutions, as part of the discussions on future funding, we have a list of reforms that we want to see from the sector.  This is certainly one such area.</p></speech>

My colleague, Senator Hoey, has been speaking on this recently.  They have lower progression rates to third level than the general population.  The Association for Higher Education Access and Disability, AHEAD, reported that approximately 12% of students disclosed a disability in a recent survey.  The true figure may be as high as 20%.  With regard to access to third level, further and higher education, this could be a fantastic tool to use into the future.  The physicality of a university campus or further education facility does not have to be any kind of barrier to people engaging in learning.  Remote learning will be a very significant part of that.  As the Minister has said, the walls absolutely can be broken down.  Within all that, we also need to understand that these institutions will need funding streams to roll that out.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the work of the Deputy's colleague, Senator Hoey, who I happened to meet this evening.  There is a lot we can do in this space.  I am proud of the progress we have made across the education sector, including in early years, primary and secondary education, with regard to being inclusive of people with additional needs.  We have made some progress in the third level sector and there are statistics to back that up but we have not made enough.  In many ways, the cliff edge for many students has moved from second level to third level.  We need to fix that.  We are developing our new national access plan.  I hope to publish that around Easter.  I am pleased to say that we have &euro;5 million to spend on that in 2022.  I am now considering how best to deploy that.  To give the House an indication of my plans, one of the areas I intend to focus on this year is the area of intellectual disabilities.  This is an area we have been too silent on when it comes to disability in the third level sector and one in which we can make progress.  I look forward to engaging with Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in and Senator Hoey as we publish the national access plan and then, crucially, as we implement it.</p></speech>

The honest answer to the last part of the question is that it will be a matter for the discussions on the Estimates.  However, I take the point she makes about the need to ensure additional supports are brought in for September.  It is right to say that what is announced in the budget will take effect from the calendar year 2023.  I believe the Deputy is putting it up to me to see if we can do more from this September.  I will certainly work on that basis.</p>  <p>  The programme for Government contains a commitment to review SUSI eligibility criteria, adjacency rates and postgraduate grant supports.  To take this forward, I established a review of the student grant scheme.  This was conducted by Indecon under the direction of a steering group chaired by my Department and comprising a number of stakeholders including, importantly, the Department of Social Protection so that it could look at the whole area of poverty traps.  Crucially, the voice of our students was also represented through the Union of Students in Ireland, along with the voice of institutions and others.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will know from my answer to her previous question, it is my intention to bring this piece of work to Cabinet alongside the proposals on a sustainable funding model.  Issues of cost and access must be considered in tandem with the issues of system funding and reform.  I do not want to bring forward a funding model that is sustainable for universities but not for students or their families.  If we want the best outcomes, we need a well-funded system that is accessible to people regardless of their background.  Reform of the student support system can, and will, be a critical enabler of other strategic outcomes across the tertiary education system.  Given these interconnections, it is my intention to bring the student grant review to Cabinet alongside the report on funding and reform of higher education, both of which will be published together.</p>  <p>  Implementing the report recommendations is a key priority for my Department.  I am pleased to say we have started this process.  I know the Deputy will argue with me about the pace but we have started to initiate these improvements.  Indeed, I will be signing regulations this week to bring in a number of improvements to the SUSI grant scheme from September.  These include increases to the thresholds and income levels and improvements to the situation regarding adjacency rates.  All student grant maintenance payments, including the special rate of grant, will increase by &euro;200 per year, the income thresholds to qualify will increase by &euro;1,000, and the qualifying distance criterion for students to qualify for the non-adjacent rate of grant has been reduced from 45 km to 30 km.  I will sign those regulations this week.</p></speech>

As the Minister will know, we are in extraordinary times with regard to the cost of living.  The cost of living is having a severe impact on students and their families.  That is why I am concerned that one thing is being delayed by the other.  We need to bring in measures with regard to SUSI eligibility before the beginning of the next year.  I am concerned about the students who are here right now, particularly students who have to travel because they either cannot get accommodation or afford accommodation and have to travel in their cars when we are seeing the price of fuel become unaffordable.  This is really having an impact and we should treat this with the urgency it deserves in terms of providing support for students.  It is in their interests, and all of our interests, for us to ensure that as many students as possible continue and are as successful in their studies as they can be.</p></speech>

Of course, we did take measures in this House to benefit students for this academic year.  We changed the law in respect of student renters not once, but twice, to make sure that students could not be asked to pay more than one month's rent in advance or a deposit worth more than one month's rent.  That was a significant issue and a solution was sought by students' unions with support from parties across this House.  This could have a real and meaningful impact with regard to the amount of money students have to pay out up front.  We also changed the law with regard to the notice period students, and other renters, need to give.  In the budget, we also introduced the first increase in grant maintenance payments in some time, an increase of &euro;200 per year.  The income threshold is increasing by &euro;1,000 and the qualifying distance criterion for students to qualify for the non-adjacent rate of grant is being reduced from 45 km to 30 km.  These are not abstract things, as the Deputy knows.  She has welcomed them.  These changes will benefit thousands of students and will build on improvements that we brought in for this year for current students, including an increase and improvements for postgraduate students.  However, I accept that we need to do more.  I will point out that, if the Deputy looks at the terms of reference of the SUSI review, she will see that these are exactly the sorts of areas we have been looking at.  We are not waiting for the publication of a report to make progress.  We have started and I certainly hope to take many more steps in the budget.</p></speech>

I think we agree on that.  At the moment, too few people have access to it.  I welcome the announced increases to the income thresholds but we are obviously still waiting for them to come into effect.  We could have worked on the maintenance grant.  We did not have to wait until September to do that.</p> <p>We need to increase the numbers getting access to the scheme rather than simply being a standstill measure to keep up with the limited wage growth that we have seen in recent years.  The SUSI budget was substantially larger in 2015 than in 2020.  Part-time students are offered no support.  The Minister should be looking to extend student grants to part-time students even if it is just helping with fees.  SUSI should cover the postgraduate fees as well.  We also need to ensure that SUSI supports get to those who need them most.  The burden of proof for lone parents is too high.  We need to look specifically at the case of adults often with children of their own who need to move back in with their parents because of the housing crisis.  There is a perfect storm for students and we need to get them out of it.</p></speech>

I particularly agree with her on the issue of part-time students.  We need to do some work on defining what a part-time student is.  I do not say that in any smart or flippant way.  Obviously, there are many different types of part-time courses.  What constitutes a part-time student for the purposes of the grant involves genuine technical and somewhat legal issues that we will need to work through.  We should do that and we will do that.</p>  <p>  I want students to know this.  The Deputy is right that students are not immune from the cost-of-living pressures - far from it.  Many are experiencing those costs which is why we made the additional allocation to the student assistance fund.  I want students to know that it is there.  It is available through their access office.  Students should know that it is there for one-off bills for people who are struggling financially.  I want to get that message out.  I sometimes worry that this message does not get out to students on the ground as much as it needs to through the access office.  The student assistance fund is there.  We have made changes to the SUSI grant scheme that have already taken effect, including specifically for postgraduate students and the grant scheme will open in coming days for the forthcoming academic year.</p></speech>

I find myself similarly thinking that there is merit in the issue he has raised this evening.  I have done some work on it and I am committing now to intensify that work to try to get a positive outcome.</p>  <p>  The nationality requirements for the student grant scheme are set out in section 14 of the Student Support Act 2011 and regulation 5 of the Student Support Regulations 2021.  The candidate's nationality or immigration status in the State determines whether she or he meets the nationality requirement outlined in the Act and regulations, and would be therefore eligible to qualify for a student grant.</p>  <p>  Permission to remain in the State on the basis of a stamp 4 visa does not, in itself, meet the nationality requirements of the student grant scheme.  There is provision for a review of eligibility where a person&rsquo;s circumstances change in the academic year.  This includes a change to a student's immigration status in our country.  Where a student acquires Irish citizenship by naturalisation or is granted one of the permission-to-remain criteria provided for in the Act or regulations during the course of their studies, she or he may apply to SUSI to have their application reassessed.</p>  <p>  It is important that our approach to these issues is equitable, consistent and fully aligned with the intent and purpose of the immigration permissions which are granted to individuals.  I have met the Irish Refugee Council to discuss this matter.  We have tried to introduce changes in a number of areas.  The Irish Refugee Council has been advocating for a change in this area for some time and there is significant merit in it.  I understand that a number of NGOs have written to my Department in recent months on the matter.  As a result of this and as a result of the Deputy's question, I have asked my officials to look in further detail at the issue he has raised.  I have asked them to look at the wider issue of alignment of SUSI grants and free fee support with immigration permissions in collaboration with other relevant Departments and to provide advice to me as quickly as possible as to whether I can make any changes in this area to align with those broader objectives.</p></speech>

I wanted to raise this matter in general but also specifically relating to Irish citizens who are not currently eligible for the SUSI grant.  This issue was brought to my attention by Kuxi Ghai, an incredible law student in Kings Inns and also an incredible advocate for the SPARK one-parent family group.  I thank Ms Ghai for her tireless campaign.  The Minister mentioned the principles of equity.</p>  <p>  Currently, grants are given to those with permission to remain in the State with stamp 4 visas if they are the spouse or civil partner of an Irish citizen or a dependent child of a naturalised Irish citizen.  Not included in the eligibility are those who have permission to remain in the State with stamp 4 visas who are parents of Irish citizens.  Excluding parents of Irish citizens is inconsistent with any principle of equity.  It flies in the face of the purpose and intent of the stamp 4 permissions for parents of dependent Irish citizens.  In his response the Minister suggested that he would undertake a review and make a change.  I hope we can do that very quickly.  In my next contribution I will make suggestions for an amendment that could be made as suggested by Kuxi Ghai.</p></speech>

I am very open and want to do more in this area.  Since I came to office, we have already made three changes to try to support students coming to Ireland.  First, we removed the requirement for prospective applicants coming in through our international protection system to have attended three academic years in the Irish school system and to have obtained a leaving certificate.  I thought that was a ridiculous requirement.  Subsequently, in 2021 the scheme was further expanded to allow eligible applicants to undertake postgraduate courses.  In March of last year, my colleague the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, and I jointly announced that international protection applicants with permission to work would no longer be required to pay the international student fees to access post-leaving certificate, PLC, education courses.</p>  <p>  We have been working with the sector.  We have been listening to NGOs and the Irish Refugee Council.  I accept there is a valid argument regarding those with stamp 4 visas.  I am sure my colleagues in the Department of Justice will have a view and I need to engage with them on that.  I will be happy to revert to the House and to the Deputy then.</p></speech>

However, I wrote to the Minister in November and again in January, at which time we seemed to be at odds.  I am glad that seems to have been rectified.</p>  <p>  I am very conscious that the Minister has included reference to the Minister for Justice.  My concern is that the buck will continue to be passed between the Department of Justice and the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.  There is an onus on Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science because the Minister is responsible for widening access and participation rates of marginalised groups, particularly those heading one-parent families and those coming from migrant backgrounds.  This is a barrier for education.  Kuxi Ghai, whom I mentioned, has not only raised this issue with me but she has also proposed potential solutions through amendment to the Student Support Regulations 2021 to include a new section that would specifically allow parents of Irish citizens to be eligible for the grant.  I will email that to the Minister's office tomorrow.</p></speech>

I was merely stating that issues relating to immigration policy are matters for the Department of Justice.  I agree with the Deputy that issues relating to widening access to education are very much the responsibility of my Department.  We do not shirk that nor do we pass it to any other Department.  The approach I take is that it is always of benefit to provide access to education for people in our country regardless of nationality, circumstances, background, gender or any other matter.  We have already taken a number of steps to do that.  I accept that we need to do more.  Dr. Catherine Day's report also broadly indicates we need to do more.  We could do more on the area the Deputy has identified.  I will try to rectify this and I look forward to receiving his email.  I am happy to keep in close contact with him on this.</p></speech>

I ask the Minister to outline his plans to increase the supply of affordable on-campus accommodation.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-08a.419" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1624" speakername="Simon Harris" time="21:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030800053#CCC01400"><p>I am very conscious of the challenges faced by students with student accommodation.  My Department and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage are working closely together on these issues.  As everyone in this House will know, the underlying issue is one of supply.  We need to increase the supply of all types of accommodation, including student accommodation.  That is why we launched Housing for All, led by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage which sets out a series of actions which will be delivered to address the housing crisis backed by a transformative budget of &euro;20 billion.</p>  <p>  In its ambition to deliver student accommodation, I acknowledge that the third level sector is facing the same issues which are affecting construction developments globally, including disrupted supply chains and other constraints.  Very significant progress is being made in the Government's overall housing policy with both housing completions and commencements showing significant acceleration and the construction workforce back to pre-pandemic levels.  Notwithstanding these trends, construction costs and other constraints are acting as a deterrent to institutions in proceeding with new developments.  My Department and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage are considering whether options may be open to us to support increased supply with affordable rental levels.</p>  <p>  With this in mind, I am working with my officials to consider immediate options and those initiatives which can be achieved in the more medium term.  I have recently written to all universities, technological universities and institutes of technology asking them to identify any potential local solutions which could contribute to increased supply ahead of the next academic year.</p> <p>This may involve the repurposing of existing buildings.  This is an important, real and sincere offer.  We saw in Limerick that there was an ability to identify a local solution and some facility that could be adapted there, with funding provided through the council, I believe, and that being ready for September.  I would like to see if there are other examples of that.  There is an open offer to all higher education institutions, HEIs, in that regard.</p> <p> More broadly, as for the medium-term strategic change that needs to happen, my Department is, as I said, working with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to examine how student accommodation can be incorporated into other developments aimed at boosting land supply, including the Land Development Agency's plans in Limerick, for example.  In my view, student accommodation should form part of the overall residential mix.</p> <p> I will update the Deputy further in a moment.</p></speech>

As late as last week I discussed that with Atlantic Technological University.  By the way, I congratulate Dr. Orla Flynn.  I think she will do an excellent job there, and I know the Minister and I will work with her to ensure that Atlantic Technological University is successful.  That is one tangible way in which this could work.  The Minister has stated to me in previous responses that he has no plans to bring forward a new strategy for student accommodation because the current strategy covers 2017 to 2024.  That strategy has been a failure.</p></speech>

I think she will be an excellent president.  I wish her luck and look forward to Atlantic Technological University, ATU, coming into being shortly.</p>  <p>  The Deputy has hit the nail on the head.  One of the institutions is already asking what it can do locally.  For the first time here we are making a shift in policy and having an open-door policy for any local solution or idea that can come forward, particularly those with immediate solutions for September.</p>  <p>  More broadly, though, I have admitted that we need to change policy when it comes to student accommodation.  We do not need better speaking points to explain it; we need to change the policy.  That is why I am meeting the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien.  I am looking at the Land Development Agency as it develops across the country and whether student accommodation can be a part of that.  The Minister and I are looking at a cost-rental model and whether there is room for that, what we need to do and whether there are grant-aid options to make it sustainable for the colleges to build.  I will update the Cabinet committee on housing at the beginning of April on options in that regard.</p></speech>

Looking at Mayo, for instance, the problem there is that we are concerned that the lack of accommodation will constrain the possibilities and the opportunities for Atlantic Technological University.  There were only 24 properties to rent last week in Mayo, and we find that students are competing with families, which should not be the case.  We should have purpose-built on-campus accommodation for students.  This cannot be separated from the underfunding of higher education.  Even the on-campus accommodation was turned into a source of revenue for colleges to replace the public funding removed under austerity.  It is not the fault of the individual institutions; these decisions were made at a Government level.  On-campus accommodation is charged for at near the market value because the various institutions need to cover costs.  They therefore try to attract wealthier, more lucrative students to be able to bring in more revenue.</p></speech>

While I accept there needs to be new policy initiatives and policy levers, some of which I have outlined, it is important to say that since 2016 we have seen 12,149 purpose-built student bed units built.  Work is under way on-site on an additional 3,128 units and planning permission has been obtained for a further 10,493 units.  In addition, planning permission for a further 1,028 units has been applied for.  I just wanted to put those figures on the record of the House.  In addition, regarding the Atlantic Technological University, institutes of technology and technological universities lacked clarity as to whether they could borrow to build student accommodation.  That has now been clarified.  They now can, and we have put into the mix immediate local solutions.  The piece we are trying to rectify is affordability.  What student unions say to me is that this is not just about the numbers being built, which I have cited, but has to be about trying to find that affordability.  We have changed the law, as we discussed earlier, to deal with some of the difficulties students face in terms of upfront costs for student accommodation.  I accept we need to do more and I will bring proposals to the Cabinet committee in April.</p></speech>

It recognised that we have to encourage better and wider take-up and target skills to meet the needs of our economy.  A plan to deliver this is the Action Plan for Apprenticeship, which has shown the intent to create a modern apprenticeship system that is reflective of Irish society and supports learners and employers.  I ask the Minister to comment on the staffing and funding allocated to the new national apprenticeship office.</p></reply>

The further development and mainstreaming of apprenticeship in Ireland through the creation of a single unified apprenticeship system has a key role to play in meeting Ireland's skills needs in a manner that presents a valued proposition for apprentices and employers alike.</p>  <p>  Key to the delivery set out in the action plan is a new organisational architecture, including, as the Deputy has alluded to, the creation of a new national apprenticeship office and a national apprenticeship alliance.  The office will have responsibility for all aspects of management, oversight and development of the apprenticeship system and for implementing our action plan.  Under the action plan the national apprenticeship office will exercise, on a shared and conjoint basis, the relevant legislative and funding functions of SOLAS and the HEA in this area.  The new national apprenticeship office will deliver additional practical supports and information for employers and apprentices seeking to engage with apprenticeships.  I am delighted to inform the Deputy that Dr. Mary-Liz Trant, who has extensive senior experience in education and training, has now been appointed as the first director of the office.  She is now providing the leadership required to address the next stage in the office's development, and I thank her for that.  This includes finalising the work programme, the staffing allocations and the development and implementation of solid governance and financial arrangements, aligned with our action plan.  I am also pleased to inform the Deputy that a sum of &euro;1 million has been allocated for the first year, 2022, of the national apprenticeship office's operation to allow it to establish, to staff up and to begin its work.</p>  <p>  I am also pleased to tell the Deputy that the success of what has been a national effort under way to promote apprenticeship as a career option can be seen in the fact that last year saw the highest number ever of registered apprentices in our country, at 8,607.  That is a 40% increase on the number for 2019, which was the last full year before the Covid pandemic, so the last comparable year.  Last year 8,607 people put up their hands and said, "I want to be an apprentice."  We need to build on that to meet the skills needs of our country.</p></speech>

I think the entire House agrees that the creation of a focused, well-resourced national apprenticeship office to co-ordinate the apprenticeship system and to drive it forward is essential to this delivery.  I am therefore delighted to see the Minister's enthusiasm for the project and to see the commitment he has made to it thus far.  He said &euro;1 million is allocated for the new office but, specifically, could he give us some indication as to how it will be staffed?  I know we have a director for the office, but what staffing will she have?  More importantly, where does the Minister think this new office will be located?</p></speech>

We have done this in a number of ways.  For the very first time, leaving certificate students, when they go onto the CAO website, <i>cao.ie/options</i>, now see all their options, including apprenticeships, not just the university route.  I always say to students about this place, so I will say it to the face of everyone here, that we always talk about building more houses in here.  If every Member of the D&aacute;il got together, we probably would not build one house between us.  We need to make sure that younger people and not-so-young people get the opportunity to become the bricklayers, electricians, plasterers, plumbers and carpenters we need to address housing and the green skills needs of our economy.  The employer grant has also been transformational.  You cannot have apprentices without employers.  This year we will also have a focus on public sector employers.  The public sector cannot just keep lecturing the private sector.  We need every county council and every Department taking on apprentices.  We now have a lot of capital to expend on expanding this.</p><p>As for the detail, I would need to defer to the director, Dr. Mary-Liz Trant.  We have given her the &euro;1 million, she has been appointed to the role and she now needs to do her workforce planning.  What I can tell the Deputy is that whatever she needs to make a success of this will be forthcoming from the Government.</p></speech>

The country agrees we need apprentices rapidly, particularly for retrofitting.</p> <p>It will be a missed opportunity if we do not take a centre and office for apprenticeships outside Dublin and the big urban areas.  In the main, apprenticeships and apprentices will be drawn from rural Ireland into construction trades and across the agricultural and possibly retail sectors. </p> <p> Deputy Conway-Walsh spoke of the challenges regarding student accommodation.  The last thing we need to do is pile more students into large urban centres, fuelling the fire of the housing crisis.  We have an opportunity with the Minister's statement of intent in terms of apprenticeships to reconfigure and recalibrate where we direct and where we house our students.  It is a huge opportunity for the Minister and for rural Ireland.</p></speech>

I welcome some of the points the Minister has made about how we are now looking at options but he gave 2021 figures of over 8,000 apprentices signed up.  Does he believe that is enough?

In relation to rural and provincial Ireland, I am pleased we have &euro;430 million in capital funding to spend on further and higher education.  From memory, 45% of that will go to further education.  I was talking to Longford-Westmeath ETB yesterday.  Capital calls are open for each ETB to come forward with projects.  There is a short deadline.  It is the first week of April.  Let us get these projects in and start opening more apprenticeship centres around the country.  Good progress has been made on one in Galway-Roscommon recently but we need much more.</p>  <p>  To Deputy Gould, we estimate we need about 10,000 registered apprentices per year by 2025.  That is what the plan commits to.  We were at 8,607 at the end of 2021 so things are looking good in that regard but we cannot be complacent.  The point the Deputy made on small and medium businesses is important.  Until now, we have seen good and growing employment uptake in apprentices but we need to make sure it is accessible to all employers.  That is why we have brought in the new employer grant offering a &euro;2,000 payment to an employer who takes on an apprentice.  I hope that will be of great use.</p></speech>

It will increase the amount of the grant by &euro;200 and reduce the criteria to qualify for the higher, non-adjacent rate.  It will reduce the distance a student needs to live from the university from 45 km to 30 km.  These are three of the initial measures we intend to take to improve the SUSI grant system.  I will sign those regulations most likely tomorrow, but certainly this week.</p></speech>

For the last two years, many students have suffered significantly through the housing crisis so many have been forced to live at home and travel great distances to college daily.  I know of many people throughout rural Ireland who do not have the public transport to access universities.  Many of them have their parents drive them to college or to the location where they can get public transport, or they drive themselves.  Now they are being snookered on the other side of that equation because prices of diesel and petrol are increasing.  They feel that nobody is winning in this situation.  They are borrowing money, facing debts and suffering anxiety and mental health issues as a result.</p>  <p>  One of the promises in the recent budget was reduced transport costs for young people.  That has not materialised and today we still do not have that in place.  It is an incredible situation.  It is astounding that it was promised in the budget and still not delivered in March 2022.</p>  <p>  We need an update on SUSI reform.  Can the Minister say with absolute clarity that students who apply for SUSI next month will be treated more fairly and with greater leniency than last year.  When will the reforms the Minister has spoken about kick in?  Will they kick in for people who apply next month or will they have to wait for the next years for those differences in grants?</p></speech>

I will ask my colleague, the Minister for Transport, to revert to the Deputy on the issue regarding public transport.</p>  <p>  The changes I have spoken about will come in for students from this September.  The grants will increase by &euro;200 and the income threshold by &euro;1,000.  The qualifying criteria for the higher and non-adjacent rate will reduce from having to live 45 km away to 30 km away.  Those changes will come in from September.</p>  <p>  Deputy Conway-Walsh and I engaged earlier on when any more changes that come in by way of the budget will take effect.  That will be a matter for the budget.</p>  <p>  The Deputy has hit on an important issue about stress, anxiety, mental health, worry and cost of living.  There is a student assistance fund in place separate to the SUSI grant scheme.  There is over &euro;18 million in that fund.  It is available through every access office in our publicly funded higher education institutions and is there for students who find themselves in hard times and in need of additional financial assistance.</p></speech>

Can the Minister give clarity on the issue of transportation?  I know it is not his Department but it is frustrating for students who were told they would get this and are waiting for it to happen.  There is no clarity on when it will happen and it is happening at a snail's pace.</p>  <p>  Today the Minister provided me with an answer to a written question about salaries in his Department.  Since he took office just less than two years ago, just shy of &euro;500,000 has been spent on special advisers.  I have asked this of all Ministers because &euro;500,000 is big money and would pay full college fees for a year for 167 students.  There is a deep difference between the &euro;200 that will be given to students in the SUSI grant increase and the largesse being expended on special advisers.  How many special advisers work in the Department and what do they do?</p></speech>

The last thing we need to do is pile more students into large urban centres, fuelling the fire of the housing crisis.

I will ask my officials to engage with SOLAS regarding it.  A competitive call is under way now and, from memory, applications are due in by the first week of April.  It will be up to the local ETBs to prioritise the projects they wish to see funded in the first competitive capital call.  I will ensure that my officials and SOLAS are aware of Ballyhaunis.</p>  <p>  The Deputy has pointed out the reduced number of apprentices who fully qualified in a year.  We must, though, also be truthful about why that was.  We had significant lockdowns and restrictions because of the Covid-19 pandemic.  I have seen heroic work done across the sector and people trying to reduce those times now when the sector is back at full throttle.  We have allocated a great deal of additional support.  That would be acknowledged by SOLAS and the ETBs.  We are taking on additional trainers and saying that the backlog for phases 4 and 6 will be cleared by April.  We are also saying that by the end of the year, the waiting list for phase 2 will effectively be cleared, if not fully cleared.  I and the Minister of State, Deputy Niall Collins, who is away on Government business tonight, will be monitoring this aspect closely and Deputy Conway-Walsh will be asking me about this issue every time we have questions too.</p></speech>

I am concerned about the drop-out rate as well.  Perhaps that is a figure we can look at another day.  We do not want people dropping out of apprenticeships.  The State has saved &euro;55 million, mostly from apprenticeship allowances, but has reinvested only &euro;37 million in the programme.  Apprentices have not been treated with the same consideration and importance as other third level students.  They are vital to our economy, across all areas,  in respect of development of the regions and the opportunities that will be presented in that regard, whether in renewable energy, construction and everything else that needs to be done.  I am also concerned that the backlog is being used as a justification for reforming the traditional model of craft apprenticeships.  There has been a real debate regarding why it is planned to dismantle the traditional craft apprenticeship model in favour of a decentralised and industry-led approach.  What is the rationale for that change?  I am concerned about it.</p></speech>

For example, if I wish to talk to third level students, I can talk to the USI and if I wish to talk to university presidents, then I talk to the Irish University Association, the Technological Higher Education Association, THEA, etc.  Who does one talk to, however, when one wishes to talk to the apprentice on the front line, other than going around apprenticeship centres, which the Deputy and I do?  The new national apprenticeship alliance, which we are just establishing and have just signed off on its composition, will for the first time see apprentices have a collective voice.  It is important to have a voice for apprentices that I, the Deputy and SOLAS can talk to and that can be heard.  That is important.</p>  <p>  I assure the Deputy that there is nothing to do with Covid-19 backlogs or anything else in the idea of having a new structure concerning decentralising the craft apprenticeship model.  The idea is to have one structure for all our apprenticeship programmes.  We have 62 of them.  The crafts and trades are so important, but so too is the account technician, the people working in insurance, the farm manager and the hairdresser.  We need to have one unified system.  This will be done in consultation with stakeholders, with staff and with trade unions.  Their voices will be heard, so there is no motive in doing this, other than to genuinely try to create a modern, fit-for-purpose and unified apprenticeship system.</p></speech>

It is not the first time he has raised this issue with me and I am aware that he has an interest in the area.  The LTI is a project-based training and work experience programme operating under the 16 ETBs in partnership with community and voluntary organisations.  In 2021, the ETBs provided 212 LTI courses nationwide, involving more than 2,000 learners.  Those are the latest figures I have.  Training provision organised through LTIs is not intended to be permanent and it is this aspect that gives ETBs the flexibility to use resources in the community in response to emerging needs.  This flexibility is one of the attractive aspects of the LTI programmes.  They enable local communities to carry out valuable and necessary projects of benefit to their communities and are designed for unemployed people experiencing difficulty in gaining entry to the labour market.</p>  <p>  The importance of the role played by LTIs within overall ETB provision is well recognised.  I acknowledge that.  All ETB provision is subject to annual funding requests and allocations based on learner demand.  The national further education and training strategy, entitled Future FET: Transforming Learning National Strategy 2020-2024, sets out the ambition and vision for the further education and training system over this period.  The expansion of any FET provision will be considered in the context of that strategy and of the new strategic performance agreements that are currently being agreed between SOLAS and the 16 ETBs.</p>  <p>  This is an important development.  SOLAS is sitting down with each of the 16 ETBs and asking about the strategic plan for further education and training in each area and how all the different provisions  will fit into the strategic plan over its full term.

Is the Minister concerned that LTIs are not mentioned in the national further education and training strategy at all?  Will he tell me what can be done to ensure that the staff can be secure in their employment?  Is it not true that they go from year to year and that there is no opportunity for advancement, promotion, incremental increases in salary or professional development?

He can speak about what the document is not referencing but I want to state in this House that it should not be taken in any way, shape or form as my view, the Department's view or the Government's view on the importance of the LTI programmes across the country and the role they have to play.  I suggest to the Deputy that the most appropriate avenue to embed that importance will be in the individual strategic agreements being reached between SOLAS and each of the ETBs individually.  Ensuring the LTIs are embedded in that strategic agreement with ETBs will be an important element and something I will follow up on as a result of the exchange we have had here in the D&aacute;il this evening.</p>  <p>  I know the 2021 funding allocation for LTIs is &euro;18,963,596.  The funding allocation and planned provision for this year is due to go to the SOLAS board in April.  The actual spend will be available when ETBs finalise their accounts in April.  The Deputy also makes an important point about training and continuous development of staff.  It is something I will reflect on and engage with SOLAS on.  I am happy to meet some staff members with the Deputy because I know he has a familiar interest in this.</p></speech>

In this particular instance, however, it seems to be missing; it is not there.  I would be very grateful if the Minister could come back to me with concrete plans on this.  I put it to the Minister that whatever about SOLAS and the ETBs, it is very important that at a national level, from his Department, the policy and strategy are fed down as well as up.  I call on the Minister to ensure it happens in this case.</p>  <p>  With respect to waiting lists to get into LTIs, does the Minister have information or can he come back to me later to let me know how many young people in particular did not get into LTIs despite wanting to?  He spoke earlier about these being demand-driven and I put it to him that more people want to get in there because of the training and opportunities they get to develop themselves and learn.</p>  <p>  Is the Minister aware of the Open Doors Initiative?  Has he met its representatives or does he have plans to do so?</p></speech>

I have not met them and I am not sure if they are looking to meet me.  I would be delighted to meet them and am more than happy to set that up with the Deputy.  As the Deputy rightly says, I will ensure that policy comes from both the bottom up and top down, for want of a better phrase.  I will ensure that is reflected in my engagement with SOLAS, the ETBs and my Department.</p>  <p>  I do not have the data that the Deputy is seeking.  I will state clearly that I am concerned if a number of people, particularly younger people but anybody seeking to access LTIs, find themselves not in a position to gain that access.  We are spending more money on further education and training probably than ever before and certainly more than in an awfully long time.  This is demand-led and we want to provide opportunities for everybody to upskill, reskill and get into work with the career they want.  There should not be any blockages like that.  Perhaps the Deputy and I could discuss that in more detail.  I will certainly inquire about the data and revert to the Deputy.</p></speech>

The Action Plan for Apprenticeship 2021-2025 aims to ensure the apprenticeship system will contribute to meeting Ireland's skills and human capital requirements by delivering on a target of 10,000 apprenticeship registrations per annum by 2025.  Among the 62 apprenticeships currently available at levels 5 to 10 of the national framework of qualifications, 25 are craft-related.  More specifically, they include housing and retrofitting-related programmes such as electrical, plumbing, carpentry and joinery, plastering, painting and decorating and the recently-launched scaffolding apprenticeship.</p>  <p>  Given the practical nature of off-the-job training for craft apprentices, the pandemic shutdown of on-site learning significantly impacted the ability of apprentices to access this training over the past two years of the Covid-19 pandemic.  This has led to some apprentices taking longer to fully qualify.  However I am pleased to say that more than 7,500 of the affected apprentices have now progressed in their off-the-job training.  This includes more than 600 final-year apprentices who have been fast-tracked to complete their qualification.</p>  <p>  It is worth noting that overall craft apprenticeship qualification data show that numbers qualifying from these programmes rose over the five-year period from 2016 to 2021 from 1,222 to 1,798.  Despite the fact that two of those years were affected by the pandemic, we saw a significant increase in the number of people qualifying from craft apprenticeships.  Furthermore and encouragingly, annual intake to these programmes has been steadily increasing from a low of 650 in 2010.  In 2021, a record of 8,607 new apprentices were registered, an almost 40% increase on the figures from 2019, in what we call the last "normal" pre-pandemic year, whatever that is.  Of those registrations, 5,181 were on construction and electrical apprenticeships.  As of January 2022, the latest full-month figures, there have been 376 construction-related registrations.</p></speech>

We are talking about building and retrofitting and beyond that we have been talking specifically about work on renewable energy etc.  Even beyond that we are looking at apprenticeships in non-traditional and non-craft training, even taking in training that might previously have happened in colleges.  There is also the question of the post-leaving certificate route and whatever other routes are available.</p>  <p>  There is work that goes between the Minister's Department, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the regional skills forum.  Where will we get the information on the skills and numbers that are required and how that can happen?  Do we even have enough employers to take on apprentices etc.?  How often are we reviewing this?</p></speech>

The expert group on future skills needs falls under the remit of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and SOLAS is an agency of my Department that looks at labour bulletins and where skills shortages exist and which has a responsibility for meeting those skills shortages.</p>  <p>  I will take those two specific issues because we have figures for them.  To deliver the retrofitting programme, we believe we need 17,000 additional people working in retrofitting by the middle of the decade, or 2025.  To achieve that we will open five centres of excellence in retrofitting training.  We have a centre open in Waterford and another in Mount Lucas, County Offaly.  We will have three more coming this year, with one in Cork, one in Limerick and one in Sligo.  This will give us the throughput to provide the 17,000 workers.  We need to create the demand and my message to any tradesperson or craftsperson who happens to come across this debate or is listening, it is that these are short, fast, free and flexible courses.  They can be done at the weekends and the average person's training is approximately three days.  It is not a big apprenticeship programme but it is about somebody getting a piece of upskilling.  With construction, we need 27,500 more people to build 33,000 homes per year by the middle of the decade.</p></speech>

I request a wee bit of leeway, as I am sure many of us have been asked questions about moves that will be made to facilitate people coming from Ukraine.  The Minister is on the record speaking about this.  I am talking about tradespeople doing apprenticeships and I have been contacted about people doing medical studies.  Where is the lie of the land in that regard?</p>  <p>  I will follow up with the Minister on the proposal around the Redeemer centre.  It is basically a place where people who might not necessarily be initially comfortable in, for example, Dundalk Institute of Technology, DkIT, could possibly start courses, including post-leaving certificate courses in the likes of that centre.  There will be a need for a funding solution.</p>  <p>  Will the Minister indicate if he will meet Oireachtas Members about DkIT in the near future?  I apologise for being so broad.</p></speech>

The transcript will act as an <i>aide-memoire</i>on that.</p><p>On the question of students coming from Ukraine and my Department's responsibility in that regard, the Deputy raises an important point.  My Department's responsibilities will largely arise in four areas.  These include English-language supports and ensuring we have provision for anyone who comes to this country to access English-language provision.  We are working to ramp that up and we have a good network and structure in place already to ensure we can meet demand there.</p><p>We will treat any student who comes here from Ukraine the same as an Irish student in terms of access to student supports and not being subjected to international fees and the like.  That is a commitment I give now.  The Department will also ensure the continuance of education for anybody in the middle of a programme, including Irish students in Ukraine and returning.  We are working our way through that but we will meet that goal.</p><p>The fourth element is important in the area of skills, as we will provide a personal assessment to anybody coming into the country in respect of his or her own skills and how they may match with qualification frameworks here.  It is about ensuring that such people can access the labour market too.</p></speech>

I should first say that my Department allocates specific funding for research through Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, the Irish Research Council, IRC, and the Higher Education Authority, HEA.  In 2021, SFI and the IRC spent &euro;257 million on targeted research funding.  Higher education institutions also fund research from their block grants from the HEA, in addition to other calls such as the North-South Research Programme.</p>  <p>  Citizen science benefits from this funding.  For example, the SFI Discover programme has invited applications for training and engagement activities of citizen science projects.  There may also be indirect benefits, for example as a product of individual research projects.  Last year the Taoiseach and I launched Creating our Future, a national brainstorm that involved the people of Ireland in a conversation on the role research can play in addressing opportunities, challenges and hopes for the future of this country and world.  Researchers joined the Creating our Future events to speak directly to communities.  This is really important, not just to have researchers speaking to researchers but to have civil society engagement.  More than 18,000 submissions were received from members of the public.</p>  <p>  I am delighted that, as a result of one of these events, Insight, the SFI research centre for data analytics, is now working with a community group in Oranmore on the Crowd4Access project.  This citizen science project empowers citizens to map the accessibility of Irish pavements for those with various mobility challenges, and represents a partnership between citizens and professional technology.  It is an interesting area for the Leas-Cheann Comhairle too, I am sure.  Insight is also working with the Europe Direct centre based at the Ballinasloe library to provide citizen science projects to secondary schools in the locality.  This is precisely the impact we had hoped for when we launched Creating our Future - communities coming together to discuss their challenges, engaging with researchers on addressing them and ultimately working together through a citizen science project.</p>  <p>  I will be bringing the final report of the Creating our Future project to Government, and it is my intention that projects involving all sorts of citizen and community interactions will form a continuing part of the engagement by the research community.</p></speech>

People see litter and they record it.  This project has the potential to assist local authorities in targeting areas where there is constant litter and also in helping communities to identify litter black spots.  This research gets no funding from the Department, which is very disappointing.  Despite applications to SFI and IRC, they did not get funding.  I ask the Minister to make contact and consider additional funding for projects given the positive impact they could have.</p>  <p>  I came from a housing committee meeting today; 32 years ago the derelict sites register was set up and we still have no clear data on dereliction.  The Department cannot give a timeline.  This is another project where citizens could be involved.</p></speech>

Just to be really clear, I see huge benefit in citizen science.  The Deputy will also appreciate and would think it appropriate that when it comes to deciding scientific and research projects to be funded, it is important that there are criteria that are independent of me.  That is the way we have funded science and research in this country, through our funding agencies, SFI in this instance.</p>  <p>  In an effort to be helpful to the Deputy and the project he references, I do run the Discover programme and there are open calls each year through a competitive process.  There is international peer review in deciding what to fund.  The aim of the SFI Discover programme is to support projects that address one of a number of objectives, including stimulating and creating debate and dialogue among the public, opportunities for dialogue with STEM experts on topics of societal importance, inspiring greater public awareness of the impact of STEM, and supporting and building engagement with and participation of a broader range of civil society and community groups.  I will send the Deputy the details.  I can also send him a list of the projects that have been funded this year and perhaps arrange for an engagement with SFI for the Deputy.</p></speech>

That is where a citizen science mapping project would be vital.  Citizens could take photographs and upload them to a central database.  We would be engaging with the community to tackle a huge issue.  We are in the middle of a housing crisis now.  We could use citizen science mapping to support local authorities and the Government to identify these projects, to identify these derelict sites and turn them into housing.  The whole concept of using citizen science mapping could be turned into a positive.  I spoke to the Department officials today and 32 years on they still do not know where the derelict sites are.</p></speech>

The SFI Discover programme is genuinely the route where I would suggest citizen science opportunities may exist for community groups.  In the Deputy's own county of Cork for example there is a project being funded by SFI Discover called Rebel Yeast.  It is an immersive citizen science project where volunteer scientists are exploring local woodlands to discover new wild yeasts, analyse their samples in the laboratory and participate in planning the research.  The volunteer scientists will fully engage with the scientific method through practice and with the research and any associated issues before co-signing communication materials for a final public event.  I assure the Deputy that there is a mechanism for citizen science to be funded.  There is the direct mechanism of SFI and the indirect but really important mechanism of the Creating our Future initiative.  There are projects being funded across the country.  Rebel Yeast in Cork is an example.  There is a competitive annual process that is internationally peer reviewed.  I can certainly arrange for SFI to brief the Deputy further on avenues that may be available.</p></speech>

This investment will include a FET College of the Future major projects fund, supporting projects to drive reform of the FET sector, including consolidation of provision in high quality facilities, integration of further education and training and realisation of centres of excellence.  It is open to every ETB now to put forward ideas.  I know from my visit to Deputy Calleary's county that there are already ideas coming from Mayo in this regard.  That is the futuristic piece; what we want to do in terms of a new way of delivering and having a modern, fit for purpose FET college.  The second funding call for FET is equally important.  It is a strategic infrastructure upgrade fund, supporting smaller-scale investments in existing FET infrastructure which are also aligned with FET College of the Future principles.  We are all very proud of the work that FET does but we also know it has been starved of capital for far too long.  This is for the projects that might needed to be done for which there has not been funding in the past.  Those two competitive calls are now open.  It is up to each ETB to prioritise and put forward their projects.</p>  <p>  Overall, as the Deputy has said, capital investment in the FET sector is expected to increase from expenditure of less than &euro;20 million in 2020 to over &euro;100 million a year by 2025.  That is a very significant increase.  The sector is excited about it.  We need to build capacity in the sector not just to identify projects but to deliver them as well.  The next phase of investment will position the sector to cater for rising demand, offering a comprehensive range of complementary options for learners.  There will also be a specific focus on apprenticeship facilities and the ability to ramp up apprenticeship provision, particularly in provincial Ireland.</p></speech>

Recently I visited the Mayo College of Education Ballina campus where they are doing some really fantastic work.  We also had the Minister of State, Deputy Niall Collins, launch the new national outdoor education and training strategy at the Achill college.  I congratulate Michael and all the team there.  They have seen investment.  Can the Minister tell me that this process is open to every ETB to apply for?  In the context of hospitality, for instance, we are facing a major crisis of staffing within the sector.  The Minister is probably too young to remember the fantastic work done by CERT - I am not, unfortunately.  We need to go back to that kind of local, industry-based model.  It strikes me that the FET colleges are ideally placed to do that for tourism and hospitality centres around the country.  The Minister mentioned to Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; the five centres for deep energy retrofit working.</p> <p>It strikes me as odd that one of them would not be located in Mayo, given the prospects for the county in terms of wind and offshore energy generation, which involves particular skills.  I support the call by Deputy Conway-Walsh for the location of a centre in Ballyhaunis.</p></speech>

It certainly is the case that these funding calls are open to all ETBs.  More than that, I expect all ETBs to come forward with projects.  I want to be able to fund &euro;430 million of capital expenditure across further and higher education between now and 2024, 45% of that being in the further education and training space.  In fact, I want to do more than that.  I would like us to have what we have never before had in further education and training, which is a pipeline of projects.  That has been done really well in the Department of Education in regard to schools building projects.  We all know where schools are on building lists.  We might argue over the pace of development but we all know where schools stand.  We need to have shovel-ready projects in further education and training in order that we can fund a significant tranche, amounting to &euro;100 million worth of projects, each year by the middle of the decade and also to ensure we have projects constantly coming on stream.</p>  <p>  It is up to each ETB to prioritise, which is important.  Each board needs to decide on the two or three big projects it wants to see progressed.  If they do so, do it well and put in good applications, I believe we can see good news for each ETB across the country in this round of allocations.</p></speech>

Every ETB should be encouraged to prioritise the existing strengths of each region and the educational opportunities that are available.  It is important that the Minister takes an interest, as I know he will, in the Ballyhaunis project and that there is encouragement for those involved to identify and pursue opportunities.  I certainly will be happy to work with him on a location in Mayo for deep energy retrofitting and the provision of the skills necessary in terms of wind farm and offshore operation.</p></speech>

Between the work we are doing in terms of the ETBs, capital funding and the Atlantic Technological University coming into being at the start of April, it is an exciting time for further and higher education in the north west, including Mayo.  I look forward to working with the Deputy on that.</p>  <p>  I thank Deputy Murnane O'Connor for all the work she has done in regard to Carlow College, St. Patrick's, for bringing me there and for the time she has given me on this issue.  I acknowledge that the college has played a major role in higher education in Carlow and the south east.  I thank the president, Fr. Conn, for his time and courtesy to me.  It will not come as a shock or news to anyone when I say that the question of integration into a technological university is a matter for the university in question, which, in this instance, will come into being at the start of May.  I would like to work with the Carlow College on this.  My officials will be meeting with representatives this week to ensure the college can be as well-positioned as possible to put forward a strong case for integration.  I look forward to working closely with the Deputy on this.</p></speech>

I acknowledge that HECA has played a very constructive role in its engagement with my Department since its foundation, particularly during the Covid pandemic.  Representatives of the association sat on the Covid steering committee and there has been no difference between publicly-funded and privately-funded institutions in terms of the public health-led approach to the crisis.  I thank HECA and, in particular, its CEO, Patricia O'Sullivan, for her work in this regard.</p>  <p>  Partnership between Government and key stakeholders, including the enterprise sector and providers of education and training programme such as higher education institutions, HEIs, is a key principle embodied in our national skills strategy.  I assure the Deputy that this principle is reflected in a strong voice and representation on the National Skills Council and the regional skills forums for higher education institutions.  I take his specific point in regard to HECA.  The Irish Universities Association, IUA, and the Technological Higher Education Association, THEA, which between them represent all but one of the public HEIs in the State, are represented on the National Skills Council by Professor David FitzPatrick and Dr. Brendan McCormack, respectively.  Membership of all the regional skills forums includes representatives from universities, technological universities and institutes of technology.</p>  <p>  I am providing the Deputy with full details in writing of National Skills Council and regional skills forums membership, which I trust will be of assistance to him.  I do not want to give a prescriptive answer tonight but, in light of his question, I will give consideration to representation for HECA.  I am happy to engage further on this issue with representatives of that organisation when I next meet them.  I certainly think the proposal merits consideration.  HECA has a very important role to play in providing courses to meet industry needs, which it already is doing in many ways.  The Deputy has asked me a valid question and I will reflect on it and revert to him directly.</p></speech>

We are well aware of the role HECA plays, particularly in terms of the courses it offers.  I understand it currently has 27,000 students nationwide, in colleges ranging from Hibernia College to Griffith College, both in Cork and Dublin, and covers courses from business to education to childcare.  There is a good balance in terms of the colleges and students it represents.  I understand the National Skills Council meets quarterly or every two months.  If the Minister were in a position by the next meeting to clarify whether HECA has been consulted, that would be most welcome.  I am a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, where we regularly have discussions with representatives from HECA.  It is obvious that they are held in such esteem that they are invited together with the other representative bodies.  They warrant inclusion on the forums we are discussing.</p></speech>

Its representatives are very good to engage with, which we do on a whole range of issues.  I have had a number of meetings with them and will continue to engage.  In order to take this forward, perhaps the Deputy and-or HECA would formally communicate with my Department and me on the matter.  In that way, we will be able to come back to the Deputy, as he suggested, in advance of the next regular meeting of the National Skills Council.</p></speech>

An issue that has come up often is the lack of garda&iacute; in communities.  I want to discuss with the Minister the number of community garda&iacute; in Carlow and Kilkenny because there certainly are concerns that there are not enough of them.  I have written to the Garda Commissioner to ask about recruitment in my constituency.  I am very concerned about this since we are now centralised, with Carlow seeming to be the poor relation in the arrangement.</p>  <p>  Rural crime has affected us all, directly or indirectly, and we cannot continue to let it happen.  People feel they are not being heard on this issue.  I attend the meetings of my local joint policing committee every three or four months, which are really helpful.  I compliment the members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in Carlow on the excellent job they are doing, but they are very short-staffed.  The assignment of garda&iacute; to communities is the main issue that is raised at every meeting of the joint policing committee.  For example, the Garda station in Leighlinbridge was closed in 2013 and, at around the same time, the post office and houses were burgled and machinery and tools were stolen.  A local Garda station is vital for small rural villages and townlands.</p> <p>Since the Government has promised to reopen the station, I am looking for the date on which the Department of Justice will honour its commitment in this regard.  The reopening is urgent and I am receiving calls to this effect.  I would like to see an end to false hope and to see genuine action taken.  I have tabled numerous parliamentary questions on this.  I have raised it as a Topical Issue many times and have spoken at length about it.  Carlow needs to be made a priority in Dublin and I intend to make my voice heard on this.</p> <p> I want to ask about Text Alert.  Text alerts are vital in the community but cost money, as the Minister of State knows.  We need some kind of funding stream.  What sort of funding have we available now for communities to help them with text alerts?  They are so valuable, particularly to elderly residents in rural areas.  I know this from talking to people.  They talk about the cost of living.  Services such as Text Alert will be cut if people cannot afford them.  I am aware that there was a LEADER scheme.  Could we have a scheme that would ensure that text alerts continue and that there is some funding for people?</p></speech>

As she will be aware, under section 26 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, as amended, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the management and administration of Garda business, which encompasses all operational policing matters, including the allocation of resources.  The Minister for Justice has no statutory role in regard to these operational policing matters.</p>  <p>  I am aware that the Government is committed to supporting a strong and visible police presence throughout the country to detect and prevent crime and provide reassurance to local communities across the country.  </p>  <p>  To date, the official categorisation of a community garda has simply referred to those who are exclusively assigned to building relationships with local communities and civil society, including through giving talks to schools and community groups.  It is important to note, however, that community policing is at the heart of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and that all garda&iacute; have a role to play in community policing in the course of carrying out their duties.  Indeed, this is fundamental to the new Garda operating model recommended by the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland and currently being rolled out under A Policing Service for Our Future, the Government's implementation plan for the commission's recommendations.</p>  <p>  An unprecedented allocation in excess of &euro;2 billion was provided in budget 2022 for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It includes funding for the recruitment of up to 800 additional Garda members and 400 Garda staff.  Many of the Garda members to be recruited will be drawn from the Garda recruitment competition that opened just last month.  I am happy to note on behalf of the Minister that the number of applications received thus far from those interested in a career in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is high.  </p>  <p>  I am informed that as of 31 January 2022, the latest date when figures were available, 97 community garda&iacute; were assigned to the Kilkenny-Carlow division.  This represents an increase of over 14% since December 2017, when there were 85 community garda&iacute; assigned to the division.  This allocation comprises 14 sergeants and 83 garda&iacute;.</p>  <p>  While the Deputy will appreciate that the allocation of resources is an operational matter for the Commissioner, I am assured that the situation remains closely monitored by the Garda senior leadership team, particularly in view of commitments to the continued roll-out of the operating model of policing at divisional level to ensure optimum use of all Garda resources in providing the best possible Garda service to the community.</p>  <p>  I can reassure the Deputy that the Minister, Deputy McEntee, will continue to engage closely with the Garda Commissioner in regard to all community safety issues in the context of prioritising the delivery of the suite of community safety commitments contained in the programme for Government and the justice plan.</p></speech>

It is great to welcome the recruitment of 800 garda&iacute; and staff members.  The Minister of State said 97 community garda&iacute; were assigned to the Kilkenny&ndash;Carlow division but did not actually tell me how many garda&iacute; are in Carlow.  Although Carlow is smaller than Kilkenny, I am a Deputy for Carlow-Kilkenny and believe it is important that I get the figures for Carlow.  It is good to see the increase but it is important that Carlow is never left behind.  I always feel it is because it is a smaller county.  Therefore, I ask for the figures for it.</p>  <p>  I compliment the garda&iacute; I know in Carlow and Kilkenny.  They do an excellent job but it is important to see more community garda&iacute;.  This is what we have always wanted in rural areas such as County Carlow.  It gives a sense of security, particularly for elderly people.  It is important that we talk about Text Alert.  I attended a Text Alert meeting recently and it was lovely to see the big crowd at it.  It was like a little community event, but there is now concern over paying money towards Text Alert.  We need to consider that and encourage people to opt for Text Alert more, particularly in rural areas.  There should be funding.  In this regard, we need to determine which is the relevant Department.</p>  <p>  While it is good that there is recruitment of new garda&iacute;, which I welcome, the Minister of State must make sure that smaller counties such as Carlow are not left behind.  I ask that he send me the figures for Carlow Garda station.  Well done to everyone involved.  For nearly two years, Covid has not been easy on anyone.  Garda&iacute; have played a huge part in calling to people and checking on people.  We have to recognise their work but we need to ensure we have enough garda&iacute; in the community.</p></speech>

I will convey her comments to the Minister.  It is important to restate the key point I made, that is, that local and senior Garda management are consulted during the allocation of personnel.  They are responsible for the specific deployment or assignment of duties undertaken at divisional level.</p>  <p>  With regard to Text Alert, I have heard what the Deputy has said.  The budget for 2022 provided for the establishment of the new community safety innovation fund, but I will convey the Deputy's comments on Text Alert to the Minister.</p></speech>

There has been an announcement that Scoil N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta Bhr&iacute;de, Leitir Calaidh, Ceantar na nOile&aacute;n, is closing.  The announcement was made by an email to the parents, and I heard it on the radio.  It surprised all of us, not least the parents of the pupils in the school and the people in the area.  The school has fought many battles and has managed to stay open.  It is in the heart of the Gaeltacht.  Already, two other schools have closed in the area.  I have brought in the relevant policy, Polasa&iacute; don Oideachas Gaeltachta 2017&ndash;2022, which was launched with great fanfare in 2016.  One of the best things to come out of any Government, as I said at the time, was the very positive policy whereby schools in the Gaeltacht could do everything in Irish and get special recognition for that.  There was a process and steps, and there was to be extra help.</p> <p>That policy was in recognition of the urgent need to have such a policy for the Gaeltacht areas.  There is a school that is at the heart of the community, as the Minister of State knows well from his own work i gcro&iacute;l&aacute;r na Gaeltachta agus an phobail.  Now there is an announcement that it is to close.  Was the Department aware of this?  Was it made aware of this?  If so, when and how?  What steps is the Government taking in relation to the matter?  Has the Department been in touch with the school or the board of management?  I understand the permission of the Department is necessary when a school is going to close, or certainly, there has to be some interaction between the school and the Department.  I am seeking clarification on the matter.</p></speech>

I thank Deputy Connolly for raising the matter.  It provides an opportunity to clarify the current position in relation to Scoil N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta Bhr&iacute;de.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, Scoil N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta Bhr&iacute;de is an all-Irish co-educational primary school with a Catholic ethos.  The current staffing is a principal, one special education teacher post and one part-time special education teaching post, with an enrolment of eight pupils in September 2021.  The programme for Government contains a commitment to continue to recognise the importance of small schools.  Small schools are highly valued in their communities in that they provide a vital link to local heritage and history, help sustain rural populations and often act as a link for sports and social activities.  Coming from a rural background, the Minister is very much aware of the huge importance of small schools to communities right across Ireland.  She has asked her Department to work with education partners to examine ways to support such schools in their communities and to ensure a more sustainable future for them.  In general, small schools are considered to be schools with four teachers or less.  A number of positive measures have been implemented to support small schools, including an improvement of one point in the appointment threshold and a reduction in the number of students required to retain a teacher, which was introduced in September 2021.</p>  <p>  The current staffing arrangements at primary level operate on the basis of one teacher for every 25 pupils, which has resulted in the lowest pupil-teacher ratio ever at primary school.  Budget 2022 further improved the staffing schedule by one point, which will bring the staffing schedule to a new historical low of one teacher for every 24 pupils in September 2022.  This builds on measures in previous budgets, which have seen improvements in the overall allocation of teaching posts and specific targeted measures for small and isolated schools, as well as primary schools on our islands.  Additionally, in August 2021, the Minister launched the small schools clusters action research project, an innovative research project which aims to encourage small schools in a number of clusters to collaborate and identify common challenges and trial innovative solutions.  The Minister hopes the learning from this project will help inform the policy approach to supporting small schools.</p>  <p>  In respect of school closures or amalgamations, the decision-making authority belongs to the patron of the school.  Any proposal to close or amalgamate a school must involve consultation with all of the relevant stakeholders - parents, teachers, students and local communities - and follow decisions taken at local level.  Such proposals must then be agreed with the Department.  The Department has no record of a formal request to approve the closure of Scoil N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta Bhr&iacute;de.  Furthermore, the Department has been given to understand that the patron has not made any decision regarding the closure of the school.  While there has been no contact between the school authority and the Department regarding the closure of the school, the Department has received an inquiry from the school authority regarding the process for school amalgamations.  I can also confirm that Scoil N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta Bhr&iacute;de retains its status with the Department and is participating in the Gaeltacht school recognition scheme, which provides all schools in Gaeltacht language planning areas with the opportunity to achieve recognition as Gaeltacht schools through the implementation of language-based criteria.</p></speech>

I note that the Department has no record of a formal request to approve the closure of the school.  That begs the question of whether an informal request was made.  What contact was there between the Department and the school?  Do I take it at face value that there was absolutely no contact in relation to a request to approve the closure of the school, and that permission must be granted by the Department, even though the Department is not running the school?</p>  <p>  The Minister of State confirmed that the Department received an inquiry from the school authority regarding the process for school amalgamations.  When was that inquiry received?  The fact that this school is in the process of getting recognition within the policy, which is excellent, is most important.  I also stress the importance of the school to the area, which I will not repeat in my limited time.</p>  <p>  I must comment on the strangeness of the fact that an announcement was made on the airwaves and we became aware of the issue that way.  Subsequently, there was a public meeting because of the sense of outrage in the community that the school was being closed in this manner.  Yet, the Department was unaware of it, obviously through no fault of its own.  The Minister of State mentioned official contact and inquiries.  When was the Department put on notice that this school intended to make an announcement that it was closing?  If the Department was not aware of it and permission has to be granted, what is the Department's view of a school board of management behaving in such a manner and making an announcement about an all-Irish school that is in the process of seeking recognition and is so vital to the community?</p>  <p>  The Minister of State has started off well.  I acknowledge that he has given me a clear answer.  Sometimes we do not get clear answers.  I ask him to go into the finer details.  What is the Department's next step in relation to this school, given the importance of it to the area?</p></speech>

Obviously, as I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for Education, I will ensure that the Minister is made aware of the questions the Deputy has raised.  To reiterate the key point, as indicated, the decision-making authority for school closures or amalgamations is the school patron.  No request for the approval of the closure of Scoil N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta Bhr&iacute;de has been received by the Department.  That is all I can clarify for the Deputy regarding the matter.  The additional points raised by the Deputy will be brought to the attention of the Minister.</p></speech>

We were promised at the time that it was a temporary closure due to Covid-19.  It is still closed today.  Why?  There are serious issues with addressing dual diagnosis in this State.  Addiction is often caused by trauma, but so too are serious mental health difficulties.  When they are presented together, people often have nowhere to turn.  Keltoi is a one-of-a-kind facility that has helped people in these situations.  It must be reopened now.  There were warnings that the closure of the unit would have profound consequences.  Has the Minister of State reviewed the impacts of this closure?</p>  <p>  There were established care pathways and clear benefits from the involvement of the unit in these pathways.  We should be opening more units like Keltoi.  We need more trauma centre facilities that provide wraparound services and have high success rates.  We need more facilities that are run by the State.  That is what Deputy Ward and I should be asking for today.  Instead, once again, we are forced to raise the dire need to reopen the Keltoi unit, the only residential facility in the State.</p>  <p>  The Keltoi staff have been redeployed, many to roles where they are no longer required.  They are ready to work and want to return to work.  The services that engage with Keltoi want the unit to reopen.  What is the obstacle to this issue being resolved?  Why can it not be sorted?  People are crying out for help, especially those with addiction and mental health issues.  The Government is failing them as a result of the continued closure of the Keltoi unit.  When will it be reopened?</p></speech>

It is much appreciated.  I am going to bring him on a bit of a journey.  I worked in front-line addiction services for a number of years prior to becoming involved in politics.  I am going to talk about the case of a young mother who sought help for chronic addiction, but it could be anybody.  She entered the service I was working in and was immediately provided with key working.  She was then given counselling and a care plan was developed for her.  Part of that care plan was to get her ready for a drug detox in the Cuan Dara centre in Cherry Orchard.  The patient went to Cuan Dara and completed the detox.  She was then ready to go from Cuan Dara to Keltoi, which was the natural continuing care pathway at the time.</p><p><i>11 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p>She went from Keltoi into supported housing and then into aftercare with Keltoi, which continued to support her.  From the supported housing, she went back into her community, managed to get her children back in her life and became a very productive member of society.  Without Keltoi, however, and that continuum of care, that mother would never have got her children back and may never have got back into the community or become a productive member of society.</p> <p> Keltoi works with complex people who have a significant amount of trauma and may use drugs to self-medicate and to calm their anxious inner world.  It also helps people with dual diagnosis.  The State is absolutely lacking in services for those with dual diagnosis.  A service such as that provided by Keltoi is not available anywhere else in the HSE.  Keltoi has been closed for two years this month and for those two years there has been a gap in the services of the HSE for people looking for rehabilitation and treatment for drug addiction.  We need to get this service open.</p></speech>

I welcome the opportunity to inform the House on the current position relating to the continued closure of the Keltoi rehabilitation unit.  I thank the Deputies for outlining their journey in terms of their work on front-line addiction services and the care plan that was provided.</p>  <p>  From the outset of the pandemic, the Government identified drug treatment and addiction services as essential services.  I acknowledge the leadership and commitment of addiction services, including the HSE, community-based services and voluntary service providers, in ensuring their services operated safely during the pandemic.  There were many innovations in the delivery of drug and alcohol services during Covid-19, especially the use of online services.  The additional resources I am providing for community-based drug and alcohol services and HSE addiction services in 2022 will consolidate these gains.  The Deputies outlined the difficulties relating to dual diagnosis.  We are moving in a direction to try to deal with dual diagnosis.</p>  <p>  I am aware of the constraints faced by residential drug and alcohol treatment services during Covid-19 due to social distancing and other public health measures.  I support the efforts of the HSE and voluntary service providers to restore services to pre-Covid-19 levels.  I have provided an additional &euro;3.3 million to expand capacity in residential treatment services.  In total, this funding will provide an additional 475 treatment episodes in a full year.</p>  <p>  As the Deputies are aware, the Keltoi facility was identified for use as an isolation facility for marginalised and vulnerable people during Covid-19 in CHO 9.  This group of service users were not able to isolate in their own accommodation on public health grounds as they required specific individual care plans.  It is important to state there are significant numbers of homeless and addiction service users in this area, particularly in Dublin north city and county.  The area also has a high migrant health population living in overcrowded and quarantine accommodation.  The HSE has advised there are still significant ongoing demands for isolation in this facility and that it will be maintained as a Covid isolation facility for as long as required.  I welcome the assurance from the HSE.  The continued use of the facility as a Covid-19 response is being reviewed monthly in line with national guidance.</p>  <p>  I recognise it is vital that individuals receiving rehabilitation services from Keltoi are supported to continue their recovery path.  I welcome the fact that Keltoi counselling staff in the HSE Stanhope Centre are continuing to provide appropriate support services to clients under the Keltoi aftercare programme.  I am happy to advise the House that the HSE remains committed to enhancing residential addiction services in this area, including the reopening of the Keltoi facility once it is no longer required as part of the Covid-19 response.  I acknowledge the challenges faced by service providers during Covid-19 and will continue to support them to fully resume services.  I am pleased to inform the House that the Department of Health has provided an additional budget allocation of &euro;10 million in 2022 to maintain public health measures for people who are homeless and to consolidate improvements in healthcare delivery.</p></speech>

Keltoi worked with people in addiction or with serious and complex mental health issues.  He has come in here two years after its closure to tell us it will remain closed.  That is not good enough.  These are people who have serious issues.  Is the Department of Health or the HSE using Covid-19 as a way of closing down Keltoi?  If that is what is being done, it is not acceptable and Sinn F&eacute;in will certainly oppose it.  We should be seeking to provide more services such as Keltoi.</p>  <p>  To give the Minister of State a flavour of the situation, the nephew of a good friend of mine named Vincent died by suicide today.  He is the sixth person to die by suicide in my community in the past four weeks.  He and his family had certain issues.  He had two brothers who died in a similar way.  There are families that need support.  There are families, individuals and communities that are being traumatised.  We need more facilities such as Keltoi but the answer of the Minister of State is to close the only such facility we have.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-08a.527" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1469" speakername="Mark Ward" time="23:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030800062#MMM00400"><p>As I stated, the continuum of care is so important.  If there are gaps in services, vulnerable people will fall through those gaps.  One of the best decisions the HSE made several years ago was to make Cuan Dara to Keltoi a door-to-door service.  Before that, people leaving the detox centre at Cuan Dara may have had to wait six or eight weeks before getting into Keltoi.  The HSE closed that gap because, in the gap, people died.  People left the Cuan Dara detox centre after doing a detox and may have started using drugs again because they did not have a continuum of care, but did so at the levels they were using before detox.  Having been through detox, their tolerance levels were not as high and many people died as a result of overdose.  It is so important to get this facility back open.  I do not say it lightly but it is a matter of life and death.  It is a big gap in the services that are available.  I still do not understand why Keltoi, rather than another facility, was chosen to house marginalised people with Covid.</p></speech>

I acknowledge there are significant and specific challenges facing the homeless and addiction service users in CHO 9, in addition to the migrant health population living in overcrowded accommodation and quarantine accommodation there.  These cohorts require individualised supports to be put in place if they are Covid positive as they cannot isolate in their existing accommodation on public health grounds.</p></speech>

It is essential that the HSE CHO 9 public health department continues to review the use of Keltoi as an isolation facility on a monthly basis to ensure normal services can be resumed as soon as possible.  I recognise the importance and value of the Keltoi unit to the community in CHO 9 and my Department and the HSE remain committed to enhancing the residential addiction services in the area, including the reopening of the Keltoi facility once it is no longer required as part of the Covid-19 response.  I assure the House that I have been advised by the HSE that Keltoi counselling staff based in the HSE Stanhope Centre are continuing to provide appropriate support services to clients under the Keltoi aftercare programme.</p></speech>

I thank him for coming in at such a late hour to deal with this extremely important issue.</p>  <p>It concerns the challenges we face as a result of the war in Ukraine.  As the Minister of State is aware, Ukraine produces 17% of the global supply of grain.  If one looks at both Russia and Ukraine, they account for 30% of all exports in the global market.  Some 42 million tonnes of grain were produced in Ukraine in 2021.</p> <p> We have 272,000 ha which are used for cereal growing in this country.  In 2012, it was 314,500 ha.  There has been a substantial reduction over the past number of years.  What action does the Department intend to take to encourage the farmers of this country to increase the acreage for cereal growing this year?  We have a very short timeframe of just four weeks in real terms.  I know that there are challenges in the supply of seed and fertiliser.  Earlier, I saw a letter to distributors from a major importer outlining that it cannot guarantee supply of fertiliser.  This is a very worrying issue and is something that we need to face up to.</p> <p> This does not relate solely to the supply of grain for the farmers who have dairy and beef herds; it also relates to the supply of grain and wheat for food in this country.  We need to have food security and I ask the Minister of State to respond on this issue at this important time?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-08a.536" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1525" speakername="Holly Cairns" time="23:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030800063#NNN00200"><p>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and the Ceann Comhairle for including this important matter for discussion.  The scale and horror of the Russian invasion of Ukraine is unimaginable.  The conflict will have implications for years to come.  Right now, one of these issues is the impact on global food supplies, especially in the context of grain.  I commend the Minister of State on his actions to practically address the issue by encouraging farmers to grow grain but we are eager to hear how that will work.  Like Deputy Burke, I mention the issues relating to food security in general.  In my first contribution in this House, I focused on food security.  Soon afterwards, in the early days of the pandemic, I focused on it again with the then Minister for Agriculture, Food and Marine, Deputy Creed.  It is clear that the Department did not learn from that crisis but perhaps it will learn from this one.</p>  <p>  Despite having such an extensive agriculture sector, we still rely very heavily on food imports.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine's policies and choice of markets have forced farmers into a small number of areas, which has very much reduced the diversity of our produce and, ultimately, reduced our resilience.  Prior to the crisis in Ukraine, there was already a real need to shift away from producing feed grain and to scale up the production of food grain for direct human consumption.  There is a real policy need to scale up local and indigenous nature-friendly food production.  Increased production of cereals, pulses, fruit and vegetables would make Irish agriculture more environmentally friendly, would support Irish producers and, crucially, would improve our food security and sovereignty.</p>  <p>  Pivoting quickly to tillage would be a challenge for the sector, but it needs to happen now if we are to have a grain harvest next year, because , obviously, there are many unknowns.  Existing tillage farmers often face price volatility and unfair trading practices.  As a result, growers will need support.  Can the Minister of State outline the support the Department will be offering and the steps it will be taking to underpin that support?</p>  <p>  It seems as though it may have, but has the situation prompted a shift in the thinking of Minister of State, of the senior Minister, Deputy McConalogue, and of the Department towards ensuring food security?  Deputy Burke mentioned fertiliser.  Are we to move away from reliance on that?</p></speech>

The illegal invasion of Ukraine places the people of Ukraine and the dreadful plight the currently face foremost in our minds.  The related grain and fertiliser supply issues have led to discussions across Europe on the issue of food security and the associated disruptions to supply lines.</p>  <p>  These issue were discussed by EU agriculture ministers at an extraordinary AGRIFISH Council meeting last week.  An appropriate response is being considered by the European Commission.  On the back of that, we expect some proposals to support the agrifood sector from the Commission in the coming days.  We also expect that we will continue to benefit from the free movement of food products and that we will continue to import and export food products within the EU.  A contingency plan was developed at EU level during the Covid-19 crisis to ensure that EU citizens would not face food shortages during crises.  A key part of this plan was the establishment of a European food security preparedness and response mechanism to ensure exchange of information and strengthened co-ordination on supply chains.  Ireland will be an active participant in this mechanism and will be working with EU colleagues to ensure a common response.  The first meeting of that group overseeing the mechanism will take place tomorrow, 9 March.  The purpose of the meeting is to specifically discuss the food security impact of the energy and input price increases and of the situation in Ukraine.  At national level, we have established a rapid response team within the Department to actively monitor the impact on agrifood supply chains and inflationary pressures arising from the developing situation in Ukraine.</p>  <p>  A comprehensive information pack for farmers and their advisers on soils, nutrients and fertilisers has been put together by Teagasc in conjunction with my Department.  A series of 20 fact sheets were made available at the start of this year on how to optimise the use of nutrients and to help farmers address the challenge of maintaining their farm outputs in the face of rising fertiliser costs and reduced availability.  We met with the farm bodies this evening to discuss all possible options available to manage disruptions to the feed supply chain.  Officials from the rapid response team have already begun engaging with all parts of the feed and fertiliser industry and we will be meeting them at ministerial level also in the coming days.  A range of issues were discussed at this evening's meeting, with the focus very much centred on feed, fertiliser and fuel.</p>  <p>  We cannot look at any part of this crisis of spiralling input costs in isolation.  Every option has to be on the table to ensure that our farm systems are robust and prepared for the challenges in the year ahead.  That is why we have agreed to form a group headed by Teagasc, but including all stakeholders, to focus on potential responses.  Among those is the possibility of asking farmers, particularly tillage farmers, to grow more crops, in parts of the country where that is suitable.  That measure will not be compulsory.  Obviously, different parts of the country have different strengths in respect of their agricultural activity.  Some areas have better ability to grow tillage crops, others grass and others again forage crops, which could be used by out-wintering cattle in order to remove some of the pressure in the context of demand for silage next winter.</p>  <p>  On tillage, we are fortunate that the success of higher-yielding winter-sown crops is estimated to be greater for the coming harvest due to favourable autumn planting conditions.  We are also very aware of the compressed timeline we have in the six- to eight-week window for spring crop establishment.  Before we decide on specific response measures, however, it is important that we engage with all stakeholders to determine the availability of the inputs required, such as those relating to seed and fertiliser, farm equipment and grain-handling capacity.  There are options in the context of forage crops, the management of silage production and the production of maize or beet.  There are many sensible things we can do from an agronomy perspective in order to ensure our systems are as robust as possible.</p>  <p>  The implications of anything we do require careful consideration.  There is no one solution to the issues we face.  We have a diverse farming system and we will need to rely on all aspects in the weeks and months ahead.</p></speech>

I agree that there is a challenge as to the lack of clarity on the availability of seed and, in particular, fertiliser.  The other issue of course is the cost of fuel.</p>  <p>  There is also further challenge regarding the rotation cycle which tillage farmers are working on with Teagasc, and whether there can be a deviation from that three-year cycle for crops on foot of the changes that have occurred.  I ask that this be taken into account in the advice that will be offered over the next four weeks.  The priority then, basically, is to try to increase the acreage by encouraging farmers to do this and to make all of the necessary supports available in order that we can get more people on board to grow cereal crops this year.</p></speech>

He mentioned a little bit about feed and fuel, and that is crucial for the whole sector.  Seeds will play a pivotal role in the process, and the Minister of State talked about the availability of seeds to grow crops.  We are supposed to declare an interest when we talk about particular matters in the House .  My family owns a small seed company.  My mother started the company because seeds are fundamental to food.  Without seeds, we simply do not have any food, be it plant- or animal-based.  We need to secure seeds not only for this year but for future harvests.  If we are concerned about the import of wheat at the moment then I am wondering if the Department is giving the same consideration to the concern around the importation of seed for wheat.  Are there plans to save the seed from the crops that will be harvested this year and in the years that follow as well?</p> <p>Has that been a consideration of the Department so far?  We have seen figures for how much wheat we import and how much of that comes from Ukraine and Russia.  Have we done the same type of analysis of seed imports as well and where they are from globally?  I am not aware of them.</p></speech>

To respond to Deputy Colm Burke regarding the EU response and the deviation in crop rotation, these issues are being looked at and the potential response to them will be worked through.  Everything is being examined at EU level.  There is also the area of set-aside being talked about, as well as the ecological focus areas, EFAs.  If they could be ploughed again, that would, over a period and over a large area of the country, give us considerable extra ground.  These are all issues that officials in the Department and the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, and the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, and I are continuing to engage with at European level to try to get maximum flexibility there for an appropriate response in that regard.  I hope to have more clarity on that and the type of supports package that might be in place from the EU in the near future, even in the coming days.</p>  <p>  Deputy Cairns raised points regarding seed, and Deputy Colm Burke raised the point about the amount of grain that is produced by Ukraine and Russia.  While we do not necessarily import that directly or purchase it from them, we are part of the global food supply chain and if that 20% to 30% of grain is not produced because the war is likely to impact on that, it will have an overall impact on world food supply chains.  What we want to do is ensure that our system in Ireland is as robust as possible.  The points Deputy Cairns highlighted are valid in terms of ensuring not just the immediate focus of the next six to eight weeks of the spring crop planting season but also that we look at the years into the future, because the impacts of this conflict will be there for some time into the future.  However, we have a very resilient and robust agriculture sector.  Farmers are very good at working together, and have done so in the past.  With the support of the Government, the Department and the farming organisations we met this evening, we will work together across all the industry, which has a key role to play here, to ensure we support the farmers to do what needs to be done to avoid a crisis.  We do not have a crisis in food security right now and we do not have a feed crisis, but we want to make sure we do not have one next winter.  That is why we must use the time we have now, the best available to us, to support farmers to do what needs to be done to secure the food supply chain into the future.</p></speech>
