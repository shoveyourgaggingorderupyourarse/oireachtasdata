T&aacute; s&eacute; deich mbliana anois &oacute; cuireadh deireadh le daonlathas taobh istigh de bhord &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  Sin deich mbliana &oacute; rinne Rialtas Fhine Gael agus P&aacute;irt&iacute; an Lucht Oibre cinneadh deireadh a chur le toghch&aacute;in do bhord &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  Le bheith f&eacute;ar&aacute;ilte, d&uacute;irt an tAire St&aacute;it &eacute; f&eacute;in, a ph&aacute;irt&iacute; agus a cheannaire go raibh siad tiomanta go mbeadh toghch&aacute;in ann do bhord &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta ar&iacute;s.  Seo &aacute;bhar ar a bhfuil b&eacute;im curtha ag Sinn F&eacute;in le blianta beaga anuas.  T&aacute; reachta&iacute;ocht foilsithe againn, a chuir muid os comhair an T&iacute; seo blianta &oacute; shin, agus d&eacute;anfaimid ar&iacute;s &eacute; muna bhfuil an Rialtas seo s&aacute;sta feidhmi&uacute; air seo.  T&aacute; s&eacute; seo pr&aacute;inneach.  Gheall an Taoiseach le linn an olltoghch&aacute;in go mbeadh athbhreithni&uacute; ar strucht&uacute;r, feidhmi&uacute;ch&aacute;in agus rialachais &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta agus go mbeadh pr&oacute;iseas roghn&uacute;ch&aacute;in agus toghch&aacute;in don bhord ina thosa&iacute;ocht don Rialtas seo.  Mar a d&uacute;irt an Teachta Farrell, seo an dara huair anois n&aacute;r chuir aon duine isteach ar an gcom&oacute;rtas le hathbhreithni&uacute; ar thoghch&aacute;n &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  Caithfimid bogadh ar aghaidh.  T&aacute; s&eacute; deich mbliana &oacute; rinneadh an scoilt sin idir mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus an bord at&aacute; ag feidhmi&uacute; ar son na Gaeltachta.  &Oacute; tharla nach bhfuil duine ar bith ann le hathbhreithni&uacute; a dh&eacute;anamh ar thoghch&aacute;in &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, caid&eacute; an plean at&aacute; ag an Rialtas anois?  N&iacute;l dabht ar bith gur ceist daonlathais &iacute; seo.  I mo thuairim, agus i dtuairim Shinn F&eacute;in, n&iacute;l athbhreithni&uacute; de dh&iacute;th.  Go simpl&iacute;, caithfidh an Rialtas na toghch&aacute;in seo a chur ar bun ar&iacute;s agus &eacute; a dh&eacute;anamh lom l&aacute;ithreach.  C&eacute;im siar a bh&iacute; sa chinneadh f&aacute;il r&eacute;idh leis na toghch&aacute;in in 2012 agus cailleadh an nasc sin idir lucht v&oacute;t&aacute;la na Gaeltachta agus na daoine a dh&eacute;anann na cinnt&iacute;.  T&aacute; tionchar aige seo n&iacute;os faide n&aacute; &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  T&aacute; tionchar aige ar thodhcha&iacute; na Gaeltachta &iacute; f&eacute;in.  D&rsquo;aontaigh Fianna F&aacute;il linn ag an am in 2012 ach t&aacute; siad sa Rialtas anois le dh&aacute; bhliain agus n&iacute;l aon rud d&eacute;anta f&aacute; dtaobh de seo.  An gcuirfidh an tAire St&aacute;it an pr&oacute;iseas i mbun sa d&oacute;igh is go mbeidh toghch&aacute;in ann ar&iacute;s do bhord &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta?</p></speech>

Where is Paul Reid?  I know there are patients who are not discharged on time.  They have not been met to be discharged.  What is the cost to the insurance company?  I want an audit done to see how many patients are in hospital in a private capacity.  Patients are admitted for tests that can easily be done on a day-care basis and they are in the hospital for four days.</p>  <p>  I also want the bullying of nurses in the hospital to be addressed.  How many nurses have left that hospital due to bullying by management?  The number of nurses we have lost from that hospital is unbelievable.  I have asked, not only on this occasion but on many occasions, for the management to step down.  It failed us before and during Covid and it is failing us now.  It is failing the front-line workers in this hospital.</p></speech>

For a while, I was afraid that the Chief Whip would be responding on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly.  Is the Minister back in the country?  It is good to know that he is, because while he was away, overcrowding in Limerick reached a new record level.  It reached a record for Limerick and then the next day, it reached a national record.  I raised the issue of the necessity of some kind of an independent review with the Taoiseach.  He seemed to take the idea on board and said he would refer it to the HSE and the Minister for Health.</p>  <p>  I, along with my Independent colleagues from the region, have raised this matter to ascertain what is happening with this independent review.  Will we proceed with it?  I do not have the answers.  I know what the problems are and, undoubtedly, the Minister of State does too.  It is very obvious.  We have massive overcrowding in Limerick and have had for a long time.  We were told that the new 96-bed unit would solve the problem with overcrowding-----</p></speech>

The problem is historic.  The new 96-bed unit is supposed to be there.  That sod was turned by the then Minister, Mary Harney, 20 bliain &oacute; shin.  The HSE is a failure.  It has badly failed Limerick people and the people of north Tipperary.</p>  <p>  I salute Independent councillor S&eacute;amie Morris on the work he does and the other people of Nenagh who resisted the closure of the accident and emergency units in Nenagh and in St. John's Hospital.  We are told this will be a centre of excellence in Limerick, but it is chaotic and people have been left on trolleys.  The trolley crisis is unimaginable there and there is stress and trauma on staff, families and everybody else.  We need a whole sea change here.  We need a clean-out of management and a re-evaluation.  We need to reopen St. John's and the perfect unit in Nenagh.</p>  <p>  People are shouting now.  Deputy Kelly made his career out of the closure of Nenagh.  Deputy Lowry supported it at the time and here we are.  People have been denuded of the services.  We do not have mental health beds in County Tipperary.  The Minister of State has responsibility for mental health.  We have to go either to Ennis or Kilkenny.</p></speech>

It is not the first time any of them has raised this.  We hear it on a consistent basis.  I acknowledge the distress that overcrowded emergency Departments cause to patients, their families and front-line staff working in very challenging conditions in hospitals throughout the country.</p> <p>The health sector is facing significant challenges in providing emergency care over the winter period while also managing the demands of Covid-19.</p> <p> The emergency department in Limerick is one of the busiest in the country, with over 76,000 attendances in 2021, which was up 16% compared to 2020 and up 7% compared to 2019.   However, the numbers of patients waiting on trolleys for admission in University Hospital Limerick, UHL, in 2021 was 4.7% lower than in 2020 and 35% lower than in 2019.  I appreciate that this is cold comfort to anyone who is on a trolley.  The University of Limerick Hospitals Group has reported that it is continuing to deal with high volumes of patients attending the emergency department at UHL.  This pattern has been sustained over a number of months and is being replicated around the country.  UHL is working to ensure care is prioritised for the sickest patients.  As part of its escalation plan, additional ward rounds, accelerated discharges and identification of patients for transfer to UL model 2 hospitals are under way.  Surge capacity has been opened to manage the extremely high levels of activity.</p> <p> There has been, and continues to be, substantial investment in UHL and the wider hospital group in recent years to address capacity issues.  For example, a new emergency department opened in 2017.  Since the start of 2020, 98 new beds have opened at UHL.  This included the 60-bed modular ward block, which became operational in November 2020.  It was established to provide a rapid-build interim solution to begin to address the bed capacity issues at UHL and improve patient flow.  This also included a 24 single-room bed block, which functions as a haematology oncology unit, and a temporary 14-bed single room block, which has been designated for confirmed and suspected Covid-19 patients.  These were initiated in May 2020 under the national action plan in response to Covid-19.</p> <p> The winter plan for 2021-22 was published on 15 November and builds on the significant investment in last year&rsquo;s winter plan.  It aims to address the significant combined challenges faced by the health service over the winter period and recognises that a whole system response is required across primary, community and acute care.  The scale of the challenges and demands faced by our health system requires both a plan and an associated system of governance and accountability.  This system includes leadership, governance and operations to reflect the scale of the challenges faced and investments provided.  The winter plan sets out the national, area and site level leadership and governance arrangements that are in place.</p> <p> On the question of a review of UHL, the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, is closely monitoring the overcrowding situation in a number of hospitals, including at Limerick over the past number of weeks.  It has also had recent correspondence with the hospital group CEO regarding its evaluation of the current factors influencing crowding in the emergency department.  HIQA has also written to HSE senior management to highlight its intention to initiate inspections under the national standards for safer and better healthcare.</p> <p> The matter of performance in hospital emergency departments is under constant review by the Department through ongoing engagement with the HSE.  The Department will continue to monitor the situation closely.  On the question of a review at UHL, HIQA is closely monitoring the overcrowding situation in a number of hospitals and there are no further details in the response from the Minister for Health.</p></speech>

There is no such thing as an independent review of the HSE because it is the HSE auditing itself.  This goes for every case that we have had in the High Court and everything; it is the HSE investigating itself.  Therefore, that is not an independent review.  These are people who are within the HSE sector and are paid by the Department.  They are nominated by the Ministers to go on these reviews and they are investigating themselves.  I am sorry, but that is not a review.</p>  <p>  The hospital has introduced a three-minute assessment for a patient to be assessed.  If a patient gets an extra minute, the management comes down and chastises the person who is trying to look after a patient.  That is not right, either.</p>  <p>  The management of UHL has to step down and let a new management in that will bring the morale of the hospital up.  It is not front-line workers who are the problem; it is the management.</p></speech>

HIQA has a certain remit and I do not think it has the remit to recommend that model 2 hospitals be upgraded to model 3 hospitals.  HIQA does not have a remit to look at the population, for example, if there is population growth or if the population of a region is greater than anticipated when originally planning hospital capacity.  While I welcome the fact that HIQA is closely looking at this, I have two questions.</p>  <p>  First, will the correspondence the Minister of State referred to be published?  I do not think any of us want to go through the jig of looking for it through Freedom of Information.  Ultimately, there has to be accountability by the Government, the permanent Government, the HSE and HIQA, through the delivery of health services in this country to democratically elected representatives.  Can we see that correspondence?</p>  <p>  Second, is the idea of a review no longer being considered?  If that is the case, I am very disappointed.  While I respect the work that HIQA is doing, its remit is limited.</p></speech>

She was hounded out of office by Deputy Kelly and others who attacked her at the time.  We have to go back and revisit and open Nenagh accident and emergency department, which was a perfect unit.  We also have to open St. John's accident and emergency department again as an interim solution until we get a new building that is capable of dealing with the number of patients from north Tipperary, Limerick, Clare and beyond.  South Tipperary General Hospital has an overflow of people coming in now because they cannot get into Limerick and they are afraid to go there because of the trolley crisis.  Many things are wrong.  </p>  <p>  HIQA investing this is a pure joke.  It has written to the management to tell it is coming in to investigate, yet it goes into nursing homes with no prior notice, inspecting them and closing them down.  This charade of the HSE has to be disbanded.  We have to open up the perfect accident and emergency units that were in Nenagh and St. John's Hospital.</p></speech>

I know from dealing with nursing homes, community nursing units and community hospitals throughout the country, and from any dealings I have had with HIQA, that it is an independent body.</p>  <p>  The 2018 health service capacity review was clear on the need for a major investment in additional capacity in both acute hospitals and the community, combined with a wide-scale reform of the manner and the location of where health services are provided.</p>  <p>  I will follow up today on Deputy McNamara's two questions - about the correspondence being published and a review being considered - to try to get him a substantial answer.  I am aware that in relation to the question of the review of UHL, HIQA is closely monitoring the overcrowding situation in a number of hospitals, including Limerick over the past number of weeks and has had recent correspondence with the hospital group CEO regarding its evaluation of the current factors influencing crowding in the emergency department.  I will bring the Deputies' concerns to the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-02-09a.31" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1549" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="09:32:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020900005#C00600"><p>First of all, I welcome the focus on consumers this week.  The Government is right to look both at short-term and, vitally, long-term solutions to this problem.  One of the areas in which we have been very negligent is that we have not confronted the rip-off that many larger companies carry out on consumers by making it difficult for them to find best value.  It is typically the older and less tech-savvy people who are the vulnerable ones being exploited by companies through these practices.  Many of those companies are using sophisticated big data to upsell and play on consumers' weaknesses to try to improve their position.</p>  <p>  I am calling for four simple measures that will make a huge difference to consumers.  The first is that they should be informed of the renewal date in good time.  That happens in motor insurance but it does not happen in mobile, television, broadband, financial contracts or utility services.  We need to change that.</p>  <p>  We also need to introduce a provision whereby a simple quick response, QR, code is on the bill that a person gets so that they can see not only their use pattern but also the billing charges thereon.  They can then go to comparison sites and see exactly where they can get better value, given their position and pattern of consumption.</p>  <p>  The third thing is that a code of practice need to be introduced by the regulators whereby there can be a frictionless response to consumers who want to change their contract.  Now, that attempt to make a change is frustrated by an inability to make telephone contact and to get responses in a timely manner.</p> <p>This is all with the purpose of wearing consumers down so that they do not pursue their entitlements.</p> <p> Finally, I ask that the electricity companies activate the 700,000 smart meters that are in people's homes to allow them to use off-peak and renewable energy and so bring down their bills.  All of these rules would be beneficial to consumers but to make them effective we need to ensure the regulators in each case have the power to adjudicate finally on any complaints by consumers that these new rules are not being applied.</p> <p> The reality is that there is better value to be had but companies are putting barriers in the way of consumers.  My colleague, Senator Garret Ahearn, did an exercise and found that he saved more than &euro;2,000 by simply looking to different broadband, telephone, television, car insurance and health insurance providers.  We should make it easy for people to do that and make those comparisons.  At times it is almost impossible.  For example it is almost impossible for an ordinary consumer to compare their health insurance with what might be available elsewhere.  With simple QR codes and sophisticated comparison sites that could be possible for consumers.</p> <p> I realise that the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, is not the responsible Minister.  I will take it up with the Minister of State, Deputy Troy, who I think will be in the House later in the day.  I would like to convey my strong view that this is an opportunity to make big changes for the long-term benefit of consumers.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-02-09a.33" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1614" speakername="Mary Butler" time="09:42:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020900006#D00200"><p>I thank Deputy Bruton for raising this important issue.  I agree with what he has said.  The recent rises in prices are driven by a number of factors and it is vital that all drivers of price increases are addressed.  We have to make sure that we have, at least, transparent and competitive markets.  The first point he made about consumers being informed of the renewal date is the most sensible thing I have heard in a long time because what happens is that people agree a deal with a service provider for 12 months but unfortunately that date can expire without them being informed.  We are, as he said, always informed in regard to car insurance renewal so that is a very practical suggestion.  Information is key, especially for consumers who too often are presented with details about prices and offerings that make it too difficult for them to compare and ensure they are getting the right service or product offering at the best price.</p>  <p>  The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has broad responsibilities for the protection of consumers' rights and ensuring competition.  Like everybody in the House, the Minister of State for trade promotion, digital and company regulations, Deputy Troy, and I have a deep interest in all initiatives which are ultimately to the benefit of consumers.  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, which falls under the remit of the Minister of State, Deputy Troy, has a specific role under legislation to provide personal finance information and education to consumers, in order to promote financial resilience and support overall financial well-being.  The CCPC uses its knowledge, skills and statutory powers to promote competition and enhance consumer welfare.  To this end the CCPC has developed, maintained and actively promotes a suite of online comparison tools for customers across a range of financial products including current accounts, regular savings accounts, mortgages and credit cards.  Another feature of the CCPC's money tools is the various calculators - the mortgage calculator, the extra mortgage payments calculator, the spending calculator and the budget planner.  By using these calculators, consumers can see how much money they could potentially save.  The CCPC also offers a guide on how to switch gas and electricity providers.  The money tools facility was created to allow consumers to compare quickly and easily features across all of the major financial providers.  All of its comparison facilities and consumer information are independently provided to help consumers to find the options that best suit their needs.  </p>  <p>  Clearly, the current levels of inflation are a cause for concern.  The Government has already taken action, and will take more actions, to assist people.  I recognise that some bills, such as energy bills, are increasing regardless of what provider a customer is with.  Of course expanding and protecting consumer rights is also important.  I understand that the T&aacute;naiste intends to go to the Government shortly to publish a consumer rights Bill, which will be the biggest reform of consumer rights legislation in more than 40 years.  The Bill will address gaps in existing legislation, consolidate the legislation, make consumer law clearer for traders and consumers and introduce new provisions on contracts for the sale of goods and contracts for the supply of digital content and digital services.  For example, downloads and streaming will be subject to similar laws as apply to digital content in physical form.  The proposed Bill will also improve the enforcement of consumer rights law and increase the enforcement powers of the CCPC.  The debate on this legislation, when introduced, might be a great opportunity to have further discussion on the four points the Deputy raised: the need to be informed of the renewal date, to include a QR code on each bill, for regulators to introduce a code of practice and - the Deputy made a valid point in regard to electricity - to activate smart meters so that people can use electricity at off-peak times.  All of these sensible proposals should be taken on board.</p></speech>

As politicians, we sometimes recognise things that need to change but our good intentions get caught up in the tangled affairs of bringing new legislation forward.  I would like to see some of these small and simple changes prioritised and pressure put on the drafting of legislation to bring forward amendments.  Those amendments need to commence preparation today if a Bill is to be passed in the House over the next four or five months.  That is the reality.  I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, to convey to the Minister of State, Deputy Troy, a request that he have his officials start drafting amendments now, so that we can consider how this could be done.  I recognise the CCPC's work but the reality is that it offers consumers an umbrella in the midst of a storm when we all know the umbrella will double in on itself unless the opportunity is there, with these companies, to facilitate the changes that are to be made.  I also recognise that updating our consumer law to include the digital world is welcome.  There are features that have emerged from the digital power of companies that we have not rectified.  The reality is that fewer and fewer of these large companies have any front-facing, customer-facing staff who can be approached to make these changes.  They operate remote and hidden systems designed to suck in customers but then lock them in.  That is not a market operating fairly.  My request to the Minister of State is not only to offer support for the principle here, but also to seek an instruction that amendments should now be drafted in order to make this a reality when we come to debate the substance in a couple of months.</p></speech>

The comment he has made about being prepared represents a sensible approach.  It will be welcome when this debate is being held in the D&aacute;il.  As we all know, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities provides a list of electricity and gas providers with some helpful hints and tips on switching.  However, I am conscious that as Deputy Bruton mentioned in his opening statement, many older people are not tech-savvy, are not online and have not grown up in that environment, and therefore would find it impossible to consider switching.  We find many people stay with the same provider all their lives and do not switch.  That is an area on which there needs to be a special focus.  The point the Deputy makes on being informed of a renewal date is important.  We know that opting to go paperless can save 10% off electricity bills, but then the date for renewal might fall in September or October and the consumer might not realise this until the bill comes in November or December.  I will take up all the issues with the Minister of State, Deputy Troy.</p></speech>

According to <i>daft.ie</i>, the rent increases for quarter 4 of last year, when annualised, come in at more than 10%.  In some parts of the country, the increase is more than 20%.  This underlines the need for a national rent freeze, at the minimum, if not for legislation to actually cut rent.  It also raises the need to raise the wages of working people.  The Government, which refuses to legislate for even a national rent freeze, is the same Government that has, in effect, cut the wages of the lowest paid workers in the State.  The national minimum wage increased by 2.9% on 1 January, a time when inflation stood at 5.5%.  The Government has cut the wages of the lowest paid workers in the State.<br /><br />We are bringing forward the motion for two key reasons.  The first is the cost-of-living crisis and how it impacts the low paid.  How in the hell is someone meant to survive on &euro;10.50 an hour in the current climate?  As it was put to me at the weekend, this is not a cost-of-living crisis; it is a cost-of-survival crisis.  We are also bringing forward the motion to benefit all workers.  We believe that all workers deserve and need a pay rise at this time.  If the minimum wage is the floor below which wages are not meant to fall, our thinking is that if the floor is raised, there will be the knock-on effect of an upward pressure on the wages of all workers.  We are unashamedly introducing the motion for those reasons.<br /><br />Who are the minimum wage and low-paid workers in this country?  Minimum wage workers are not a tiny minority of the workforce.  They comprise nearly 10% of the workforce now.  They are not, in the main, part-time workers or workers who do a bit of work for a few bob.  Some 68% of minimum wage workers now work full time.  It is an educated workforce.  Nearly 50% of workers on minimum wage have been to third level.  That is the highest percentage of any country in the EU.  It is a higher percentage than in the UK.<br /><br />Of course, many workers earn just above the minimum wage.  The median wage in the State, which is two thirds of the average, stands at &euro;11.86 an hour.  Some 50% of hospitality workers are at or below that level.  Some 33% of retail workers are at or below that level, as are 15% of healthcare workers.  Those are the very workers who got this country through the pandemic and showed the value of their work to society but who now find their wages do not match that value whatsoever.  These are disproportionately women workers and young workers.  Some 22.7% of women workers are low paid.  Some 33.9% of young workers are low paid.  In both those cases, the figures are above the European average.  They are being hit hard.  Electricity bills are up by &euro;800 this year.  The cost of groceries has increased by &euro;800 annually.  The cost of petrol is up by &euro;500 this year.  Between those three items alone, before one even gets into the cost of rent, prices have increased by &euro;2,000.  Someone earning &euro;20,000, &euro;21,000, &euro;22,000 or &euro;23,000 has, in effect, had 10% knocked off their purchasing power.  If the official rate of inflation is 5% or 5.5%, what is it for the low paid who have no option but to buy these necessities even though prices are increasing at a rapid rate?  The real rate of inflation for the low paid is double or triple the official rate.<br /><br />The Taoiseach stood up in the D&aacute;il yesterday and gave us the usual line.  He said Ireland pays the second highest national minimum wage in the European Union.  Let us look a little closer at that.  When purchasing power and can buy for your buck are taken into account, Ireland is not in second, third or fourth place.  It is considerably further down the list in seventh, and heading downward.  Last year, the minimum wage was raised by 1% whereas the EU average was four times that.  This year, the minimum wage will increase by less than 3%.  The EU average is more than double that at 6%.  In fact, in Germany the minimum wage is currently undergoing a staggered increase of 25%.<br /><br />This is not just about the low paid.  If we raise the floor, there will be knock-on increases and we want to see that.  The Taoiseach said yesterday that he is okay with wage rises provided they are linked to productivity.  I would like to ask the him a question but for now I will ask it of the Minister of State.  Why, between 2010 and 2020, did the Minister of State and his colleagues from Fine Gael stand over big increases in productivity without wage rises but are now insisting that wage rises can only happen if there are increases in productivity?  Between 2010 and 2020, hourly pay went up by 15.44% and GNI went up by 61.2%.  Annual wages increased by less than 0.5%.  The key figure with regard to productivity is unit labour cost which, between 2015 and 2020, was down by 6% and reached a record low in quarter 3 of 2020.  There is one law for the bosses and another for the workers.  If productivity increases without wage increases, that is fine, but there can be no wage increases without productivity increases.  What hypocrisy.  It really shows where Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael stand when it comes to class politics.<br /><br />The Taoiseach also raised the prospect of a wage price spiral.  He gave us the example of the 1970s and in doing so recycled an old Thatcherite myth.  Which country has had perhaps the biggest debate about minimum wages in the past five years?  It is the United States, which introduced minimum wages citywide, statewide and so on.  For every $1 increase in the wage of a worker in McDonalds, there was a 2 cent increase in the cost of a burger.  A rise in wages cuts profits and does not automatically lead to a rise in prices if the bosses, who can afford to do so, absorb the increase.  <br /><br />Mr. Duncan Graham of Retail Excellence Ireland was on the radio this morning.  It is a pity there is not more excellence in the wages paid by some of the people who operate alongside, and with, Retail Excellence Ireland.  The most recently recorded annual profits for Musgraves, which operates Centra and SuperValu, were &euro;98 million.  Can they not afford to pay workers &euro;15 an hour?  If there are smaller employers who say they cannot afford it, we ask them to open their books and prove it.  If they cannot, they should be topped up from a levy paid by the bigger employers who can well afford such an increase.<br /><br />It seems that the Government has not tabled an amendment to the motion.  The Minister of State might clarify whether the Government is opposing the motion or is using a cynical tactic it has often used to deal with motions in recent times, that is, allowing the motion to go thorough and then quietly ignoring it.  I call on the Government to own its position on this issue.  If the Government is for the motion, it should vote for it and implement it.  If it is against, the Government should have the guts to vote against it.  There should be no more of the cynical tactics we have seen in recent weeks.<br /><br />Sinn F&eacute;in and Labour have proposed amendments to the motion that look for a timeframe for the implementation of a living wage rate of &euro;12.90 per hpur.  That amount would represent a step forward for low-paid workers.  We support both amendments.  We would make the point that the &euro;12.90 living wage report was issued before the current wave of inflation and even in that report, the author made the point that it would be very difficult for a worker living in Dublin to pay rent on that wage.  It is a bit out of date and I think &euro;15 is now the key figure.  That said, &euro;12.90 would represent a step forward and we will support that proposal.<br /><br />We have no faith in the Government on this issue.  We will exert pressure on the Government but workers must exert their own pressure.  In the UK, the Unite trade union has won cost-of-living pay increases or better in 25 workplaces by taking industrial action or threatening to take industrial action.  That is a good, positive example and one that needs to be followed by workers in this country. </blockquote></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-02-09a.39" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1628" speakername="Paul Murphy" time="10:02:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020900008#G00200"><p>I thank Deputy Barry for bringing the motion forward.  At the centre of this debate is one unassailable fact, which is not debatable: the national minimum wage in this country is a poverty wage.  A full-time worker earning the minimum wage gets only &euro;21,000 a year.  That is &euro;5,000 a year less than the independently assessed minimum income needed for an acceptable standard of living for an individual without children.  That is an unassailable fact the Government stands over, which results in minimum wage workers, even those without children, living in poverty.  Does the Government think it is acceptable in 21st-century Ireland, a country with immense wealth and some of the most productive workers in the world, that a full-time job is not enough to lift someone out of poverty?  Yesterday, in response to questions on this issue, the Taoiseach said that the answer to poverty and deprivation is work, but these people are working.  They are not unemployed; they are working hard and they are working full time, but they are in poverty.  A worker works a full week and is not able to pay the bills.  The essence of this point is that it is time to lift the minimum wage to a real living wage for all.  No worker should be left in poverty and that means fighting for a &euro;15 an hour minimum wage.</p><p>In this debate, there will be, as there are in public, many myths and half ideas spun about minimum wage workers.  These are stories told to try to justify the payment of poverty wages.  To listen to those who oppose increases in the minimum wage, anyone would have the impression that minimum wage workers are all young, part-time workers earning a little pocket money for the weekend.  That would not justify paying poverty wages, but it is not even true.  Two thirds of those on the minimum wage are full-time workers with 90% in permanent positions.  We have the most educated minimum wage workers in Europe.  These are hard-working people doing essential work and trying to make a living.  They deserve a decent raise.</p><p>The German Government, under pressure, has just announced that it will increase the minimum wage to &euro;12 an hour this year.  If the Government will not agree with our demand for &euro;15 an hour, will it at least agree to &euro;12 an hour, which would be at about the level of the real increase in inflation for those who are on low incomes?  One in four workers in Ireland earn less than &euro;12 an hour.  That includes significant numbers of workers in childcare, retail and hospitality, precisely those people who were clapped by the Government over the past two years.  They do not want applause; they want respect and a decent wage.  In the US, the Fight for $15 campaign won the phasing in of a $15 minimum wage in a number of different states.  We need a similar movement here to fight for a &euro;15 an hour minimum wage.</p><p>When this is discussed, many Deputies baulk at the idea of &euro;15 an hour.  They suggest it is an unreasonably high figure, but the reality is &euro;15 an hour amounts to &euro;2,500 a month or &euro;30,000 a year for a full-time worker.  Ireland is a wealthy country.  There is no reason a full-time worker should earn less than &euro;30,000.  Let us consider rental rates.  A one-bedroom apartment in Dublin is &euro;1,500 a month.  How could anyone be expected to live a decent life and raise a family on less than &euro;2,500 a month?  The Taoiseach, who presumably opposes a &euro;15 an hour minimum wage, earns &euro;215,000 a year, while a minimum wage worker earns 10% of that or &euro;21,000.  That is simply not right.  How can earning wages ten times those of an ordinary worker be justified?  Does the Taoiseach and the Government think that is fair?  For example, Mr. Paul Reid, head of the HSE, is earning 20 times the wage of a minimum wage cleaner.  We need to raise the wages of the low paid and cut them for the tiny few at the very top.</p><p>Rents continue to go through the roof.  According to the latest <i>daft.ie</i>rental price report, in south County Dublin, for example, the average rent for a one-bedroom apartment is now &euro;1,549 and that for a three-bedroom house is &euro;2,290.  Rents are going up by 5% or 10% throughout the country and energy bills went up by 40% or more, yet the minimum wage went up by less than 3%.  That is a cut in real income for the low paid in this country.  While Deputies received pay rise after pay rise, and one senior official recently received an &euro;81,000 raise, low-paid workers are expected to make do with less.  If Deputies' wages were linked to the minimum wage, we would have seen a proper increase a long time ago.  </p><p>This also takes place in the context of the debate on the cost-of-living crisis.  It should be recalled that when we raised this issue last year the Government told us that the price hikes were transitory.  In October, in our first motion about this crisis in this House, and again in December, we warned that anything less than direct State intervention, using powers available to the Government, would not address the crippling rise in energy and heating costs.  The Government then announced the tiny subsidy of &euro;100 for electricity consumers.  It is trying desperately to distance itself from the comments of the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Sean Fleming, about shopping around, but the truth is that is the Government programme.  Members should read the amendment that was tabled to gut our motion on the energy prices crisis.  The bottom line point of the Government is that the market will provide.  Again and again, in answer to parliamentary questions and in answers in the House, the Government has put forward the idea that people need to go and shop around.  The reality is the Government is ideologically opposed to imposing regulation on market forces or taking things out of the control of the market and into public ownership.  It pretends that nothing can be done and this is a global rise in inflation.  What is hidden under that is the fact of profits.  Inflation is, to a substantial degree, profit-driven in this country.  It is not an automatic fact of life that big business just keeps the big profits it is making.  Year in and year out, the costs go up for big business, but it just passes those costs on and ordinary people's lives get harder.  The question of who pays the price for inflation is an active political and class struggle question.</p><p>The determination of big business and of the Government is that workers pay the price for inflation, both through declining wages in real terms and increased prices.  All the indications so far, however, from the balance sheets coming out of big business are that it is not hurting at all.  Shell and BP announced last week that they are on track to make &pound;40 billion in profits this year.  ESB announced a significant increase in profits last year, as did Energia.  We do not accept that.  We say that can be cut into by, on the one hand, price controls, which the Government has the power to implement but refuses to, and by workers fighting for a pay increase.</p><p>Throughout the country, workers are demanding pay rises and they are right to do so.  If workers do not organise and speak up, they will lose out.  When they do fight back, they have power - extra power in the current economic situation - and they can win real improvements.  Before Christmas, for example, Dunnes Stores workers campaigned for and won a 10% increase.  That should be an inspiration to other workers to do the same, to talk to their fellow workers, to link in with their union, to push for a meeting of all staff to discuss a pay claim and to lodge a pay claim.  The same goes for public sector workers.  They should organise now to demand an emergency pay increase that goes beyond the rate of inflation.  For us, raising the minimum wage is a part of this.  It not only helps the very low paid out of poverty, but raising the wage floor helps to raise the wages of all workers.  It also helps to strengthen the negotiating power of other workers who are already above the rate of the minimum wage.</p><p>I will make a final point that we also need to end age discrimination when it comes to the national minimum wage in this country.  It is blatant discrimination that people under the age of 20 are only entitled to earn less than the minimum wage.  They are doing the same work and should be paid the same for it. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-02-09a.40" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1618" speakername="James Browne" time="10:12:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020900009#H00100"><p>I thank Solidarity-People Before Profit for tabling this motion.</p>  <p>  The Government notes the motion on the minimum wage.  It expresses concerns with rising inflation and with the welfare of the low paid.  These are two concerns that this Government shares.  However, the motion ignores what this Government has done and is doing to address issues around the cost of living and to ensure rising incomes and rising living standards for the low paid.  </p>  <p>  First, regarding the problems of inflation and cost of living increases, I understand the pressures people are feeling.  The annual rate of consumer price inflation, as measured by the EU's harmonised index of consumer prices has picked up sharply in recent months, reaching a multi-decade high of 5.7% in December.  The Government recognises that those on lower incomes are being disproportionately affected but it should be noted that the recent rise in inflation is primarily the result of global factors and consequently, largely beyond the reach of Government policy.  These inflationary pressures are partly the result of temporary factors related to the pandemic that are expected to fade over time.  We need to be aware of the risk of higher inflation expectations feeding through to a wage-price spiral.  This risk to the inflation outlook increases the longer this temporary period of high inflation lasts. </p>  <p>  The Government has pursued a large range of measures to protect households from the rising cost of living.  Budget 2022 contained a personal income tax package worth &euro;520 million and a social welfare package of more than &euro;550 million.  The fuel allowance was increased by &euro;5 per week to compensate lower-income households for the additional energy costs they are likely to incur.  There were also increases in the allocation to early learning and care and school-age childcare to ensure childcare prices do not rise.  The Government has also approved an electricity costs emergency benefit scheme, with payment of up to &euro;100 to be made this year to an estimated 2.1 million electricity account holders.  In addition to the actions taken, colleagues across government along with their officials have been tasked with developing proposals for a package to help families with the cost of living.  The Government will finalise this package very shortly.  </p>  <p>  Regarding the income and living standards of the low paid, what the Government has done, and is doing, to address these issue should be acknowledged.  Central to this have been increases to the minimum wage.  Since its establishment in 2015, the Low Pay Commission has been responsible for making annual recommendations to the Government on the appropriate rate of the national minimum wage.  The national minimum wage seeks to find a balance between a fair and sustainable rate for low paid workers and one that will not have significant negative consequences for employers and competitiveness.  As it is legally enforceable, it provides protection for workers.  </p>  <p>  The Low Pay Commission comprises an equal number of employer and employee representatives and independent members who help to provide a balanced view when determining an appropriate rate for the national minimum wage.  In addition, the establishing legislation requires that the commission gives consideration to a range of issues when arriving at a recommendation for the appropriate national minimum wage.  These issues include the cost of living, competitiveness and the likely effect of any proposed recommendation on future levels of employment.  When considering increases in the national minimum wage during a period of inflation the Government must be conscious of the need to avoid second round effects or a wage-price spiral.  </p>  <p>  The Low Pay Commission is legislatively required to provide a recommendation to the Minister by the third week in July.  Any recommended change in the minimum wage is then normally announced as part of the budget in October, coming into force the following January.  The commission has made six recommendations on the national minimum wage since it was established and the Government has accepted each of these recommendations.  The national minimum wage increased from &euro;8.65 per hour to &euro;10.50 per hour between 2016 and 2022, in line with the recommendations of the commission.  The Government is supportive of the commission and the work it has carried out since its foundation and respects its independence.  </p>  <p>  The Government is committed to protecting low paid workers, many of whom have continued to work in sectors providing important services throughout the pandemic.  It is estimated that at least 135,000 people saw an increase in their wages due to the latest increase in the minimum wage in January, with many others on slightly higher pay levels also getting a knock-on increase.  Today Ireland has one of the highest minimum wages in the EU.  Recently released data from EUROSTAT shows that as of 1 January 2022, 21 of the 27 EU member states have national minimum wages.  In terms of gross monthly rates, Ireland has the second highest national minimum wage of these 21 member states.  When adjusted for purchasing power standards, PPS, Ireland ranks sixth out of 21.  The share of workers on the minimum wages in Ireland has fallen consistently since the establishment of the Low Pay Commission.  The share of workers on the minimum wage or less as a percentage of the total labour force has reduced from 9.3% in quarter four of 2016 to 6.8% in the fourth quarter of 2020.  It should also be noted that wages in Ireland are among the highest in the EU.  Median gross earnings in Ireland were &euro;17.97 an hour in 2018, which is 36% above the EU-27 average of &euro;13.18.  </p>  <p>  Ireland's personal taxation regime is viewed as being one of the most progressive in terms of income redistribution in both the EU and the OECD.  It is characterised by a large number of earners who are exempt from income tax, followed by a relatively steep climb from entry to the taxation net at an annual wage of circa &euro;17,000 to entry to the top rate of taxation at earnings of &euro;36,800, which is below the national average wage of &euro;38,846.  The tax strategy group's paper for 2021 shows that 989,000 earners or 36% of the total are exempt from income tax.  This includes people on the national minimum wage and on low pay.  </p>  <p>  Ireland has a well established system for setting the minimum wage based on the Low Pay Commission and this system works well.  Since its establishment, the commission has delivered six consecutive annual increases in the minimum wage and the next recommendation on the national minimum wage is due in July of this year.  As well as considering the national minimum wage, the commission is also currently tasked with examining the issues of a living wage and a universal basic income pilot scheme.  Reports from the commission on both of these matters are expected within the first half of this year.  The Government respects the commission and its independence.  It supports the work the commission is currently doing on the living wage, a universal basic income and preparing its July recommendations.  I expect, as with all commission recommendations, that the Government will indicate its planned approach following receipt of those recommendations.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-02-09a.41" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1478" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="10:12:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020900009#H00200"><p>The Government does not have the guts to stand up publicly and argue with us or oppose what we asking for here, which is an emergency review of the minimum wage.  In our view, there is a need to increase it to, as an absolute minimum, &euro;15 per hour.  The Government is going to accept our motion but with absolutely no intention of acting on it.  The public out there should know that this is the cynical way in which politics operates in here and the way this Government behaves.  The Government is spineless.  Behind the scenes it works to maintain the<i>status quo</i>and effectively ignore the really desperate situation that working people are facing at the moment as a result of the Government's own failures.</p><p>The only defence the Government has offered is that inflation is not its fault.  It is a global phenomenon and there is a not a lot it can do.  It can take some measures but it is not really its fault.  However, we need to seriously challenge that narrative.  This Government, along with European and other governments, has championed the privatisation and deregulation of energy markets over the past 20 years and is showing no intention of rolling back on that; in fact, quite the opposite.  When People Before Profit tabled a motion in October warning about the escalating energy crisis and asking for price controls, the Government reiterated its commitment to so-called competitive markets in energy.  When Deputy Fleming said what he said the other day, it was not some maverick comment about shopping around; it was Government policy.</p> <p>It has been Government policy, and that of Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, for 20 years.  Since the removal of the not-for-profit mandate of the ESB and the privatisation of Bord G&aacute;is, energy prices have gone through the roof and we are paying the bitter price for that now.  That is the truth.  That is part of an international phenomena, but the Government championed it and it is still committed to it.  That is set out in black and white in the speeches of Ministers including, as recently as this week, in the speech of the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, where he again referred to the competitive market.  I am amazed that nobody in the media is questioning this.  There is no debate about the link between the deregulation and privatisation of energy supply and the ability of energy companies to ratchet up the cost of energy to stratospheric levels that are literally impoverishing people.  Between 1,500 and 2,500 vulnerable people will die unnecessarily this winter because they cannot afford to heat their homes.  Excess winter mortality is worse in this country than in most other countries in Europe.</p> <p> People need to know that prior to the deregulation and privatisation of energy supply in this country, energy costs were lower in Ireland by a significant margin than they were in the rest of Europe.  Today, they are higher.  They are, on average, between 15% and 20% higher than in the rest of Europe.  That is the fault of Government.  Let it be clear, that is the fault of Government.  Why are energy prices higher in Ireland?  It is because the Government allows the energy companies to profiteer and price gouge.  We will continue to shout from the rooftops until it penetrates into the debate that the companies that are impoverishing people with these massive increases in energy prices are making massive profits.  On a global scale, it is staggering.  Last year, Shell and BP made &euro;40 billion in profits, of which Shell's share was &euro;19.3 billion.  The previous year, their profits amounted to &euro;4.8 billion.  It is incredible.  Their profits have quadrupled in one year.  The same is happening in Ireland.  Energia's profits were up 46% last year and 45% the previous year.  The ESB made &euro;616 million profit in 2020, and it is set to be more than &euro;700 million for 2021.  What is being taken out of the pockets of working people, pensioners and the vulnerable is going into the pockets of other groups of people who get paid dividends.  The rich are making money out of the misery of the poor.</p> <p> This is going on in the housing sector as well.  Last year, rents rose by, on average, 10%.  The previous year, they increased by 7%.  In total, rents have risen by about 68% over the past decade.  Similarly, there have been increases in the rental income of landlords, which increased by 16% in the past two years.  They are creaming it at the expense of working people and the Government is facilitating it.</p> <p> Against that background, we say it is time for workers to fight back.  They cannot take this lying down.  It is vital the minimum wage is increased to &euro;15 per hour, which, by the way, would still not allow a person to meet the cost of rent in Dublin.  The existing minimum wage level is shocking.  Do Members opposite get it?  In my area, rents are, on average, &euro;2,200 per month.  A person would need a &euro;26,000 after-tax income per annum just to pay the rent and he or she would be paying 100% of it.  A person on the minimum wage would not have that income.  That person would be paying about 120% of his or her income to pay the average rent in my area.  Across Dublin, the cost of renting a one-bedroom apartment is &euro;1,500 per month.  In my area, the cost for a one-bedroom apartment is &euro;1,900 per month.  It is beyond shocking.</p> <p> The Government will not do anything about that on the basis that landlords have the right to make profits.  The Government could do something about it, as other countries have done.  Rent controls set rents.  The Government could set a charge of a specific amount per square metre of rental property.  That is done in other countries.  It is the only way this issue can be dealt with.  A rent freeze at current levels will not suffice.  We need to set rents.  That is done in other countries and there is no reason it cannot be done here.</p> <p> There is simply no justification for vulture funds, landlords or anybody else setting rents at the current levels.  They are guaranteed and, as we speak, they are escalating the homelessness crisis again.  There was a brief respite from homelessness because the Government had to introduce an eviction ban, which previously it said could not be done.  The ban was introduced for a brief period during Covid and homelessness decreased.  The Government has since lifted the eviction ban and homelessness is on the increase again.  I am dealing with three families who are working and in homeless accommodation.  They were recently told by the local authority that they have to leave their accommodation because their income has risen above the income threshold.  That is the reward they get for working.  They are being told to leave the homeless accommodation when they have no chance of getting any other accommodation in the area.  People being evicted into homelessness is reaching obscene levels.</p> <p> We have given up on this Government.  In this motion, we are calling on workers to get out and fight.  The landlords and the big business people are exploiting the misery and suffering of people.  It is time for workers to stand up and make pay claims.  Like the Dunnes Stores workers, they need to insist on at least a 10% increase and that, at an absolute minimum, nobody should have to work for less than &euro;15 per hour.  On top of that, we want price controls on energy and rent controls to bring rents to affordable levels.  This Government has no interest in addressing the root causes of this inflationary spiral because it is in reality collaborating with the corporate interests that are benefiting from the suffering people are having inflicted on them.</p> <p> I commend the motion to the House.</p></speech>

I thank the Deputies who brought this motion to the floor of the D&aacute;il this morning.  It is very important.  Before I address the substance of the motion, I want to make clear that the best defence a worker has against the right-wing policies of this Government is not just to join a trade union but to be active in that trade union and to demand his or her fair share of the profits this Government is so accommodating of employers to make.</p><p>I have come here from a meeting of the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment, which is debating the Government's remote working legislation.  It sets out 13 reasons an employer may refuse a worker the right to work from home.  The T&aacute;naiste has stated he is bringing forward five pieces of workers' rights legislation.  I am not sure if he has read all of that legislation or if he understands the import, but they most definitely are not workers' rights when codified within the law are 13 reasons - 13 spurious reasons - an employer may refuse a worker the right to work from home or remotely.  We all know the benefits of that.  The Government has spoken about that, but when push comes to shove we know whose side it is on.  It is invariably on the side of employers.  It is never on the side of workers.</p><p>At the commencement of the pandemic, the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, like me, will have seen the low-pay, precarious work that was being exposed.  Hundreds of thousands of people were working in appalling conditions and many of them had been laid off.  When we looked at the impact on the tax take, we found these workers were underemployed and underpaid.  Such workers are in precarious work and some of them have no hope of meeting the cost of rent and certainly no hope of buying a house to shore them up against the damage being done by this Government to the property and housing markets.</p><p>The Minister of State said in his remarks that the Government is seeking to avoid a wage spiral.</p> <p>Imagine that.  Imagine wages just got out of control and people could live on what they were earning like we do in this House.  Imagine workers could simply live on the wages they were earning.  However, the Government's concern is about a wage spiral.</p></speech>

Was it happy it could ring-fence it and just do it for one person?  The Government was not one bit concerned about the impact that was going to have on wages.  In fact, unfettered, the man seems to be granted endless pay rises.  We know he has had at least three in the past while.  They do not come from nothing as they are granted by the Government.  Out of one side of its mouth the Government says there is plenty of money for those to whom it chooses to give it and out of the other side it preaches wage restraint to low-income workers.  With the cost of living going the way it is, wage restraint means workers in this State, after 40 hours of work, are making the choice between heating their homes or paying for their groceries.  The Government's wage restraint and the fact it is preaching that to workers is causing workers to be in impoverished and intolerable circumstances because of inflation.  Not alone does the Government want them to work to the age of 67, 68, 69 or 80 years - where it is going to end we do not know - but after 40 hours of work, on their feet in many instances, the Government has absolutely no problem with workers getting poverty wages for it.</p>  <p>  This motion calls for an emergency review of the minimum wage.  For the Government to accept that, it would have to admit there was an emergency.  The evidence of it is all around us but I refer to the remarks made by a Minister of State from the present Minister of State's own party.  I hasten to add when that party's back was to the wall, or when it believed it was, it cut the minimum wage and did it nice and quickly and was not worried about the impact on the broader economy then.  It did not create a single job.  It merely made working people poorer.  From that same party comes the call to shop around.  Imagine that.  People will be shopping around for a new Government because they cannot take much more of this.  That the Minister of State would come in here and preach wage restraint to people who cannot afford to heat their own homes is shocking.</p>  <p>  I urge Members to support the Sinn F&eacute;in amendment.  We need to move towards a living wage.  The Government's term of office is nearly half over and we do not yet have any concrete moves on that.</p></speech>

We have one of the highest rates of low pay in the developed world, with 20% of our workers in low-paid jobs and 50% of women currently earning &euro;20,000 or less.  That needs to be addressed.  A full-time worker on the minimum wage only earns &euro;1,774 before tax and USC.  Take away rent, mortgage, food, shopping, massively increased energy costs, childminding etc. and what does that leave people at the end of the week or month?  It means those on a living wage have virtually nothing left to alleviate the daily worries of feeding themselves or their family, paying their rent or heating their house.  To top it off, we now have the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Fleming, arrogantly stating people just have to shop around.  I am glad he has now realised how insulting that was, but if his apology is to mean anything, then this Government must now start not only talking about increasing the minimum wage but looking seriously at a living wage for all.  The living wage technical group estimates workers need at least &euro;12.90 per hour to achieve even the minimum acceptable standard of living.  That is all people are asking for, namely, a fair society where they can work, live and plan for the future.</p>  <p>  Like many motions brought to this House by the Opposition, this is about fairness.  I urge the Government to support it but I will not ask those on the minimum wage to hold their breath while they wait for it to do so.</p></speech>

They are still facing the difficulties we are becoming too familiar with these days, such as difficulties in meeting their housing payments each month, paying insurance costs to get them to and from work, paying for childcare and the list goes on.  However, an increasing problem is how low wages, which have always made it difficult to pay for the essentials, are now being totally outpaced by the rising cost of living.  While this problem has become a prominent issue, the Government at every turn tries to wash its hands of it.  It is something Sinn F&eacute;in has been consistently pointing out and trying to get the Government to address.  In the budget, the minimum wage was increased from &euro;10.20 to &euro;10.50 or 2.9%.  In October, the same month as budget 2022 was announced, the consumer price index jumped to an annual rate of 5.1%, which was the highest rate since 2007.  I ask the Minister of State how these figures compare.  In the year to December it rose a further 5.5%.  Given how the increase in the minimum wage is totally out of step with the rising cost of living, no amount of shopping around will help the many workers who are struggling to make ends meet and making very difficult choices between staying warm and putting food on the table.</p>  <p>  Ireland needs a living wage, which is something Sinn F&eacute;in has done a considerable amount of work on.  A living wage is the minimum income necessary for a single adult in full-time employment to meet his or her basic needs and afford an acceptable standard of living.  That is why Sinn F&eacute;in has proposed an amendment to this motion that urges the Government to produce a roadmap to delivering a living wage within a strict timeframe.  In the past, the Government has paid lip service to calls for a living wage but has done nothing to progress it.  Instead, it has created a housing market that is out of reach of the average worker and has overseen a situation in which rents are skyrocketing.  Young people are also being failed by this Government, which is happy to see them get paid sub-minimum rates while efforts to address this from the workers' side are hampered by a lack of collective bargaining to allow workers use the power of trade unions to improve pay and conditions.</p>  <p>  Before any more Government Members think of advising struggling families to shop around, they need to remember those families have been shopping around for years, which is something the Ministers of State who give this advice from on high do not have to do.  These citizens look at all options, unlike the Government, which is out of ideas.</p></speech>

We in Sinn F&eacute;in have consistently called on consecutive Governments to introduce a living wage for workers.  A living wage has been outlined as the absolute minimum required for a single person working full time to live with any kind of dignity.  In 2019, a Sinn F&eacute;in motion calling for a living wage was passed in this Chamber as recognition for the huge contribution low-paid workers make to the economy, but Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il and the Greens have refused to implement this.  Sinn F&eacute;in is again calling on the Government to do more for workers throughout this State.  Childcare costs continue to increase and have gone through the roof.  Transport costs have gone up.  Energy costs have spiralled out of control, and most middle- and low-income workers have no medical card or access to supports such as fuel allowance or the housing assistance payment.  The working poor now need relief.  The most recent figures on rents show that rents in Laois have gone up by 11.3% in one year.  Offaly has seen a 14.6% increase in one year.  Has the minimum wage gone up in line with that?  No it has not.  Have wages across the board gone up?  No they have not.</p>  <p>  This is a crisis in the cost of living.  Last year inflation was up 5.5% while the minimum wage increased by just 2.9%.  The living wage technical group has calculated a rate of &euro;12.90 per hour as the absolute minimum required to ensure workers are not living in poverty.  We are calling on the Government to produce a roadmap to deliver that living wage within a strict timeframe because this can has been kicked down the road long enough.</p>  <p>  It is also vital we address the unequal power relationship that exists between workers and employers.  We need to see collective bargaining legislation introduced to give workers a legal right to be represented by a trade union of their choice.  This is the only way workers can collectively use the bit of power they have to bargain for better pay and conditions.  All Governments have refused to do that.  Fianna F&aacute;il trenchantly refused to do it back in the 2000s.  Consecutive Governments have failed to introduce this legislation and it must happen now.</p>  <p>  The number of billionaires in this State has increased dramatically again this year.  Figures that came out in the new year showed that.  The shift in power and in money is going to a smaller few the whole time.  It is time the ordinary workers, that is, the people who struggle every day to get to work, to pay the high cost for transport, car insurance and everything else, got a break.  They need an absolute guarantee of a living wage.</p></speech>

This is more than just a discussion on what represents a realistic minimum wage.</p> <p>It is also a discussion about low pay, poverty and workers and families struggling to make ends meet and living from week to week on the wages they receive.  According to data from the OECD, Ireland has a far higher level of low pay than countries of similar economic status.  Raising the minimum wage, while raising the level of pay, may still not represent a living wage which is defined as "a wage that provides an employee with sufficient income to achieve a minimum acceptable standard of living".  A living wage allows the worker to afford basic essentials such as healthcare, food, clothing, housing, education, energy costs, and so on.  Low pay can result in an individual making compromises between putting food on the table, heating the house or going to the doctor.  Every week hundreds of thousands of people throughout the country on low pay must figure out how to pay their rent, pay for their utilities, transport, food, clothing, childcare costs and so on.</p> <p> Low pay has a cost to the economy and society as well by reducing tax revenue and increasing demands for welfare allowances and social protection payments.  There are clear costs both to the economy and to the worker with regard to low pay.  These costs are further exacerbated when both the cost of living and inflation rise and huge numbers of workers are only a pay cheque away from poverty.  Currently, inflation is at its highest in 20 years and the cost of living is spiralling out of control.  A proper living wage would significantly address both income inequality and poverty levels.  Contract workers and temporary workers are particularly vulnerable groups when it comes to low pay.  Figures show that half of all hospitality workers are on low pay, as are significant numbers of cleaners and retail workers.  Such employees would benefit greatly from increases to the minimum wage and would significantly improve their living standards.  Workers need a greater voice to improve pay and working conditions.  There should be better regulation of the exploitative gig economy.  There should also be improvements in public services and a real effort made to reduce income inequality.  Until such measures are put in place, hundreds of thousands of workers will remain vulnerable and living barely above the poverty line.</p></speech>

The word "crisis" appears to go hand in hand with this Government.  We have gone from one crisis to the next and now we have reached a crisis in the cost of living.  Some in the Government seem to think the solution is to stop complaining and to shop around.  People do shop around, but some cannot do so because of barriers.  Those people who are struggling are invariably on low pay and the minimum wage.  The reality is that working on the minimum wage puts individuals and families at increased risk of poverty.  According to the CSO, approximately 120,000 people earn the minimum wage or less in Ireland.  Approximately 110,000 people in Ireland live below the poverty line, despite being in employment.  It is easy to forget that every single one of these numbers represents a person, someone struggling to get by, to survive and to provide for themselves and their family.</p>  <p>  How does it reflect on us as a society to have such a large number of people living in or on the edge of poverty?  What does it say about the coalition Government when it fails to act where it can to improve the standard of living for these workers and their families?  The measure of a State is how we support and protect the more vulnerable, yet the Government seems more concerned about protecting vulture funds and big developers rather than ordinary workers.  Increasing the minimum wage will give the Government the clearest opportunity to put thousands of workers and their families out of poverty.  It would start to give working families the quality of life they deserve.  It is not just good for the individuals but also good for the wider community.  If the Government fails to act as energy and housing prices continue to spiral out of control, the cost of living will continue to worsen and put thousands of people at risk of poverty because so many are so close to the cliff, looking into that dark abyss.  Sinn F&eacute;in has outlined measures that would make a difference.  I accept there are elements the Government cannot influence or change, but there are many things the Government can do and it needs to do them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-02-09a.53" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1621" speakername="Johnny Mythen" time="10:42:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020900012#L00300"><p>First, I commend People Before Profit on bringing forward this motion on the national minimum wage.  Currently, there are more than 380,000 workers earning below the definition of low pay.  The recent increase in the cost of living, which was running at 5.5% in December, combined with the introduction of increases in carbon tax, rent increases, and increases in the cost of food, fuel, gas, coal, car insurance, house insurance, and the high cost of childcare, is pushing these 380,000 workers nearer and nearer the poverty line.  This is resulting in some of the worst division of inequality in the State since the occupation of our country.  The absence of a decent wage causes inequality on so many fronts - education, health and social inclusion - especially to a whole generation of young workers.  That is why we have included an amendment to this motion seeking the Government to produce a roadmap to deliver a living wage within a strict timeframe.</p>  <p>  A living wage is the minimum income necessary for a single adult in full-time employment to meet his or her basic needs.  A living wage should be a matter of right.  People are working and contributing to society, and it is their right that they should be able to afford basic needs such as healthy food, safe and secure accommodation and heating, as well as other essentials such as extracurricular activities and being able to provide a full and happy life for their children.  Should that not be the goal of any civilised society?</p>  <p>  The pandemic shone a bright light on how the bulk of low-paid workers worked tirelessly in shops, retail and supermarkets and delivered goods and services to the nation.  These are the workers who literally kept the wheels turning.  It is incumbent on us all that we do not allow decent working people to slip further and further away from a decent standard of living.  This can be done by introducing a real living wage.  This is about embedding a societal change that allows workers to share prosperity and the wealth of the country.</p>  <p>  In 2019, Sinn F&eacute;in introduced a motion in the D&aacute;il calling on the then Government to recognise the significant contribution low-paid workers make to the Irish economy and to introduce a living wage, with appropriate legal protections for those small or medium-sized enterprises that can show they cannot afford it.  This motion was passed by the D&aacute;il and supported by politicians from across the political spectrum.  It is vital the Government follows up on its own words "to protect those who are hardest hit".  Now is the Government's chance to do just that and to support the motion and the amendment before the House today.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-02-09a.54" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1551" speakername="Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in" time="10:42:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020900012#L00400"><p>The Labour Party supports this motion.  A lot of things come to mind when talking about the national minimum wage.  We need to picture how a parent feels who has worked a hard week on the minimum wage and then wonders how he or she can feed and clothe his or her children and keep them warm.  There is an element of fear in the motion but there is also an element of humiliation &ndash; that people are working so hard but perhaps have to make choices between food or warmth for their children.</p>  <p>  This motion is important because we live in a low-wage economy.  According to the OECD, 23% of Irish workers are statistically in low pay.  It is a massive issue.  When Government representatives talk about going back to normal, for many people going back to normal was the grind of working hard to try to provide for their family, but still at the end of the week asking themselves these devastating and humiliating questions as to whether they could feed, clothe and keep their children warm.</p>  <p>  The Government has rejected all of the presentations given to it about the cost of living and the reality of Irish life, including the Labour Party motion introduced last week by my colleague Deputy Nash, who also established the Low Pay Commission when the Labour Party was last in government.  The Government's argument is that tax cuts are the way to bring down the cost of living.  We talk to the Government about the fact that nowhere in Europe do people pay for a GP visit except in Ireland, or must families consider whether they have the money to bring their child to the doctor.  People in other European countries do not have those humiliating decisions to make.  Other European countries do not have the expectation of a second mortgage payment when it comes to childcare.</p> <p>When we talk about going to school and back-to-school costs, other countries just do not have the expectation of parents having to put their hands in their pocket every time they get a communication from their school.  We have so many things that families are just expected to pay for that the Government thinks can be resolved by a tax cut.  We just had a presentation from the Minister of State who told us &euro;520 million was spent on tax cuts that do nothing for the person on the minimum wage.  Whenever it is suggested we increase the minimum wage, you can predict that employer representatives will come out and say it would have a devastating effect on the economy and jobs.  That has been proven time and again to be an economic lie because they just do not want to pay the workers.</p> <p> This is connected to what was suggested earlier about trade union recognition.  Unfortunately, we do not have the same collective bargaining rights as other European countries enjoy and that is absolutely linked to why we have such an epidemic of low pay in Ireland.  Some people do not believe it but 23% of Irish workers are on low pay.  Some 40% of workers under 30 years are in insecure work.  All the things we ask the Government to do around childcare, school costs, GP care and rent are things it simply will not do.  It puts it all in the tax cut bracket which benefits those who do not effectively need any relief compared with people with the humiliating question in their heads at the end of the working week.</p> <p> The suggestion we would increase the minimum wage to something approaching a living wage is something the Government should be embracing.  There is a commitment in the programme for Government to establish a living wage.  We are two years into this Government.  We were all elected this day two years ago.  I know the Government was not founded this day two years ago but nonetheless we are approaching the midway point of this Government and yet there is still no energy or sense of emergency around the low pay epidemic or establishing the rationale to give someone that basic sense of dignity and pride that he or she can be a member of this society, engage in it and interact with others on the basis of a sense of equality and decent living standards and eradicate the humiliating question that person may have at the end of the week.</p> <p> In our amendment, we suggest the minimum wage be linked to inflation.  That is a perfectly reasonable suggestion.  We have to grapple with this epidemic.  In any other country where so many people are working in low-paid employment and those people are disproportionately women and migrant workers, it would be at the top of the enterprise agenda.  Employer organisations should be mortified.  They should be embarrassed and ashamed this is allowed to happen.  It is absolutely linked to workers in this Republic feeling they do not have the same power when they are members of a trade union as other workers would have across the EU or the world because the collective bargaining rights in Ireland are not strong enough.</p> <p> What do we do if we give people enough money to survive the week?  They have a different sense of themselves, their future and of the country and the community in which they live.  They have a different sense of vision and positivity to hand to their children.  They can say to their children that the country, the State, the Government and their employer has their back and that everyone effectively believes they have a right to live through their week, to work hard but be in a position to pay their bills and not have the heartbreaking flash across their brain when they are at home at night, looking at their children asleep, wondering if they can feed and clothe them and keep them warm.  A living wage is the least we can do so that our citizens can afford to live.</p></speech>

It has been an issue for decades.  It is a feature, unfortunately, of the Irish economy.  We have the highest levels of low pay in the EU.  It has a real impact on people's lives but it is having an especially big impact now as prices are rising so dramatically.</p><p>This is not something that just arose as a consequence of the pandemic.  Front-line workers during the pandemic were people who went into work, gowned up and put themselves at risk in hospitals, nursing homes etc., but people also realised that so too were shop workers, the people who drove the buses and trams, and the ancillary workers.  They were the people who cleaned the hospitals, for instance.  There were sectors people did not realise were vital in just keeping things afloat.  Many of those include people who are on low pay.  Then there are the areas where we have creativity, fun and joy in our lives such as entertainment, arts and hospitality, where there are very high levels of low pay.  There is now a real issue in recruiting and retaining staff.  People have to be able to work in an environment they want to work in but also to be able to afford to live.  People have found other types of employment directly as a consequence of the lack of available work in those sectors and it is increasingly difficult to get them back.  Much of that relates to low pay.</p><p>It is not only bad for the individual to struggle constantly but also bad for the economy and society.  We are all impacted by this.  Low pay results in a lower tax take and means higher need for supports such as housing assistance payment, medical cards and so on.  Low pay has a wider impact and it is in all our interests that we get to grips with the problem.  <i>The Spirit Level</i>was a book which measured this.  Countries with greater levels of equality, and we have a lot of inequality here, do better in health, life expectancy and in many other areas.  That is another societal gain from where people live in a more equal society.  The Government has a role to play in bringing that about.  We will support the motion and some of the amendments.</p><p>We have to recognise there was an underlying assumption in the budget around the level of inflation.  Inflation has exceeded what was expected and therefore there has to be an adjustment.  We called for a 60 cent increase to the minimum wage and it was increased by 30 cent.  That was before inflation had accelerated.  I am not surprised we are being told it is not short term but could be medium term.  It is very difficult to judge.  However, we need a review of the numbers for the living wage as those will have changed.  Nor do we need just one review.  It needs to be under constant review.  A link to inflation is essential.  We must acknowledge that countries that have done better have a system of free collective bargaining and they do not necessarily have to have a minimum wage as a point which people do not fall below.</p>  <p>The bargaining is done for, and sometimes through, particular sectors, and we need to see that here.  We need to see a plan for how we will get to a living wage.  It cannot just be a case of saying we will do it when we get around to it, without a fixed plan.  The national minimum wage is to increase by 2025 from &euro;10.20 to &euro;12.90 an hour.  That already looks very tame in comparison with the circumstances in which people find themselves at the moment, with rents, housing assistance top-ups and the increasing cost of heating and food.  In an inflationary environment, money just does not stretch as far as it did.  There has to be a clear recognition that there is an urgency about this and we need to see timelines for that urgency.</p> <p> It is in the employer's interest not to have a constant turnover of staff, and retaining staff is at least as important as recruiting them.  We will not see stability in certain sectors unless there is an environment where people earn enough to allow them to live in dignity, not just to survive.  This low pay issue affects women to a greater degree than men, and that has to be considered especially in the context of sectors that are dominated by women.  The Government most definitely has a role to play.  We would very much support a right to free collective bargaining.  It has been demonstrated in other jurisdictions that it has made a significant difference, so much so that in some cases they do not require a national minimum wage.  They also compare favourably with ours as equal societies.</p> <p> We will support the motion.</p></speech>

It is well timed, given the main item we have been discussing in recent weeks has been the increase in the cost of living.  Many factors are contributing to the increase but I do not believe that wages in this country, and especially lower ones, are one of them.  An argument can be made that an increase in wages will lead to an increase in the inflation rate and in the cost of production, but everybody who is willing and able to work needs the State to give them a commitment that they will have a living wage.</p>  <p>  I have come across many people in my constituency who are working for less than the living wage.  Every day, they face additional challenges, yet they are still willing and able to work.  They do not want to sponge off the State but to work and contribute.  Many lower paid workers prevail in industries such as cleaning and security, as was mentioned.  When the Covid lockdowns and restrictions were in place, these were front-line workers, who may not have been getting anything more than the minimum wage.  They were doing work that was essential and they continue to do it, so we need to support them.</p>  <p>  Sometimes people are segregated whereby if they do not have an education or certain skills, their contribution to society is considered lesser than that of those who have received an education.  Some people, however, have developed manual skills that are essential in this country.  The construction industry is one example where our challenge now is to find and provide enough workers who will lay the bricks, carry out the plastering and electrical works and get the job done.  We are finding it difficult to get people to do that in order that we can meet our commitments in the national development plan as well as those regarding housing and so on.  It is a significant problem and the minimum wage is part of that.  We have an opportunity to say to people who want to work that work pays.  When they have spent 40 hours working, they should know they will have enough money in their pockets to look after their families, feed themselves and have some enjoyment in life, rather than it being a constant struggle, day in day out, week in week out, as they count on a Monday morning what is left over from the previous week.  Having to live in such a frugal way is unfair and wrong.  It is time we reconsidered the minimum wage.  Employers need to come to the table and recognise that the workers on their payroll ensure their businesses remain active and economically viable.  It is not a huge ask.</p>  <p>  We are now emerging from the Covid pandemic, following all the closures that happened in the tourism, hospitality and retail sectors and the struggles they faced.  The main challenge now for these sectors relates to getting in staff in order that they can open their hotels and restaurants and serve people in shops and other retail outlets.  They cannot get them because people have not been sufficiently incentivised to go to work.  That needs to happen in order that the gap between social welfare and working is of such a nature that people can see the benefit of working.  Long term, they will contribute.  Tax credits are good and will help, but they will not do enough on their own.  For those who are exiting social welfare and entering full-time work, there should be a transition arrangement whereby they can retain a large share of their benefits for, perhaps, three to five years until they can find their feet in the industry.</p>  <p>  As well as that, we need to return to the fundamental issue.  If someone is working for 40 hours a week, he or she needs to have enough money to pay the bills, look after his or her children and home and have a little enjoyment in life.  This is an opportunity for the Government - we will all support it in taking this step - to raise the minimum wage as a counter-reaction to the inflation that exists.  We must also ensure we are in a position whereby we can say to people that it is worth their while to work.  I will now hand over to my colleague Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n.</p></speech>

It is interesting that we are having this debate over the wages of people who are on the lowest level of income in the State, and the Government is pouring water on any opportunity to see those incomes rise.  That is in stark contrast to the Government's attitude to the likes of Robert Watt, who have experienced increases in their wages of almost &euro;100,000 in a short period.  It is amazing that a Minister can pick out of the air an income increase of &euro;100,000 for those in the inner circle of the highest echelons of the public service, yet when it comes to those on the lowest level of income, Ministers push back with regard to any pay rise for them.</p>  <p>  I have spoken to citizens throughout the country, including in the constituency in which the Minister of State and I are based, who are facing bills of &euro;700 and &euro;800.  Earlier I saw an electricity bill of &euro;1,200 that had been dropped on the doormat of a family home.  These families are considering taking out loans to be able to pay for those bills.  People do not have that level of money at the ready at home to be able to pay for these bills.</p> <p>Those bills are skyrocketing at present and the reason they are is in significant part because of the actions of this Government.  I have asked the Government to look at having a reduction in VAT.  I have spoken to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, and the Taoiseach.  Both have told me that they have not even asked the European Union for a derogation with regard to the reduction of VAT.  A reduction of VAT would overnight allow for the costs of fuel and energy in people's homes to fall.  The Government is to pull another lever, that is, the carbon tax, to add further to the cost of families at home as well.</p> <p> The Government, basically, is shrugging its shoulders saying it does not have the ability to reduce the cost of living but Ireland has one of the most expensive public services.  This is seldom discussed.  Public services in this country are extremely expensive.  A reduction in the cost of public services would help people at the low and middle-income earning levels the most.</p> <p> The Government needs to get real about the cost of living.  Otherwise it has to accede to increases in the level of pay for people who need it.</p></speech>

Deputy Damien English, a junior Minister, is present, but we have no interest in the working poor, the small farmer and the so-called "daoine beaga" - I do not mean in stature - or ordinary humble people of Ireland.  "Let them eat cake" - if she was here now - is the attitude of the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste.  Globalists is what they are, looking after big global companies to bring in all the technology companies and everything else and screw our own unfortunate people.  I said yesterday they will die on the side of the road.  They will be starved with the hunger.</p>  <p>  Farmers will be forced out of business and forced into poverty because of the fertiliser crisis and everything else.  It is shocking the way workers are treated in this country.  I am an employer and many of my colleagues are, and we try to have a good relationship with our staff and look after them and nurture them, but big companies have not time at the checkouts due to how quick they are scanning the products in.  They are making them like machines.  It is all part of the global economy we bought into, with Deputy English's party leader and his friendship with the famous Prime Minister Trudeau, and with all this belief in the G7.  To hell with the ordinary people.  We commemorate 1916 and we commemorate 1923.  They commemorated something else in Dublin Castle two weeks ago.  I would not go near the place because they are turning in their graves with the kind of vultures they left behind them, which is what you have turned into, supporting all the big business and everybody else and forgetting about the ordinary people.</p>  <p>  Look at the wages, as Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n said, of the HSE and the rise in wages Mr. Watt got to go from one Department to another, and he out in Dubai last week looking at best practice of hospitals.  They would not know a hospital from an elephant because they have no experience in the field but they can get a pay rise any time they like.</p>  <p>  The unequal divide-and-conquer attitude that they have in government here is shocking, disgraceful and despicable, but it is out of the handbook from all over the world to keep the people down.  The Government will get a rude awakening.  I have said it before.  They are waiting in the long grass.  There is a fair bit of long grass this year because we had a very mild winter.  It will be well grazed by the time the election is called and the Government will have no place to hide.  They can run but they cannot hide.  They should hang their heads in shame.</p></speech>

Many employers are telling me they cannot afford it and this is something that needs to be factored in here.  What will happen is that the employer will pass on the minimum wage increase to the hard-pressed public.  The Government, instead, has to lower the tax and USC charge take on minimum wage workers.  This will increase the take-home pay for minimum wage workers.  This would at least, for once, stop hitting the employer who in some cases is going out of business.</p>  <p>  The cost of living is a major crisis for minimum wage earners in this country at present.  The struggle they have to make ends meet is shocking.  With the cost of living let shamefully spiral out of control by this Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and Green failed Government it has spent the past week running around.  They remind me of calves left out for the first time jumping and gadding as if the crisis was only happening in the past week.  This shocking out-of-touch anti-family Government has been told by me and my Independent colleagues of a crisis in the past six months.  However, this greedy tax-take fuelled Government by Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael - ploughing ahead with this carbon tax supported by so many on this side of the House - has done nothing but crucify those on the minimum wage and lower wage bracket in rural Ireland so that we can have Green pet projects paid for in the capital.  This is nothing short of a joke - a joke, I may add, we would love to laugh at if it was not so serious.</p>  <p>  This Government has people having to sit up in rural Ireland and ask does it pay them to work at all.  They pay childcare, massive car fuel increased charges, and bills.  Many employees are working simply at a loss.</p>  <p>  The Government has got it in the neck, of course, in the past few weeks.  This is why it is after waking up.  Themselves and their Green friends are frantically trying to put things right, something they should have done in the past six months.  Let me tell the Government that &euro;100 off the electricity bill is an insult to the hardworking people who are struggling to keep going.  An immediate halt to the carbon tax is needed here, and other further tax cuts.</p></speech>

I thank Deputy Boyd Barrett for his motion.</p>  <p>  Every man and woman, working or even not employed, is under savage pressure and the Government knows the reason for it.  The cost of energy, the cost of travelling, the expense of diesel and petrol and home heating oil has gone up.  Things are so extreme now.  There was one way to deal with it, and that was not to add the carbon tax.  The Government has a greater take of tax now from fuel than it had before the worldwide increase in oil prices came on.  The Government's tax take is much greater.</p>  <p>  Other countries have reduced the amount of tax they are taking.  They are not insisting on taking more carbon tax but the Government is held to ransom here.  Its hands are tied behind its back by the Greens.  They are not allowing it to touch or reduce the cost of energy.</p>  <p>  Farmers are paralysed and driven down into the ground with extra costs.  It is as if this Government hates the farmer.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine could subsidise fertiliser and he could forego these anti-dumping levies but he will not do that because the Greens will not allow him.  All the working class people are suffering then because if the farmers' production costs go up more they have to demand more for their produce.  It is a merry-go-round.  The Government could have it stopped and have helped a lot, but it has sat idly by.  The Government has all these other plans now but there was one way of doing it - forget the carbon tax for now and drop the tax take.</p></speech>

If the Minister of State, Deputy English, does not realise it or if the Government does not realise it, there is a serious crisis going on in our country at present.  It is the crisis of the people who are working and who have a job, but who are finding it awfully difficult to live.  They really are finding it difficult to live.</p>  <p>  That is why last night I nearly went out the window when I saw the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, on the television.  I will not say he was smiling, but he was grinning.  It was very hard to take and I will tell the Minister of State why.  The Minister was grinning with delight he was so happy announcing the grants to insulate people's homes.  You would say that is laudable and great.  Could the Minister of State explain to me and to those who cannot fill the oil tank and who is finding it difficult to pay their ESB where they are supposed to come up with the difference between &euro;55,000 to do the job on their house and &euro;25,000 of a grant?  It sounds great that the Government is giving &euro;25,000 of a grant to do &euro;50,000 or &euro;55,000 worth of work, and the Minister was grinning about it that this was great.  The Minister was ecstatic.  He was out of his mind with delight announcing this.  Will the Minister of State explain it to those people who find it so hard to pay for their messages at the end of the week, to pay for childcare, to pay for education, to buy clothes and to run the car?  I am talking about people about people who are in work who are finding it so hard at present and I, truthfully, believe that the Government does not realise that.  Maybe they are waking up now and just realising it, but it is as if this is a new problem.  I think today of people such as the Debenhams workers who were treated so badly and who camped outside in Tralee fighting for what I would call their workers' rights.</p>  <p>  People are being wronged.  People who are going to work are being wronged and I believe the Government is leaving all those people behind.  All the Government is doing is heaping further tax and further tax upon them and hurting them more and more and that is wrong.</p></speech>

It is beyond time.</p><p>It is becoming increasingly impossible to live in this country on a minimum wage.  We do not need to read the recent shocking inflation report to know this.</p> <p>We see this and we have seen this in our communities for some time now.  The cost of living in Ireland has risen exponentially to the point that people are becoming increasingly squeezed because while the cost of living has skyrocketed the minimum wage has barely moved.</p> <p> I believe that the minimum wage should be set to match the rate of inflation.  I have been particularly struck by the sense of complete hopelessness among young people recently.  They are unable to have the same life as the generation before.  The cost of living makes it difficult for them to save, own a car or start a family, and entirely impossible for them ever to own their own home, yet their wages do not reflect their increasingly difficult financial situation.</p> <p> A lot of people in this country are just about getting by and many are struggling so they turn to their Government for answers.  What is the response they get?  To "stop complaining" and "shop around".  I am truly disgusted at how out of touch this Government is with the people who elected them as representatives.  It is incredibly insulting, and almost inhumane, to face people who really struggle to make ends meet and tell them they just are not shopping around enough.  It is not as if anyone in this House would ever know what it is like to do that in today's world.  It was timed perfectly for this motion for the Minister of State to say such a thing.  It was not that he misspoke or anything because such views are a trait in the responses to parliamentary questions of all Ministers at this stage.  If it were possible for people to better their financial situation by shopping around, why should they have to forgo the odd coffee, brunch or holiday or their Netflix subscription in order to do so?  Why should they have to forgo the small things that make life a little bit more enjoyable and bearable just so that they can afford somewhere stable to live?  God knows, nobody sitting here today would do so.</p> <p> As well as that, the Government has once again completely neglected rural Ireland.  The idea of shopping around completely ignores people living in rural areas of this country who do not have the option even if they wanted to do so.  In my constituency of Donegal, there are many areas that have just one local shop.  If one lives in Glencolumbkille, for example, one's nearest supermarket is in Killybegs, which is over 25 km away.  In order to shop around, one would have to travel to the next nearest supermarket in Donegal town, which is over 50 km away.  That is a round trip of over 100 km, which is a trip that nobody should have to take especially given the astronomical cost of fuel at the moment, which this Government insists on increasing.</p> <p> Rural Ireland, once again, is suffering the consequences of a negligent and incompetent Government.  To raise the minimum wage would go a long way in helping rural Ireland to repopulate and rebuild. It would also significantly help all of those who struggle with the rising cost of living and, shockingly, that includes many of our staff here in the Oireachtas.</p> <p> It would be completely disingenuous for us all to stand here and discuss the minimum wage without acknowledging the fact that our own assistants get paid a mere &euro;11.75 per hour, and this motion would affect them too.  Before Christmas we all came in and sang their praises.  We nodded and agreed that they deserved so much better.  We are now in February but there still has been no movement on this matter because, once again, we have failed to put our money where our mouth is.  The union asks are not complicated so I ask that the Government and HR meet them.  I also ask that the minimum wage is raised in order to make life in this country a bit more bearable for the people in need. </p></speech>

We have unacceptable rates of poverty.  It is estimated that one in four people would be at risk of poverty and deprivation without social transfers.  Even with social transfers we have 630,000 people below the poverty line, which includes 165,000 children.</p><p>A key factor in the high rate of poverty is low pay.  There is a huge disparity in wage rates.  Average pay, according to research by Neary is &euro;53,000 a year but three out of every four workers come nowhere near that.  The typical pay for 50% of workers is &euro;34,000 a year but one in four people earns just &euro;21,700 a year and that is for a full-time worker in or around the minimum wage.</p><p>The concept of a minimum wage is that it is supposed to act as a floor and have the effect of generally raising incomes.  That is why the trade union movement fought for its introduction against huge opposition from the usual suspects.  The reality is that the minimum wage has become the norm in widespread areas of the economy for workers who work in hospitality, floor cleaners, home helps, people who work in areas of retail and, as has been said, for some of the staff in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann. </p><p>Between 25% and 30% of all minimum wage workers in Ireland work in the hospitality sector.  As noted in the motion, this particularly affects women and young workers.  Many workers in hospitality rely on tips to bring their income up to a level where they can just about make ends meet.  We then have the absolute scandal of tip theft by rapacious employers such as those at The Ivy, which is a restaurant that is located down the road from here.  It really says something when the Government is forced to consider legislation to stop this practice.</p><p>The legislation needs serious scrutiny.  It is a weak substitution for the Bill that was proposed by Senator Paul Gavan during the last D&aacute;il.  A serious problem with the proposed legislation is its definition of service charges which, as it stands, will provide a loophole for employers.</p><p>In terms of the minimum wage, a 30 cent increase in the budget is an insult.  It represents a 3% increase, which is well below the rate of inflation, and leaves the minimum wage well below the living wage that is now estimated to be &euro;12.90 an hour.  In fact, I fully support the need for &euro;15 an hour to meet the huge increases in the cost of living, which will particularly affect those on low incomes.  Such a proposal will be met with outrage and ferocious opposition from employers.</p><p>Last summer, there was a huge outcry about the difficulties in recruiting workers when the hospitality sector was partially reopened.  It was claimed then that the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, acted as a disincentive for young workers but that whole claim was nonsense.  The reality was that labour force survey data for July to September of last year showed that employment was back at the 2019 level.  The same people have now called for a relaxation of visas to bring in cheap labour from outside the EU.  There is a determination to maintain highly exploited cheap labour as the norm.</p><p>The trade unions must back a new campaign for a new minimum wage to act as a floor and not the norm.  The minimum wage must be set at a level that generally raises wages and tackles the scourge of low pay.  I appeal to every employee and worker to join a union, get active and lodge pay claims in response to the cost of living.</p><p>Finally, I wish to quote someone in response to the comment made by the Minister of State, Deputy Sean Fleming, that people should &quot;shop around&quot;.  Oscar Wilde said:</p> <blockquote> 	But to recommend thrift to the poor is both grotesque and insulting.  It is like advising a man who is starving to eat less. </blockquote></speech>

Some of those reasons are outside of our control as a Government but we are trying to respond with a number of initiatives across various Departments to ease that pressure and make a difference.  I think we will all hope and agree that some of the external factors that have caused inflation will ease during this year.  That will reduce pressure so that people can again pay some of their bills in different ways and invest for their future as well.</p>  <p>  Long term, we believe in the concept that work must always pay and that we support anyone who cannot work for whatever reason.  We must ensure that our system, through social protection supports and the Department of Health, in the majority of cases can assist families through difficult times.  That does not mean that every family who needs help are found in the system.  All of us here try to constantly find ways to beat that system and make sure that people do not get lost in it but get the help and support they need.  In general, we will work on that.</p>  <p>  While the context and most speeches are about the pressure that people are under, the motion calls for one process to deal with this matter, which is around an emergency review of the national minimum wage.  That is something that is constantly under review and the decisions are generally made by July every year.  The motion calls on us to ensure that this review sees an increase in the minimum wage and that the increase is adjusted to fully compensate for the erosion in buying power.  Also, the motion wants us to ensure that the review is concluded and implemented by 1 May 2022.  In general, we make a decision by July but I have outlined what is called for in the motion.  It is not all of the other solutions that people have referred to in their speeches and I will focus mainly on the mechanisms of that process.</p>  <p>  We have done this since 2015.  I recognise that Deputy Nash was the Minister of State at the time but I worked at that time to bring forward legislation on the minimum wage and the Low Pay Commission.  A process was set up.  That brings balance to the conversation and has resulted in six consecutive pay increases, when it was recommended.  Part of today's motion is that we must agree the term and the outcome of the review by the Low Pay Commission, which is not the way it is meant to work under legislation.  I accept what the motion seeks to achieve but that defeats the purpose of having a balanced conversation.  Most years, employers, employees, companies, workers and unions come together to converse and try to reach an agreement, which has generally been achieved over the last number of years.  The Government has always taken on board that advice.  I have an issue with that piece of the motion but understand the context of what people seek to achieve.  I will not argue over that and we do not oppose the motion.</p> <p> The Minister of State, Deputy Browne, detailed what we regard as the well-functioning system relating to national the minimum wage, which has secured six consecutive increases over the past six years, making it the second-highest national minimum wage in the EU. Over the past hour, we have heard a lot that would suggest this system is not working; I disagree.  The system is working and we have a process to get to where we want to go.  We can argue over the different places that we want to get to, but the system generally does work and has brought a fair bit of collegiality among the sectors to be able to implement those wage increases.</p> <p> The motion calls for the introduction of "a system whereby the minimum wage and wages generally are index linked so wages at a minimum cover any increases in the real cost of living".  We should remind ourselves that the standard way of measuring increases in the cost of living is by looking at the consumer price index measure of inflation.  Between February 2015, when the Low Pay Commission was established, and July 2021, when the most recent report of the commission was submitted to Government, prices increased by 4.4%.  In February 2015, the minimum wage was &euro;8.65 an hour.  In July 2021, the commission recommended a minimum wage of &euro;10.50 an hour, which is a 21.4% increase over the same period when there was only a 4.4% increase in prices.</p> <p> I am not saying that is something to shout about but I want to point out that the process the Deputies are asking for here might not give the return they want because it is linked to inflation, which is high at the moment but is not always high.  The Low Pay Commission has gone beyond that rate quite a number of times in the past few years and we need to bear that in mind when trying to tamper with a process that has achieved six consecutive pay increases in recent years.  In contrast, if, as the motion seems to suggest, the minimum wage had been indexed to inflation, it would have only increased by 4.4%.  It would have only increased from &euro;8.65 to &euro;9.03 an hour, which is not something the party opposite would want, and the minimum wage would be &euro;1.47 lower than it is today.  To me, that would be a poor result.  The system is working.  Of course, we have asked the Low Pay Commission to go further and to examine the overall living wage concept, which we are also trying to achieve.</p> <p> While the Members opposite are right that the increase in inflation in the last six months has reduced the impact of the increase in the minimum wage introduced this year, as explained by the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, these recent inflationary pressures are partly the result of temporary factors related to the pandemic, as well as energy costs, and they are expected to fade over time as things settle down.  We recognise the pressures in the system because of Brexit and Covid.  Therefore, if, as anticipated, inflation in future years is lower than in the past few months, tying the minimum wage to inflation would result in the minimum wage moving to a lower development path, not higher.  I doubt that is what the Deputies want to achieve but we can look at that part of the motion again.</p> <p> Further, it should be noted that since the establishment of the Low Pay Commission, not only has the minimum wage increased far faster than inflation, the share of workers on the minimum wage in Ireland has also fallen consistently.  The share of workers on the minimum wage or less as a percentage of the total labour force has reduced from 9.3% in quarter 4 of 2016 to 6.8% in quarter 4 of 2020.  Again, that fact was not borne out in some of the contributions here today, which give the impression it is a much higher percentage.   While the T&aacute;naiste and all of us in government are committed to increasing overall wages and packages for employees, we have to also recognise where it is at currently in a factual conversation so we can focus in on this.  The motion captures it pretty well compared to some of the speeches, but we have to bear that in mind.</p> <p> While the system in Ireland works, it also must be accepted that recent inflation is concerning; we are all concerned about it and we are trying to respond.  As the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, noted, colleagues across government and Departments, along with their officials, have been tasked with developing proposals for a package to help families with the cost of living and the Government plans to finalise this package shortly.  We know some of that legislation is progressing today and more will be done.  It is a difficult time, no doubt, and families are under pressure.  We all meet them every day of the week and we all know families who are under immense pressure.  We have to try to find new ways to be able to support them and find the ones who need that help, which it is important to do.</p> <p> The Government acknowledges there are too many workers on low pay in Ireland and it has been clear this is something it intends to address.  This is reflected in the work of the T&aacute;naiste in the past couple of years and I know that, as the leader of my Department, it is a particular focus of his.  We are trying to strengthen working conditions and strengthen the pay of workers, and we see that across a number of areas.  It is important to bear in mind that it is the aim of the Government.</p> <p> The Government has been clear in its belief that a legacy of the pandemic must be better pay, terms and conditions for everyone, but particularly for those on low pay.  We are committed, therefore, to honouring the commitment in the programme for Government to progressing to a living wage over the lifetime of this Government, along with legislation for sick pay.  In 2021, the T&aacute;naiste asked the Low Pay Commission to examine the programme for Government commitment to progress to a living wage over the lifetime of the Government and to make recommendations on the best approach to achieving this commitment, something all speakers have asked for in this debate.  Following this request, the Low Pay Commission commissioned a team of researchers at the National University of Ireland, Maynooth to conduct supporting research on the living wage.  The terms of reference for this research were noted by Cabinet in 2021.  This research was to consider the policy, social and economic implications of a move to a living wage and the process by which Ireland could progress towards it and achieve it.  The research was to examine international evidence on living wages, examining different calculation methods, examining the policy implications and outlining options for moving to a living wage in Ireland.</p> <p> I understand that, in January of this year, the commission received the living wage supporting research report from the researchers at the National University of Ireland, Maynooth and the commission is currently evaluating this research.  I further understand that the commission is meeting with experts and stakeholders in this area, such as Eurofound, the UK Low Pay Commission, business and employer representatives and representatives of the Living Wage Technical Group operating in Ireland.  The commission&rsquo;s report and recommendations on the progression to a living wage should be delivered by the end of the first quarter of this year.  The Government will respond to the recommendations after the T&aacute;naiste receives and considers the report.  We are making progress in this area and, hopefully, we will be able to outline a pathway to achieving it very soon.</p> <p> The Low Pay Commission has stated that it "understands that a living wage may be defined as the minimum income necessary for a single adult worker in full time employment, with no dependents, to meet his or her basic needs and afford a minimum acceptable standard of living".  As such, moving towards a living wage would, by definition, cover the costs of living, the apparent aim of the Solidarity-People Before Profit motion.  The motion calls on the Government to "introduce a system whereby &hellip; the wages at a minimum cover any increases in the real cost of living".  Work on achieving this is well under way.  That is why we are at one on this and why we are not opposing the motion.  We are trying to achieve the same thing.  We have put in place a process to get us there, it is under way and we will have a roadmap setting it out in the coming months.</p> <p> By progressing towards a living wage, the Government aims to maintain our well-functioning system while moving to ensure that wages cover a minimum acceptable standard of living that all in this House will agree to.  Through moving towards a living wage, the Government will achieve what this motion aims to achieve, which is higher pay for low paid workers.  It will achieve this constructively and through the Low Pay Commission, where, along with independent experts, there are an equal number of employer representative bodies and employee representatives.  This allows for progress to a living wage to be made in a considered fashion, which works well in this country.</p> <p> In progressing to a living wage, we need to recognise that many businesses have been badly affected by the pandemic and are struggling to pay existing wages.  Likewise, many families are struggling to pay existing bills.  We need to make sure that we proceed in a way that does not cause jobs to be lost in terms of the number of people employed or cause employees to have their hours cut.  To do so would be counterproductive.  What we are trying to achieve through our approach is a balance that recognises the pressures on employees and their families to pay their bills and make ends meet, while making sure we are able to continue to grow jobs and the recovery of this country.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-02-09a.70" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1522" speakername="Mick Barry" time="11:32:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020900017#Q00200"><p>The slogan of the campaign for a minimum wage in the United States was &quot;$15 now because the rent won't wait&quot;.  That is a slogan that will have a lot of echoes among a lot of young and not so young low-paid workers in this country this morning, given the shocking figures we have seen from<i>daft.ie</i>, which do not shock because we are all so used to it now.</p><p>The Minister of State mentioned six consecutive increases in the minimum wage.  He should not worry about six consecutive increases.  What about 37 consecutive quarterly increases in the price of rent in this State and the latest blow of 10%-plus annualised increases, if quarter 4 of 2021 is anything to go by?  Of course, the highest rents in the country are in Dublin but let us not take the worst example.  Let us take an alternative example in my own city of Cork, where the average price of rent is now more than &euro;1,500 per month.  Does the Minister of State know how much of the wage of a full-time worker on the minimum wage that would eat up?  Let me tell him.  It is 84%.  How is anyone meant to feed themselves after that?</p><p>A woman told me recently:</p> <blockquote> 	This is my choice now with these cost of living increases.  I can be reasonably well fed in a freezing house or I can starve in a warm house.  They are the choices that I face. </blockquote>  <p>Another woman told me her two sons are renting.</p> <p>They have had to come back to the family home because they cannot afford the rent any more.  What does that do to the weekly grocery and electricity bills?  That is a story that will be recognised by tens of thousands of mams and dads throughout the country.<br/><br/>Let us come back to a central point in this debate.  I have said in the House a few times and I will keep saying that the Minister of State and the Government have effectively cut the pay of the lowest-paid workers in the State.  Last year the Government implemented one of its six consecutive 1% increases in the minimum wage.  The European average was four times that.  This year, the Government increased it by 2.9% at a time when official inflation, which is far below the rate of inflation for the low-paid, was 5.5%.  The rate of inflation was nearly double the increase the Government conceded, which is a de facto cut in the pay of minimum wage workers, the lowest-paid workers in the country.  This year, the average increase in minimum wage across the EU is 6%, more than double what the Government is paying out.  An important point was raised in the debate by Deputy Paul Murphy when he talked about the wages paid to young people.  Some 90% of the minimum wage, or &euro;9.45 per hour, is paid to 19-year olds, while 18-year olds are paid 80%, or &euro;8.40 per hour.  For under-18s the figure is 70% of the minimum wage, or &euro;7.35 per hour.  This discrimination against young workers must stop.  We need equal pay for work of equal value.  That is a basic principle that we are asserting.<br/><br/>During the debate the Minister of State, Deputy James Browne, made the claim that Irish workers are receiving among the highest wages in the EU.  Workers will be in disbelief at that claim when they go to the supermarket checkout or when they scroll through their phones and look at their bank balances and their gut instinct is right.  It is a false claim and fake news.  In 2020, the Republic of Ireland ranked tenth in the Union for labour costs, including wages, pension contributions and social insurance.  This was below the eurozone average and below the EU15 average.  That is bad enough but on the other side of the coin we find that Ireland had the second-highest price level for consumer goods.  In reality we were joint first because there is only a fraction of a difference between Ireland and Denmark in top place.  The consumer price level in this Republic is 40% above the EU average.  What a double-whammy that is with wages on the one hand and prices on the other.  This is an international crisis, as the Government has argued, but it impacts particularly hard in this country for those reasons.<br/><br/>The Minister of State spoke about steps the Government is taking or trying to take and he is trying to steer the debate away from wages and onto the question of price controls but we will meet him on his own ground and debate price controls.  Taking &euro;100 off an electricity bill might be 15% of the bill paid for by the State with the ordinary person having to delve into his or her pocket for the other 85%.  It is a fraction and a pathetic gesture.  If the Government wants real price controls then we should debate rent.  At a minimum, we should have a national rent freeze, although in reality at this stage we should be talking about legislation to cut the price of rent.  The carbon tax increases the Minister of State is supporting that are coming on 1 May are already becoming an issue.  A strong demand will bubble up in society that this increase be scrapped.  Then there is the big issue and the elephant in the corner, namely the USC.  This is the tax that had to be brought in because of the austerity era and the IMF.  It was promised that when austerity was over the USC would be over but the Government has kept it in place.  That will become an issue as well and I do not see any action from the Government on these fronts.<br/><br/>The following is a quote from Daniel McConnell on <i>www.examiner.ie </i>this morning:</p><blockquote>	The Government is bracing itself for industrial strife as public and private sector workers are demanding pay increases of at least 5% </blockquote> <p>The article quotes the deputy general secretary of the largest trade union in the country, SIPTU, who says the Government has a responsibility &ldquo;to step up&rdquo; on the issue of low pay.  I do not want to make extravagant claims and the motion is not solely or mainly responsible for this; rather, it is the pressure of working people from below but there has been value in putting this motion down because it has helped and assisted to change the debate this week.  It is not just about the issue of price controls.  We want real price controls and the Government is only paying lip service to it.  The issue of wages is beginning to come onto the agenda and this motion has played a role in assisting to put that on the agenda.  That is important because worker organisation and action are key here.<br/><br/>The Government is a sham on this issue.  I ask the Minister of State not to make me laugh at the idea that the Government is supporting this motion and that the House is all at one.  The motion states that there must be an emergency increase in the national minimum wage by 1 May.  I know, the Minister of State knows and everybody listening into this debate knows that the Government has no intention of doing that so I ask him not to try to cod anyone.  The Government should have the guts to support its position and if it is going to vote for it then it should implement it.  If the Government is against it then it should own its political position and vote against it.  It should not engage in the sl&iacute;bh&iacute;n politics of Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael and vote for something with no intention of implementing it because that is precisely what I have heard from the Minister of State today.<br/><br/>I will make a point to working people who listened to that previous point.  We will exert the pressure in here and do our best but the key is that on the ground they organise and submit pay claims.  Hopefully there will be no need for industrial action and employers, seeing that workers are serious, will concede the pay claims.  If not, workers must be prepared to fight and we will stand with them and back them because this is not just a cost-of-living crisis; rather, it is a cost-of-survival crisis and working people must not be the whipping boys as this Government, despite all its fine words, intends them to be.</p></speech>

The latest rental report from <i>daft.ie</i>shows that rip-off rents were up another staggering 10% in the final three months of last year.  New figures also reveal that cuckoo funds, courtesy of sweetheart tax deals provided by the Government, massively outbid ordinary house buyers for family homes and then rent them back to those people at extortionate rates.</p> <p>On the Taoiseach's watch, affordability has gone out the window.  These rack rents mean that people have no breathing room to save for a deposit.  Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael have made homeownership a pipe dream for an entire generation and a nightmare for those desperately seeking to put a roof over their heads.<br/><br/>In October's budget, the Taoiseach did nothing for renters - zero, zilch, <i>nada</i>- and this has to change fast.  The cost-of-living measures the Taoiseach says he will introduce must include cutting rents and banning rent increases for three years.  Ripped-off renters need relief now.<br/><br/>The average rent in the last three months of 2021 was a whopping &euro;1,524, and it was more than &euro;2,000 in Dublin.  Let us take a second for that to sink in.  There are double-digit increases in 20 counties, up by 20% or more in every county in Connacht, so clearly the rent cap of the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, is a failure.<br/><br/>In December, the Taoiseach said the role of cuckoo funds in wrecking the housing market was being exaggerated.  However, his claim was simply untrue, and it does not tally with the facts that 4,900 family homes were bulk-purchased by these very funds last year and that they outbid ordinary homebuyers by up to 32%.  It is past time that the Government took action on these funds.  They are a key driver in pushing rents up to record levels.  People are forced to pay rip-off rents before they get to pay their energy bills, put food on the table or meet the cost of childcare.  Many renters are left with literally nothing at the end of the month, so is it any wonder that Generation Rent feels battered, bruised, exhausted and sold out?<br/><br/>The <i>daft.ie </i>report shows the Government is failing on supply.  The number of homes available to rent is at its lowest in 15 years and, therefore, we should not be surprised that landlords get away with charging big money, sometimes to live in places where your feet could literally touch your fridge while you are lying in your bed.  This is a social disaster.  It is unfolding on the Government's watch.  Rip-off rents rob a generation of a decent life and the ability to build their future.  This cannot continue.  We need action now.  Renters do not have the luxury of waiting on the never&ndash;never for the Government to deliver on supply.  Is tubaiste s&oacute;isialta iad na c&iacute;osanna at&aacute; as smacht.  T&aacute; gl&uacute;in ioml&aacute;n ann at&aacute; n&iacute;os measa as n&aacute; riamh, agus t&aacute; s&eacute; ag dul in olcas.  Caithfidh an Rialtas c&iacute;osanna a ghearradh agus cosc a chur ar arduithe ar feadh tr&iacute; bliana.<br/><br/>I have been asking Taoiseach until blue in the face to cut rents by means of a tax credit, putting &euro;1,500 back into renters' pockets, and to ban rent increases for three years.  He could have done this at budget time but chose not to.  I now urge him to do these very things as part of the cost-of-living package he promised.  He should take this opportunity to finally make a difference for the renters of Ireland.</p></speech>

The Government came into office more than a year and a half ago, and I have made it clear that housing is the key social issue facing our country and society.  Ireland needs, on average, 33,000 homes constructed per annum right out until 2030.  These homes are needed to satisfy demand for housing across all four types of tenure: affordable, social, private rental and private ownership.  The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, in the context of the Housing for All strategy, has broken down the tenure types as follows in respect of our objectives: 11,800 new privately owned homes; 6,500 new private rental homes; 4,100 new affordable homes; and 10,300 new social housing homes.  Therefore, the State is investing the largest amount of capital ever in social and affordable housing, with clear targets to reach the figure of 33,000, which we desperately need to get to.  Supply is a bit like last year and the year before because of Covid.  There is a need in the market and there will be demand in the market for 6,500 new private rental homes per year.  If the market supplies fewer than that number, rents will rise even further.  We cannot wish away the basic law of supply and demand.  We need more supply, and we need it as quickly as possible.</p>  <p>  I have been very consistent and open in the House in saying the State sector will invest in an unprecedented way in social and affordable houses.  We will also need private investment to make sure we reach the target of 33,000 across all four types of housing we want, from cost-rental and affordable housing to social and private housing.</p>  <p>  With respect to funds, including institutional funds, we have already passed planning laws and introduced taxation measures to stop the bulk-buying of houses and homes in the State.  The Deputy knows that.  That is the position.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la has followed up on that with recent decisions, copper-fastening the legislative changes the Minister has made.  It is basically about supply.  I am aware that the Deputy may not agree and does not like me raising the issue of supply.  People are objecting to various projects on an ongoing basis.  If we believe there is a crisis, as I do, we do not have the luxury of consistently opposing planning applications for social, affordable and private housing.  The Deputy opposed 1,100 rental homes on Clonliffe Road.  She may have had good reasons for doing so, but I find it hard to reconcile the definition of a "crisis" with wholesale serial objections to projects that would supply homes that are badly needed.</p></speech>

We need more supply and to build more houses.  A total of 20,000 were completed last year, when the Covid lockdown hit us, and we hope to reach a figure of 25,000 in 2022.  However, the target in Housing for All is to get to 33,000 houses every year.  That is what we need to get to.  We need it across all types of housing: private housing, public housing to an unprecedented degree, affordable housing and cost-rental housing.</p><p>Deputy McDonald quoted <i>daft.ie</i>.  On the key page, the author states, &quot;As ever, the solution remains in the construction of large numbers of market- and cost-rental housing to cater for tenants of all incomes.&quot;  That is the conclusion on what is required.  I know it is very difficult for people.  The Housing for All strategy is the correct strategy.  The investment is available from the public side.  I have seen no real substantive alternatives on the supply issue coming from anybody.  We have gone through the figures with all the people involved. </p></speech>

We now need to get on with it and allow the houses to be built.  That is a sincere point I am making.  If we all agree this is a crisis, we are not going to solve it with 20,000 or 25,000 units per year; we need 33,000, at a minimum, per year.</p></speech>

That is what is happening.  Does the Taoiseach know what his policy is doing?  It is making a bad situation worse.  It is demonstrating that the wrong kind of supply can actually make the situation worse.</p>  <p>  The average renters find themselves in a nightmare of the Government's construction.  They are being fleeced for high rent by the funds that have sweetheart and favourable arrangements with the Government, and they are unable to accumulate a deposit and advance in their lives.</p> <p>It is outrageous.  It strikes me that the Taoiseach is happy to come in and recite big figures, but never actually get to the root of the issue or deal with the day-to-day reality that people cannot make their rent.  I put it to the Taoiseach again that, as part of the Government's cost of living package, he should cut rents by means of a tax credit and, for God's sake, put a ban on runaway rent increases for three years.  I ask the Taoiseach to do those things for the renters of this country.</p></speech>

He can hardly tell them to stop complaining or to shop around.  Cuckoo funds are outbidding household buyers by as much as 32%, paying on average &euro;105,000 more per property than household buyers.  Ordinary workers can shop around for an eternity, but increasingly they feel they are chasing shadows.  They will never be able to outbid the cuckoo funds that are swooping in and snatching the homes they hope to buy.  This is not just happening in the build-to-rent sector, the sector designed specifically by Government to be bought exclusively by cuckoo funds.  Last year, these funds spent &euro;2.27 billion acquiring nearly 5,000 properties for use in the private rental sector.  In some cases, the funds are buying these homes and leasing them back to local authorities that reward them with guaranteed extortionate rents, in some cases for up to 25 years, before they get the keys back.  Again, this has been deliberately facilitated by Government policy.  The Government voted to slash the stamp duty for cuckoo funds if they leased the homes back to local authorities.  We warned the Government at the time that this would be the result, but it went ahead anyway.</p>  <p>  The head of research of BNP Paribas Real Estate Ireland, John McCarthy, has explained further that "[cuckoo funds] believe that rents are well underpinned by existing market imbalances and Ireland's demographic potential".  In other words, the rental market is so utterly broken and dysfunctional, these funds do not believe that sky-high rents are going to come down any time soon.  Ireland has a young population who are going to be condemned to continue to pay crippling rents for the foreseeable future.</p>  <p>  Rents are now 50% higher than they were during the Celtic tiger peak.  What level does the Taoiseach think is sustainable?  In Dublin, rents went up by 4% in just the last three months of 2021.  Nationally, year on year, they went up by 10%, with 20 counties seeing a double-digit increase.  Rents increased by 25% in County Donegal.  Meanwhile, the Government insists the rent caps, which are now set at a 2%, are working.  It is plainly obvious the rent caps are not working.  The Government has to be straight with people.  Most people believe this is out of control.  The Taoiseach is going to have to tell us how he will get control of this.  Does he accept the Government has incentivised the disaster by rewarding the cuckoo funds with tax breaks for buying what would normally be family homes?  Does he accept rent caps are not working?  Will he immediately bring in a three-year ban on rent increases?  We really need to see an eviction freeze.  There is a serious problem with evictions coming down the track.</p></speech>

Again, the issue is a very serious one.  Rents are too high for people.  There are not enough houses out there.  We can see from the from the Daft report there are not enough apartments to rent.  There is not enough housing out there to buy.  The whole purpose of the Government policy over the past 12 months and since we came into office has been to increase the supply of housing dramatically.  A total of 31,000 starts happened in 2021.  That is the highest number of housing starts since 2008.  We are going to continue with that acceleration of house building if we are allowed and if people just remove the obstacles and allow us to get housing and apartments built.</p>  <p>  We are going to have to build different types of housing.  There will be a very large public housing programme.  We want more than 10,300 on average as part of that 33,000 overall houses to be built every year.  We want to get up to that 33,000 target.  Supply is key here.  People can rightly raise the issue and so on, but equally, we need solutions.  I am talking about solutions in terms of supply and the type of housing we provide and to enable people to afford housing.  Cost rental is one of those models that is developing and is in its infancy in this country.  I predict the cost rental model, which can offer a very substantial rent reductions below the market, will accelerate and be enhanced due to Government efforts in working with local authorities and others.  Social housing is going to increase year on year, and specifically, direct builds. We are phasing out the leasing.  We will increase direct builds on an unprecedented scale.  Also, there will be 4,000-plus affordable houses built.  That is what the State can do, but the private sector will be involved as well.  It will also be providing housing and apartments, as has always been the case.</p>  <p>  The one thing we cannot do is inhibit supply.  It is easy to be political about this.  I understand it fully and I have no issue with it, but I have to make sure we introduce the right policies for the long haul.  We cannot develop housing policy on the basis of the outcome of the next election and who wins it or who does not.  We now have to get a consistent housing policy that lasts the decade and brings stability to the market.  The market is not stable right now; the rents are too high.  However, a lot of thought has gone into this from people just outside of politicians in terms of what we need to do.  I believe in a strong social housing programme and it is happening now.  I believe in the idea of affordability and that we should help from the State perspective.  I believe in the idea of cost rental.  However, I also believe that we need private sector investment as well.  I think the Deputies in opposition need to speak out on that.  Do they believe in private sector investment at all in the housing market or is it their view we should continue the decline in the number of landlords?  They are leaving the market.  We do not have enough rental properties.  We do not have enough houses built for people to buy.  We want more owner-occupiers.  We want to give people the chance to buy their homes, which is why the shared equity and help-to-buy schemes and so on are coming in.  There are huge issues here, and I acknowledge that.  However, we need to be solution focused in terms of how we get to grips with it.</p></speech>

Of course it has its place.  It is a big part of the solution but it has to have constraints put on it.  The Taoiseach stated that he has spoken to a lot of people in terms of designing the solution.  I am wondering who he has been speaking to because the solution that has been designed really favours cuckoo funds over individual home buyers.</p></speech>

Housing is critical to that.  For the past decade, I have been speaking about the need to build social housing.  When the housing assistance payment, HAP, was brought in, I said it would be a disaster if it was not accompanied by a big housebuilding programme and it would become a dominant feature in terms of the amount of State money that went into it.  I am sick to death of predicting things that turn out to be right.  Perhaps the Taoiseach might listen to some of us rather than saying the same thing.  We know we need supply, but we need affordable supply.</p></speech>

I accept and am glad the Deputy acknowledged the need for private sector investment.  It does need to be constrained.  We have already brought in planning constraints on funds in terms of housing estates and being able to bulk buy.  They cannot do so.  From a taxation perspective and a planning position, that has happened.  In terms of apartment building, there has been a huge issue for some time in terms of the whole issue around viability of apartment building.  The <i>daft.ie</i>report and the BNP Paribas report state that, basically, if that funding was not available, those apartments would never have been built in the first place.  We have an issue with apartments - there is no question about that - in terms of viability, particularly in terms of brownfield sites and trying to get compact living.  That is all part of Housing for All and that is why the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe fund is being established - to see if the State can help in terms of creating viability and affordability in that apartment sector.  That is clearly a challenge but, again, let us be clear that we have to be very careful we do not inhibit supply even more in terms of just responding to the short-term issues.</p></speech>

Two men wearing boiler suits and balaclavas pumped 44 bullets into the victims.  The names of the five Catholic men and boys were: Christy Doherty, aged 52; Jack Duffin, aged 66; James Kennedy, aged 15; Peter Magee, aged 18; and William McManus, aged 54.  The police ombudsman for the North yesterday released another shocking report.  There has been a litany of reports.  She detailed the murder of 11 Catholics by loyalists with the assistance of the British military.  Her report also investigates the murders of Harry Conlon, Aidan Wallace, Michael Gilbride, Martin Moran, Theresa Clinton and Larry Brennan and the attempted murder of Samuel Caskey in 1990.</p>  <p>  The RUC special branch had informers who were directly involved in these murders.  Informants employed by the special branch were murdering Catholics throughout the North at that moment in time.  A police gun was in the hands of loyalists who were involved in these murders.  The ombudsman identified eight British informants linked to the murder or attempted murder of 27 people.  The RUC destroyed files.  It failed to investigate CCTV footage.  It failed to search the houses of suspects.  It failed to carry out forensics on blood.  It failed to test a getaway car for gunshot residue.  These reports come just a few weeks after another report by the ombudsman that was released on similar murders on the north coast, in Derry and Antrim.  The police ombudsman has 400 such requests in her in-tray at the moment.  Those are 400 requests relating to British state collusion in the murder of citizens.  These were citizens of a state murdered by the same state.  They were Irish people murdered by the British military in Ireland.  It is not ancient history.  This is in our lifetime.  The perpetrators of these murders live in the same towns and villages as the families of the dead loved ones.  Some of those securocrats still work within the security forces.  Some of them have actually been promoted as a result of their activities.  In many cases, the PSNI knows who carried out these murders but there seems to be no effort to seek proper convictions.</p>  <p>  The British Government is a signatory to the Good Friday Agreement and the Stormont House Agreement.  These are international agreements.  The British Government has international responsibilities to justice.  I am asking the Taoiseach to use every single tool, including our position in the UN, to make sure there is an international investigation into murders by the British state in Ireland.  I am appealing also to the Government to look at the creation of a historical inquiries team on this side of the Border, in a similar fashion to the Smithwick tribunal, to take evidence from people from the North and to try to get to the heart of what happened to these people and to ensure there is justice.</p></speech>

This report from the police ombudsman is a very significant one.  It is a deeply disturbing report and, as the Deputy stated, the second such report in a matter of weeks.  Examining those attacks, in particular that in south Belfast in Sean Graham bookmakers, resulting in many murders and one attempted murder, it has found very strong evidence of investigative and intelligence failures and collusive behaviours by the RUC as defined by the ombudsman, including the continued unjustifiable use of informants involved in serious criminality and murder and, crucially and unacceptably, the return of weapons to loyalist paramilitaries.  It is simply appalling, what has been presented in the report of the ombudsman.</p>  <p>  I did say yesterday in the House that I met several victims' groups last week, Relatives for Justice being one.  Among that group was Mark Sykes, who was there in the bookmakers and was shot.  It was very emotional for him to have to recount, 30 years on, what happened to him and what he witnessed and how long he has had to campaign to get this report of the ombudsman published.  The predecessor to the current ombudsman was working on this for quite some years as well.  As the Deputy is aware, he is a survivor of the Sean Graham bookmakers attack.  I was grateful to him for talking me through his experiences even though it was very difficult for him.  I also spoke to other victims of other atrocities as well last week.</p>  <p>  What it does bring home in the first instance is that we do need a comprehensive and agreed framework to deal with the painful legacy of our past.  We have had the Stormont House Agreement and other agreements and the British Government does need to adhere to agreements it entered into in the context of the Good Friday Agreement and in the context of legacy.  I have made this point to the British Prime Minister and we have made this point consistently to the British Government that legacy is important in terms of the overall architecture of the Good Friday Agreement and the need to follow through on it.  There has been too much foot-dragging regarding agreements that have been entered into.</p>  <p>  The Deputy referenced the Smithwick inquiry.  The Irish Government fulfilled its obligations under the Good Friday Agreement and subsequent agreements, around legacy.  Anything we were asked to do, we did.  We stand ready.  I have said this to other groups and victims and political representatives of other victims who feel they have not got full closure or have not got prosecutions in respect of their loved ones who were murdered and they would allege collusion in the Republic.  I said to come and meet us and that if we have any information, we will provide it as a State because we believe that is our obligation.</p></speech>

At the time and since then the Taoiseach has indicated the families of those who were lost, who were murdered, on Bloody Sunday need to find justice.  We are looking at the likelihood that there is going to be an amnesty.  If there is an amnesty in the North of Ireland, it means there is no rule of law and that the perpetrators will get away with murder.</p>  <p>  I attended the 50th anniversary of the Ballymurphy massacre, and speaker after speaker got up on the trailer that day and said the British Government quite simply wants to get away with murder.  That is what is happening here.</p>  <p>  Over recent debates in which I have participated, I have made an effort to name every single victim of the Bloody Sunday massacre, the Ballymurphy massacre, the Springhill massacre, the murders that were researched in Operation Greenwich and those today in the Ombudsman&rsquo;s report.  Is it not shocking that we know the names of the people who lost their lives, the people who were murdered, but we do not know the names of the people who perpetrated those murders.  Most people, for example, would not know Lance Corporal David James Cleary, better known as Soldier F, who is accused of murdering civilians on Bloody Sunday.  Most people would not know the alphabet of British Army perpetrators of murder.  We need to ensure people know their names.  The Taoiseach has recounted what has happened, but I am asking him what steps will he take to ensure those names are known throughout the country for the murders they have committed.</p></speech>

I do not agree with the amnesty at all and I do not take it as a likelihood.  The Irish Government has entered into discussions with the British Government and all of the parties in Northern Ireland in respect of the proposals that emanated from the British Government last year.  We have made it very clear we do not accept any unilateral actions in respect of legacy that would represent a breach of the Good Friday Agreement and subsequent agreements.</p></speech>

We have opposed them and have made it very clear to the British Government that there can be an amnesty for nobody.  State forces and governments have a higher moral order in how they conduct themselves, as does the government in any state.  Equally, no paramilitaries should have an amnesty either in respect of heinous crimes and murders that were committed against very many people.</p>  <p>  The Deputy is correct in saying people want closure, details and to find out what happened to their loved ones and who killed them.  Some, such as the two victims groups I met last week, know who killed their loved ones, but they want further information to establish if that could have been prevented, for example, and whether further preventative actions could have taken place with the use of informants, collusion and so on.</p></speech>

I am inundated with calls from customers.  There was a time when we had excellent repair and maintenance cover based at the Cahersiveen depot, which ceased in July 2021 when the last customer service technician retired.  In the 1980s and 1990s, there were up to 30 technicians based in the Cahersiveen depot.  They were excellent people who gave great service, with people such as Tom O'Shea who gave 46 years of loyal service, D&oacute;nal Clifford, Dave Fenton, Dermot Corkery and, in west Cork and west Kerry, Jim McCarthy.  These people retired but were not replaced.  They had local expertise, knowledge and experience and knew their customers and the terrain.  Unfortunately, upon their retirement, they have not been replaced.</p>  <p>  I know every last inch of the rugged beautiful coastline from Kenmare down through Sneem, Castlecove, Caherdaniel, Waterville, down into Portmagee, Ballinskelligs, over onto Valentia Island, up through Kells Bay and on over into Killorglin.  I know every last inch of it, but unfortunately the Eir customers in that area are not getting the service they should have.  I am asking the Taoiseach and the Government to intervene with Eir and to put people working on the ground.  We need maintenance and repair people.  The rugged coastline I have outlined to the House is beautiful but it gets a battering from the weather, which is why the poles, wires and whole service need to maintained.</p>  <p>  I pay a very special thanks to the operations manager, Mr. Pat O&rsquo;Sullivan, who always worked so diligently on behalf of all the customers and all of the other Eir staff, but they need help and people on the ground to carry out the basic maintenance that is required.  Connectivity is so important and the service is so vital in the areas I am talking about because they are predominantly rural areas.  Whether it is going up into places like Glencar or into the Bridia Valley or Cloon Lake, all of these people need service.  Some of them are possibly getting a little bit older, are vulnerable and want to have their landline.  Many of these people do not have a proper mobile service, and that is why it is so important.</p>  <p>  It might be asked, when it is a company in the way it is, in that it is not semi-State, why a person would be raising it with the Taoiseach.  I will tell him why.  It is because these people, some of whom are pensioners, are all taxpayers, workers, farmers and people we are here to represent.  Because of it being such a serious issue, that is why I wanted to bring it to the floor of the D&aacute;il, why I want the Taoiseach to take it on board and why I want him to know about the problem that is there.  I am asking him in a very humble way if he will contact Eir, let it know the issue was raised here today and let it know it is only common sense that when there is a service, maintenance people are needed to attend to the repairs and keep things right.</p></speech>

I appreciate the seriousness of the matter because connectivity is everything today in the modern era for work, education and quality of life.</p>  <p>  Eir has announced, as part of its &euro;1 billion capital investment programme, that it plans to invest &euro;500 million to expand its Irish fibre network to some 1.4 million premises in urban areas.  In August, Eir announced plans to expand its gigabit fibre network roll-out to a further 200,000 premises, bringing its planned deployment to 1.6 million premises.  This includes all towns and villages across Kerry that are not part of the Eir fibre broadband roll-out.  More than 28,000 premises in Kerry have been passed to date under Eir&rsquo;s programme.  Meanwhile, in early October 2021, SIRO announced phase 2 of its fibre broadband network roll-out.  This includes extensive plans for the main towns and villages in Kerry.  To date, SIRO has passed in excess of 16,000 homes and businesses as part of its Kerry fibre broadband roll-out programme.  I will talk to both companies to ensure the work continues.</p>  <p>  The roll-out of the national broadband plan in Kerry is proceeding.  This State-led intervention will be delivered, as the Deputy is aware, by National Broadband Ireland, NBI, under a contract to roll out high-speed, future-proofed broadband network within the intervention area.  This area covers 1.1 million people living and working in more than 544,000 premises, including almost 100,000 businesses and farms, and 679 schools.</p>  <p>  For the interest of the Deputy, I am advised by National Broadband Ireland that, at 31 January 2022, more than 295,000 premises have been surveyed nationally or have surveys under way, with in excess of 154,000 premises constructed or under construction across all counties, including Kerry.  There are 27,183 premises in the intervention area in County Kerry, of which more than 17,500 have been surveyed by NBI.  Surveying is completed in the deployment areas of Dingle, Rathmore, and Kilgarvan.  Pre-works are under way in the deployment areas of Ballyheigue and Castlegregory and main works are under way in the deployment areas of Tralee and Killarney, with in excess of 5,000 premises now available for order or pre-order and more than 8,800 premises progressing well through construction.  Further details are available on specific areas within County Kerry through the commercial operator websites and the NBI website, which provides a facility for any premises to query availability in this area.</p>  <p>  The broadband connection points, which are a key element of the NBP in providing high-speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll-out of the fibre to the home network, in the Kerry context are now installed at Gneeveguilla, Tureencahill, Valentia Cable Station, St Fiachna&rsquo;s Church, Old Railway Station Heritage Centre and community spaces in Cullenagh, Kielduff Community Centre, Chapeltown, Killeenliath, Kilmoyley Community Centre, Black Valley in Our Lady of the Valley Church, and I could go on.  There is also a long list where the NBI has installed connectivity for national schools, but the list is too long, although it is quite extensive as well.</p></speech>

That is the question I am raising today and it is the issue I want the Taoiseach to take back to Eir.  I wish the CEO of Eir very well.  The person is retiring and that person saw fit to bring in a new trainee to be trained for the role of CEO of the company.  It is recognised at the higher end that a person should be trained in, but technicians at ground level who keep the service going do not train in somebody beneath them.  It is done at the top, but it is not done where it really matters.  I am asking the company to recognise this.  When it was a semi-State company up until 1999 it was one of the best in the world.</p></speech>

That means investment from both the private sector and the State, which is investing very significantly in the intervention areas that are not covered by private sector companies.  Those areas are now earmarked in the national broadband plan.  The State is putting in a lot of investment, as the Deputy knows.

It also found that childcare managers have indicated major difficulties in the recruitment of staff.  This should not come as a shock to the Government because early years professionals are very poorly paid and their conditions are in need of massive improvement.  Indeed, the vast majority of childcare workers struggle to make ends meet.  They regularly do work for which they are not paid and, astonishingly, only 10% have paid maternity leave.  Their skill, professionalism, expertise and the contribution they make to the forming and education of young children are invaluable.  Their pay and conditions have to be addressed as a matter of urgency.  Staffing has gone beyond the crisis point in the sector.  Fair pay scales and a career path for early years professionals are urgently needed.  When will this happen?</p></speech>

I agree that career pathways have to be developed in early education and early childcare.  The funding has increased dramatically, from approximately &euro;69 million to &euro;207 million through to 2023, to facilitate that.  A joint labour committee has been formed and there will be engagement between employers and trade unions.  The trade unions will be well aware of the provision.  I want the mechanisms of the joint labour committee to get going so we can get this stage of investment in childcare organised by the autumn, and then in the budget do even more for childcare in terms of affordability, access and provision.</p></speech>

This legislation has long been promised by the Government.  Indeed, the then Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, promised it back in 2018 when we were debating the abortion legislation.  A Private Members' Bill to provide for safe access zones to protect women and healthcare staff will be debated on Committee Stage in Government time in the Seanad tomorrow.  Why will the Government not simply bring that legislation further?  I am glad it is giving Government time for it, but I understand from the spring legislative programme that the Government still intends to bring forward its own legislation rather than allowing this Private Members' Bill, which has cross-party support and the support of doctors, healthcare providers, Together for Safety and other advocacy groups, to be brought forward.  There is an extremely troubling report from Together for Safety that anti-choice activists have been obtaining information about dates and times of appointments for terminations so they can harass women.</p></speech>

It is an incredibly important issue that requires reform.  We must take a holistic approach in tackling the issue of drugs in Ireland.  Addiction requires a health-based approach, and the focus should be on harm reduction and prevention and, ultimately, saving lives.  Best practice, such as the Portuguese model, suggests that decriminalising possession of small amounts for personal use is very effective.  We must reform our drug policy and ensure it focuses on individuals and communities while holding criminality to account.  The citizens' assembly on biodiversity is very welcome, but the Government is also launching an assembly on the Dublin mayor.  Surely drug use is a much more pressing issue that is affecting countless communities and families.  Where is the citizens' assembly on drug use and why is it not being prioritised?</p></speech>

Due to Covid-19 we were not in a position to do that.  In terms of two of the commitments, one has been established on biodiversity, which is a crisis, and likewise with regard to the Dublin mayor, which had been agreed.  As regards drugs policy, it is our view that we will have a citizens' assembly in the latter part of this year.  However, that does not mean there is nothing happening with drugs policy.  It is an urgent and serious issue that has to be dealt with in the context of a community-up approach, with multidisciplinary supports going into the communities most affected, along with a health-based approach.  In any event, we are very seized of the serious situation in many communities as a result of drug abuse.</p></speech>

Obviously, because of the pandemic and its consequences, cancer care in the context of diagnosis, early treatment and early intervention has been severely curtailed.  In fact, according to some experts on cancer, there could be a five- to ten-year tailback in early intervention.  This is very serious for those who want to get screened and so forth.  What is this Administration doing at present to address those issues in cancer care?</p></speech>

Many activities that would have been taking place were suspended, particularly during severe surges of the Omicron, Delta and previous variants.  It has had a serious impact with regard to delayed diagnoses and on waiting lists.  In response to Covid-19 up to &euro;350 million has been allocated for waiting times and waiting lists.  Also, additional funding has been allocated to the national cancer strategy for increasing resources to enable hospitals and clinicians to deal with the increased workload that undoubtedly exists now.</p></speech>

Put simply, the price of meal has gone up by 30 cent and the price of bacon is down by 40 cent.  That equates to losses of roughly &euro;38 per sow.  There is a perfect storm here as these businesses cannot get work permits.  Countries like France, Poland, Denmark and Holland have introduced schemes to help their pig industries so why can we not do so here?  I said this to the Government yesterday.  Why do we have to wait until this industry is wiped out?  A perfect storm has been created by inflation and a lack of action from the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, and his Department.</p>  <p>  Other countries in the EU have acted on this and there are Brexit funds and Covid-19 payments among the many ways of supporting this industry during this crisis.  Otherwise we will not have a pig industry.  We were told that some of these people openly cried at the meeting, telling how they were in pig farming all their life but will have to give it up because it is not viable.  Will the Taoiseach ask the Minister to take action on this?  He knows the problems so he should try to help out these farmers.</p></speech>

It is a matter I have been working on for a significant number of weeks now and through the end of last year as the crisis emerged in the pig industry.  I have met representatives of the Irish Farmers Association national pig committee directly and last week I attended a meeting of the vast majority of pig farmers nationally at a centre in the Green Isle Hotel in Dublin.  I committed to work to deliver a support mechanism to help with the financial pressure they are currently experiencing.  I am working with my officials on that.  I met representatives of the banks as well as the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland to discuss supports and how to work with farmers through this very difficult period.  I am very much aware of the issue and the industry is facing challenging times.  It is subject to cycles but this is being acutely felt because of pressure from the input cost end and the price end.  I and my Government colleagues will work with this really important sector.  It is the third-largest part of our agrifood sector.</p></speech>

It has no building or location for operations and it is currently working out of a van.  If somebody is suicidal, he or she clearly needs privacy and support when waiting for an ambulance.  Such people need to be away from cameras and video devices.</p>  <p>  The chair of the group, Mr. Matthew Collins, and Aont&uacute; Limerick representative, Ms Sarah Beasley, are working hard to try to get a property.  There are countless council-owned vacant properties in Limerick so would it not be possible to get one of those buildings or a State building in use for that purpose as soon as possible?  Organisations such as the Claddagh Watch Patrol; Save Our Sons and Daughters, SOSAD; and Meath River Rescue are examples of organisations all around the country doing their best to prevent suicide at the coalface.

Over 2,000 eye care patients in Donegal have been waiting over a year to get necessary treatment due to the lack of an ophthalmic service in the county.  The ophthalmic service for the north west is now mostly based in Sligo University Hospital as Letterkenny does not currently have the required nursing and medical staff.  Despite this, there does not seem to be any push in putting in place the staff and facilities necessary for a properly functioning service at Letterkenny.  I wonder if the intention is to completely run down the service in Letterkenny altogether.  Will the Government ensure that Letterkenny University Hospital is not left behind once again and that a fully functioning ophthalmic service will be re-established there?</p></speech>

It is affecting a large number of families.</p>  <p>  I have three requests for the Taoiseach and his Ministers to consider.

As I said yesterday, the idea is to do what we can to alleviate the pressures families are experiencing now because of the increased cost of living and the inflation being generated internationally across the globe.  It is an international phenomenon for a number of reasons, including soaring oil and gas prices and congested supply chain logistics.  Supply is not meeting demand as we reopen from Covid-19.  Putting all these factors together, it leads to a very significant cycle of inflation.  We will bring forward a package of measures to try to help people.</p></speech>

On 23 October 2020, a civilian entered the Midlands Prison in Portlaoise in the company of a senior official and was identified as an Irish Prison Service, IPS, official.  That person was signed in at the gate as an IPS official.  The person entered the search area and I am informed was identified a number of times as an IPS official.  That person interviewed and spoke with members of the operational security group in the prison on the understanding that the person in question was an official of the IPS.  That person left the Midlands Prison and entered the maximum security prison next door, Portlaoise Prison, where the process was repeated.</p>  <p>  The rules are very clear in this regard.  On 8 November 2020, the Minister for Justice and her office was informed of the incident and gave assurances that an examination would happen.  The IPS was also notified by way of its chief Ms Karen McCaffrey.  An acting Minister for Justice was also notified.  The IPS indicated after investigation that there was no veracity to these allegations and at no stage was the visitor introduced as an IPS official.</p></speech>

This is particularly acute with An Bord Plean&aacute;la where many of the appeals, I would say the majority, are not dealt with within anything like the four-month statutory target.  It can take over a year to get permission for leave to seek substitute consent, for example.  When one finally gets the leave, if one does get the leave, to apply for substitute consent it can take two or three years to get the substitute consent.  This is utterly farcical given that many of these cases are very simple.  I know of a case going on for years that relates to one house and has no effect on the environment.  The house has been built.  When will the planning and development (judicial review) Bill and the planning development Bill come before the D&aacute;il?  Both are on the list for publication.  In the meantime, will extra staff be provided to An Bord Plean&aacute;la to allow it to make decision in an appropriate and speedy manner?  </p></speech>

In my constituency of Dublin Rathdown, families are paying up to &euro;1,500 per month, which is essentially a second mortgage.  While it is extremely welcome that the universal subsidy has had an impact, for some families it amounts to only &euro;80 per month.  In light of the rising costs in the general economy, will the Government look at widening that universal subsidy and, more importantly, look at a genuine tax rebate scheme to take the pressure off working families across the country?</p></speech>

We have taken important measures in this year's budget to provide core funding to childcare providers to enable them to better pay their staff, so we can get that quality and we can retain staff in the sector.  In exchange for that, we will get the fee-freeze mechanism, which will be the first time in the State we have ever had such a mechanism.  We have brought in some other changes in this year's budget including the extension of the universal payment and the removal of the wraparound hours for children in services in areas of disadvantage.  The key technique we have now is the national childcare scheme.  There is a strong commitment, which is shared across all parties in government, that we will continue to extend out and invest significantly in the scheme.

Yesterday it sent notice to almost 100 directly employed retail security officers that their jobs are going to be outsourced to OCS.  There has been no engagement whatsoever with the workers.  It means that workers, who in some cases have worked for up to two decades with Tesco, are being given a few weeks to choose between redundancy or being outsourced.  If they are outsourced to OCS, it is very likely their terms and conditions will be undermined over time.  There are no guarantees.  OCS could lose the Tesco contract.  Would the Taoiseach agree that Tesco should immediately withdraw this approach and this attempt to outsource these jobs?  The idea that it is negotiating on other aspects of its workers' terms and conditions while pursuing this outsourcing is obviously ridiculous.  It shows that the company is negotiating in very bad faith.  Tesco is still highly profitable.  These are the workers who were clapped and who kept supermarkets open.  Instead of outsourcing jobs they should be increasing wages, as happened in Dunnes Stores, and they should be improving terms and conditions.</p></speech>

I am not supportive of the outsourcing policy or trend.  Ireland is very close to full employment in our economy.  In that context, it is crucial that there are quality jobs, and that pay and conditions reflect the talent, commitment and enthusiasm of those who are working for firms and companies.  The policy outlined by the Deputy seems to me to be counter-intuitive and counterproductive for retaining staff.</p></speech>

Specifically, what progress has been made in acquiring the site and taking it into public ownership so that a national public hospital can be built on a site owned by the public?  We have passed three motions.  On the last occasion, the Taoiseach said that motions do not build hospitals.  When motions are unanimously accepted in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, as these motions have been, they tell the Taoiseach what the D&aacute;il wants.  In that context, what progress has been made to acquire the site?</p></speech>

I do not have the full details yet but I hope the Minister will be coming to the Cabinet soon with a memorandum that we can then bring before the House.</p></speech>

There are 107 dentists in Meath, as listed on the government website.  To my knowledge, not one of them is accepting new clients with medical cards.  There are 35 in Navan, five in Trim and two in Enfield.  This is for a population of 210,000.  It is a serious issue.  The dispute between the HSE and the dentists has gone on for more than 13 months.</p> <p>It needs to be resolved.  Is there any sign of that?  I receive calls every day from patients in distress because no dentist in the county is accepting medical cards.</p></speech>

It is about the fact that the British Government was responsible for death squads that executed Irish people.  There is a responsibility on us in here to highlight the issue.  We need to be incredibly strong in regard to the fact that the amnesty legislation is just not going to cut it in terms of human rights and where right-thinking people are.  We need to deal with the reports of the ombudsman, in particular the latest one.  We also need to deal with some of the outstanding issues in this State.  I refer to the Glenanne gang killing two people in Dundalk in the Kay's Tavern bombing, and the death of Seamus Ludlow and the requirement on the State to carry out an inquiry into how that was handled.  We need to deal with the issue of collusion, which was about the British Government feeling it had the right and ability to carry out executions of nationalists in Ireland.</p></speech>

We do not believe in unilateral action on legacy issues.  The British and Irish Governments and all the parties in Northern Ireland have entered into an intergovernmental conference on this in terms of the legacy overall.  It is a very important issue.  There can be no amnesty for anybody, state or non-state, who committed appalling murders or who colluded in committing appalling murders.  There can be no amnesty for such acts.</p></speech>

They still receive no illness benefit, and there is no pension scheme in place for them.  School secretaries were, as we know, to the forefront in dealing with the pandemic and making sure our schools stayed open, dealing with parents, students and teachers, with none of the benefits.  It is disgraceful that we are in a situation whereby they must sign on during the Christmas and Easter holidays, considering the job they do.  They are valued members of our school communities the length and breadth of the country.  The WRC has instructed that further talks take place on 24 February.  I ask the Taoiseach to ensure that these workers, who are predominantly women, are treated not just with platitudes but with remuneration and that they have a proper standing within the Department of Education.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-02-09a.240" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1507" speakername="Darren O'Rourke" time="13:02:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020900026#Z00800"><p>I move:</p> <blockquote> 	That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to require the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications to draft and publish a hydrogen strategy within six months of the passing of this Act.  </blockquote>  <p>I welcome the opportunity to introduce the Bill, along with my colleagues Deputies R&eacute;ada Cronin, Johnny Guirke and Maurice Quinlivan.  Hydrogen generated from renewable energy sources through electrolysis of water is emerging as a sustainable solution for the decarbonisation of many sectors.  It has, for example, the potential to act as a store of surplus renewable energy, an alternative source of heat for homes and businesses and an alternative source of fuel in the transport sector, including for long haul and heavy goods vehicles, HGVs.  In the words of Ms Marie Donnelly, chair of the Climate Change Advisory Council, in response to me in a recent Oireachtas committee meeting, there is a lot of talk about hydrogen at the moment but perhaps not enough strategic planning around it.  We need a plan and we need to get the picture on the page so that we can see what it looks like.  This Bill calls on the Minister to publish a green hydrogen strategy within six months of its passing and sets out the framework for that strategy.  It is an important and necessary step.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-02-09a.241" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1585" speakername="R&eacute;ada Cronin" time="13:02:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020900026#Z00900"><p>I am delighted to introduce this Bill, along with our climate spokesperson, Deputy O'Rourke, and Deputies Guirke and Quinlivan.  Green hydrogen offers major possibilities, but achieving them requires a strategy.  Green hydrogen is an alternative fuel for transport, including long haul drivers and HGVs, which are important in my constituency, Kildare North.  It is fast becoming something of a logistics hub.  Climate change is thundering towards us.  Continents are burning and Europe is being washed away, yet despite a small fortune being spent on climate consultants and advisers we do not have a hydrogen strategy.  We are not even preventing climate change at this stage; rather, we are mitigating.  The strategy in the Bill will help us to address our fuel needs and meet our Paris commitments.  Just transition must be central to all we do, because we cannot have climate apartheid, whereby one group has electric vehicles in their driveways and solar panels on their retrofitted holiday homes while others cannot put their heating on.  It would be inherently wrong and socially destabilising.  This is a leap we must make together and our Bill will help us to achieve that.  We cannot delay and depend on the private sector.  I am glad to put this Bill before the D&aacute;il.</p></speech>

Our island has one of the best offshore wind energy potential in the world, and if we can harness a portion of it for the production of green hydrogen, we can create thousands of jobs in rural Ireland and become exporters of this renewable energy to Europe, which will create wealth for citizens here.  We want an all-Ireland approach on this, with a co-ordinated plan to develop hydrogen plants and storage facilities across the island.  I assure the House of the co-operation of Sinn F&eacute;in ministers in Stormont on this issue.  In 2020, Canada, Chile, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Russia, Spain and the EU adopted hydrogen strategies.  Unfortunately, in Ireland we have seen very little action on this.  The 2021 climate action plan only made fleeting references to green hydrogen.  We now need a national green hydrogen strategy that will outline how the State intends to invest in this renewable energy resource to make a return for citizens and provide private industry with a roadmap and assurance that Ireland wants to be a leader in this area.</p></speech>

Despite this, we do not have a hydrogen strategy.  By comparison, the European Commission published its strategy in July 2020 and our neighbours in Scotland published a strategy in 2015.  The lack of a strategy jeopardises our ability to make the most of our abundant renewable resources through the creation of a complementary hydrogen network.  It also limits our potential to secure funding and be a green hydrogen leader.  The coalition Government is behind the curve on offshore renewables.  This has to change, and change rapidly.  The Bill seeks to ensure the State is prepared to realise the full potential of green hydrogen through the preparation of a national hydrogen strategy and, to this end, includes provision for comprehensive consultation with stakeholders.  Along with my colleagues Deputies O&rsquo;Rourke, Cronin and Guirke, Sinn F&eacute;in is happy to introduce the legislation.</p></speech>

It supports the work of the Cabinet committee on housing, which oversees the delivery of housing for all.  The unit undertakes ongoing monitoring and tracking of the actions in the plan and prepares quarterly progress reports.  The most recent of these, for quarter 4 2021, was published in late January and shows significant progress, including affordability measures such as the new local authority home loan, the extension of help to buy, the delivery of cost-rental homes and a cap on rent increases.  Other progress includes the launch of project tosaigh and our commitment to delivery, with more than 200 new staff approved for local authority delivery teams.</p> <p>There are signs that the sector is rebounding from what has been a very challenging number of years due to the Covid pandemic.  More than 20,000 new dwellings were completed in 2021, with more than 30,000 commencements in the same period.  Planning permission figures are also strong.  The housing crisis will take time to resolve but we are confident that with sustained momentum on implementation of the plan, its benefits will become tangible.</p> <p> The unit supports the delivery of wider public investment through Project Ireland 2040, which falls under the Cabinet committee on economic recovery and investment.  The unit is also responsible for developing the national risk assessment, which provides a high-level overview of strategic risks facing the country.  The latest national risk assessment was published in December 2021, with inputs from a public consultation process through which more than 50 organisations, public representatives and individuals made submissions.</p> <p> The experience of recent years has demonstrated the importance of strategic risk management and preparedness.  By promoting an open and inclusive discussion on the major risks facing the country, the national risk assessment plays an important role in this work.  The unit, part of the broader economic division in my Department, maintains an overview of progress in key policy areas in line with Government priorities, and provides me with briefing and speech material on infrastructure, housing and related policy issues.</p></reply>

He knows the importance of funding under the Trans-European Network for Transport, TEN-T.  In December 2021, the European Commission published its proposals for a revised TEN-T, which remains largely unchanged.  Crucially, it does not include the western rail corridor.  Given the core funding of 85% that will be earmarked and provided between now and 2030, the western arc in the revised TEN-T is really important.  The west of Ireland and, in particular, the north west is the only region in Ireland that is no longer a developed region.  It has been downgraded to a region in transition.  We need to see investment in the west and it cannot be shafted in place of the eastern seaboard.  We are not looking for one or the other.  We are looking for our fair share in the west of Ireland and we need it for transport.  Why is there not more emphasis on the west, the north west and the western arc in particular, under TEN-T funding?</p></speech>

I know he has more work to do on that and he is due to visit the constituency and meet public representatives.  A key element of that is the delivery of housing.  We have 19 sites in public ownership with 28 ha of land which provide a great opportunity to deliver a mix of housing for a community that really deserves and will benefit from that investment.  I am talking about public investment in public housing.  Working with the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, will the Taoiseach continue to ensure Dublin City Council, which owns that land, shows ambition to deliver the type of housing the Government wants?</p></speech>

I spoke to the Taoiseach and regarding the southern relief road in Carlow.  I am now glad that the strategic assessment report, SAR, has been completed by Carlow County Council and it has recently been given clearance to proceed to prepare a preliminary business case, for which I thank the Taoiseach.  However, other projects like this one are not progressing due to lack of funding.  The level of funding available in the first half of the national development plan is not enough to progress all the schemes committed to.  Other Deputies have raised this with the Taoiseach and more will do so.  My concern is for the N24 and N25 roads.  I spoke to the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, on this on this and I am happy he has agreed to meet the Deputies and councillors from the area.</p>  <p>  We spoke about the cost of living and housing.  The biggest issue relating to adaptation grants for local authorities is that the grant is not big enough.  Several people have come to my office in recent months saying they cannot afford to make up the shortfall after receiving the local authority adaptation grant.  Given the cost of living and the cost of materials, we need to look at the grants because they are affecting older people and others who need them.</p></speech>

Earlier, I heard the Taoiseach ask whether Opposition Deputies had any solutions.  Uniquely we have repeatedly argued for actual rent controls where we set rents.  A transition year school student, Shyanne, is doing her work placement in my office this week.  I asked her to see if she could find any rent control regimes anywhere else that might work here so that we could perhaps explain them to the Taoiseach.  Within a few minutes, she came up with the example of France, which has just introduced a new regime of rent controls, just like the one we are proposing.  Rents are now set on a district-by-district basis to ensure affordability, based on the size and the age of the property.  There is a proposal from a transition year student, one that is actually being applied.  Why does the Government not try that when its policies are so obviously failing?</p></speech>

What does the Taoiseach believe is an affordable rent for a one-bedroom apartment in Dublin?  This week, South Dublin County Council announced that people will shortly be able to apply for its first affordable rental scheme.  Rents for a one-bedroom apartment will be approximately &euro;1,000 a month.  Ten years ago, the average market rent for a one-bedroom apartment in the area was less than &euro;750.  We now have this so-called affordable option for &euro;1,000.  If the Government's definition of "affordable" is not actually affordability but instead taking a completely sky-high unaffordable market rate and then chopping 30% off it, it is still unaffordable.  It does not make it affordable for ordinary people.  Does the Taoiseach think &euro;1,000 is affordable or does he agree we need to build genuinely affordable housing with rents linked to people's incomes and not to the market?</p></speech>

By the way, apartments are homes.  Figures published today by PNB Paribas Real Estate show that institutional investors paid up to 32% more per home compared with individual household buyers.  This is pushing up house prices and rents.  While the number of homes being built is increasing each year, the number of homes available to buy is not increasing and remains stuck at only 7,500 homes a year.  The share of new housing available for individual households to buy has decreased from more than half of annual output in 2017 to just one third last year.  Will the Government end favourable tax treatment for investment funds to give individuals a fair chance to buy their own home?  Is the Taoiseach concerned that the number of new-build homes available for individuals to buy is not increasing?</p></speech>

In many ways both parties have skewed the housing market significantly.  A young family looking to buy a house needs to compete with an institution that has a tax regime not comparable to the young family's.  It may pay no tax, but certainly pays a very small amount compared with the family it is competing against.  It is getting an interest rate on international markets of 0% or a little above compared with what the young family must pay here.  Those institutions are also basing their investments on the rental income that will be achieved.  The Government is standing over a market that is stacked against young families being able to purchase homes at the moment.</p>  <p>  In response to a parliamentary question this week I found out that the number of social houses being leased by local authorities has doubled in just three years.  Last year, &euro;100 million was spent on leasing social housing from institutions.  When this is added to housing assistance payment, HAP, hundreds of millions of euro are going into the pockets of private developers when the State could be building those homes for these people and getting a rental income from it.  It is wrong.</p></speech>

The disruption took the form of the erection of a blockade comprising a van and cones at the entrance to the site where the school is based, the diagonal parking of a car on the site where the school staff normally park their cars, and the parking of a truck extremely close to the entrance to the school.  The actions involved the owner of the site and the school building, who wants to sell the site for development and apartments, which would involve knocking the school building.  The school has legal rights as the tenant of the site.  It is under no obligation to vacate in the immediate future.  Will the Taoiseach join me in condemning these bully-boy tactics employed against a group of female teachers and the young children they teach?</p></speech>

As for housing, we all know that a major issue is delivering on supply.  That will not happen straight away, no matter whose policies are implemented.  The difficulty we have at present is that there are people paying huge and disgraceful rents to the extent that I just do not understand how they could have operated before this cost-of-living crisis.  There is something we can do.  We need to revisit a ban on rent increases because, obviously, the 10% increase in rents shows that anything that has been done, including rent pressure zones and caps, has failed to deliver.  It is as simple as that.</p>  <p>  I am also making a call in respect of regeneration schemes in Dundalk, particularly one in Muirhevnamore that needs to be revisited.  I will contact the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage about that.  It may be that projects that were shelved or put to one side need to be looked at.  There are huge maintenance issues, and that is part of the retrofitting scheme.</p></speech>

It related to the western rail corridor.  The western rail corridor is now being considered in the context of the all-island rail strategy that the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, has agreed with his counterpart in Northern Ireland.  Through the shared island initiative, we have agreed to fund an overall strategic review of the all-island approach to rail.  The majority of funding for infrastructure in the next ten years, be it rail or roads, will be Exchequer funding through the national development plan.  I take the Deputy's point about the review that is under way involving the EU and the work on the TEN-T, but all the representatives of the west of all parties, including mine, have been very clear to us about the importance of the western rail corridor.  There were earlier feasibility studies, as the Deputy will be aware, so we decided to have this as part of the broader all-island review, which is important to do.</p>  <p>  Deputy McAuliffe raised the situation in Ballymun and the need for housing development on land owned by the local authority.  I met recently with a range of community leaders and representatives of various organisations in Ballymun with him.  Their presentation was very important insofar as they highlighted the enormous challenges facing the community across the board and the need for a range of initiatives to be undertaken from early education to education to employment and, in particular, to making sure we can accelerate the construction of housing on those sites.  I said to the community leaders, and I would say to the Deputy and to the council involved - the city council, I think, in this instance - that they should move at all speed to develop plans and designs for those sites for housing.  As I said earlier, we need supply.  If we have State land available, it should be used.  There should be no excuse for delay in the utilisation of State lands in the possession of local authorities.  We have been asking other State agencies to provide land for realising the objectives of Housing for All.  Where the council owns lands, that should be pursued.</p>  <p>  Deputy Murnane O'Connor is a very active and persistent public representative and has pocketed one TII development with the southern relief road for Carlow and its proceeding with the preliminary business case.  There are Deputies across the House who would like that news for other projects in which they are involved.  I take Deputy Murnane O'Connor's point about the N24 and the N25.  I am glad that the Minister for Transport is meeting with the Deputies concerned.  The NDP has limits, but this is still an enormous sum and there are huge challenges in getting all of it spent in a proper way.  Very significant increases are being given this year in respect of the adaptation grants.  There was a lot of delay because of the Covid lockdown, but I hope we can get some progress.  I hear what the Deputy says about the gaps, given the increase in the cost of materials and so on, which is leading to construction inflation.</p>  <p>  To respond to Deputy Boyd Barrett, we have rent controls here.</p></speech>

The 2% limit was introduced by legislation in December.  It will take some time to bed in.  The rent control board will carry out its own engagement with landlords to make sure that the legislation is adhered to.  The rent pressure zones have been around for quite some time and are similar to the measures in France that the Deputy suggested.  The overall point I will make is that this comes back to supply.  We need cost-rentals, private rental and private homes but we also need very significant social housing provision, which we are doing.  We need to support affordable housing to get to 33,000 units of mixed tenure type per annum.  A lot hinges on supply.</p>  <p>  I would make the same point in response to Deputy Murphy .  Rents are too high in Dublin, but cost rentals are well below the market rate.</p></speech>

In fact, our social housing programme is quite good in that respect.  Likewise, HAP is a support to many low-income families in getting access to housing.  Our preference, however, is to build more houses and to build social housing through the approved housing bodies and the local authorities in order that people can get access to social houses rather than having to rent at excessive rates.  Our preference is also to get more private rental supply.  If we inhibit private rental supply, rents will go even higher.  There simply are not enough apartments or houses being built.  The good news is that in the past year there have been 30,000 commencements.  We have to maintain that right throughout 2022.</p></speech>

We have been in government for one year and a half and we have been endeavouring to deal with the issue of viability.  Builders are saying they cannot build apartments and get a return.  There has been a particular absence of compact growth.  We want to build more in the city centres, where the services are.  The Housing for All strategy has developed the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe fund to see whether we can trigger greater investment in cost-rentals and greater apartment building.  As for houses and housing estates, owner occupiers are no longer competing with funds because there are planning regulations and additional taxation measures there to prohibit that.</p>  <p>  To respond to Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n, Fianna F&aacute;il is not a party entirely of the free market.  Fianna F&aacute;il has always believed in State development and State involvement in the economy from its earliest days, from establishing State bodies and investment in public housing right across the board.  We also believe in development and enterprise and the individual entrepreneur and entrepreneurial spirit.  That is important.  Likewise, however, there has to be a strong State in respect of health, education, childcare and so on.</p></speech>

This is welcome.  Action on the lack of refuge spaces and capacity across the State has been delayed on the basis that this work had not been completed.  County Roscommon is one of nine counties across the State to have no refuge spaces for women or children.  Together, Roscommon, Galway and Mayo have a population of more than 228,000 women.  According to Safe Ireland, based on the Istanbul Convention, those three counties should have 46 refuge spaces.  There are 14.  We know there is a shortage of childcare workers, psychologists and other wraparound care providers and that many existing services are heavily reliant on fundraising.  Where State funding is available, it is not provided on a multi-annual basis.  There is no dedicated funding strategy to address how we are to reach the levels outlined in the Istanbul Convention.  With regard to what is to come before Cabinet next week, will the Taoiseach confirm that the existing gaps in respect of refuge spaces will be addressed in what the Government will propose on the back of that review?</p></speech>

In two weeks' time, a ROSA activist, Aislinn O'Keeffe, faces trial accused of organising a small protest in Limerick against gender-based violence.  We have also seen more and more use of the law against striking workers, for example, the Debenhams workers last year.  Does the Taoiseach agree that the right to protest is a fundamental human right and that protest should not be criminalised?  Zac and Orla face the threat of imprisonment, Orla for allegedly painting "No more empty promises" on a Department building in reference to climate and Zac simply for allegedly filming that act.  The real criminals are the big business polluters and the head-in-the-sand politicians.  Activists like Orla, Zac and Aislinn should be congratulated, not criminalised.</p></speech>

She will therefore be publishing that review along with both interim and medium-term plans to provide for and develop those places, which we need.  The Deputy has highlighted this need in respect of Roscommon.  The report was submitted to the Ministers, Deputies O'Gorman and Naughton, and presented to the monitoring committee for the national strategy.  There is significant underprovision in eight counties and other counties could also do with more places.  From a capital perspective, the funding is there to be provided.  Operationally, we need to move much faster.  My understanding is that, under the present arrangements, a group has to apply to become a social housing body.  My personal observation is that this is too unwieldy.  The Minister wants to talk to the NGOs and organisations involved and to put some further ideas to them.  The strategy on gender-based violence will go for consultation again to make sure that people are comfortable with all of its aspects.  The Minister wants to make sure that, when we publish the review, we also have a delivery mechanism.</p>  <p>  In the interim, local authorities should work now with service providers to provide additional places.  There will be some structural changes following the strategy but we cannot wait until then.  We should start working now, where feasible.  Deputy Fleming has been working with a local group in Laois and has said they have basically reached agreement with regard to the development of a centre there.  That decision was arrived at locally and the local authority and others were involved.  The group is going to apply for approved social housing body status.</p>  <p>  We need to move faster with regard to the provision of places.  We should design these centres properly.  There should be, in essence, a national design.  We must then provide the requisite funding to provide proper services because many services have grown from the ground up, acquiring buildings and adding onto them.  We should design proper, comprehensive centres that accommodate all needs and facilitate the work of professionals.  There should be proper rooms and facilities for proper engagement with children and women in such centres.</p>  <p>  The Deputy mentioned the situation in Roscommon.  We are quite happy to work with the local authority there.  I will mention the issue to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage and to the Minister for Justice.  I am satisfied that this will work out in the medium term as the strategy is developing and that we will have a better system in place to deal with the provision of places but we need to do work in the interim to provide more places for the women who need them.</p>  <p>  On Deputy Paul Murphy's question, these are cases that are coming before the courts and it is not appropriate for me to comment on them.  I do not believe this country is criminalising protest at all.  I am committed to parliamentary democracy and to the right to freedom of expression and the right to freedom of speech.  I have always been committed to those universal rights.  I am thankful that this country celebrates those rights.  We are part of the European Union, which remains one of the last bastions protecting these rights.  I agree with the American President that the world is becoming increasingly polarised between authoritarian regimes and democratic regimes.</p></speech>

The ten Cabinet committees established by this Government reflect the full range of policy areas on which it will work on during its lifetime, as set out in the programme for Government.  Cabinet committees meet regularly to continue this work.  Strategy statements prepared by Departments reflect the key national priorities as outlined in the programme for Government.</p>  <p>  My Department has been involved in progressing some key programme for Government commitments in recent months, including ongoing monitoring and management of the impact of Covid-19 on the provision of Covid and non-Covid healthcare; driving delivery of our commitments to a shared island on a whole-of-government basis through the shared island unit in my Department; the establishment of a unit in my Department to help support social dialogue; the implementation of the Housing for All strategy, which is driving delivery of key housing-related commitments; the delivery of the economic recovery plan, which was published on 1 June, and for which a progress report will be advanced in the coming period outlining the considerable progress the plan has made in transitioning Ireland's economy; and developing a well-being framework for Ireland, the first report of which was approved by Government and published in July, while a well-being portal and well-being information hub have been developed, a follow-up phase of consultation and engagement on the initial framework has recently finished, and a second report will be published this year.</p>  <p>  Other aspects include, harnessing digital, with the digital Ireland framework having been published on 1 February and which is a high-level framework with clear targets and deliverables to support Ireland's ambition to be a digital leader, to the benefit of our economy and society; the signing into law of the Climate Action and  Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021, the marine planning framework, the Maritime Area Planning Act 2021 and the publication of the climate action plan 2021; engagement with European Union leaders to advance a range of high-level objectives in the programme for Government, particularly concerning those aspects relating to Brexit, Covid-19, the European Union budget and the European Green Deal; the implementation of Global Ireland 2025; supporting the work of the United Nations, through our membership of the UN Security Council; the establishment of a future of media commission; the completion of the work of the Citizens' Assembly on Gender Equality; and ongoing oversight of the implementation of A Policing Service for our Future, which is the Government's plan to implement the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.</p>  <p>  Ensuring progress on implementation of the programme for Government will continue to be a priority across all Departments, as well as through the work of the Cabinet committees.

Far from increasing their availability, local employment services, along with job clubs, are being dismantled.  The Taoiseach will know that many of those involved in local employment services - I see them in Ballaghaderreen and Ballinasloe in my constituency, while the Taoiseach will have seen similar people in his constituency - have given 25 years of service and dedication and they are vastly experienced.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, has repeatedly told me there was an EU requirement that required her to procure and tender out for local employment services and job clubs.  The directive and the European Commission have been clear, however, that member states are not obliged to contract out the provision of services where they wish to provide them themselves.  Regardless, even if there was a requirement to tender for these services, there is no requirement to change the model.</p>  <p>  We are removing the community, not-for-profit basis that has worked so well and moving to a payment-by-results model, which we have already seen through JobPath has not worked.  More than 320,000 people have been referred to JobPath, 6.8% of whom have sourced employment that has lasted for a year, at a cost of &euro;250 million to taxpayers.  The Taoiseach knows the local employment services and job clubs in his constituency, as I do in mine.  They are being dismantled.  It is going to remove the walk-in and wrap-around services being provided.  For some people, it is not a case of getting a job or any job.  Some people require wrap-around services they could get through the LES and the job clubs within their community.  That will now be gone.</p>  <p>  I know the Irish Local Development Network, ILDN, has raised this issue with the Taoiseach.  I would like to get his views on this matter because, to date, the relevant joint committee and the Committee of Public Accounts have not been listened to regarding the LES and job clubs.  We want to see the community-based, not-for-profit model, which has worked, being retained.</p></speech>

I have raised two instances of people in homeless emergency accommodation who have secured employment, which has put them over the relevant income thresholds, and who have then been threatened with being, or actually have been, put out of emergency homeless accommodation.  I have now encountered a third family in that situation this week.  Two people working are in homeless accommodation because cannot afford the rents, which I remind the Taoiseach in my area average &euro;2,200, so who could afford them, and they are being told they have to leave emergency accommodation.  Will the Taoiseach please do something about this?</p>  <p>  It is bad enough we have the housing crisis and cannot deliver social housing.  By the way, if there was the social housing the Government has said it is going to supply, these people would not be thrown out of it because their income happened to rise, or even if it were to rise above the threshold, because there would be a differential rent.  Ironically, however, if they are homeless, because the State has not delivered social housing, when people go over the income threshold, they are evicted from their homeless accommodation.  This is bizarre, and as I told the Taoiseach yesterday, this is happening in a council area run by Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party and where, last year, zero council houses were built.  This year they are going to get five.  This is the supply the Taoiseach is talking about.  This is a Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party council, and I just wonder if the Minister is aware of this.  Does he know that is what is going on?  When the Taoiseach says the Government is going to deliver housing supply, does the Minister know there are local authorities that are producing zero council houses or five next year?  Seriously, there is a big disconnect between the plans, the rhetoric and the promises and what is happening on the ground.</p>  <p>  The reason these families are being thrown out of their accommodation is because of the income thresholds set by the Taoiseach's Government and successive governments before this one.  The Department has been reviewing the income thresholds since Deputy Alan Kelly was Minister with responsibility for housing.  I have been appealing and asking about this of five different Ministers at this stage and I have received the same answer from every single Minister: we are reviewing them.  It is the longest review I have ever seen in my life.  It is never completed.  What I think, when a review of income thresholds goes on for that long, is that it reduces the numbers on the list and makes the statistics look good.  That is why the Department does not want to review them upwards because it does not want to increase eligibility for social housing.  That is what is going on - honestly.  It is obvious at this stage.  There cannot be any other explanation, unless the Taoiseach is going to tell me the limits are going to be varied next week.  I would love if the Taoiseach told me that, but I do not believe he will.  He is going to tell me they are being reviewed.</p></speech>

The Minister has received significant legal advice in respect of the European directive and the need to adhere to it.  The Minister, in the designing of the tendering process and framework, has put a fairly high premium on community involvement and engagement.  In some cases, that is a key factor in terms of capacity to be successful in tendering for a variety of these services.  The Minister has received very strong legal advice regarding what she can and cannot do.</p>  <p>  We acknowledge that in certain areas there has been a more community-based approach, especially in areas of high disadvantage.  We will continue to look at those.  The Minister has taken on board quite a number of the representations people have made on the issue.  There is only so far she can go, however, because of legal constraints in respect of tendering, the need to tender and so forth.</p> <p> The situation right now is that there are shortages all over in various sectors, including the hospitality sector and construction.  I can recall not so long ago people in the House saying we should keep the pandemic unemployment payment going and keep this and that going.  The reality now is that many sectors have lots of vacancies and they do not have enough people within society and within the economy to fill the jobs that are available.  We have a different kind of problem now in respect of economic growth and development, coming back from the Covid situation when restrictions have been lifted not just here but everywhere.  That is creating its own challenges in terms of inflation and so on.  It is impacting on our economic recovery insofar as the cost of living is very much impacting on people and causing them a lot of pressure.</p> <p> I will raise with the Minister again the issue the Deputy has raised here today.  I am familiar enough with the issues.  There is a need in certain areas to make sure we have tailor-made services.  I spoke recently to a community representative who said to me it is not really about job activation or about jobs first.  It is about getting people in terms of training and acclimatisation, because with the difficulties and challenges people have had in their lives, we need a whole range of programmes to get them even thinking of progressing to employment.  That has to be factored in to whatever services are provided.</p> <p> To Deputy Boyd Barrett, my view is that no one in a homelessness situation should be removed or asked to leave a homeless accommodation environment just because his or her income went up.  If that person is still homeless, he or she should be facilitated to stay in the facility until that person gets a social house.  There needs to be a common-sense perspective applied by the local authorities in that situation.</p></speech>

He recognised that, and we have been, since we came into office, very serious about social housing.  There have been a number of years where it has taken a while to catch up.  We want to do 9,500 this year in terms of direct builds.  The approved social housing bodies have taken up a lot of the slack in providing housing.  Those bodies have done good work and we have great trust in them in terms of Housing First and the homelessness strategy.  The local authorities are being resourced now to ramp up their housing programmes and get projects under way.  Some local authorities are doing very well, others not so well.  Some local authorities quite simply had lost the human resources capacity to deliver meaningful social housing programmes.  That has been rectified by the Minister and I think we will see, in respect of social housing, stronger and higher outputs from local authorities to balance the output from the approved social housing bodies.  It is preferable that we would build more social houses as opposed to relying unduly on the housing assistance payment, HAP, system.  The HAP system has been in place for almost ten years now.</p></speech>

What we can do is rebalance that equation over time.  If we did that, we would then free up more houses for the private market as well, for cost rental and so on.  We can have all the politics about it and I respect people's views and different perspectives, but I keep coming back to the point that we need to get supply up.  Twenty thousand houses are not going to solve our housing crisis.  Before that it was even lower.  There is no question that Covid affected it in 2020 and 2021.  Without housing supply, however, we are not going to resolve the issues around housing.  We need to give people access to a whole range of options in terms of owning and renting homes and apartments. That involves cost rental and affordable housing.  The State has allocated &euro;4 billion per annum for the next ten years.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-02-09a.319" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1596" speakername="Robert Troy" time="14:02:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020900032#LL00200"><p>I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>  <p>  It is accepted by most representatives in the House that the transformation of this country's economy from an inward-looking, State-dominated economic model to one of export-oriented growth, dynamic competition and increased choice for our citizens has resulted in unimaginable societal and economic progress for the State and its people over the past 30 years or so.  Much of this progress arose from policy decisions made and voted on by the Oireachtas, driven by the desire of previous Members of this House to end the relentless emigration of our people and pursue the idea that this nation's living standards could be as good, if not better, than those of our European neighbours.</p>  <p>  As a country, we have surpassed even those goals, not by accident, but by the decisive and deliberate efforts of Governments to ensure that Ireland continues to have a competitive economy, not for its own purpose, but to fund a fair and inclusive society with high levels of educational attainment, good-quality employment and social supports for our citizens.  The advance of our integration into the EU's Internal Market has not only created record levels of employment, but has also benefited our citizens in the choice of goods and services that they can access in Ireland for competitive prices.</p>  <p>  We are all aware, however, that there are sections of our economy that are less competitive than others and, in some instances, have conspired to keep it that way.  We are all far too aware of sectors that still have high costs associated with the services they provide, resulting in high profits but underwhelming services.  We know practices that drive out competition, drive up costs for ordinary citizens and undermine the dynamic nature of our economy.  This is why I am particularly determined to introduce this Bill to the House for Members' consideration.  I hope that this legislation will go a long way in deliberately disrupting firms and companies that do not play fair, try to drive out competition and seek to rig the system to increase profits in an unfair manner.</p>  <p>  The purpose of the Bill is to introduce measures that will strengthen the powers of our national competition authorities and give them greater tools to tackle anti-competitive practices.  For too long, this State has been seen as soft on rogue businesses and those seeking to game the system.  This view, regardless of whether it is justified, does significant damage to Ireland's credibility as a place to do business and undermines our people's confidence in government and Government agencies.  We see continued frustration with the high cost of insurance, which is driving many small enterprises and community groups out of business.  When that occurs, the impact on local employment and creativity can be profound.  I share that frustration.  Despite some of the most significant reforms to the law pertaining to competition, consumer rights and personal injuries in recent years, premiums have not dropped sufficiently and uniformly despite assurances made by the insurance sector.  It is fair to say that the outcome of the recent investigation by the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, into the motor insurance market leaves questions unanswered.  It also shows the need for legislation, which I am introducing today.</p>  <p>  Let me be clear that this Government wants to see severe consequences for companies that engage in price fixing, bid rigging or any other form of anti-competitive practice that does damage to our economy and our people.</p> <p>We believe unlawful actions by companies should have strict and severe consequences.  Penalties are needed for unlawful actions.  This is the reason for the introduction of this Bill.  We are seeking to give teeth to our agencies charged with protecting consumers and our economy.  We need to resource these agencies properly and give them the powers required through legislation to carry out their tasks effectively and efficiently.<br/><br/>As Members of the House will know, Ireland has two national administrative competition authorities: the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, and the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.  This Bill will transpose the ECN+ directive, which means that for the first time in Ireland, competition law can be enforced through administrative actions taken by competition authorities.  ECN stands for the European Competition Network, which is composed of the Commission along with national competition authorities from each member state.  It became apparent to the network that there are several areas in which existing EU law is insufficient to meet the objective of a fair internal market for everyone.  These include, but are not limited to, giving national competition authorities the means to impose effective fines and implement leniency programmes.  The ECN+ directive intends to fill some gaps in the current system.<br/><br/>The new powers given by the ECN+ directive will apply only where there is an interstate trade element.  In deciding to implement this directive through primary legislation, the Irish Government felt it was important that the same sanctions should apply to breaches of national competition law.  This will avoid having two parallel systems with differing sanctions.<br/><br/>The stated aims of the ECN+ directive are to ensure all national competition authorities have effective investigation and decision-making tools, to ensure all national competition authorities have the ability to impose effective deterrent fines, to ensure all national competition authorities have a well-designed leniency programme in place that facilitates applying for leniency in multiple jurisdictions, and to ensure all national competition authorities have sufficient resources and can enforce EU competition laws independently.<br/><br/>The date given by the Commission for the transposition of this directive was 4 February 2021.  Unfortunately, Ireland, along with several other member states, did not manage to transpose it by the deadline.  I do not need to tell Members how incredibly difficult the past two years have been and about the significant legislative burden the pandemic placed on both Houses of the Oireachtas.  This is a difficulty we share with our European counterparts.  Particular to the Irish context, however, was our unique constitutional position.  Transposing the ECN+ directive raised significant constitutional considerations given the particular role of the courts in the Irish Constitution.  The constitutional concerns included the introduction of the concept of administrative sanctions, periodic penalty payments, interim measures and leniency provisions.  Ireland has robust defences against the administration of justice by any body save for the Judiciary.  To transpose the directive in a way that was compatible with Irish law, it was necessary to consult several legal experts to ensure the legislation would be workable.<br/><br/>Additionally, in April 2021 the Supreme Court issued a majority judgment in the case of Zalewski <i>v</i>. the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, and others that had a significant impact on the drafting of the Bill, which was quite advanced at that stage.  A previous decision of the High Court had concluded that the WRC was not administering justice within the meaning of Article 34 of the Constitution.  The judgment in the Zalewski case overturned this decision.  The Supreme Court agreed that the adjudication service of the WRC does constitute the administration of justice, which has traditionally been regarded as the exclusive preserve of the courts.  However, the majority decision also concluded that the adjudication service of the WRC is not repugnant to the Constitution because it found that the administration of justice is limited.  Limited administration of justice is permissible under Article 37 of the Constitution.  While the Zalewski judgment was supremely helpful in clarifying how the administration of justice can be achieved within the parameters of the Constitution, it required in the case of the Bill a fundamental redesign of how the provisions relating to administrative sanctions would work, at quite a late stage in the initial drafting.<br/><br/>The main changes introduced on foot of the Zalewski judgment concern ensuring the adjudication officers are independent in their functions, the processes of adjudication and investigation are separate and distinct, and the procedures surrounding the imposition of administrative financial sanctions are clear and transparent.  The Bill also provides for court confirmation of the decisions of adjudication officers and the ability to appeal those decisions.  The delay in bringing this Bill to the House is regretted, but it is imperative to transpose the directive in a way that is constitutionally solid and provides our competition authorities with the tools they need to challenge anti-competitive conduct effectively.<br/><br/>It has long been a commitment of the Government to crack down on white-collar crime.  As part of making good on this commitment, a cross-government agency review group, chaired by Mr. James Hamilton, was put together.  The group comprised representatives of Departments and the key State agencies charged with the prevention, investigation and prosecution of economic crime and corruption.  One of the recommendations made by the Hamilton review group was to amend Irish competition law to create a specific offence of bid-rigging.  This proposal has significance concerning public procurement fraud.  Express provision for bid-rigging is included in this Bill and meets this recommendation.<br/><br/>The Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment had hearings on the general scheme of the proposed legislation in February 2021.  Its report contained 17 recommendations for consideration in the drafting of the Bill we are considering.  In drafting the Bill, we addressed all of these recommendations, including by ensuring there would be no difference between the roles of CCPC and ComReg as competition authorities, as the powers required for the transposition of the directive are given to both as &quot;competent authorities&quot; throughout the Bill.<br/><br/>I have mentioned that there has been careful consideration of the legal issues, including in respect of how this legislation would interact with the Irish Constitution and the implications of the Zalewski ruling on the measures in the Bill.  In the main, the enforcement powers in the Bill relating to both administrative and financial sanctions, in addition to other sanctions, such as structural or behavioural remedies, are identical in regard to both EU and domestic law as they are subject to court confirmation.  However, we have separate provisions for periodic penalty payments in order to fulfil the specific requirement of Article 16 of the directive, on the one hand, and the constitutional requirements for domestic law, on the other, which is the only instance where differentiation between national administrative competent authorities and national judicial competent authorities is relevant within the Bill.  The proposed maximum penalties for infringements of competition law are also the same regardless of whether EU or domestic law has been infringed.  Rights to appeal have been dealt with in Part 2H of the Bill.<br/><br/>The inclusion of bid-rigging as a specific offence means the competition authorities can pursue cartels specifically involved in this activity in the future.  The Minister for Justice has established an action plan to ensure cross-government implementation of the recommendations of the Hamilton report, including in respect of the recommendation of screen e-tenders data, with my Department and the CCPC both actively engaging in that process.  My Department worked with the Department of Justice on the proposals on surveillance and interception to ensure alignment with existing legislation and procedures.  As a result of the ongoing review of the interception legislation by the Department of Justice, it has been decided to include the CCPC within the remit of that project instead rather than through this Bill.</p>  <p>Both my Department and the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications are committed to ensuring sufficient resources for the CCPC and ComReg to implement this legislation, which includes some additional resources for the CCPC having already been put in place, but both Departments will keep their needs under review as the legislation is concluded and implemented.<br/><br/>I turn now to the main provisions of the Bill.  Part 1 of the Bill contains a number of standard provisions concerning the Short Title, commencement, transitional provisions.  In addition, section 2 defines a range of terms used in the Bill.  Part 2 deals with a number of amendments to the Competition Act 2002, which is referred to throughout the Bill as the Principal Act.  Section 5 amends the Principal Act to insert a definition for bid-rigging, as mentioned earlier in the context of the Hamilton Review Group.  Sections 6 and 7 amend the Principal Act, setting out that in order for an act to be an offence, it must intentionally or recklessly prevent, restrict or distort competition.  They are no longer offences of strict liability.  Section 9 provides for an increase in the maximum fines that can be imposed for concerted practice and cartel offences.  Section 12 is an extensive section that inserts a number of new parts into the Principal Act, parts 2C to 2H, which will insert 51 new sections.  Part 2C relates to how certain investigations are conducted.  Part 2D relates to adjudication officers and matters related to, <i>inter alia</i>, their appointment, independence and functions.  This part also sets out the powers of adjudication officers to impose administrative financial sanctions.  Part 2E sets out the leniency programme for the administrative sanctions regime under this Bill.  Leniency includes immunity in this instance.  Part 2F relates to mutual co-operation and how competition authorities across the member states will work together regarding the enforcement of competition law.  Part 2H relates to the procedural provisions around the gathering and use of information and evidence.  Part 3 deals primarily with refining the provisions in the Principal Act surrounding mergers and acquisitions, and strengthening the powers of competition authorities to deal with those that may have an adverse effect on competition.  Section 13 allows undertakings to voluntarily inform the CCPC of a below threshold merger and empowers the CCPC to take interim measures where appropriate.  Section 15 allows for the voiding of any merger or acquisition that requires a decision of the CCPC but is put into effect prior to that decision being made, or where requirements instigated by the CCPC were not complied with.  It also sets out penalties to be imposed for this.  Part 4 deals with amendments to the Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2014.  Section 25 relates to the independence of adjudication officers.  Section 28 deals with the chairperson or member of the CCPC appearing before an Oireachtas Committee.  Section 29 expands the provisions of legal privilege to proceedings involving adjudication officers.  Section 31 sets out greater powers to enter premises and seize, retain and examine records by an authorised officer of a competition authority during an investigation.  Part 5 is composed of one section, section 33, which amends the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Act 2009 to allow the CCPC to exercise surveillance functions.  Part 6 relates to amendments to the Communications Regulation Act 2002 and expands the powers of ComReg to enable it to deal more effectively with breaches of competition law.  Section 35 sets out greater powers to enter premises and seize, retain and examine records by an authorised officer of a competition authority during an investigation, in the same way as the powers of the CCPC are expanded in section 31.  Part 7 is composed of one section which allows for the insertion of a number of references to various statutory instruments and regulations into Schedule 9 of the Consumer Protection Act 2007.<br/><br/>I would like to take this opportunity to flag that it is my intention to bring a small number of amendment to this Bill on Committee or Report Stage to clarify the intentions of certain aspects of the procedures to be adopted under this Bill, and also to ensure that the powers of both the CCPC and ComReg are sufficient for the additional functions which they will have as a result of this Bill.  On Committee Stage, I also propose to introduce an amendment to section 12 of the National Standards Authority of Ireland Act 1996.  The proposed amendment will be purely technical in nature and will not make any changes in substance to the National Standards Authority of Ireland Act 1996.  The purpose of the proposed amendment will be to modernise and provide more transparency in the wording of section 12, which governs the power of the National Standards Authority of Ireland, NSAI, to charge fees for carrying out its services, activities and functions and selling its products.  The NSAI is a State agency under the aegis of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  Its functions are set out in sections 7 and 8 of the 1996 Act, and relate primarily to standardisation, certification and metrology.  Government will be asked to agree to the various amendments.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this Bill is weighty legislation which required much consideration and redrafting to get right, particularly in light of the Zalewski judgment.  However, I am confident that the Bill before the House is robust and will allow Ireland to deal effectively with anti-competitive behaviour on both a national and European level in a way that is wholly in accordance with our Constitution.  Anti-competitive practices affect everyone, making it more difficult for honest businesses to prosper and having adverse effects on consumers.  By strengthening the powers of our competition authorities, we take an important step to ensure that our economy is open, fair and transparent.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-02-09a.322" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="14:17:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020900034#NN00200"><p>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak on this legislation.  This is comprehensive and complex legislation which transposes an EU directive, while also making additional changes to benefit the national competition authorities, namely, the CCPC and ComReg.  The CCPC is the primary enforcement body for competition law in this State.  It has the power to play an enormous role in tackling white-collar crime if it is given the correct powers and is resourced properly.  The CCPC investigates suspected anti-competitive practices and tries to bring these damaging practices to an end.  As stated, the CCPC can only fulfil this remit if it has the necessary powers.  Unfortunately, developments in enforcement mechanisms have left the State out of step with the rest of Europe.  In short, the CCPC does not have the necessary powers it needs to tackle adequately a range of anti-competitive practices and white-collar crime.  Anyone who followed this legislation during pre-legislative scrutiny stage in the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Enterprise, Trade, and Employment will know that it has arisen due the European Union's ECN+ directive, which aims to ensure that national competition authorities have guarantees of independence, sufficient resources and appropriate powers of enforcement, including the ability to issue fines.</p>  <p>  The inability of Irish national competition authorities, such as the CCPC, to impose administrative fines was identified by the European Commission as a concern and part of the divergence in national powers that led to uneven enforcement of EU competition rules.  As a result, the State has been compelled by the European ECN+ directive to implement legislative changes to ensure the CCPC has the appropriate tools and resources to enforce EU competition law in a consistent manner with other EU member states.  The implications for customers of the inability of the CCPC to issue fines was writ large today with the news that six car insurers and a brokers' trade body will not be fined or face any legal action, despite findings from the CCPC of alleged behaviour that negatively impacted consumers.  The CCPC alleged the firms engaged in anti-competitive price signalling over a 21-month period, from 2015 to 2016, leading to premiums rising for consumers.  The alleged anti-competitive co-operation consisted of public announcements of future private motor insurance premium rises, as well as other contacts between competitors.  In its report that was published earlier this week, the CCPC stated that it did not have the power to issue fines to the companies.  Elements of this Bill will thankfully rectify that.  It is unfortunate that the European Union has had to compel the State to act in the interests of Irish consumers.  The directive introduces minimum standards in relation to the enforcement of competition law at a national level and harmonises the resources, powers and tools available to national competition authorities.  Of particular note in this regard, are the introduction of civil sanctions for breaches of competition law and a leniency programme for businesses that come forward with evidence of a breach of competition law.</p> <p>The provisions for substantial fines and improved investigative powers as well as improved institutional co-operation are also very important.  The Bill provides a significant opportunity for change and will enable the CCPC to be more effective for the benefit of consumers, businesses and the economy as a whole.  It includes provisions for maximum fines of up to &euro;10 million or 10% of total worldwide turnover for breaches of competition law.  The Bill will allow the CCPC for the first time to fine companies for breaches of competition law such as cartels, bid-rigging and abusive market practices.  It will also encourage whistleblowing on secret cartels by offering reductions in fines to companies that provide evidence against other cartel members.  Such powers have already proved to be a significant deterrent against breaches of competition law in other EU states.  Currently, Ireland is one of a very small number of European countries that allow a company to be fined only if a court finds there has been a breach proven to a criminal standard.  Through the transposition of the EU directive in the Bill, fines will now be allowed to be imposed for breaches of Irish and EU competition law on an administrative basis.<br/><br/>The legislation also pertains to ComReg, which likewise can only deliver on its remit if it is empowered and funded to so do.  The area of communications regulation has increased in importance through the years.  If the ECN+ directive is not implemented as intended, then ComReg, just like the CCPC, will continue to have its hands tied.  There are areas of legislation that need to be strengthened to achieve this and Sinn F&eacute;in intends to propose amendments to achieve that.<br/><br/>The ability for the CCPC to act is grounded in its statutory powers and, therefore, it is essential that those laws provide the CCPC with the right enforcement tools to effectively deter, detect and address white-collar crime relating to competition law.  Along with legislative changes, there is a need for additional financing, resources and powers in order to help the CCPC and ComReg in investigating and tackling white-collar crime.  The lack of legislation to tackle corporate and economic crime, as well as the underfunding and under-resourcing of the agencies investigating white-collar crime, has been de facto Government policy for decades.  More than a decade and three successive Governments later, the appetite to legislate, regulate and properly tackle corporate and economic crime is far weaker than it ought to be.  Would the House even be legislating for this if it was not being forced on us by the European Union?  It is more than three years since the Central Bank called for a senior executive accountability regime codified in legislation.  However, there has been no urgency by two successive Governments to bring that forward.  It is for this reason that the casino capitalism that caused the banking crash still exists in the protected and gilded world of high finance.<br/><br/>The ever-unfolding events and allegations of malpractice in respect of high finance, insurance, public procurement and building development to name but a few serve as a reinforcement that this Government does not see white-collar crime in the same way that it sees blue-collar and other crime.  At pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill, the CCPC stated that international estimates from the OECD suggest the rate of overcharge in public procurement is between 20% and 30%.  The chairperson of the CCPC stated:</p><blockquote>	Considering annual State spending of approximately &euro;16 billion on goods and services, if even 1% of it was subject to price fixing or bid rigging, a surcharge of 20% or 30% would be a substantial sum of money. </blockquote> <p>What is even more infuriating is that in 2007 the accounting firm RSM Robson Rhodes estimated Ireland was losing &euro;2.5 billion a year from economic crime.  If that figure is applied to the past 15 years, that is a potential loss of more than &euro;37 billion to the Irish economy.<br/><br/>The economic and social costs of corruption and white-collar crime far outweigh other forms of crime.  Despite corporate and economic crime bringing the State to its knees just a decade ago, the area consistently receives far less funding, resources and political attention from successive governments.  The same goes for media coverage of white-collar crime, where it is painted as almost not a crime at all.  This legislation is a good start, along with the Companies (Corporate Enforcement Authority) Act 2021 which established a stand-alone Corporate Enforcement Authority, but resources and funding must follow.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-02-09a.324" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1451" speakername="Matt Carthy" time="14:27:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020900035#OO00200"><p>I welcome the fact the Bill has been brought before the House.  It is not before time.  Ireland is renowned for its failures to adequately tackle white-collar and corporate crime.  We have seen in this House and in the public discourse how that plays out.  A financial scandal is followed by some form of inquiry, usually a very lengthy one, but nobody ever seems to be held to account and then it falls down on that pin as to whether laws or regulations were technically broken.  Bizarrely, often the most substantive outcome is that the Irish taxpayer foots a bill simply for seeking answers about impropriety.  That is why it is positive to see legislation before us today that seeks not only to empower the CCPC to fully and properly investigate cartels and practices in breach of competition, but also, crucially, to levy penalties upon those operating such illegal ventures and to ensure that those involved in corporate activity are aware of those powers.</p>  <p>  A report dating back to 2005 placed the cost at that time to businesses in the State from corporate crime at &euro;2.5 billion every year.  While welcoming the Bill against such a backdrop, it is a fair question for people to ask why the Government is only acting now.  It is more than three years since the Central Bank called for a senior executive accountability regime codified in legislation.  There has been no urgency to do that, as Deputy O'Reilly stated, by two successive governments.  In the past 12 months alone, two Oireachtas committees have published reports into the practice of bogus self-employment which defrauds the Exchequer of potentially hundreds of millions of euro, yet it seems that the Government, the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Protection are reticent to even acknowledge a problem may exist.</p>  <p>  The reason for this legislation is simple - the Government is being forced to do it by the European Union, via the ECN+ directive.  Although the Bill, like the Companies (Corporate Enforcement Authority) Act 2021, is welcome, as are the additional powers granted to the CCPC to investigate competition breaches and levy fines, if this is not just to play out as it has before, there are a number of outstanding ancillary issues that are critical.  Crucially, the agencies tasked with tackling corporate crime must be adequately resourced if we are to see the full benefit of good legislation.  If funds are not forthcoming, it will be entirely apparent that the legislation only arose from an EU diktat, rather than any domestic will to tackle competition breaches.  This is an area in which the Government has form.</p>  <p>  An area of particular concern to me relates to actions within the agrifood sector.  At EU level, the unfair trading practices directive did not go anywhere near far enough, yet the approach taken by the Government was to wait until the very last minute to transpose that directive via statutory instrument and then to do so in the most meagre and minimum form possible.  According to a European Commission report published in October, Ireland was one of only five countries to transpose the directive without amending it from the EU regulation.  In other words, there were no additional powers to tackle the cartel-like behaviour in the meat industry in particular.  Between May and October of last year, the full-time-equivalent head count in the unit that is to act on that legislation actually decreased from three to just two.  In that time, it has not heard a single case, which is not surprising given that very few people know the unit exists.  Of the much-lauded funding it received, it has not spent a cent on informing farmers and the public of its existence.  The only funds that have been spent in the context of unfair trading practices have been the salaries of people who are working within the unit, but we have no idea what precisely that unit is doing.  </p>  <p>  Legislation to establish an enforcement authority such as a food ombudsman or a meat regulator has been marked as a priority within the legislative agendas last summer, last autumn and again this spring, but we have seen absolutely no progress being made.  In the intervening period, we have this legislation that is prescribing additional powers of investigation and providing for the levying of substantial penalties.  In our submission on an independent meat regulator, Sinn F&eacute;in called for it to be ascribed powers of that exact nature.  The question has to be asked why the Government is not prioritising the establishment of an independent meat regulator.</p> <p>Questions need to be asked regarding the role of the CCPC in dealing with queries and concerns that have been raised by farmers.  It has not been acting satisfactorily but the commission will require additional funding and we require an independent meat regulator.  My apologies; I thought I had more time.</p></speech>

I would have been only too delighted to listen to Deputy Carthy continuing on far more eloquently than I would myself.</p>  <p>  The CCPC is the primary enforcement body for competition law.  My colleagues have spoken about the fact that we are late to the game in this.  It is our absolute failing on white-collar crime.  In the past many of us have spoken in this Chamber regarding transposing European law in respect of white-collar crime.  Those who engage in that level of criminality, whether from an organised criminal point of view or from an organised industrial or corporate point of view, have certain advantages and it is a case of us having to play catch-up.  As has been said previously, at the end of the day we need to adequately resource and investigate the areas where this needs to occur.  It is all about accountability, transparency and delivering for the consumer.  It is about dealing with the issues where people perceive or know them to be, when we are talking about cartels and the impacts that these have, whether it is insurance costs, the issues in the beef industry, or whatever else.  There is no stopping and starting in respect of the difficulties we have and Deputy O&rsquo;Reilly referred to the abject cost there is to us of this, as a State and as individual citizens.</p>  <p>  ComReg has been mentioned.  Once again we are a laggard in the transposition of European law.  That European law is to provide ComReg with the ability to do the business that it needs to do in ensuring consumer protection.  A request was made to the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment, of which I am a member, to forego pre-legislative scrutiny, PLS, but we decided against that to ensure that what we are going to do will give ComReg sufficient powers.  We were definite in our decision but we also realised that even if we had waived PLS, the fact is we were still going to miss the deadline that the European Commission wanted.  Again we have too many of these failings and we very much need to look at them.</p>  <p>  Let us consider the issues that are being debated in this House over the past number of days.  The cost-of-living crisis involves everything from the primary sins of multiple Governments on the rental and housing crisis, the cost of childcare, but also the energy crisis, where the Government has failed to do what it can in mitigating the pain that people are suffering.  The fact is they are suffering because so much of this is a case of pain heaped upon pain.  It is not so much about the carbon tax but it is the fact that the carbon tax is on top of all of the other taxes.  We really need to set out a direction for them in getting through this crisis.</p>  <p>  Beyond that, what we are doing, and should be ensuring that we are doing here, is putting a system in place that deals with white-collar crime on a similar level to the way we deal with other forms of crime, to the crime of the poor person out there who does not have the resources, lobby power or access to the people in this Chamber.  We need to ensure that we do that and that we show everybody out there that what we are going to operate is a fair system that delivers for everybody.  </p>  <p>  I get it, where at times people say that we have to be very careful as we need to ensure that we keep business in the State and protect jobs.  We all accept that but if we do not do our due diligence on white-collar crime and do not find out when wrongdoing is occurring and cartels are operating, we hurt the consumer, the citizen and the regular Joe and Josephine out there.  It is just not good enough.  I welcome this Bill, and nearly all the legislation I mentioned earlier to provide the State with the tools that are required, even if it is to deal on an international basis with criminality, corporate malfeasance and those actions that detrimentally impact our ability to operate a society that delivers for people.  It is a very significant cost and the moneys we lose are the moneys that we then do not have to put into the healthcare system, deliver on climate change and deal with the cost-of-living crisis.  This is not a victimless crime but these are pieces of work that we have to do.  </p>  <p>  We all know that if we are going to talk about the wider corporate landscape, we also have a failing still in dealing with collective bargaining.  I have mentioned the case of National Pen and its non-unionised workforce a number of times over the past number of weeks.  It is an international company that is failing miserably to give people the information they need on what their future holds and it has not yet put on the table a redundancy package.  All we hear from Government and others is that this is going to be a generous package but the fact is that we do not have the legislation and the protections in place for people and these sort of problems will continue to happen until we do what needs to be done.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-02-09a.330" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1551" speakername="Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in" time="14:37:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020900036#PP00600"><p>I thank the Minister of State for his contribution.  The Labour Party broadly welcomes this Bill.</p>  <p>  I am going to illustrate the impact of white-collar crime with a story.  I used to teach in an area of acute disadvantage in the north inner city of Dublin.  Whenever I told anybody where I used to teach, they used to always make quips, comments or jokes about crime, despite the fact that I was teaching children.  There would always be a joke, snide remark or comment about crime somewhere in the conversation when I mentioned where I used to teach.  I recall once that I was trying to arrange a primary school football match against another school and I rang the school as we were trying to organise the game.  The guy on the other end said, in a joking way, that he was quite sure that my school&rsquo;s girls would be good at football because they spend half of their time running away from burning and stolen cars.  I kept this to myself, did not challenge him on it, and I was quite happy the next week when we did actually beat the lard out of his side.  </p>  <p>  The point was that there always seemed to be a sense that our children needed to be fixed and that there was an air of criminality about the area in which they lived.  The adjoining area to where we used to work was the International Financial Services Centre, IFSC, and it was a case of if only our children could be a bit more like them, like those functional members of society who were working hard in these financial institutions.  If only our children could aspire to, be more like, speak like and dress like that, that would be better.  This was at the height of the Celtic tiger where there were movers and shakers and big moneyed people.  That was the kind of sense we used to get in that there was one type of criminality that people used to joke about and refer to but the IFSC was somewhere to which we should really aspire to have our children end up working or be part of.  </p>  <p>  Lo and behold, a number of years later the malpractice, lies, shoddy deals and the criminality that took place in the IFSC almost brought down the entire State.  That is the story of my little school and of what society thinks of those children and what the air and atmosphere of the country was in which they grew up.</p> <p>We do not really think that white-collar criminality is the same.  If one walks into any courtroom in the country one will find people generally from a particular socioeconomic background.  They are disproportionately affected by addiction issues, housing issues and other issues of social concern.  One does not see the type of people who have been so close to events and decisions that almost brought down the State in the dock as often as they should be.  I am not saying that people should automatically make snide or derogatory comments about people in different professions like they did about the children I used to teach, but it is important to speak in this Chamber about the effect this type of inequality has on young lives and how young people feel.  We are encouraging young people throughout the country to believe in the system and in this Republic, to engage in the political process and to believe the State will have their backs at the end of the day and that people are not out to get them and they respect them but, fundamentally, if we do not have as tough a regime for white-collar crime as for any other type of crime, people will not believe it.  They will believe, inevitably, that they should perhaps engage in a parallel economy because they are not going to get respect anyway.<br/><br/>We are broadly in favour of this Bill but, as ever, we have to be vigilant to ensure that companies do not dodge the legislation and also to ensure that investigating bodies do not get too cosy with their industries as they use these powers to pursue them actively.  The powers include the ability to fine companies a maximum of &euro;10 million or 10% of total worldwide turnover for breaches of competition law.  This comes on foot of the failure to prosecute any insurers after a five-year investigation into price fixing, which ended in just commitments from insurers.  A spokesperson for the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission said the commission is in no way giving the insurance industry a clean bill of health.  It has written to the Central Bank to outline broader cultural concerns in the industry which have come to light during the course of the investigation.<br/><br/>The Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, has welcomed the Bill.  There are a number of suggestions from McCann FitzGerald.  The law firm said that violations will be easier to prove and fines will be higher, but enforcement will remain challenging.  It stated:</p><blockquote>	A new and untested enforcement process, termed &ldquo;administrative proceedings&rdquo; in the Bill, is a significant departure for Irish law.  So-called adjudication officers, nominated by the CCPC and approved by the Minister, and paid &ldquo;per diem, per piece or periodically&rdquo;, will effectively determine liability for breaches, may issue &ldquo;prohibition notices&rdquo; (effectively cease and desist orders), and may order divestment or other structural remedies. </blockquote> <p>Another issue it cites is that the merger control reforms will increase uncertainty, stating:</p><blockquote>	New gun-jumping prohibitions, mandatory information requests for third parties, and CCPC powers to intervene and review below-threshold deals are proposed.  Notably, the CCPC will be able to require parties to notify any deal, no matter its size, if the CCPC believes it &ldquo;may ... have an effect on competition&rdquo;.  The CCPC will also have powers to require businesses to unwind certain completed mergers, if the CCPC believes the deal may harm competition. </blockquote> <p>The Bill proposes to transpose EU Directive 2019/1 of the European Parliament and of the Council, also known as the ECN+ directive.  The purpose of the directive is to empower the competition authorities of the member states to be more effective enforcers and to ensure the proper functioning of the Internal Market.  This transposition includes granting further powers to the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission and the Commission for Communications Regulation.  The powers include the ability to levy administrative financial sanctions for breaches of competition law obligations, which will be set at a maximum of &euro;10 million or 10% of total worldwide turnover.  As the Minister of State said, the Bill proposes to make some amendments to Irish competition law, which include a specific offence of bid-rigging with regard to certain anti-competitive practices in bidding and tendering processes, the prosecution of gun-jumping offences and the unwinding of certain mergers after they have been implemented, and to provide for targeted surveillance powers in investigations for certain criminal offences.<br/><br/>Broadly, we support the Bill.  We will do our best to assist the Minister of State and the Government to strengthen it in any way we can.  The Minister of State mentioned that he will be proposing amendments on Committee and Report Stages and we will be as constructive as possible.  However, it would give the children I spoke about earlier more confidence in the State and the governance of the State if initiatives or legislation such as this did not arise because of an EU directive but from the deep sense of injustice that the Government should feel when it comes to tackling white-collar crime.  I told the story not in any way to diminish the area in which I taught but because it is important for people to understand the profound effects that a stench of inequality has on a person, the person's family and the person's community.  When one tries to say to anybody that he or she needs to be more like other people, one is giving the other people a free rein that they do not deserve.  They must have the same responsibilities under the law and the same consequences for criminal behaviour.</p></speech>

The T&aacute;naiste has done a lot of work on this Bill and he has acknowledged that while the vast majority of businesses do not engage in anti-competitive practices, some businesses unfortunately do, be it offences such as bid-rigging, gun-jumping or unwinding certain mergers after they have already been implemented.  They happen in business.  They happen at the expense of consumers and other businesses, particularly newer and smaller businesses that are more vulnerable to the impact of anti-competitive practices.</p>  <p>  Anti-competitive practices drive up costs.  They freeze out start-ups and smaller businesses and they can lead to bad quality products and poor services.  The last two years have been a very challenging time to be in business, with restrictions, staffing issues, closures, supply chain struggles and financial pressures.  Business owners have had a huge amount to deal with.  I tip my hat to all the businesses that have survived and those that have thrived in these challenging circumstances.  However, when one takes account of the pandemic-related challenges, which many businesses will need some time to recover from, and then adds to that these anti-competitive practices, it creates a difficult environment for business to thrive, especially start-ups and smaller businesses.  Therefore, I strongly welcome the steps this Bill is taking to combat those practices.</p>  <p>  Giving regulators the powers to administer sanctions has long been sought.  It was often said and thought that it could not be done or that it would never happen.  However, it is happening now and is being done.  For the first time in Irish law, breaches of competition law can be enforced through administrative actions taken by competition authorities, with maximum fines of up to &euro;10 million or 10% of total worldwide turnover, whichever is the greater.  This Bill will give agencies the power to enforce competition law much more effectively.  It will give them the teeth they need to protect consumers and to crack down on anti-competitive practices.  It will also mean that consortia or monopolies will be broken up and organisations abusing their dominant position will be suitably punished.  Most importantly, they will be deterred from doing that in the first instance.  That is a very positive development for consumers.</p>  <p>  On foot of this Bill, there will also be greater European co-operation among EU regulators, with competition authorities across the EU coming together to fight these white-collar crimes on a cross-border basis.  This Bill is an important further step in the Government&rsquo;s efforts to tackle white-collar crime and the troubling impact it can have on its victims and on wider society.  It signals a different approach in competition enforcement for Ireland and will complement work that is ongoing to ensure a balanced marketplace with healthy competition.  It will ensure our competition authorities have access to the tools they need to protect the interests of customers and businesses.</p>  <p>  As we know, this legislation arose from an EU directive which aims to ensure that national competition authorities are guaranteed independence, necessary resources and powers of enforcement.</p> <p>They would have the power to issue fines for breaches.  There should be enhanced investigation and information gathering powers where companies do not co-operate properly with investigations.</p> <p> I welcome the powers that this will give regulators such as the CCPC, ComReg, and the DPP, as well as the courts.  ComReg has welcomed this Bill and deemed it essential for the effective enforcement of competition law.  It correctly notes that similar powers have proved to be a significant deterrent against breaches of competition law in other countries, so I welcome that we are following suit.  This Bill will be good for businesses, consumers and customers.  I welcome the proactive steps it is taking to crack down and discourage anticompetitive practices and white collar crime.  I commend both the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister of State, Deputy Troy, on all their continued work in this area.</p></speech>

It has an enormous impact and its victims are all of us in many respects but at times particular groups or individuals are affected.  It is vital for people to be prosecuted and fined in the correct way, and there should be sufficient resources.  That is a question we must return to in properly resourcing the ODCE.  That must be done and I am not convinced there are adequate resources there currently.</p>  <p>  The legislation provides for maximum fines of up to &euro;10 million or 10% of total worldwide turnover, which I welcome.  It reflects the kind of penalties we have long needed.  The point has been well made that perhaps this would not be happening if there had not been a European directive on this, and that is very likely true.  There is the related question of insurance and if there had not been investigations into anticompetitive practices at a European level, I wonder if we would see much movement at all from the Government.  To be frank, we are not seeing enough movement but would we see any movement at all otherwise in tackling the outrageous practices of the motor insurance industry?</p>  <p>  On the matter of competition, we should realise that competition has limits despite being able to play a role.  Competition is not going to fix a housing system that is completely broken or resolve issues where public services and goods are at the centre.  This is where the State must play a crucial role.  The Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Sean Fleming, has correctly apologised for his remarks because shopping around is no answer when there are not enough houses or childcare is an extortionate cost everywhere because the State does not subsidise it.  Shopping around is no answer to people being beggared from GP fees, inpatient fees and all the costs associated with childcare.  Shopping around is no answer when parents feel the burden of costs from voluntary contributions, buying schoolbooks and everything that comes around each summer.</p>  <p>  All these matters come down to public services not being properly funded.  It is a major issue.  There are other concerns, including inflation and energy costs.  One of the biggest issues in the cost-of-living crisis in the State is that we have not properly funded our public services and the State constantly has to come back to parents and families, having to charge too much.  That may be inpatient fees, GP services or other healthcare that we believe should be free at the point of access.  It may be additional costs for primary or secondary schools or the fact it is often like a second mortgage or more to pay for childcare.  That is not to mind the crazy rents we are seeing of &euro;1,500 or &euro;1,600 in Cork.  People are absolutely crucified.  The Bill is welcome and I hope it deals with the issues but competition and shopping around will not solve everything.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-02-09a.335" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1627" speakername="Jennifer Whitmore" time="14:57:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020900038#RR00300"><p>I am standing in for my colleague, Deputy Catherine Murphy.</p>  <p>  Competition is a vital element in our economic system.  When operating at its best, competition results in better outcomes for consumers and society in general.  A variety of options in the market leads to better pricing, better quality and innovation.  When it comes to competition policy, the fundamental concept is about applying rules to make sure business and companies compete fairly with each other, resulting in the best outcomes for the consumer.</p>  <p>  The changes this Bill will bring to the area of competition law in Ireland are, by and large, welcome because the policy we currently have in place is shamefully insufficient.  As it stands, we have no way to meaningfully enforce against anticompetitive practices.  This was pointed out by the Hamilton review group, which identified a number of weaknesses in resourcing the bodies charged with preventing illegal practices and enforcing the law.</p>  <p>  Reports this week on anticompetitive price signalling in the motor insurance industry really drove home how inadequate is the current policy.  The CCPC found that over a 21-month period in 2015 and 2016, AA Ireland, AIG, Allianz, Axa, Aviva, FBD and Brokers Ireland all may have engaged in anticompetitive behaviour that resulted in premiums rising for consumers across the country.  We cannot say these firms acted illegally and the CCPC was not able to bring the case to court because the cost of doing so would have been prohibitive.  We also cannot say these firms were fined for their actions because the commission does not have the power to issue fines.  Instead, we can only say that six of the firms signed a legal commitment promising to comply with competition law, and one would think that would be a given.  Brokers Ireland refused to sign any such commitment.</p>  <p>  This example illustrates exactly why it is so important that our competition enforcement bodies have teeth and the resources to use them.  The CCPC states: "The most the CCPC can achieve at present, in a significant number of competition cases, is to seek commitments that the business will cease the practice or behaviour and not do it again."  It really is just a slap on the wrist.  There is absolutely no accountability for anticompetitive practices currently and no real repercussions at all for illegal actions that cost the consumer.</p>  <p>  For so long, we have under-resourced our enforcement bodies in this country and we have been consistent in that poor practice across all areas of policy from anti-corruption bodies to wildlife crime units.  This week I received indication that only one person has been allocated to the wildlife crime unit within the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  That is laughable when we consider all the discussions and chat about having a zero-tolerance approach to wildlife crime.  One person will never be able for that task.</p>  <p>  This Bill is going to completely reshape the role of the CCPC and ComReg but it seems to be silent on the details of the extra resources these bodies are going to receive alongside all their new responsibilities.  Will the Minister of State outline what extra resources will be made available to them upon enactment of this Bill?</p>  <p>  We have such a dependence on large multinational corporations in Ireland.  It has been the policy of successive Governments to attract more foreign direct investment and encourage more corporations to establish their European bases of operations in Ireland.  If we want to be a base for this kind of massive economic activity, we need to have the infrastructure in place to combat economic crime.  The impact of anticompetitive practices or corruption in this sector is international and it can deal with a colossal amount of profits and some very expensive lawyers.</p>  <p>  The maximum fines in place for breaches of competition law under this Act can run to 10% of global turnover.  It is very welcome to see a sanction of this size and it really could make some businesses sit back and think about their behaviour.  The Bill also provides enforcement bodies with powers to conduct unannounced inspections subject to warrants and compel businesses to hand over passwords and documentation.  There is also the introduction of a specific offence for hindering an investigation.</p>  <p>  All of these investigative and surveillance powers are needed to detect white-collar crime, especially when the nature of the crime becomes harder to detect, with cartels becoming more sophisticated in their efforts to hide their practices from enforcement agencies.  Of course, these powers must be balanced with the rights of the individual, and I acknowledge the issues raised by the enterprise committee relating to the surveillance powers proposed in this Bill.  Will the Minister of State outline in wrapping up or in a follow-up with Deputy Catherine Murphy how exactly the surveillance powers will operate and what kind of oversight mechanisms will be in place?</p>  <p>  There are very welcome measures being put forward in this Bill but fundamentally we need a commitment that the enforcement bodies that will be in charge of implementing those fines will be adequately resourced.  Price-fixing, market rigging and all the various kinds of anticompetitive practices are part of a much wider issue of corruption in the private sector, and it is a problem we are just not equipped to handle in this country.  We have no effective means of preventing, investigating and prosecuting corruption.</p> <p>There is no overarching or consolidated approach to combating corruption in the private sector or the public sector.  A look at the State's anti-corruption website gives us a clear picture of the fragmented approach, with 16 bodies listed as responsible for tackling corruption.  Ireland's anti-corruption response is incredibly fragmented by international standards.  A 2020 survey conducted by the French Anti-Corruption Agency found that 84 of 114 countries surveyed had a single agency approach.  This is an approach the Social Democrats has been championing since it was founded and one which, unfortunately, the Government is opposed to.</p> <p> It is difficult and rare to see successful prosecutions of corrupt practices in business life in Ireland.  Even after costly and lengthy tribunals of inquiry, there have been few consequences for those against whom negative findings have been made.  There is a strong public perception of a golden circle in Irish society, the members of which are accountable to no one and who regard themselves as untouchable.  The EU Commission's 2017 Eurobarometer on corruption found that 68% of Irish people believed corruption was widespread across society, with a particular lack of confidence in the banking and financial sector.  We must examine the possibility of having a single, independent anti-corruption agency as opposed to having many fragmented agencies that do bits and pieces rather than the totality of the work that is required.</p> <p> Apart from the lack of confidence Irish people have in particular business sectors and in our ability to deal with corruption, fundamental to all of this is the undermining of democracy.  It has a fundamental impact on how people engage with our institutions and how people trust them.  It undermines our ability for cohesiveness and the ability to work as a community and as a society. It is not just about addressing corruption in those businesses.  It is also about providing a more trusting society for everybody.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-02-09a.337" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1519" speakername="Cathal Crowe" time="15:07:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020900039#SS00200"><p>I see the Competition (Amendment) Bill 2022 very much as positive legislation.  It gives more powers to the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, and to the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.  Those two bodies will have more power - I suppose more firepower - so they can challenge anti-competitive practices by businesses and, in doing so, protect customers.</p>  <p>  There were two aspects in particular over the past two years that were very eye-opening for me.  One was during the early onset of the Covid pandemic when Ryanair in particular, and Aer Lingus to a lesser extent, flew out planes with virtually no passengers on board and refused to give refunds.  If the plane was in the sky, then the service was considered to be operational, and therefore it was up to the consumer to go.  I believe we saw some shoddy practice during that time.  Most of this has been rectified now.  There is also role there for the Commission for Aviation Regulation.  I believe that, from a consumer point of view, we saw some sharp practice at the early onset of the Covid pandemic in how air passengers were treated around booking, trying to re-book, trying to get refunds, and the length of time it took for refunds to come through.</p>  <p>  I wish to address another point with the Minister of State, Deputy Troy, that I have raised several times in the Chamber, which is the fascination in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and the Houses of the Oireachtas with the issue of motor insurance and the huge costs of this to young people in particular, especially young males.  It seems that across the board there is now a loading on everyone.  Premiums seem to have gone up and up.  When people get their renewal notices, for most people &euro;100 or &euro;200 has gone onto it already without any road traffic accident claims or any new penalty points on licences.  There is certainly an issue there.  Indeed, our colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, has been very good in taking action on that.</p>  <p>  The one form of insurance that simply has not had enough debate is home insurance and flood cover for properties.  I live in a part of County Clare not too far from the River Shannon.  In 2009, part of the River Shannon burst its banks.  In an area of between 5,000 or 6,000 homes, one or two homes took in water.  Because of that low incidence of flooding, all homes in that catchment area are now being denied flood cover.  It does not, however, work as simply as that.  It also affects whether a person stays with his or her existing insurer.  I happen to be with a particular insurance company, which I will not name, but I remain with this company because I cannot leave it.  My neighbours cannot leave their insurance companies because the minute they leave their insurer and try to shop around, they are denied flood cover and they are exposed to far higher premiums.</p>  <p>  Time and again I must write letters for people who are trying to sell their property and for people who are trying to buy properties, because when they go to lending institutions, they are told the sale cannot be approved because the properties do not come with flood cover insurance.  The lenders will not lend on the properties or give mortgages on them.  It is farcical because, bizarrely, a two paragraph letter from the local Deputy who lives in that local area and who had the same problem is accepted by the bank and accepted by the insurer.  They insure, life goes on, and sales of properties continue.  I write ten to a dozen of these letters per week.  It is absolutely crazy.</p>  <p>  This is about the principle of risk equalisation, a principle we became most familiar with in the context of health insurance.  Theoretically, a younger person should be in better health and better physical shape than someone older or someone with an underlying illness.  In health insurance, the principle of risk equalisation means everyone pays more or less the same to more or less the same extent.  Insurance companies, however, have been applying risk equalisation for the past 11 years to homes in County Clare and homes further up along the River Shannon area, and to homes along other rivers such as the River Lee in Cork where homes have also flooded.  They apply risk equalisation where one home floods and they pass the burden and the principle of risk equalisation onto thousands of homes in the catchment area.  This does not take into account topography.  It also does not take into account that one part of a housing estate could be 10 m higher than another part if they were developed at different levels, with different levels of landfill and different systems of drainage.  It does not take into account the fact of underground topography, and the person suffering is the consumer and the homeowner.  This debate has not happened enough in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  The principle of risk equalisation is not just being applied, it is being abused.  This needs to be the next consumer protection issue for D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and Seanad &Eacute;ireann to look at.</p></speech>

All of us have come across situations of price fixing and anti-competitive practices in the State.  The insurance industry is probably the most obvious one people are aware of.  There are many examples of it across all kinds of situations.</p>  <p>  One example that certainly comes straight to my mind was during the early 2000s when grant schemes were in place for farmers to build slatted sheds.  I remember two brothers who lived not far from me.  Around the year 2001, one of them built a large industrial shed, which was probably as big as this Chamber or bigger, and it had an insulated roof.  Two years later, his brother, a farmer, was building a slatted shed with a grant.  The shed part of it was probably one third of the size of the other shed, yet it was twice the price.  The excuse at the time, when all of these guys were putting up sheds, was that the world price of steel had gone through the roof. Then, a few years later when the grants ended and were finished, all of a sudden the world price of steel fell again and the price of sheds went down again. I am sure the Minister of State would also have been aware of that.  Even in his own constituency there was plenty of that happening.</p>  <p>  It is a huge problem all over the State.  I often think of this when, in fairness, all of us in here are looking to get houses built and looking to get various programmes in place to encourage development and to encourage work to happen.  Very often when that occurs, the particular industries involved use it as an opportunity to push up prices to the detriment of the customer. We are all very aware that when the State has a role in such a process, when the State is paying for it, or when the State is providing a grant for it, this is a kind of green light to drive the arm in as far as you can.  We need to have firm regulation to ensure this does not happen and we can stop it from happening so that the public in general and the taxpayer get a fair deal.  Very often in these cases it is the taxpayer who ends up being wronged and being robbed by these unscrupulous people who engage in that type of behaviour.</p>  <p>  This legislation goes a good distance to try to resolve that.  We hope it has moved us all in the right direction.  Of course, it is coming very late in the day.  For years those of us on the Opposition side of the House, and indeed the Minister of State and his party when they were on this side of the House, were calling for similar legislation and for things to move faster in this regard.  It has taken so long that one wonders if it is because the EU directive came into play forcing this to happen that we are now in this position.  This is one of the key questions many people have.  There has been such hesitancy on the part of the State and by official Ireland to take a real hard look at how corporate Ireland operates and how so many people in so many positions throughout the State can seem to ride roughshod over people's rights, especially their economic rights, when it comes to such situations.</p>  <p>  The Bill is welcome.  It is a move in the right direction.  Whatever bodies or commission are put in place and whatever way we do this, we need assurance it has the correct amount of funding and resources in place, not just to be a regulator but also to be an enforcer of the regulations.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-02-09a.339" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1510" speakername="John Paul Phelan" time="15:17:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020900040#TT00200"><p>I, along with the Deputy Kenny and other speakers, welcome the Bill and express my support for its provisions.  I wish to make a couple of points.  First, I will start where Deputy Kenny finished.  We need to ensure the additional powers and responsibilities being conveyed upon the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, are followed by sufficient funding and resources to ensure they are implemented.  I welcome the changes being made to allow officers extra powers of investigation and, in certain circumstances, surveillance.  It is important resources are provided to those officers to ensure they can carry out their work.</p>  <p>  Several people have spoken about white-collar crime.  I share their views.  This Bill is a significant step in the right direction in that regard.  I welcome in particular section 6, which outlines the additional investigation procedures in respect of the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.  I suspect every Member of the House often receives queries from members of the public regarding the provision of phone and broadband services, in particular.  The ability of ComReg to operate in a more active sense can only be a positive in terms of ensuring a proper service is delivered in every corner of the country, in particular telecommunications of different sorts.</p>  <p>  I want to focus my attention on two specific areas.  Deputy Crowe mentioned the lack of competition in the insurance sector and issues surrounding that.  It is fair to say that, over the past 12 months or more, we have seen a significant decrease in the amounts awarded by the courts in respect of accidents, public liability and the category of insurance claim that falls into the trip and fall category.  Some insurers have passed on those savings to their customers.  However, that has not happened in all cases.  This issue was brought home to me recently by people who are involved in operating play centres for children at community level.  Those who ensure the provision of public active recreational spaces, whether commercial or community groups, find the cost of insurance crippling.  I am not convinced enough is being done by the CCPC and others to ensure we have a properly functioning insurance market.</p>  <p>  Deputy Crowe mentioned flood cover, and his comments apply everywhere in a somewhat haphazard set of circumstances.  Some people can, despite their premises being flooded every couple of years, still retain insurance.  Perhaps they have historic cover they are keeping in place.  A broker recently managed to get insurance for a building I did not think would get it from an underwriter outside of the State.  The Government and its arms, like the CCPC, have to do more to ensure businesses and family homes that are open to the prospect of flooding can be insured.  Like everyone else in the House, I am aware of the extensive funding invested by the Office of Public Works, OPW, and local authorities throughout the country in flood relief schemes.  We could all names parts of our constituencies that have significant difficulties.</p>  <p>  My final point is, in many respects, the main point.  It is broader in scope than the terms of the Bill, but I will raise it while the Minister of State is here.  I refer to banking and financial services.  I am fortunate enough to have been a Member of the Oireachtas for 20 years, but the changes I have seen in the past two or three years in my county, Kilkenny, are quite remarkable.  Kilkenny city still has branches of the major financial institutions, but outside of the city, ten bank branches have closed.  The two that have remained open are cashless.  To be perfectly honest, people of a certain age, including those who want human contact when they are dealing with financial matters, find that cashless services do not provide them with that opportunity.</p>  <p>  I welcome the fact the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, is trying to work with the Department of Social Protection to ensure the post office network remains intact and strong throughout the country.  However, I deeply regret that our financial institutions, many of which were supported by the taxpayer when they were in difficulty, have completely withdrawn from provincial Ireland across the board.  A market town with a population of 3,000 or 4,000 traditionally had banks buildings that were permanent physical entities.  When they are lost, it creates issues not just in terms of access to financial services but also leaves a glaring hole in the physical make-up of towns or large villages.</p>  <p>  A broader issue in which the CCPC may have a role is the withdrawal of commercial banking operations from the State as a whole.  We saw that happen recently with KBC and Ulster Bank.  The lack of competition in financial services leaves us open to the potential for anti-competitive practices in the future.  The CCPC, in conjunction with the Department and Government, needs to do more to ensure we have strong competition and new entrants into the banking sector in the State.</p></speech>

There are speakers due for all of the groups, including Sinn F&eacute;in, the Regional Group, the Government and the Rural Independent Group.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-02-09a.341" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1482" speakername="Se&aacute;n Canney" time="15:17:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020900040#TT00400"><p>I welcome that the Bill is being brought forward.  It is important for our country to make sure that, whatever we are doing in life, we do it in a fair-minded way and ensure as best we can people get value for money.  There are many facets of life and business where I feel competition may not be what it should be.</p>  <p>  In terms of insurance costs, there is a suspicion we may not have a lot of competition in the market and, therefore, premiums can be dictated very easily.  Flood insurance is one such example.  When I was a Minister of State in the OPW, I saw first hand the attitude insurance companies had regarding insurance, in particular for homes that had been flooded.</p> <p>More importantly they used flood maps as a pretext for refusing to give insurance for flood damage.  These properties may never have flooded in the last 40, 50 or 60 years.  However, because they were in proximity to where there was a slight risk of flood, they were being denied flood insurance.</p> <p> We need to question the pricing by Internet service providers and the advertising of their products especially regarding the technologies that are available and what they can do.  They offer a certain speed of broadband but when it is installed users only get a fraction of that.  However, because of the terminology used it is very unfair on the service user and they pay a price for that.</p> <p> I highlight a dangerous area - that of quarries and what is going on at the moment.  Last week Deputy Fitzmaurice spoke about it and I echo those sentiments.  An investigation into what is going on in the quarry business is warranted.  When we are looking to build roads and other things in the national development plan, we may find that it is not so much that the price is being fixed but that there is an effort by a few to try to exclude new entrants into the quarry business.  Many objections to quarries are being submitted from the same sources and that needs to be examined in detail.</p> <p> When I worked in the construction industry at times I felt a fair price for materials etc. was not being offered.  Those practices back in the 1980s were stamped out by good legislation.  We now have a more sophisticated and indirect way of trying to control prices.  This is important where big companies take control of the market and dictate.  Sometimes they put fear into other suppliers who do not want to fall foul of the big players in the game.  The Bill is important from that point of view.</p> <p> While the Bill is important, enforcement of it is what really matters.  We need to provide the resources so that we see the results of good law.  We need to see a reduction in insurance premiums across the board - for home insurance, car insurance and business insurance.  The utility providers need to provide what they promise in their adverts.</p> <p> Our banking sector has fallen into a very dangerous position with very little competition.  We have an opportunity to create a third force or a fourth force in banking by giving more powers to the credit union movement and to the post office network so that they become competitors in the retail banking market.  Throughout the country bank branches are closing.  Ulster Bank has exited the market and is gone as a competitor.  Retail and business banking is in a very precarious position.  It is important to open up and ensure that our reputation as an open flexible economy is borne out in our competition legislation.</p> <p> At the end of the day, we want to ensure that every business has an opportunity to make a profit, but we do not want businesses profiteering at the expense of consumers.  If there is no competition, it will add to the inflation we have been talking about in recent weeks.  People will act upon an opportunity to increase their prices.</p> <p> Hotels across the board have increased their prices substantially in recent months.  I warn the hotel industry that it received a significant level of support from this Government and previous governments.  Hotels need to ensure they do not try to capitalise on that by increasing their prices just because they are back in business now.  It is important for them to play fair with their customers.</p> <p> Overall, I commend the Minister of State's efforts and those of his officials in ensuring we have proper competition in our market.  Ireland has a good reputation, but we want to make sure that it is welcoming for new business entrants and for new indigenous business people starting up.  If they have the wherewithal to get into business, they must not be stymied by established global competitors that would fear them if they got into the market.  We need to watch out for that and be careful about it.  We need to ensure we have fair business and fair prices, and that we end up with a reputation that we can remain proud of into the future.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-02-09a.343" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1616" speakername="Matt Shanahan" time="15:27:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020900041#UU00200"><p>The preamble to the Bill suggests it will give effect to the implementation of Directive (EU) 2019/1 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2018 to empower the competition authorities of the member states to be more effective enforcers and to ensure the proper functioning of the Internal Market, ECN Plus, the European Competitions Network.  Essentially it is aligning our competition law with the EU legislation.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State also suggested that the enactment of this legislation, further to some additional amendments he wishes to propose, will strengthen the powers of the State in tackling white-collar crime, economic crime and corruption.  Others in the House have discussed specific areas of concern, such as public sector procurement, the construction industry, insurance services and possibly even legal and financial services.</p>  <p>  If the question were asked in the House today how, where and on whom sanctions were placed as a result of the banking crisis, what would the answer be?  How might this legislation address that?  Do we seriously think that significant effort was made to pursue criminal prosecutions for those who colluded in the positioning of interest rates, the over-reporting of assets and the under-declaring of positions with respect to currency hedging and contracts for difference?  How would this proposed legislation treat that situation again?</p>  <p>  I think we know that we largely failed in our obligations to hold to account those who were colluding criminally during the banking crisis.  If this legislation is enacted, will we be protected from such a scenario repeating?  Does this legislation deliver the required deterrent by way of criminal sanctions?</p>  <p>  The Minister of State has placed significant emphasis on the ability of this legislation, framed within the context of European competition network law, as being positioned to combat national and international cartels.  However, how would we know if such cartels are in operation considering the difficulty up to now in surveilling and getting access to financial statements and records?  The Bill outlines that the powers of ComReg and the CCPC are to be strengthened and somewhat merged in order to meet this challenge and that future surveillance powers and powers of entry will assist in this battle.</p> <p>That is welcome, but will it be enough?  I imagine that companies that engage in international price collusion and deliberately set out to rig bids and to compete for some tenders while strategically withdrawing from others are not waiting around, their filing cabinets full of incriminating evidence, for the CCPC or ComReg to come knocking on their doors.</p> <p> In the case of public procurement, analysis of tender bids would surely point to possible price fixing.  Given, however, that many of our large-scale public procurement tenders are refined down to a shortlist of three to five, it is difficult to see where and how significant price collusion might be occurring.  Quantity surveillance and measurement software would probably indicate where significant or even extraordinary price gouging is taking place if only we had the ability to properly implement it.  I have raised in this House a number of times the prices of general building materials in this country and how they are so similarly aligned, yet it is possible to buy similar quantities of those materials on the European mainland at significant price reductions not explainable by transport costs, warehousing or other logistics.  In the context of a free European market with open borders and transparent pricing, how does this situation persist?  As for building specifications, has the Minister of State's Department any intention of looking at material specifications and what manufacturers are specified within public procurement tender contracts?  How is it that we can arrive at specifications and dimensions for timber and insulation materials, for example, that are not specified in other European country tenders, thereby offering much wider choice and better cost options?</p> <p> The Minister of State has highlighted our dysfunctional car insurance industry and the deliberate concealing of insurance fees and claims data for years, which would have allowed further international motor insurance underwriting if potential competitor companies were able to assess the market intelligence and dynamics that were taking place.  They were precluded from doing so, however, which resulted in no new appetite to enter the market for many years.  I know that this situation has been largely resolved in respect of the motor insurance sector and that we now have up to 40 companies bidding for motor insurance in this country.  However, what were the sanctions prescribed by the CCPC for those companies that were, in effect, breaking European consumer law?  Despite progress in the motor insurance market, does the Minister of State believe there might be anti-competitive practices still ongoing in respect of personal indemnity insurance, employer's liability insurance and occupier's liability insurance?  Could instances of fraudulent personal injury claims, supported in some instances by legal professionals, not be considered anti-competitive as well as downright criminal?  Will the legislation the Minister of State proposes tackle white-collar crime and provide civil and criminal sanctions for those found guilty of same, and will they be pursued?  I fully understand the need for this legislation to comply with European legislation and for our courts to integrate accordingly, but we have a history in this country of not pursuing white-collar crime.  Even when we do, derisory financial punishments are usually the order of the day.  If there are teeth to this legislation, the public will need to see those teeth in order to have any confidence that this proposal from the Minister of State is a game changer, which I hope it is.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-02-09a.345" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1549" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="15:37:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020900042#VV00200"><p>This is very welcome legislation.  We need to strike a balance between very powerful enterprises now emerging in the world of big data, artificial intelligence and ICT and the consumer because that balance has shifted dramatically.  Markets have changed.  The way individuals interface with them has changed dramatically.  The capacity to have a personal interaction with those who provide services is dramatically changed.  I think it is becoming a subject of increasing concern among people.  The Minister of State will have read during recent weeks about the spat between Neil Young and Joni Mitchell and Spotify, one of the huge influences in delivering music and entertainment through online transmission.  Clearly, it is an extraordinarily powerful platform but, at the same time, legitimate questions are being raised about the extent to which it promotes innovation and makes it very difficult for talent to emerge.  That is a real concern.  The same could be true more locally of the impact we see from the growth of media platforms on local media and national media, which are so important to the health of democracies such as ours.</p>  <p>  As I said this morning when speaking to the Topical Issue matter I raised, on which I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Troy, got a report, very vulnerable consumers are being made mugs of by very powerful companies that use friction as a policy tool to prevent people from getting the best value.  They are effectively profiteering at the cost of many of the most vulnerable consumers, whether older consumers or consumers who are not tech-savvy.  Right across the spectrum of entertainment, mobile phones, TV and broadband, utilities and financial services, a dramatic change is occurring in the sort of model on which a lot of the theory surrounding good markets was built.</p>  <p>  It is therefore welcome that we see today a change such that the CCPC can take administrative sanctions against companies.  We were told for years and years that it was not possible in the Irish legal system to have administrative sanctions where a potential criminal offence was involved.  It is really welcome that that has been overcome because the reality was that for a small Irish regulator or a competition authority to seek to prove beyond reasonable doubt that a criminal offence had been committed by a very large company with deep pockets, it was a David-and-Goliath battle.  It was very difficult for those regulators to take on those very large companies.  It meant they had to be highly selective in the cases they took on because of the sheer cost and difficulty of getting a prosecution.  That daunting standard for a regulator meant they had to pull back.  Like the Minister of State, I hope this will be a very significant change.</p>  <p>  I have read through the Bill and there is no doubt but that there are hoops to be gone through.  There is due process, and that is exactly as it should be, but the legislation means we will now be able, without going down the criminal route, to get to proceedings and sanctions that bring in remedies, whether the breaking up of companies, structural changes, behavioural changes, unbundling of products, the ending of rebates or the stopping of data sharing.  These are significant new powers, but I would like to hear from the Minister on a question I have.  My reading of the Bill is that competent authorities can investigate only through the very narrow prism of competition law.  Therefore, even though ComReg or any of the other regulators can initiate administrative sanctions, it seems to be only on the two traditional issues of competition law - collusive behaviour and abusive dominance - that it can do so.  Those are not easy routes to travel, and we need to see a point reached at which other codes of practice that represent reasonable and fair treatment can be pursued through administrative sanctions where they are not properly observed by large companies.  This is not just a matter of collusive behaviour or abusive dominance.  Traditionally, in the literature, it has been extremely difficult even to define abusive dominance, let alone to prove an offence has occurred.  We therefore need to see a wider range of areas where the use of administrative sanctions can bring fairness into this.  What is the reasonable use of personal data, for example, in the marketplace?  That is something for which codes of reasonable practice should be established, and it should be possible for regulators to seek administrative sanctions where they are not being honoured.  Similarly, as I said this morning, friction that deliberately obstructs consumers from getting value should be pursuable by administrative sanctions.</p> <p>I would like clarification from the Minister of State that what the legislation provides for goes beyond my narrow reading of it, or for him to consider a broader base for these legislative powers, allowing them to be given to the many regulators who could oversee codes of good practice that would transform the approach of enterprise.  In the long term, it is in enterprise's interest that we establish these high standards because, ultimately, enterprise depends on the trust of its consumers.  If that is lost, those enterprises cannot thrive.  I hope this is a vehicle whereby we can build a much stronger basis of trust.  It is always said that sunlight is the best disinfectant.  I hope this Bill will bring a little bit more sunlight to some of those darker practices that ought to be stamped out.</p></speech>

Indeed, it should provide the long-awaited powers necessary to tackle a wide range of white-collar crimes.  As somebody who sat on the finance committee and who was involved in the scrutiny of insurance prices, what was happening in that market, the protection of raw data and how things were used against the consumer, who was fleeced with insurance costs, I really welcome this.  The Bill is a good beginning and will go at least some way towards tackling those issues.  Every one of us who buys insurance will welcome this.</p>  <p>  The aggregate economic and social cost of the anticompetitive practices in this State has cost us very dearly.  The victims of breaches of competition law such as the operation of cartels, bid rigging and the abuse of market practices have all paid the price.  As a State, we have also paid the price economically.  Back in 2007, it was estimated by RSM Robson Rhodes that it was costing the State &euro;2.5 billion.  It could be much more than that now.  That is &euro;2.5 billion that could be spent on different things in the State while we squabble over pennies.</p>  <p>  What really annoys me is who we go after in this State.  We go after the dead pensioner who has forgotten to tick a box and who has somehow been overpaid a small pension or something like that.  We follow them beyond the grave and yet we ignore so much white-collar crime.  Discussing this Bill brings that to the fore.  Our national competition authority must have appropriate powers of enforcement and adequate resources to tackle these economic crimes.  For far too long, we have been an outlier in the EU in comparison with other member states.  Reaching a criminal verdict in a court of law can take too long.  It also puts justice out of reach for too many victims of white-collar crime.  This Bill will go some way towards addressing that.  We also see issues with prices in the agriculture sector.  Really legitimate concerns and queries have been raised for a long time with regard to price fixing in the agricultural sector.  I hope this Bill will serve to address some of that.  The only pity is that it was not brought in years ago and is only now coming to the floor of the House.  However, I welcome the Bill and I look forward to it becoming law as quickly as possible.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-02-09a.348" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1461" speakername="Michael Collins" time="15:47:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020900043#WW00300"><p>The purpose of the directive is to empower the competition authorities of member states to be more effective enforcers and to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market.  I have heard of a few problems from my constituents.  One is a very serious problem that affects all industrial import and export businesses.  As of July last year, all goods entering the EU from Britain and all British goods entering the EU are subject to VAT at the point of entry.  This is totally pointless and just causes delays.  All exporting companies have an economic operators registration and identification, EORI, number and immediately claim the VAT back.  This layer is not productive as both the EU and Britain have to employ more people to administer it.  All that happens is that goods are delayed and, when goods are delayed, it has a knock-on effect for businesses, especially small businesses in rural communities.  We need to figure out a way to get rid of this double layered system, which is hampering competition.</p>  <p>  Since Brexit, customs have been a nightmare.  An Post is asking for very small amounts of VAT on goods imported from the UK.  In many cases, Irish VAT has already been paid.  One constituent of mine purchased a spare part from an Irish website, paid in euros and was charged VAT at 23% on the whole transaction.  A few days later, he received an email from An Post asking for &euro;1.46 plus an administration charge of &euro;3.50.  These are very small amounts of money.  The administration costs must be much higher than the amount of money An Post is trying to collect, which cannot be good for the country and just results in long delays and makes us less attractive to the competition out there.</p>  <p>  I will go back to an issue I raised on Leaders' Questions last week, that is, the cost of fertiliser.  Where is the competition now?  We need this sleeping Government to come on board and help the farmers.  In all fairness, we need to keep the food chain running.  I would appreciate it if the Minister of State would listen to what I have asked him.  I have asked him and his Government colleagues to come up with a plan to help these farmers because no business anywhere can take a triple layer of costs on top of their existing expenditure.</p>  <p>  Quite a lot of speakers have asked where the competition is in the meat industry.  I remember standing with the farmers outside meat factories, particularly in Bandon in west Cork, some time back.  They have been crippled by the situation they find themselves in.  There is no competition in the meat industry.  There is a monopoly.  That must be ended.  It cannot continue.  People are struggling to get the best price they can in a terribly difficult situation.  The fact that competition is not being allowed there and that one person is basically running the show in this country makes it almost impossible for anyone to get a fair price.  Competition is the lifeblood of trade.  I hope this Bill will help with that.</p>  <p>  Competition issues can be considered at a national and international level but the local level must also be considered.  There is a massive divide between urban and rural and that divide is getting bigger and bigger.  The competition is also getting bigger and bigger.  People in rural Ireland are finding it more difficult to survive.  There is mass development in urban towns.  I would not begrudge anyone that but, back down in Dursey Island in west Cork, a development has recently been brought to the Judiciary by those seeking to prevent it.  This development aims to open up and rebuild a rural community.  People in rural Ireland are finding they are not understood.  They want fairness and to be allowed to compete.  They want to be treated alike.  There is now a possibility that An Taisce or BirdWatch Ireland could ruin a project worth millions of euros that would have given that community a chance to compete for employment and tourism in their locality, which is very important for them.</p>  <p>  Many people cannot insure playgrounds or facilities in the community and voluntary sector because competition has never been weaker between insurance companies.  We should be encouraging competition in this area.  This has been allowed to go on for years and years, leaving some organisations and individuals to go out of business because they cannot afford insurance as a result of this lack of competition.  I hope that this Bill will tackle that.</p>  <p>  I know of one situation in west Cork.  The West Cork Connect bus company is trying to survive.  It is in competition with Bus &Eacute;ireann, which has a monopoly and State funding.  The owner is trying to provide a private service on the hour, every hour, from west Cork to Cork city but, instead of being encouraged, every barrier is being put before him to prevent him from succeeding.  He is not looking for any State intervention.  He just wants a licence to continue.  Competition is an international and national problem, but it is certainly a local issue too.</p> <p>When we have situations where the owner of a good company is willing to dip into his own pocket and to take people from Skibbereen, Clonakilty, Bandon, Bantry, Dunmanway and Drimoleague all the way to Cork city, every hour on the hour, that is a fabulous service.  For some reason, though, a State company will get preference above that individual and his company, and that is something that must be examined as well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-02-09a.350" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1499" speakername="Richard O'Donoghue" time="15:57:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020900044#XX00200"><p>The purpose of the CPCC is to make markets work better for consumers and businesses.  I understand this legislation is to strengthen and to ensure the proper functioning of international markets.  Two international markets are not working.  Our pig industry is on its knees, and it will be lucky to survive in its present form.  Surely the CPCC can step in to ensure the industry will survive.  In France, across all food sectors, the origin of meat is visible to consumers.  Why not in Ireland?  People look for Irish products all over the world, but we do have not have such visibility at home.  Irish pig farmers engage continually with Bord Bia to produce the best product on the market, yet they cannot compete with the below-cost-selling of products produced by people in other countries.  Dog meat is more expensive now than our top-quality foods.  Pig farmers are losing an amount that translates to &euro;37.84 per pig, according to Teagasc.  Feedstuffs, fuel and energy costs account for a major portion of their fixed overheads.  They just cannot compete.</p>  <p>  My next point concerns a service agreement with our phone companies.  I meet people every day who have continuing issues with their phone providers.  They call the customer support centres, but they are totally inadequate and unable to deal with the simplest of queries.  Rural Ireland has a poor broadband service and the people in those areas are at the mercy of these providers.  ComReg gets involved, but the level of stress caused by these companies is harmful to people and businesses.</p>  <p>  We have also seen the lack of fertiliser supplies, as well as the rising cost.  I refer to all the legislation and regulation the Government is bringing in.  This is a case of supply and demand, but the Government must support the farmers.  Nitrogen is needed early in the year because the temperature of the ground here means that farming cannot work without it.  If the Government does not support farmers, we will end up with a lower intake of grass, which in turn will mean a lower output of milk.  This situation will work out across the food markets and then we could end up with food shortages in Ireland.  Therefore, the Government needs to stand up and ensure the farmers get the reward they need to keep them going and to keep us fed.  The Government must subsidise the farmers for the cost of fertiliser.</p>  <p>  My next point relates to the retrofitting scheme that was launched yesterday by the Minister for Environment, Climate and Communication, Deputy Eamon Ryan.  I represented the Rural Independent Group at the launch.  The document that was produced, and which I had in front of me, contained a breakdown of the different grant schemes which are going to be available, including examples of how much it would cost in various cases.  For example, in the scenario where it cost &euro;50,000 for a full retrofit of a house, the scheme would provide &euro;23,500 of a grant.  I asked the representatives of the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, when this document with all the facts on it was printed.  I was told that the paperwork associated with the examples of retrofitting of houses was done in October 2021.  Does the Minister of State know that there have been four price increases since then?  That equates to an overall increase of 17% in the cost of retrofitting.  Therefore, in the context of the percentage of the grant available, a person who undertook a retrofitting project worth &euro;50,000 in October 2021 will have to pay &euro;60,000 for the same work to be done now.  In addition, this retrofitting scheme is not coming into operation until the autumn, so we will have a couple of additional price increases by then.</p>  <p>  Where are all these price increases coming from?  They are coming from anything oil-based.  I get this information from a weekly data sheet because I am in construction.  Insulation materials that are oil- or silicon-based have seen the price increase every month since October 2021.  I can tell the Minister of State now, in the context of the retrofitting scheme launched yesterday, that the grants must be increased in line with the rate of inflation in the cost of materials.  The scheme sets out that a house retrofitting project costing &euro;50,000 will get a maximum grant of &euro;23,500.  If the cost to retrofit the same house rises to &euro;60,000, the Government must increase the grant aid in line with what the retrofit project is costing.  That is common sense.  </p>  <p>  I ask that neither I nor the public be given public paperwork that is out of date.  The real facts and figures should be provided.  I say that because if the grants are not raised to match the cost of the retrofitting, the people paying for these projects will no longer have an &euro;83 saving per month.  Instead, retrofitting a house will mean that people undertaking such projects will, in the context of that approximately &euro;80 per month over the course of a 20-year loan, see the current figure for the associated cost rise from &euro;50, which is what is in the document, to &euro;70 over the next 20 years.  I ask the Government not to lie to the public and to put current facts out there.</p></speech>

This retrofitting scheme has been eagerly awaited and much wanted.  People want to engage with it.  It will, however, cost them &euro;500 to get an assessment, and they will get back &euro;250 whenever.  I am talking about people on the margins.  People have told me they have been waiting for two and half years already for the SEAI.  I understand from Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue, and I thank him for attending the briefing yesterday, because he understands building, that the scheme is not going to start until the autumn of this year.  Why does the Government keep announcing it?  It is like going out fishing and throwing out a fly to catch a sardine or, hopefully, a trout.  I ask the Government to not be fooling the public.  People are sick and tired of schemes being announced.</p>  <p>  The Government is also telling us that the credit unions and banks will be involved.  The credit unions will be, certainly, but the banks are closed for business in respect of people undertaking things like this.  Those seeking loans will be asked where they work and what they are doing, and every employment situation is precarious as far as the banks are concerned.</p>  <p>  Regarding this situation, I have said numerous times that the CPCC is useless, toothless and fruitless.  We have authorities for everything now.  All these seem to consist of are a plaque, about the size of an A4 sheet of paper, up on the wall, lovely plush offices and nice big swivel seats and desks for the board and employees.  I am not being personal about anybody, but we have so many quangos.  Quangoland is alive and flourishing, and does not need any nitrogen.  There are insiders and jobs for the boys and for friends of political parties and whatever appointing them.  These quangos have no function because they are doing nothing.</p>  <p>  Let us take the example of the meat cartels.  Goodness, we all stood outside the factories two years ago.  It is shocking the way the farmers are being treated.  One Christmas, about five years ago, Deputy Michael Healy-Rae and I went to a Dunnes Stores outlet with representatives of the IFA.  There was a protest ongoing, and three or four-----</p></speech>

The whole lot came to &euro;16 or &euro;18.  It was shocking.  There were loss leader products, and all these types of things.  The companies are getting the money back in other ways, but they are selling all these things by way of champion products and below cost selling.  It is shocking.  I refer to the position in which they are putting the ordinary shopkeepers, the fear gn&oacute; or bean gn&oacute;.  Those shopkeepers look after the people when raffles are being held for the GAA or for other fund-raisers, such as when people are sick.  They are the first people to give spot prizes.</p> <p>They have been trodden on.  I said it this morning.  All the globalists.  It is a globalist policy, and we are denuding our country of expertise in business.  I see today now I will be attacked for saying it as an employer myself.  I called about it and they said now we are going to give an extra 12 days' sick leave.  How are small business clinging on?  The Minister of State should know this.  They are hanging on by their fingernails after Covid.  It is one scheme or promise after another but they are all heaped on top of these people who cannot afford to pay them and they will be doomed to shut, gone out of business.  It is fine to have all the promises then.  Is everybody going to be on an unemployment register?  We cannot manage that.</p> <p> We have the beef cartels.  Some of them were bailed out in bygone days and they got away but they are back now and they are not helpful to anybody.  Insurance, my goodness, what a racket and the carry-on.  We hear every day of the week on different radio programmes about shopping around and elderly people and all kind of penalties and loading.  That is not a fair crack of the whip for anybody whether young, daoine &oacute;ga or daoine aosta.  There is no fairness at all in the system and we have an insurance regulator.  We have a regulator set for everything now, everything.</p> <p> The eTenders is the biggest load of baloney as well; certain levels of the tender are at EU level.  I have a community now in my county who were successful and did great work.  It is a wonderful community shop and enterprise, and they got grant aid before Covid but now the prices are doubled and trebled and they cannot do the work on that kind of funding.  Now they want to know, n&iacute; neart go cur le ch&eacute;ile, they want a meitheal.  They want to do it themselves, overseen obviously by the Department and by a local engineer and architects.  They cannot get around it.  They are killing the spirit of the people.  The spirit of the Irish people has been magnificent and the spirit of the meitheal has been magnificent throughout our country with neighbours helping out and doing barter arrangements where they can.  eTenders is another way to kill small businesses.  Someone has to have so many builds in the bank to apply, including contractors and everything else; you have the whole works.</p> <p> I refer to transport and the cartels that are there and the price of fuel now.  I am talking about the National Transport Authority, NTA, now and bus transport.  We have JJ Kavanagh's whom I salute and many other small operators in my county.  They are being squeezed and squeezed and squeezed until there is nothing left to squeeze.  Every last drop of blood will be squeezed out of them.  We have empty coaches.  Outside the door here are double decker buses up and down the street one after the other and n&iacute;l duine amh&aacute;in istigh sa bhus; a lot of them have no one inside of them, but no problem, this is Dublin and we can have anything we like.</p> <p> I mentioned also the whole situation with fertiliser.  Denmark, Sweden, France and all the other countries have intervened in the pig industry in the EU and they are allowed to.  The EU Commissioner was before the committee.  Deputy Michael Collins was there and he heard that the Irish Government can intervene and subsidise this.  If it does not subsidise the fertiliser for farmers, the foodstuff is going to be more expensive for mom's purse, as Deputy Healy-Rae phrased it, on a Friday evening.  It is as simple as that.</p> <p> Everything is gone the same way.  We have regulators for everything.  We need someone to get in and regulate these regulators and put them on a training course and make them understand what their job and their role is.  An awful lot of them are political hacks and they are in there creaming it off.  They are putting people to the pin of their collar.</p> <p> I also mentioned the loss leaders in the supermarkets.  These are punishing the small shops.  Since the pandemic there is not a small shop left in the capital.  Some of them are gone in the country.  Look at An Post and the telephone network.  I saw Albert Reynolds at an Ard Fheis once waving a phone.  Everyone had a phone in their house in a month.  Now we wait maybe two years to get a phone and we wait five or six months to get it repaired.  Elderly people are waiting for hours on the phone.  Customer service is appalling in some of those big companies and there are the monopolies again.  It is shocking the way we are treating our people.</p> <p> I said today they are waiting in the long grass.  There is a lot of long grass this year because it has been a mild winter but it will be grazed fairly bare.  The Government will have no place to hide when the election comes because it will be laid out bare naked and the people can see it.</p></speech>

This is the case for individual consumers as well as businesses and by extension, the economy as a whole.  For this protection to be effective, the CCPC needs to have powers that will deter those intent on engaging in anticompetitive practices from trying to do so, while also ensuring that it has the resources and powers of enforcement needed to sanction effectively those who do.</p>  <p>  Right now we are one of a few EU member states that allow a company to be fined only if a court has found that there has been a breach proven to a criminal standard, which is staggering.  This seeks to rectify that by allowing the CCPC for the first time to fine companies for breaches of competition law.  It will enable the commission to issue maximum fines of up to &euro;10 million or 10% of total worldwide turnover for breaches of competition law, while encouraging whistle-blowing on secret cartels by offering reductions in fines to companies that provide evidence against other cartel members.</p>  <p>  As matters stand, everyone is being failed through anticompetitive practices that are carrying on in the knowledge that our bark is worse than our bite.  While this Bill may seem to be broad yet targeted, it is no thanks to this Government or any previous ones that we are discussing it here today.  It is because the State has been compelled by a European directive to implement legislative changes to ensure the CCPC has the tools and resources it needs to enforce EU competition law like many other member states.</p>  <p>  The people of this country will know very well the consequences of a light-touch approach when it comes to white-collar crime.  Generations to come will be paying for the manner in which a light touch to corporate crime has in the past brought this country to its knees.  We continue to see instances and allegations of malpractice in high finance, insurance, public procurement and building development.  The list goes on.</p>  <p>  International estimates from the OECD suggest the rate of overcharge in public procurement is between 20% and 30%.  We have heard of how a study in 2007 found that Ireland was losing somewhere in the region of &euro;2.5 billion a year from economic crime.  If that figure is applied for each year since, the loss to this State would be eye-watering.  The Government sees white collar-crime as something apart from crimes that are committed further down the food chain.  That is why there has been no appetite to legislate, regulate and tackle corporate and economic crime, and why the Government was forced to implement legislative changes to ensure the CCPC has the appropriate tools and resources to enforce EU competition law.</p>  <p>  While I welcome this legislation as a good starting point, we must have a firm commitment that resources and funding will be provided to uphold a CCPC with powers that will make a difference.</p></speech>

I greatly appreciate the opportunity to contribute to this important debate.  It is very interesting to hear Deputies say we are being forced by a European directive.  Do people not understand how European directives are created?  They are done with the co-operation of the Government through the European Council and with the co-operation of Irish MEPs in Europe.  I fundamentally welcome this and I welcome the work the Government has done with European partners to ensure that the directive can be transposed into domestic legislation in an efficient form, in the format of this Bill.</p>  <p>  Many Members have talked about various companies and practices but the important thing to remember is that at the heart of this Bill is the right of the consumer and the protection of the consumer.  I have no doubt that if this Bill is to be effective and faith is to be given to competition in the State, we need to see the powers granted by this Bill for administrative fines put into action very quickly.  Consumers and people across the country need to know that this legislation is on their side.  They need to see the cartels broken up.  They need to see both the National Competition Authority and the CCPC acting in a manner that is in the interests first and foremost of the consumers.</p>  <p>  There are one or two areas that have developed in recent years that I am particularly concerned about.  They require the attention of this legislation.  The first is the post-Brexit reliance on British providers in so many areas and the fact that the UK is outside of this directive.  It is key that this legislation ensures that operators within the State are in line with all that.  Many people refer to insurance in a particular area, namely childcare providers and child recreation centres, which only have the option of one insurance provider and the impact that had with rising premiums leading to centres and schools closing and to fees and costs going up.</p> <p>It impacted not just on parents and guardians in the State, but on children.  I hope that this legislation will be used to ensure that a sense of fairness is created in this market.  As Deputy Bruton mentioned, the main areas that the Bill seeks to address are collusive behaviour and the abuse of dominance.  There is a vagueness that will need to be laid out specifically so as to ensure that the various agencies can act in an appropriate and, importantly, timely manner to identify these.</p> <p> I will use this opportunity to speak to the one area that this Bill does not address and that I have previously raised with the Ministers of State, Deputies Troy and Fleming, and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, namely, competition in the mortgage market.  It is detrimental to consumers that the level of choice for mortgages is so restrictive, particularly compared with European averages.  The average interest rate in Ireland is 2.73% but 1.28% in the eurozone.  This comes down to competition and choice.  We want European providers entering the Irish market so that we can tell homeowners and prospective homeowners that there is competition, which will put more money in their pockets and take the pressure off the weekly budget.</p></speech>

Not only does it transpose into Irish law the European Competition Network, ECN, directive from 2019, but it does something novel, in that it extends the remit and powers available under the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Act 2009 and applies them to the CCPC, which has not been the case to date.  Up until now, the Garda, the Defence Forces and the Revenue Commissioners have been able to use the extensive powers available under that Act.  Under this Bill, however, they are being given to the CCPC as well.  I note that the Minister of State is not doing this because it was a directive given to the Government by the EU, but because it was contained within a recommendation in the report prepared by the former DPP, Mr. James Hamilton, and delivered in February 2020.</p>  <p>  The Bill follows on and implements another recommendation from that report, namely, that a new separate offence of bid rigging be introduced.  This will be transformative in terms of the CCPC's ability to investigate what are regarded as anticompetitive practices.  I welcome that, instead of having to go to court, the CCPC will find itself in a position similar to the Central Bank whereby it can impose what are referred to as administrative fines on people who have been found to be in breach of competition law.</p>  <p>  While I am on the topic of the Central Bank, an area of competition that we in political life need to examine actively is the lack of competition within the Irish banking sector.  As the Minister of State will be aware, very few banks from outside the jurisdiction operate within Ireland and many of the banks operating in Ireland are controlled or have significant ownership by the State.  We need to consider how to expand and introduce greater competition into the banking sector.  The Minister of State might look into whether we should give some responsibility or jurisdiction to the Central Bank so that one of its remits would have to do with the existence of competition within the banking sector.</p>  <p>  Competition is a complex issue and, from listening to this debate, I am conscious that it can have different consequences on different parts of the economy.  The purpose of competition law is to try to ensure that we have a vibrant economy within which consumers have significant choice because there are so many competitors in various sectors that prices will decrease and standards will increase.  To find an example of where there is great competition, one need look no further than the grocery sector.  We see large volumes of advertising in our newspapers and everywhere else about the price of food in various competitive supermarkets throughout the country.  That has a consequence, though.  The lowering of prices in the grocery sector has a negative impact on the prices being received by farmers for their food.  As such, competition law is not a simple issue' it is complex.  We always look to place the consumer at the centre of it, but we also need to recognise that, by continuously promoting the benefits for the consumer, there are certain other individuals who will lose out.</p>  <p>  I am pleased that the target of this Bill will be businesses that are openly breaching competition law.  That is something that this new legislation will achieve.  I hope that the surveillance powers will be a great deterrence to those businesses that are involved in bid rigging.</p></speech>

It is important that we tackle tender rigging, which is a scam and drives up prices.  Unfortunately, the Government does not seem to have the same inclination to end bid rigging in the private housing market.  Ordinary working families and individuals are trying to buy homes every day but they are being outbid by cuckoo funds.  One in five homes in Cork city is being bought by non-owner occupiers, many of which are global companies that are using the housing crisis to profit.  The average rental price for a two-bedroom property in Cork is double what it would cost to buy the same property.  How can that be right?  Ordinary people are losing out because the Government is allowing institutional investment funds to buy up the properties that people need to live in and that they want to buy themselves.  The Government is doing nothing to protect people.  This matter needs to be examined.</p>  <p>  I wish to discuss the mortgage-to-rent scheme.  In 2018, there was a decision to allow a private operator, Home for Life, to essentially claim a monopoly on the scheme.  Home for Life is the only private operator licensed in the market and the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage has confirmed that he does not intend to reopen the licensing application process.  Home for Life is buying distressed mortgages and then leasing the respective homes for 25 years to local authorities.  The homeowner remains in the property and becomes a local authority tenant.  At the end of the 25 years, the local authority will have to find housing for that tenant and Home for Life will own the property even though the State has paid its rent for 25 years.  More than 500 of these long-term leases have been completed since 2018.</p>  <p>  This is a local authority scheme that does not need private investment.  If we continue to rely on just one private operator, and assuming the investment patterns do not change, a conservative estimate is that the State could be looking at local authorities forking out &euro;120 million over the next 25 years.  This situation will be compounded year on year and not a single house will be owned by the State.  It is a scandal.  The mortage-to-rent scheme was set up for local authorities to buy the distressed mortgages of homeowners who could not repay their loans.  Why was a private company allowed to make unbelievable profits on the backs of people who were losing their homes?</p></speech>

It is long overdue.  I have been asking in the D&aacute;il when the commitment in the programme for Government to empower ComReg to apply administrative sanctions would be introduced.  I kept being told that it was coming, but it is finally here.  I hope that it will be effective and lead to a change in how telecommunication services are provided.</p>  <p>  Recently, we had a celebrated example of a company winning a great customer service award, namely, Eir.  It was so confident in its win that it immediately blocked all replies on Twitter from anyone who might question the win.  Subsequently, it transpired that Eir had bought the win.</p> <p>Another organisation that received an award for its services was RT&Eacute; News, but that is an entirely different story and not one I do intend to get into here today.  The bottom line, however, is that Eir has been reviled by its customers for quite some time.  It appears to have improved its customer service somewhat in recent months but has a long way to go and is far from unique in how it provides customer service.  I hope that ComReg is empowered to take action on behalf of ordinary consumers across this State because there are consumers who cannot get broadband and are awaiting it under the national broadband plan.  There are also those who in theory have broadband but whose service is completely inadequate.  In such cases, the telecommunications provider, be it Eir or one of its competitors, is not fulfilling its contractual obligations at all and people can get no redress.  I hope this will be addressed and that ComReg will have the power to tackle such rogue operators, be they rogue operators that have to buy customer service awards or others.</p> <p> We talk a lot about working from home and its importance.  I expect it is as important to the Minister of State's constituency as it is to mine that there be a facility to work from home, be it every day or some days per week.  It enables young couples, older couples and young singletons to live in our constituencies while working for companies in our major urban centres in a way that would not have been possible heretofore.  That has a large number of benefits because we need to see more balanced regional development instead of having all economic activity concentrated in certain urban centres that do not have the infrastructure to deal with the required level of development, while other parts of the country are simultaneously abandoned.  Driving through most of the market towns of Ireland, we can see the large-scale abandonment of buildings.  If lucky, we see some commercial activity in ground-floor premises.  We see that nobody is living overhead and that a number of buildings are derelict.  The ability to work from home is a means of addressing this problem but it has to be accompanied by an adequate telecommunications service.  Therein lies a great challenge for the Government.  I am referring to its rolling out of broadband but also to its empowering of the regulator to ensure contracts are adhered to.  I very much hope that is brought about by a Bill.  I commend the Minister of State on introducing this Bill.</p> <p> There are a couple of other areas that I wish to turn to in the time available about which I am perhaps a little less optimistic.  One such area, the beef sector, has been alluded to by previous speakers.  While I was in the Chamber, Deputy Conway Walsh of Sinn F&eacute;in raised it towards the end of her contribution.  We do not have any anticompetitive practices in the beef sector, according to our competition authority.  We have never been found to have any anticompetitive practices in the sector.  There are four major firms involved - one very big, another big and two slightly smaller.  They control the beef sector.  The sector is obviously very important to Irish agriculture.  Year in, year out, prices rise and fall in unison; there is never more than a cent or two in the difference between the prices of those concerned.  Farmers have long complained of anticompetitive practices in this regard but none have ever been found.  In fact, I wasted my time writing to call for an investigation into the beef sector when I was a Deputy in a former D&aacute;il.  There is a degree to which the CCPC has demonstrated a lack of awareness of how the sector operates.  Deputy Bruton talked about the capacity to introduce sanctions for the abuse of personal data.  In the beef sector, the processors have all the data.  They know how many cattle are in Ireland right now.  They know how many cattle aged 21, 28, 29, 30 or 34 months are in Ireland and can set their price accordingly.  It is not necessarily anticompetitive because the information is at least available from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, but its effect is to stifle competition in the sector.  Prices will rise and fall in tandem because the processors know exactly how many cattle are available.  Some years ago, they were facilitated by the BSE crisis through the introduction of the so-called 30-month rule, whereby people are rewarded for getting rid of their cattle at 30 months.  In reality, it operates as a penalty.  A farmer are penalised if his cattle are not killed by 30 months.  If someone knows how many cattle aged 28 and 29 months are in the country at any given time and that live exports are not happening, for a variety of reasons, he or she can control the price.  I appreciate there are animal rights arguments against live exports.  Some of those arguments are slightly exaggerated, for commercial benefit.  The benefit accrues to the beef processors because, if it can be ensured that cattle can leave Ireland only in one way, dead, they have to be killed in Ireland.  If the processors know how many cattle are of a particular age, they just set the price; it is very simple.</p> <p> Anybody who has anything to do with the beef sector will know phone calls are regularly made and that smaller operators fear the bigger operators.  There are not many of them but there is still a fear factor because ABP is a huge operator.  It could wipe a processor out overnight, in the same way that Cement Roadstone Holdings, CRH, could wipe out, and has wiped out, people in the quarry business.  We have to acknowledge realities in this House.</p> <p> The aforementioned factor has to be considered.  Nobody is going to investigate it or determine what we can do about but it is going to be made worse by a couple of new steps.  Like the Minister of State, I grew up in a village, Scariff.  There were two butchers in the village when I was growing up.  It is not all that long ago.  I might look old but I am 47.  Both butchers in the village were able to kill cattle or pigs.  They did not kill horses for feed, unlike ABP, but they did kill cattle, sheep and pigs.  The policy of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine was to wipe out those abattoirs, the thinking being that they were a nuisance and that it could not be dealing with small producers, no more than it wanted to be dealing with small cheese producers.  The production of cheese in farmhouses across Ireland is inherently dangerous because cheese is made by bacteria, so the view was to sacrifice them.  I once had a meeting with representatives of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in Limerick but they did not say what I am saying.  I could never accuse them of saying it.  Regarding the people I represented, namely small cheese producers in a region where there had been a listeria outbreak, the Department was taking the opportunity to drive them under or get rid of them.  There is a policy to abolish the small producers.  It might not be stated to us but it is stated among people who work in the business.</p> <p> I am glad the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, is present because the Green Party has a policy of promoting small food producers, craft producers and farmhouse producers.  It is important that this happens, but what happens on the ground and what is promoted by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine are entirely different.  The aim is to wipe out the small producers and regard them as a nuisance.  If there is a listeria outbreak in a farmhouse producing cheese, the Department will say, perhaps rightly, that it could threaten infant milk exports to China.  The approach is to ask why a risk should be taken for the sake of small producers producing a product that a couple of hundred people love when there is a need to protect the huge Chinese market.  However, if we go down that road far enough, we will end up with just one person producing a product.  That is where we are heading in the beef sector by wiping out the small abattoirs.  </p> <p> With regard to the number of regional vets employed, I understand they are paid through central government but employed by local councils.  There are fewer and fewer of those positions available.  When those positions are no longer available, there cannot be an abattoir.  There cannot be an abattoir without a vet who can occasionally inspect.  Year on year, we are reducing the number of places where cattle, sheep and pigs can be killed in Ireland and concentrating production into the hands of a small number.</p> <p>That is not anti-competitive.  That is fine; it is just business.  However, it is a business model that has the same result as anti-competitive practices.  There are small producers being driven to the wall.  There are large multinationals making more and more money, to the extent that the controlling shareholder of one of them can own the building the Department of Health rents, while small farmers that produce money go to the wall.  The shareholder to whom I referred is obviously a better businessman than the others - he would not own the building otherwise - but we need to look at the huge imbalance that exists.</p> <p> I want to mention two things that in my view are going to make that worse, if inadvertently.  The first is the application for protected geographical indication for beef.  This is going to be brought in for grass-finished Irish beef.  If the application is successful, it will be good news in theory because all beef finished in Ireland will be grass-finished Irish beef because, thankfully, the majority of beef cattle spend most of their lives outdoors.  We have not yet reached the stage, although I think we will, unfortunately, where there are cattle that are 24 months old and have never seen grass under them or the sky over them.  Personally, I find that immoral on some level.  I am a farmer and I produce beef to be killed and eaten.  I find it immoral that cattle would never see anything other than a roof over them and concrete under them.  It offends me.  I do not know exactly why it offends me, but it does.  It seems to be so contrary to what is natural and to what farmers and generations of farmers did before me.</p> <p> If every animal in Ireland is going to be grass-finished Irish beef, then what is the scope for the producers' groups?  We were told the producers' groups could come together and perhaps apply for protected designation of origin, for example, for Burren beef, east Clare beef, Mullingar beef or Ballynacarrigy beef &ndash; take your pick.  We were told they could apply for protected designation of origin that would be recognised and they could, perhaps, argue for a higher price from the big players such as ABP, Dawn Meats, Slaney Foods and  Kepak.  Now the Government has taken that from them by applying for this recognition for Ireland.  If everybody has it, then it becomes worthless.  It is like inflation.  We are inflating away the possibility and the bargaining chips these farmers have.</p> <p> The other thing that has recently been feted is ABP's advantage beef programme, which sounds great because it is about traceability.  It is about ensuring less movement of cattle.  It basically means there will be a 20 cent per kg bonus for cattle that are killed on the grid.  The grid price will be averaged across all ABP and Slaney Foods plants.  I think there are seven of them.  The price will be averaged across them in any event.  However, the conditions are the cattle will have to have been on not more than two farms during their lives and they have to be at least a year on the farm on which they are killed.  That all sounds great for the consumers, but the actual effect of that is to ensure farmers cannot have cattle that were bought in a mart the year before they are killed.</p> <p> Marts were introduced in the 1960s and the 1970s to ensure some degree of transparency in what was always, I suppose, a slightly murky business, but at least there were multifaceted places that cattle could be killed.  Cattle were being brought to Dublin and shipped live to the Port of Bristol and elsewhere in the UK at the time.  While there was no transparency in it, there was a greater degree of competition.  If that is taken out, then the beef processors are being further empowered to set a price.</p> <p> What happens when we do not have enough cattle?  Sometimes supply does not quite meet demand.  That happened last summer in the Irish beef business.  It was a rare and a wonderful thing.  Beef prices are good at the moment; I am not saying that they are not.  However, I am very much afraid of the power of processors when beef prices and international beef prices take a turn.  I am afraid of their power to use that to ensure they are insulated from the downturn in the market and ordinary producers get screwed.  That is what they do.  What happens when demand exceeds supply is processors have to go to the marts to buy finished cattle.  They have to pay a market price for them.  Lo and behold, they actually have to compete with one another for cattle in the marts.  Then the farmers realise the processors are actually making more per kilo than the farmers thought they were, so the farmers can demand more per kilo.  That is what happened last summer.</p> <p> Apparently, this advantage scheme is being brought in with the backing of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  The Department backs anything that is advantageous to the big beef processors and the big dairy co-operatives to the detriment of small producers, whom they regard as a nuisance.  If there is a scheme such as the one that is being proposed by ABP, then one cannot go to the marts.  There will be less trade going through the marts and there will be even less transparency in a very non-transparent market.  That, I have to say, worries me.  There is a requirement that cattle have to be 12 months on a farm, with the exception of bull beef, which only has to be on a farm for six months.  If there is a rationale for the 12-month requirement, then surely there is a rationale for the six-month requirement.  One does not see young bulls traded in marts as much as cows and steers.</p> <p> The scheme undermines one of the few areas in which we have transparency in the food chain in Ireland.  There is no transparency in what the beef processors pay.  They buy cattle and we do not know what they pay for them.  They are using more and more feedlots.  Of course, when supply wanes a bit, they are able to empty those feedlots to suppress prices.  There is no transparency around what the retailers pay the processors.  There is no transparency around the conditions attached to it that they be, for example, Angus beef, Hereford beef, 30 months old, 33 months old or 36 months old, the extent to which consumers want that, or the extent to which it is actually a ploy the processors have to suppress prices.  There no transparency around any of that.  However, there is transparency around what cattle of 450 kg, 550 kg, or whatever weight are making in the marts on a given day or week.  That is absolutely transparent.</p> <p> This programme, to me, is an attempt to undermine that and remove the one little bit of transparency farmers have.  Of course, it is justified on other bases because there will be less movement and more certainty, and the cattle will all come from Bord Bia quality assured herds.  However, up to now there has been a requirement that to finish cattle, they have to have come from a Bord Bia quality assured herd, unless they are being bought a long time before they are killed.  I do not accept and I question the rationale for the programme.</p> <p> That said, I am not convinced these are issues that can easily be addressed by way of legislation.  I think a culture change is required in how we produce food, how we promote the food we produce and how we encourage food producers.  It seems to me that, for a long time now, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has been corralling producers down one lane, and that is towards greater intensification.  For example, farmers are told that if there is a lake in the middle of their farm, they should take it out because it is a waste of time.  They are told that if there is a hedgerow, they should take it out because it is a waste of space.  At the same time, we have a Government that is rightly promoting biodiversity.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine - inadvertently, perhaps - is promoting forms of agriculture that are completely detrimental to that.  Therefore, we need to take a step back.</p> <p> I do not think that what I have highlighted or sought to highlight can be addressed by way of anti-competition legislation.  It is a political issue, but it is about who holds political sway in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  I do not mean it is about which party holds sway.  The question is whether it is a Department for food producers or a Department for large-scale multinational beef packers and co-operatives that are increasingly moving away from the farmer base that heretofore owned them and controlled them.  I fear the dairy sector will go the same way as the beef sector in that it will become, in a way, controlled by processors rather than controlled by producers.</p></speech>

I will start with farming because I always like reminding the House that Ireland is predominantly a farming and agriculture-based country.  This Government, however, as well as successive governments in the past, seems to have forgotten that.  It has forgotten farmers and fishermen.  Every obstacle that could be put in their way has been put in their way.  Farmers are extremely resilient.  They have to fight against weather and the cartels involved in beef factories.  They have to fight all the time just to survive and make a living.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately, the Government does not do much to help them.  Who are the additional carbon taxes that have recently been imposed going to affect adversely the most?  It is the farming community and people living in rural Ireland.  I refer to the price of diesel in petrol stations at the moment.  I never thought I would live to see the day that the price of agri-diesel would go over &euro;1 per litre.  I never thought that would happen.  There are exactly 4.56 l in a gallon.  I never thought I would see the day that a gallon would cost more than &euro;4.  It is nearly heading to &euro;5.  It is an awful expense on farmers.  It is an awful burden to try to take.</p>  <p>  When farmers go to the mart, they being are hit with a cartel or monopoly type of situation with the factories.  I and Deputy Mattie McGrath and others from around the country stood shoulder to shoulder outside meat factories - I stood outside the meat factories in Rathkeale and Bandon - trying to stand up for farmers and be there for them in their time of need.  Unfortunately, we still have not won our way.  When I say "our way", what we wanted was fair play and a fair price.  All farmers want to do is cover their costs and make a modest profit so they can continue trading the next year.  That is not happening, however.</p>  <p>  In the context of business and life generally, in the past, governments were made up of people who, at home, were doing the ordinary things.  They were farmers, shopkeepers, publicans or undertakers.  They employed just a few people here and there.  Now when I look across the Chamber at Ministers - obviously, I am not referring to the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, who is present, as I would never personalise anything - talking about job creation, I see people who never created a job or paid a man or woman on a Friday.  I hear people over here talking about the working man but a lot of these fellas here talking about it never did a day's work in their lives.  When I look across at the Ministers, I see people who do not know what it is to stick their hand in their pocket and have to pay somebody.  They do not know the obligations of being an employer.  They do not know the obligations and rights to which an employer has to adhere to employ people properly.  That is why I say they are out of touch and do not know what they are talking about.</p>  <p>  I refer to the situation for small grocers at the moment, for instance.  I will again declare that I am a small shopkeeper.  I am a small employer in a small village and have been so since I was 18 or 19 years of age.  Believe me, it is a terribly difficult place to be when you are trying to balance a book, pay your tax, keep your nose clean and be open for the next year of trading.  It is not easy.  Deputies might ask whether I have anything good to say about the Government.  Of course, if it was not for the incentives that were given to small businesses and the schemes that were in put in place, and if it was not for those mechanisms to help employers and their employees, whether in the catering sector, the hoteliers or the pubs that were shut for so long, an awful lot of the small businesses in County Kerry that I represent would be shut today.</p> <p>Of course, that was a lifeline and I acknowledge and say thanks for it.  </p> <p> Now that those schemes are finishing, the hard reality of trying to make the business wash its face is going to be back on those employers again who desperately want to hold on to their loyal workers.  We must remember that if it was not for the workers, there would be no business.  It is very important that those employees and employers are protected to ensure that our small businesses in our rural areas, in particular, are kept vibrant.  We must also consider the fishermen who have been sold out.  At the end of the day these are the things that are so important.  The farming, the small businesses, the people who create two and three jobs and the fishermen.  All of these businesses are in a constant battle just to keep their heads above water.  </p> <p> One thing I want to touch on is the whole scheme around contractors.  I declare an interest as I have been involved in that business all of my life.  It is becoming very difficult because of the whole E-tendering system.  When a big job comes to a county, this job goes to a big contractor.  I have no problem with that if the big contractor will employ the smaller local contractors, which is great.  We have a situation where no matter what size the job that comes up now is, one really has to be in the stratospheric league of things to be able to qualify.  In other words, when tenders are being offered, if there is a contractor who is tax compliant whose nose is clean from a regulatory point of view - which of course it has to be - that person should be entitled to take their chances and tender for that scheme.  Remember, in order to grow, to get bigger and to make what one does better, one has to start somewhere.  When I think of contracting in Kerry I think of great people, the likes of Mike Jack Cronin of the MC Group.  I think of where he started, from what I would call very humble beginnings, and grew into a great organisation.  It is very difficult for a person to do that.  There are certainly no incentives there for a person like that.  It is nothing but the height of absolute hard work, determination and, of course, a good workforce that is needed.  It is great to see small beginnings like that come up along in the world and indeed the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage was in Kerry to go to one of Mike Cronin&rsquo;s sites recently.  </p> <p> The Taoiseach visited another great group of people in Tricel.  That family, a husband and wife organisation in the Stack family, started out from very humble beginnings and did great things.  I compliment the Stack family on what they have achieved, where they now have 500 employees.  This was a husband and wife team which started in 1973 in the great town of Killarney.  Now it is doing very significant work exporting its tanks and its renewable energy solutions around the world.  It is a great achievement for a small family business to grow into that.  </p> <p> The opportunities for others to do that is very limited and I blame the E-tendering scheme in the way that it is structured.  It is like the chicken and egg - where does one start?  One cannot start big, one has to start small but if one starts small now the opportunity of getting bigger is very limited because of the whole tendering system.  </p> <p> Our tendering system has to be open, of course, to every type of scrutiny and transparency, which is what we want, but I want to see more people being given the opportunity of a bite of the cherry.  I compliment, as I am doing in talking about these types of businesses, all of the people who are involved in that type of contracting.  We are fortunate in Kerry and Cork at the moment that there are a number of large infrastructural projects that are under way and are in the pipeline.  I warmly welcome those, including the greenway which has been finally given which I would call the legal green light.  It will be a lifeline to Cahirsiveen and to the people of the Iveragh Peninsula because it was held up for a number of years.  I believe it will be one of the finest walkways we will have in Europe.  People will come from all around the world to travel, to walk on and to use that walkway when it will be opened.</p></speech>

There is a great difference between going to a landowner in one way as opposed to another.  There was a very nice man in the place where I come from and he said it is all about how one approaches a thing.  There is a great deal to be said for that.  Those were very wise words.  No matter what one is at in life, it all depends on how one goes about it.  Unfortunately, there were a great number of lessons for us all to learn.  I am not pointing the finger of blame at any one person or to any organisation but the legal complications that ensued were most unfortunate.</p>  <p>  There is no point in life if, when we are so busy going forward, you look behind yourself and will fall over what is in front of you.  We must look forward and that is what I will be looking to do in County Kerry.  I hope now again that the Cabinet, where there is money already in the kitty, will provide additional funds which will be greatly needed.  The Green Party is shouting all the time about greenways and walkways.  Now is the time then for it to put its money where its mouth is to ensure that we will be putting funds there, on top of the funds that are there already, to start and complete the project and the job of work in a timely fashion.  I am looking forward to as many people from Kerry being employed there as possible because the Iveragh Peninsula is so devoid of employment at the moment.  It would be an economic boost in construction and a great economic boost afterwards to go from Mountain Stage on through Kells and down into Cahirsiveen.  It will be a great lift for that entire region, be it going down to Ballinskelligs, Portmagee and Valentia Island and across all of that area.  We will all benefit from the greenway which I welcome.</p>  <p>  I come back to the obstacles that are put in the way of business.  One of the biggest problems that we have at the moment in all types of businesses is the energy costs.  It is laughable when I hear the Government saying that it recognises now that there is a problem.  Of course there is a problem but who caused the problem only the Government?  The Government, on the one hand is going ahead, gung-ho, in imposing carbon budgets and taxes on top of other ordinary taxes and increases.  At the same time it is telling the people that it will hit and hurt them this way, but that it must try to devise a way to help and assist the people in another way.  In other words, we must try to give the people some of their own money back.  That is crazy.  We should be ensuring that we have a surety of electricity supply in this country which we do not have at present.  We are going to be overly reliant on England and France and we will finish up buying it from them because we have shut down Bord na M&oacute;na and ensured that those stations were closed.  </p>  <p>  At the same time, if one then looks at Moneypoint and Tarbert, they were shut because of the Green Party but in spite of that party they were opened again and the reason for this was if they were not, there is a great possibility that we would be here in the dark with a candle.  That is a fact.  This is a stark fact and it is one that the Green Party Members hate to be reminded of but I will remind them of it over and over again.</p>  <p>  I will also remind them that last night it was very upsetting to hear a Minister coming out to say that it was great that we were going to give the people &euro;25,000 of a grant while at the same time telling them that it will cost between &euro;50,000 and &euro;55,000 to do this job.  The Government was saying that it will give a grant of &euro;25,000 to people who have trouble paying their ESB bills, heating their homes and educating their families because money is so scarce in family homes at present.  </p>  <p>  I want to give a reminder to the Government at a time when it is topical to ask if the Government is in touch or out of touch. </p> <p>I hold 40 to 50 clinics every month in rural areas and in the larger towns and centres of population in County Kerry.  I like to think I am acutely attuned to what is happening in family homes and the pressures that are on families at present post pandemic, the financial constraints on them and the ever-increasing costs of just living.  They go to the petrol station where previously &euro;55 or &euro;60 would fill the car but now it costs way over &euro;100.  That is a fact.  It is costing &euro;104 to &euro;108 to fill the average car.  I never thought I would see that happen, and it is getting worse.  Consider what a person is paying for electricity.  If the electricity bill was &euro;100 previously, there is no problem in saying that the bill is now over &euro;200.  That is the reality.  There is the cost of medical care and the cost of basics such as education - sending young lads out to school, packing their bags with their lunches, buying their books and sending them on their way.  It is ordinary, daily living.  When we talk about competition and living in Ireland, we must remember those facts.  They are sore and hard facts of life.</p> <p> I want to remind the Minister of State of another matter, and it is very upsetting.  Take the example of people who have a small shop.  In the past the shop supplied the needs of the local schools.  Let us say there were a couple of big schools in the area.  Those people, who were providing local employment, are now being faced with the problem that the schools are being told they can only deal with bigger organisations.  In other words, the stuff will arrive in a van from Dublin to the school in the rural area, instead of from the local shop that was supplying such goods to the school and giving local employment.  We are losing that connectivity, and it is a problem.  I use that as an example.  These are stationery stores, people who supply schoolbooks and the like.  They are finding things extremely difficult because they are being debarred.</p> <p> There is the same type of situation with the HSE.  If there is a hospital in a community, the one thing the hospital should be doing is trying to procure and source all goods it can locally.  Obviously, we want local people to get employment in the hospital, but we also want the services and the day-to-day supplies that are needed in the hospital.  It is only good business sense that we support local and shop local.  I do not mind giving a little bit of a rub when I see these international groups coming here - obviously, I would be too polite to name them - and hear them boast about creating so many jobs because they are opening this shop here and that shop there.  These are people who would not even bank their money in Ireland; they take their money abroad to bank it, for fear something would happen it here.  When those people are boasting about the jobs they are creating, they never mention the jobs they are displacing.  They never say how many shops they have closed in a locality.  It is similar to a petrol station, for example.  When we see one being established with a shiny new place, nothing is said about all the places that had to close to make way for it.  I have seen that happening.</p> <p> I again thank and greatly support the small family businesses that take on the conglomerates and the big multinational groups that come here just to profit here and take their money and everything they can out of the country.  It is like what we saw happening with the Debenhams workers in Tralee.  It is all about coming in with a smash-and-grab effect.  I am not talking about the business I just mentioned.  I referred to Debenhams in the context that I felt the workers were treated so badly.  In broad terms, I am talking about businesses that come here just to make what they can and go away with it.  Compare that with the small family business that has been in the area perhaps for decades.  It is there for years, and we see the generations - the older people, the present family and the younger people coming up - carrying on the business, whether it is a pub, a hotel, a shop, a plant hire business or a small building contractor.</p> <p> Those people have a thing in their blood that the big businesses do not know about.  I will explain.  It is the blood that is running through their veins; the business is in their blood.  The ability to survive is in their blood.  The ability to make a couple of pounds, survive and just plod along is in their blood.  That cannot be bought; it cannot be made.  It is the spirit of resilience.  That is the Irish spirit of fighting on the flat of one's back.  When everything goes wrong and people are down and everything is down on top of them, they rise out of the ashes, take it on and fight on again to live another day.  Some of the best friends I had and some of the best business people I ever knew went broke.  They went broke possibly twice or three times.  However, every time they went down, as sure as they went down they came back up again, and they came back up bigger, better and stronger.  They plodded along.  What else did they do?  They created local employment again.</p> <p> I think of all those business people, past and present and hopefully in future generations.  We, as legislators, and today's Government are only all on a wheel.  We are only here for a while.  We must ensure that those businesses will be nurtured and looked after, and that everything that can be done to keep them rolling along will be done.  We need not be too worried about the big conglomerates because they can mind themselves, but we must mind our local businesses because they are so important.  That is the message I send from the House tonight.</p></speech>

I will start by responding to some of those comments and questions.</p>  <p>  Several Deputies mentioned the recent CCPC investigation of price-signalling in the motor insurance sector.  This Bill means that in future such behaviour will be punishable by huge administrative sanctions.  Deputies O'Reilly, Carthy and &Oacute; Murch&uacute; mentioned the delay in bringing this Bill forward.  In an Irish constitutional context, this Bill is groundbreaking.  It also goes further than merely transposing the directive by extending the administrative sanctions to breaches of national competition law and increasing other CCPC powers regarding mergers and surveillance.  The Minister is committed to ensuring that the CCPC is well resourced.</p>  <p>  A number of Deputies raised the matter of flood insurance.  The CCPC can only look at the insurance sector from the perspective of competition law.  Regulation of the insurance sector overall rests with the Central Bank.  On the matter of the banking sector, again regulation is within the remit of the Central Bank.  The CCPC's role relates to competition law and assessment of mergers.</p>  <p>  In response to Deputy Shanahan, this legislation would have had no role to play in the banking crisis as the issues at that time were not related to competition law breaches.</p>  <p>  The public procurement issues raised are not within the Minister's remit as they are the responsibility of the procuring body.  I am the Minister of State with responsibility for public procurement and I can say that the majority of public procurement spend is allocated to small and medium enterprises.  I meet with representatives of the small and medium enterprises sector every quarter so their feedback can be taken into account in matters of procurement law.</p>  <p>  Deputy Bruton asked about administrative sanctions for broader than competition law breaches.  He mentioned the use of personal data.  This is within the remit of the Data Protection Commissioner.  As Deputy Bruton will be aware, matters regarding consumers switching providers in the areas of utilities, insurance and financial services fall to ministerial colleagues with responsibilities related to the regulation of those sectors, namely, the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications and the Minister for Finance.  The Commission for Regulation of Utilities provides a list of electricity and gas providers with some helpful hints and tips on switching.  Comparing insurance prices is more complicated as often insurance contracts cover a range of products, making comparisons more difficult.  This is a topic that the Minister of State with responsibility for financial services, credit unions and insurance, Deputy Fleming, has pressed upon the insurance industry, urging more transparency.  There is also a useful comparison on the Health Insurance Authority's website where consumers can compare the cost of plans from different insurers for similar benefits.</p> <p>Comparing prices and using comparison sites, such as those provided by the CCPC, are always sensible steps in order that we can compare not only the prices but also the benefits of each supplier.  That is why the CCPC recently launched a consumer information campaign aimed at promoting its free, independent money tools.  I encourage consumers to visit the CCPC website, <i>www.ccpc.ie</i>, to avail of these very useful tools, which could end up saving consumers significant amounts of money.<br/><br/>I intend to bring the Deputies' concerns to the attention of my colleagues, the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan; the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Sean Fleming; and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath.  To reply in particular to Deputies O'Donoghue and McNamara, the powers of ComReg to enforce competition law are affected by this Bill but the legislation does not have any effect on its powers as a sectoral regulator.  Those powers remain under the remit of its parent Department, which is the Department for the Environment, Climate and Communications.  Many Deputies raised farmers' concerns, especially around beef and pork prices.  This Bill will not be the panacea for all the concerns of farmers but it provides for severe financial punishment for any operators in the meat sector found to be in breach of competition law.<br/><br/>In moving this Bill, we believe the powers being given to the CCPC and ComReg as a consequence of the legislation will act as a deterrent to anticompetitive behaviour by enterprise.  These powers will help the Government in its efforts to tackle white-collar crime in our economy, which will be of benefit to everybody living and working here.  The Minister of State, Deputy Troy, looks forward to working with the House during Committee and Report Stages of the Bill, including on any amendments that may be proposed.  As mentioned, the Bill underwent pre-legislative scrutiny before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment and it has been drafted to reflect several of the key issues outlined in the committee's report.  I hope there can be cross-party support to ensure we get this Bill enacted as soon as possible.</p></speech>

The amendment seeks to address a number of weaknesses in the Bill.  A number of amendments that were ruled out of order for various reasons also sought to improve the legislation.</p><p>This amendment seeks to deal with three issues, the first of which is the prospect of the payment being made to people who have holiday homes with potentially very little electricity use.  These houses would only be used for some weeks of the year.  The amendment also applies to people with multiple properties who would be in a position to receive multiple payments for their properties.  At the very least, such situations do not reflect their electricity or energy use and the cost to them of electricity.  This anomaly should be addressed, especially when considered in the context of the potential risk that people who are house sharing and splitting bills or whose names are not on the bill will miss out on this payment.  Paragraph (f) of the amendment provides that renters would receive the benefit of the payment.</p><p>We call for a dispute resolution mechanism to be put in place.  The Minister, in his Second Stage speech, indicated that such a provision will be made.  When this payment is triggered, which is not happening nearly quickly enough, we need to ensure that those who are entitled to it get the benefit of it.</p><p>Paragraph (g) addresses a fundamental weakness of the measure, namely, its universal nature.  It is not targeted.  While the Government has made its case on that, it is a fundamental weakness.  Despite other measures the Government has introduced, many people will still be below the waterline, even with this &euro;100 payment.  We are incredibly frustrated that the Government did not go further or take action earlier and that it has taken this long to reach this juncture.  We set out in our pre-budget submission, and will set out in the days ahead, the course the Government should take.  A fundamental part of that is a response that is reflective of the burden on individuals and families.  We do not see that in the legislation.  Paragraph (g) gives all those who do not need this support, including every Member of this House, an opportunity to forgo the payment and redirect towards charities working in the area of energy poverty.</p><p>The amendment would strengthen the Bill.  Of the 11 amendments we submitted, ten have been ruled out of order.  They also would have strengthened the Bill.  I ask the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, to support the amendment and take on board the contributions made on Second Stage by Deputies from across the political spectrum, particularly the Opposition, pointing out the weakness of this Bill.  I appreciate that there are constraints on the Government with regard to the targeting of this measure but those constraints were self-inflicted by the Government.  It has not done the work over the years to identify those living in energy poverty and at risk of energy poverty.  There is no sophistication in the architecture of the State, including Department, to direct those resources in the way they should be directed.  This is down to a lack of preparation.</p><p>The Government has indicated it will make proposals which, while not a mini-budget, will address the costs of living.  I ask that the weaknesses of the Bill be addressed in the suite of measures that are brought forward.  Sinn F&eacute;in would be more than happy to advise in that regard.</p></speech>

We are trying to reinvigorate our tourism industry.  There are many good holiday home operators.  While we will always have some cowboys, the vast majority of them are good.  I am talking about a fear uasal i nD&uacute;n Garbh&aacute;n.  People need to get out into the sun and the water, and get their space.  They are so hard-pressed and at the pin of their collars.  Some recognition should be allowed for that.  This is why I support the amendment.</p>  <p>  Let us face it; people are subletting houses.  I remember older people, some of whom may have gone on to their eternal reward, telling me that when they got married they lived in a room in their parents' house or rented a room in someone's house.  We are back to those days again because people cannot get onto the property ladder because they cannot afford it.  One of the reasons for that is that direct Government actions in the past year have prohibited it.  While I do not mean anything personal, the Minister's actions have directly contributed to the huge costs facing people trying to build a house.  It is just impossible for a young couple, or any kind of a couple, to build a house now.  A builder will not even give a quotation and builders suppliers will not give a quotation for more than three days because prices are going up by the week.</p>  <p>  Students are also being exploited.  They pay for their electricity through meters but there is no provision for that in the Bill.</p> <p>There should be some dispute resolution mechanism.  This is a feeble attempt by the Government to deal with this problem.  When a tax, punitive or otherwise, is being introduced, it is applied at 12 midnight.  However, we are making a big song and dance about a &euro;113 payment.  We are talking and talking about it.  People cannot live.  The cost of everything has gone up.  We in the Rural Independent Group have looked for a mini budget because it is necessary.  </p> <p> The amendment is very good and I compliment Deputy O'Rourke and his colleagues on bringing it forward.  We have to try to deal with this, and the public are expecting us to do so.  Why are we so slow to react?  Why does take departmental organisation months to act?  We are nearly halfway through February.  I wish everyone a happy Valentine's weekend.  We have been waiting a long time for this to come through.  Debates on different taxes, medical cards, grants or supports go on forever.</p></speech>

Surely there must be some way to do that?  We used to use the peann luaidhe, but now we have computers.  When PUP was introduced, I pleaded with the Minister concerned to address that.  Anybody who is an employer knows that PRSI is now paid weekly.  All of that information is on a computer.  People could have been given what they were earning.  Students and others working one or two nights a week who earned &euro;100 or &euro;120 ended up getting &euro;350.  Trying to wean people off that payment is like trying to take milk from a calf.</p>  <p>  What happened was stupid.  The press of a button would tell someone what each employee earned.  There might be a few in the black market, but I am not talking about them.  I am talking about legitimate businesses that paid people.  We now have all kinds of problems as a result of the PUP.  Some went on foreign holidays.  Many people did not abuse it.  The payment was too much.  People should have received what they were paid.  We are talking about supports, not luxuries.  Why can we not separate payments like we separate the chaff from the oats?  I do not mean that in a bad way; we do that at harvest time.  That would mean people who do not need it will not get it.  We can decide payments made to businesses that are in profit should be repaid, but it is very hard to get something back once it has been given.  </p>  <p>  As I said, the amendment refers to some mechanism for dispute resolution.  The &euro;100 will not go here nor there in terms of people's bills.  Diesel, fuel, home heating oil and ESB bills have increased.  There will be a &euro;500 upfront cost for repairs to a roof under the retrofit scheme when it is introduced in October, following an assessment.  People do not have that kind of money.  They are on the breadline.  They are struggling.  The Government does not seem to get that people need money in their p&oacute;ca anois.   </p>  <p>  I do not know why Departments are so cumbersome that they cannot engage with people and have a humane approach.  I am not knocking departmental officials, but the system is so unwieldy that we cannot seem to have that flexibility or understanding.  As I said, we are too slow to react.  We can react on budget night at 12 midnight, but when we want to give something back to people it takes months.  I do not know when this will happen, but we are a good number of months away from the budget.  Some other support packages are being considered.  </p>  <p>  We need a mini budget.  The Government can deny that and keep its head in the sand, but it will have to happen because the people will starve, as I said yesterday.  They are suffering every which way and cannot survive.  It is not fair to our people.  They have endured two years of hell.  They are a resilient people, but the resilience is wearing thin at the moment.  People are cross, angry and not at all happy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-02-09a.389" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1698" speakername="Ivana Bacik" time="17:27:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020900054#HHH00400"><p>I will speak on the amendment as we are on Committee Stage.  I support the amendment, on behalf of the Labour Party.  It relates to an issue I raised during the Second Stage debate on the Bill, namely, the need to ensure adequate integration of renters into the proposed framework in the Bill.  Clearly, the rebate for householders will be welcome, but we have criticised it as being inadequate and merely a drop in the ocean when we see the soaring cost of living crisis that so many households are facing.</p><p>On Second Stage I spoke specifically about renters.  We know that in Dublin Bay South as many as 44% of all properties are private rentals.  Figures from <i>daft.ie</i>today show a chronic and historic shortage of supply of rental accommodation in Dublin, with just 712 homes are available to rent at an average rent of &euro;2,000 per month.  We know that the cost of rent is exorbitant.  We also know that, therefore, in any Bill such as this which seeks to address issues with the cost of living there has to be adequate regard for renters.</p><p>That is why the amendment is crucial, because it seeks to put in place better protections for renters, specifically to ensure that the Minister will make provision to ensure that renters receive the benefit of the rebate.  As I pointed out on Second Stage, we would all hope that landlords would ensure that any saving on bills is passed onto renters, but in the absence of any safeguarding measure in the Bill this could not be guaranteed.  That is why it is important that a guarantee such as this is inserted into the Bill.  I urge the Minister to accept the amendment.  There will be a fairly united front from the Opposition in support of it.</p><p>I was dismayed to learn that ten of the 11 amendments have been ruled out of order, as Deputy O'Rourke has said.  I also sought to table amendments on foot of the speech I made on Second Stage, only to be told that the deadline for accepting amendments was before the start of the Second Stage debate.  I am new to the D&aacute;il, but this struck me as a really poor procedural law.  We could not, therefore, have a Second Stage debate in any meaningful way because the deadline for putting forward amendments had already passed.  That is the only reason I do not have an amendment on safeguarding.  We had drafted an amendment on safeguarding renters, but that was disallowed by the Bills Office.  That is not necessarily the call of the Minister, but it is a flaw in the procedure.  That is exacerbated by the fact that out of the 11 amendments Members managed to put forward, ten have been ruled out of order.  Therefore, this is the only amendment we will have a chance to debate on the floor of the House.  That is really unfortunate.  It is an important amendment to support and I am glad to do so on behalf of the Labour Party.  It will provide more robust safeguards for renters, which is important, in particular in the context of report today on the crucial shortage of rental properties and the 10% increase year on year in the cost of rent across the country.  </p><p>I wish to emphasise that this is not just a Dublin issue; this is about the cost of rent across the country and the lack of protections for renters more generally.  This amendment seeks to address that in the context of a Bill that is about addressing the extortionate rise in the cost of living.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-02-09a.390" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1592" speakername="Carol Nolan" time="17:27:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020900054#HHH00500"><p>The Oireachtas has shown from research that we have had more price volatility in the past 11 months than in the previous 12 years.  This has had a serious impact on households.  The rebate does not go far enough and I support the amendment which seeks to protect those in the rental market.  The &euro;100 rebate will not go far enough for a lower paid people.  We need to bear in mind that those in the rental sector are constantly trying to cope with spiralling rental prices and other cost of living pressures.  We need immediate action, and a &euro;100 rebate will not address that.</p>  <p>  Many measures are needed, and a mini budget must deliver for the most vulnerable in particular.  Age Action Ireland has highlighted its concerns about elderly people and the serious impact rising costs are having on that cohort.  Many countries in the European Union have introduced a range of measures to try to protect the most vulnerable and counteract the rise in electricity prices and so on, and the negative impact it is having on so many families around Europe.</p> <p>For example, Austria plans to spend &euro;1.7 billion on easing the impact on families of surging energy prices.  The measures announced last week include suspending an eco-tax introduced six years ago.  That adds about &euro;33 a year to bills.  The Austrian Government is also pledging to hand &euro;300 back to those out of work.  Austrian electricity prices have increased by 12.4% on last year.</p> <p> Earlier this month Belgium decided to cut value added tax on electricity as part of a package to shield consumers from rising energy prices.  It is also giving all households &euro;100 relief on electricity bills and extending its social price rates.  Britain's price cap will rise by 54% from 1 April, its regulator, OfGEM, announced on Thursday in its six-monthly review of prices.  To limit the impact, the British Government launched a package of measures, including a &pound;200 discount on electricity bills for all households to be repaid over five years and a &pound;150 rebate on council tax bills for about 80% of households in England.</p> <p> In December, Bulgaria's Parliament voted to freeze power and heating prices for households until the end of March in a move seen as allowing time for the new coalition Government to come up with a plan to shield households from surging energy costs.</p> <p> The Irish Government needs to come up with a package that will deliver and will protect the most vulnerable in our society, including those in rented accommodation, elderly people and particularly businesses which have been very badly treated and are trying to get on their feet after Covid restrictions put them on the back foot.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-02-09a.392" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1627" speakername="Jennifer Whitmore" time="17:37:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020900055#JJJ00200"><p>The Social Democrats will be supporting the Sinn F&eacute;in amendment.  It is a very important amendment and I am pleased to see it included.  I also raise the issue of the short timeframe associated with the Bill.  I know it includes the term "emergency measures" in its Title.  There was no pre-legislative scrutiny and the timeframes are very short.  I also believe it did not need to be such an emergency measure.  It was clear from last September that we were facing a serious fuel crisis and a cost-of-living crisis.  In September, I asked for us to have statements in the D&aacute;il on the rising cost of energy prices, but that was not allowed.  If some foresight and planning had been put in place at that point for what was clearly coming down the road, perhaps this Bill might not have needed to have been an emergency measure Bill and we could have gone through a full and proper process in dealing with it.</p>  <p>  The amendments spell out clearly what the issues are with the Bill.  When talking about the inflation crisis we are facing, the Governor of the Central Bank was very clear that there were three key drivers - transport, rent and energy costs.  He also made it very clear that the inflation crisis was not impacting on everybody in the same way and that some people were suffering far more than others, particularly vulnerable people living in poverty.  It is unfortunate that targeted measures were not put in place to assist the people who are in most need of this support and instead this broad-brush approach was taken.</p>  <p>  On Second Stage, I mentioned that it was not targeted, and the explanation I was given was that from an administrative perspective it is cumbersome or difficult to work out.  However, it cannot be rocket science to exclude from the scheme people with multiple houses or people who have holiday homes.  It sends completely the wrong message that the 62,000 people who have holiday homes will get &euro;100 for a home where very little energy is used and it is also their second home.  That sends out a very poor message to people who are really struggling at the moment and are making choices between food on the table, fuel or perhaps paying rent or the mortgage.  We need a more targeted approach.</p>  <p>  In the long term, things like the retrofitting plan will make households more secure from energy price rises.  However, for what needs to be put in place at the moment, while many people welcome this Bill, it will not be enough.  The Government could introduce measures that would be highly targeted and would seek to protect people who are most vulnerable to these cost increases.  I have written to the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities on this matter.  It needs to extend its moratorium on disconnections which, I understand, is due to end on 11 March.  There is a risk that we could have a cold snap over the next month or two which would put people in a very difficult position.</p>  <p>  The Government should also extend the fuel allowance beyond March.  It should also link it to the working family payment because many working people are struggling to meet these price increases.  The exceptional needs payment should be doubled to assist those people.  We also need to recognise that it is not just people in receipt of social supports who will be hit by this rising cost of energy and rising inflation.  The Social Democrats have proposed that a refundable tax credit of &euro;300 be provided for those earning &euro;50,000 a year or less.  The Government could introduce a range of measures because one measure will not be sufficient for people.  Even if it were highly targeted, some people would fall outside it.</p>  <p>  I agree with what Deputy Bacik said about those who are renting.  It is important that this money is passed on to people who are renting and gets into the pockets of the people who are paying the bill and not just the ones who from an administrative perspective are receiving the payment.</p>  <p>  I have a feeling that we will be back again seeking to extend the provisions of the Bill at some stage.  I ask the Minister to look at those amendments and suggestions.  We do not know what is going to happen on the global energy market.  If something like this happens again, we should not fall foul of this again and we should not allow people who can afford two homes to get very valuable State support.</p>  <p>  The fact that the Bill is not meeting people's needs and is not doing what people need it to do has opened up the discourse on the carbon tax.  It has turned the carbon tax into an environmental bogeyman.  People feel that carbon tax is the problem, which is taking away from the importance of the carbon tax in actually paying for retrofitting schemes and supporting people to make the just transition, allowing us to take the actions needed to address climate change.  The lack of proactively by the Government on the issue has allowed for that discourse to happen which is really unfortunate.</p>  <p>  The entire carbon tax yield needs to be paid back into climate action, allowing vulnerable people and people who need to take those measures-----</p></speech>

No amendments will be accepted, similar to what happened with the climate action Bill.  It looks like it is going to be &quot;my way or the highway&quot; when it comes to the amendments.</p><p>The discussion should be on the &euro;100 subsidy.</p> <p>It goes nowhere near where it should have gone.  As I said earlier, I do not know whether the Minister has ever been in the countryside, on a farm.  When they are put out for the first time, calves are often seen jumping and gadding around the place.  That is what the Government has been doing for the past week.  Where has the Government been for the past 12 months?  The country is on its knees and the Government disappeared.  Now the Government is jumping around as if there has been a crisis this week only.  There has been a crisis for months and months.  My colleagues in the Rural Independent Group and I have been calling on the Government to put in place protective measures for people who cannot pay their electricity bills, put fuel in the car or buy fertiliser for the farm.  The Government stood idly by until maybe a few among them went back to their constituencies in recent weeks and got it in the neck.  The &euro;100 is a pittance.  No one should ever disregard getting a few quid but, Lord God, people have been hit with bills.  I have listened to people who have the heating turned off in their homes and who are seriously suffering because of the measures the Government has brought forward.  The Government needs to bring in emergency measures and a mini-budget immediately.  One hundred euro will go nowhere.</p> <p> The Minister can deny all the amendments before him if he so wishes and if he does not want to co-operate with others in here - that is fine and that will be his choice - but the public will have their say at the end of the day.  I am just sorry to think that those in Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael are backing the Green Party in the way they are because the public will have their say on each and every one of those Deputies as well.  The Government has left people perishing with the cold, unable to turn on their lights, unable to pay their electricity bills and unable to pay for home heating oil.  The Government is dreaming and dreaming and hoping people will dream away with it, but most people are not.  They are coming to reality, starting with a few.  A fierce reality has struck them.</p> <p> The carbon tax needs to be ceased immediately.  Good God almighty, where does the Government think the people are finding the money?  The Government must think they are millionaires with a load of money stuffed under their mattresses at home ready to throw out to the Government for pet projects around Dublin city.  I am sorry, but it will not work that way.  People are struggling.  The Minister needs to accept some of these amendments tonight to show a clear understanding of the way people are suffering.  If he does not, that is fine.  We will keep pushing from this end.  It took us maybe seven or eight months to get the Government to jump around the way it is doing this week.  It is only now worried about the public, whereas countries such as Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands are already working on this and have put in place measures to protect their people.</p> <p> I am bitterly disappointed.  A &euro;100 subsidy was a joke.  Now the Government realises that.  It has a tendency to make a lot of announcements and then, two or three days later, another announcement and another announcement on the same issue, as with the &euro;1,000 to be given to the care workers, when it forgot the home-----</p></speech>

The Government forgot about the home helps in all this.  We keep pushing and pushing.  The bottom line is that the &euro;100 subsidy is by no means enough.  I urge the Minister to take on board many of the amendments put before him.  Certainly, I will support those amendments.  Again, it is time for a mini-budget immediately in order to keep in touch with what is going on and with the reality on the ground because people are angered and in a difficult position financially.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-02-09a.401" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="17:47:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020900056#KKK00400"><p>I wish to clarify that whether amendments are accepted or otherwise has nothing to do with the Government.  That is a Bills Office issue.  Similarly, I take Deputy Bacik's point about the timing of amendments, but that was not within our control.</p>  <p>  I wish to respond to this amendment and to each of the three subsections it is proposed to insert, paragraphs (e), (f) and (g), in order.  Paragraph (e) concerns criteria and system design.  I emphasise that this scheme is an exceptional measure designed to be delivered directly to all domestic electricity accounts using the existing electricity billing infrastructure and without application of qualifying criteria.  Using that infrastructure, it is not possible to determine whether individual premises are used for purposes other than a principal private residence.  This design of the scheme is aimed to enable payments to be made at the earliest possible opportunity in 2022, without delay and in light of the exceptional rise in energy prices.</p>  <p>  As for the proposed insertion of paragraph (f), for operational reasons, the scheme can credit only domestic electricity accounts.  I understand that the majority of the 300,000 tenancies registered with the RTB hold their own domestic electricity accounts.  In such instances, the payment will be applied directly to those households.  Others who have tenancy agreements whereby tenants pay their actual share of each bill will benefit from the payment because the amount of the bill will be reduced by the amount of the payment.  A small proportion have in place other arrangements whereby electricity costs are part of the overall rental cost.  In consultation with my Department, the RTB is working on a public information campaign on this legislation.  In the event of a dispute arising between a tenant and a landlord as a result of a failure to pass on the credit payment, the dispute resolution mechanisms run by the RTB are available.</p>  <p>  I turn to the proposed insertion of paragraph (g).  The scheme is being administered on the basis of the current electricity billing mechanisms and arrangements of ESB Networks and suppliers in order to facilitate the payments to be made at the earliest possible opportunity in 2022.  While I acknowledge the outcome Deputy O'Rourke is trying to achieve with this amendment, a more practical solution would be for individuals who choose not to benefit from this payment to make a donation to charity.  A number of NGOs do very important work to alleviate energy poverty.  That would be the most practical way of ensuring that any payments under this scheme which people do not wish to retain for themselves can be quickly redirected to those who are in greater need, particularly in respect of energy poverty.  I would be very supportive of that.  In this way, the outcome the Deputy seeks could be realised as directly as possible and in the best interests of those living at risk of energy poverty.  On that basis, I propose, unfortunately, to reject the Deputy's amendment.</p>  <p>  As for the wider issue of protections we need to apply, the relevant Cabinet subcommittee will meet tomorrow, as has been publicised, to consider what further measures may be possible.  However, we should not ignore the fact that there has been significant intervention, especially in last year's budget.  I refer, for example, to the expansion of the fuel allowance scheme and the extension of its qualification criteria.  That is one of a range of income supports paid by the Department of Social Protection, which also includes general social welfare schemes, the living alone allowance to support those living alone and at higher risk of poverty, and the household benefits package.  The budget last year increased the weekly rate of the fuel allowance by &euro;5 to &euro;32 per week such that &euro;914 would be paid to eligible households over the course of this winter.  In addition, from January this year there was due to be a &euro;20 increase, from &euro;100 to &euro;120, to the income threshold for qualification for the fuel allowance above the appropriate maximum rate of the contributory State pension.</p>  <p>  Cognisant of rising fuel costs, the Minister for Social Protection asked her officials to prioritise work required in order that this change could be implemented at the same time as the increase in the fuel allowance back in October.  The Department of Social Protection has completed that work, and that &euro;120 allowable means a sum that is significantly more than the &euro;33 weekly rate of fuel allowance.  Increases were also made to the qualified child payment, the living alone allowance and the income threshold for the working family payment, exactly the sort of targeting I heard Deputies rightly call for.  Those are the sorts of measures the Government has been putting in place.  That will be funded by the additional carbon tax revenues of &euro;105 million allocated in this year's budget to the Department of Social Protection.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the household benefits package consists of a set of allowances which help with the costs of running a household.  It includes allowances towards covering electricity or gas costs.  Recipients, the majority of whom are pensioners, are paid &euro;35 per month.  The Department spent approximately &euro;265 million last year on the household benefits package.  Targeted supports were also provided under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, the exceptional needs payments and the urgent needs payments.  Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, a special heating supplement may be paid to assist people in certain circumstances who have special heating needs - for example, in cases of ill health.  This is in addition to the basic welfare and pension rates and adjustments to income tax introduced primarily as a response to the cost-of-living increases more generally and driven in part by higher energy prices.</p> <p>I mention that because, where measures are taken that are targeted in that way and which benefit social welfare recipients, that should be acknowledged.  Forgetting about it politically does not respect the importance that attaches to this issue.  Measures such as those are needed and more may be needed.  Ignoring what is in the budget and what has been done does not do service to that cause.  I thank the Deputy for his amendment.  I regret that the others could not be moved today.  Unfortunately, I cannot accept the amendment.</p></speech>

The issue of how to protect our people in this inflationary period is very important.  This inflation is caused by international events that we do not have control over.  I appreciate the contributions from Deputies and their good intent in coming forward with proposals.  This matter will not end with this Bill but it is a significant step in the right direction.  It is very practical, immediate and deliverable.  What it proposes can be done in a timeframe that will allow it to have an effect as the bills start to hit in the coming months.  It addresses the core part of the problem, which is higher bills, particularly for gas, electricity and heating because of the high fossil fuel prices.  I thank the Deputies for allowing us to get this Bill through.  We will have to go to the Seanad and then put the Bill's provisions into action straight away to affect the bills of households right across the country.</p>  <p>  I will finish by thanking my officials.  They have done the Department and the Civil Service proud in turning it around really quickly.  I thank them for their professional approach and their help in delivering the Bill.  It is their Bill in terms of all the practical arrangements that had to be put in place to make it happen.  I very much recognise their work as central to this whole process.</p></speech>
