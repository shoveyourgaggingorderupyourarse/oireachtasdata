The Department and its agencies are carrying out extensive work to prepare for all Brexit eventualities.  Informed by detailed research, the Department has been putting in place a package of measures that will allow us to respond to the needs of businesses.  This includes the recruitment of additional staff to support businesses to adapt to Brexit and the launch of additional supports for market diversification, innovation and competitiveness improvement.  I also launched a Brexit working capital loan scheme in April 2018, which will provide affordable working capital financing to eligible businesses that are either currently impacted by Brexit or will be impacted in the future.</p><p>My officials are examining policy proposals for a new longer-term business investment loan scheme to support businesses to invest strategically for a post-Brexit environment.  I am also developing proposals for a new business finance advisory hub service which would focus on business development.</p><p>In terms of helping firms to prepare for Brexit, Enterprise Ireland has launched the Brexit small and medium enterprise, SME, scorecard, an interactive online tool which can be used by all Irish companies to self-assess their exposure to Brexit.  Enterprise Ireland is also offering what is known as a &quot;Be Prepared Grant&quot; of up to &euro;5,000 to support clients to develop a Brexit action plan and strategic consultancy grants of up to &euro;35,000.  The agency has also rolled out a number of Brexit advisory clinics across the country.  The Enterprise Ireland market discovery fund provides support to companies to assist them in researching the viability of exporting into new geographical markets, offering maximum grants of &euro;150,000.  The agile innovation fund supports product, service and process innovation to enhance the competitive advantage of Irish companies. </p><p>The local enterprise offices are organising workshops, seminars and training to assist companies to better understand the challenges of Brexit and have a range of supports to help clients.  Similarly, InterTradeIreland is providing a Brexit start to plan readiness voucher scheme of up to &euro;2,000, which enables companies to purchase specialist advice in areas such as customs, tax, tariff and non-tariff barriers, legal and labour mobility issues. </p><p>With regard to state aid considerations, in November 2017, following a meeting with the European Commissioner for Competition with responsibility for EU state aid policy, Ms Margrethe Verstager, we established a technical working group comprising representatives from the Directorate General for Competition and my Department, together with colleagues from Enterprise Ireland and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  The objective of the group is to scope and design schemes to support enterprises impacted by Brexit in line with state aid rules.</p><p><i><font color="#2F2F2F"> Additional information not given on the floor of the House</font></i></p><p>An outcome of the technical working group discussions has been the extension of the Irish rescue and restructuring scheme to include temporary restructuring aid for enterprises facing acute liquid needs.  This provides a further &euro;10 million of State support to those companies experiencing acute liquidity needs and is in addition to the original &euro;10 million announced in November 2017 under the  rescue and restructuring scheme.  Under the scheme guidelines, the temporary restructuring element is in the form of loans repayable over a maximum period of 18 months.  Restructuring aid under this scheme is in the form of direct grants or equity support.</p><p>The Department and agencies will continue to engage with the European Commission over the coming months as the potential impacts of Brexit become clearer.</p></speech>

We all accept that the political capital being used by the Government, Parliament and citizens in the context of addressing the border issues on the island of Ireland is of critical importance from a political, cultural, social and economic perspective and all that flows from that.  None of us wants any form of border on the island beyond what is currently in place.  We must also consider the impact Brexit will have on small and medium businesses.  There is no doubt that, irrespective of how the negotiations on Brexit proceed, the United Kingdom will officially leave the customs union, as we know it, and the Single Market on 29 March 2019.  If an agreement is not reached, World Trade Organization rules will apply.  I am concerned that while the emphasis is on the immediate issue, there is insufficient preparedness not only in terms of resourcing the Department, but also in resourcing the policies the Department should be identifying as key to maintaining and supporting small and medium enterprises that will be dramatically affected by Brexit.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-05-24a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1272" speakername="Pat Breen" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018052400004#B00100"><p>We all share the concerns about what will happen on 29 March 2019.  That is why we put many incentives in place to ensure that we will be as Brexit ready as possible.  The uncertainty obviously causes many problems for companies, particularly those exporting to the UK.  The importance of local enterprise offices, LEOs, must be highlighted.  We have resourced agencies and given them extra staff to deal with Brexit.  As the Deputy said, meetings organised by Enterprise Ireland have been held all over the country.  LEOs are also providing mentoring.  Deputy Kelleher will acknowledge that we have put in place incentives for companies to prepare for Brexit.  I understand the Deputy received a copy of Building Stronger Business - Getting Brexit ready, a small booklet that outlines the tools available including the clinics, the Be Prepared grant, the Enterprise Ireland, EI, market discovery fund, what LEOs and InterTradeIreland are doing and FDI Brexit support.  We are working hard in this area.</p>  <p>  It has to be admitted that there are challenges, but there are also opportunities for companies.  Until we know what is going to happen &ndash; the next few months will be important &ndash; uncertainty is affecting many companies.  At the same time, the UK market will remain important for SMEs and other Irish companies that export into the UK.  We are putting resources in place.  These will be additional to the collaboration that already exists with the Department.</p></speech>

I was in Brussels for the past two days as part of a Fianna F&aacute;il parliamentary delegation to discuss Brexit.  We met Commissioner Hogan, the Council and political groupings.  There is significant support in Europe for addressing the issue of the Border in the context of the all-island arrangement and the Good Friday Agreement.  I am concerned that if the Border issue is addressed, we will have used up all of our political capital and will not have enough- in the context of state aid rules - to get things changed in the future.  I urge that the Minister of State, at the next Competitiveness Council meeting, signal that the Government is going to submit an application for the relaxation of the state aid rules in order to allow for higher thresholds to be made available to companies so that they can be prepared in advance of Brexit, rather than trying to make the case after the event.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-05-24a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1272" speakername="Pat Breen" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018052400004#B00300"><p>In regard to state aid considerations, I will be attending a meeting of the Competitiveness Council in Brussels on Monday next.  The technical working group involving various players, including the Department, Enterprise Ireland and others, has been very successful.  An outcome of the group's discussions has been the extension of the Irish rescue and restructuring scheme to include temporary reconstruction aid for enterprises facing significantly acute needs as regards liquidity.  That provided &euro;10 million in state aid to support companies experiencing difficulties, which is in addition to the &euro;10 million announced in November 2017.  Under the relevant guidelines, the temporary restructuring element is in the form of loans repayable over a maximum period of 18 months.  Restructuring aid under the scheme comes, as the Deputy knows, in the form of direct grants or equity.  My Department and the expert group will continue to engage with the European Commission in the coming months as the impact of Brexit becomes clearer.  That means longer term loans, etc.  We are not reneging on this; rather, we are working hard. I am sure that message was brought home to the Deputy in Brussels during the week.</p></speech>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-05-24a.17.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1345" speakername="Martin Kenny" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018052400004#B00500"><p>How does the Minister of State intend to attract more foreign direct investment to Leitrim and the regions and what is his plan to ensure that indigenous Irish businesses establish and grow in these areas and offset the reliance on foreign direct investment?  I know the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, is absent because she is meeting a delegation at the Border to demonstrate the impact of Brexit.  As a Border county, Leitrim will be particularly impacted upon by Brexit.  We need a new emphasis on bringing foreign direct investment to the region and supporting indigenous business.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State is from County Clare.  The business model relating to Shannon Development works well.  We need to extend that to all rural areas country where there is potential to grow jobs and build industry.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-05-24a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1272" speakername="Pat Breen" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018052400004#B00600"><p>I thank Deputy Martin Kenny for his question.  He he is representing his county well.  The Government is committed to supporting job creation and investment in the regions.  This remains a key priority.  That is why my Department and its agencies are working towards ambitious targets to ensure that employment and investment are distributed as evenly as possible across the country, including in County Leitrim.</p><p>The north east-north west action plan for jobs is a key policy response for supporting employment growth in the Border region.  The plan is stimulating job creation across the region by facilitating collaborative initiatives between the public and private sector and through the provision of new competitive funds awarded through Enterprise Ireland to support regional enterprise projects.</p><p>There are currently five IDA Ireland client companies employing 889 people in Leitrim.  Employment in these five companies has increased steadily over the years, with 283 additional jobs being created between 2013 and 2017.  The increase in employment highlights the work undertaken by IDA Ireland in partnering with its existing client base to help evolve operations and to identify new areas of opportunity in order that they can sustain a long-term presence in the country.</p><p>As well as engaging with current clients in Leitrim, IDA Ireland is also working hard to identify new investment opportunities for the county and the north west.  This is line with the agency's five-year strategy and goal to increase investment in every region of Ireland by 20% to 30% by 2019.  IDA Ireland's staff are continuing to highlight the benefits of areas like Leitrim to investors and the advantages for overseas companies in locating there.</p><p>Our collective efforts to increase investment and job creation in the north-west region, which includes Sligo and Donegal, are aided by the strong base of foreign direct investment currently located in those counties by overseas companies in the region.  As the Deputy knows, employment has been steadily growing over the years.  Last year, for example, IDA Ireland client companies in the north west created 330 new jobs, bringing total foreign direct investment, FDI, employment up to 6,462 people across 40 client companies.</p><p>FDI, represents only one part of our wider efforts to generate economic growth in regional locations.  Indigenous enterprise also plays a crucial role in creating employment opportunities.  Enterprise Ireland plays a key role in supporting companies in areas such as Leitrim to innovate and remain competitive in international markets.  In 2017, 559 people were employed across 25 Enterprise Ireland supported companies in the county.  In addition, Enterprise Ireland paid &euro;1.6 million to client companies based in Leitrim between 2015 and 2017.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>The LEO in Leitrim also provides financial assistance, guidance and other supports for anyone who intends to start or grow their own business.  It can offer direct grant aid to microenterprises in the manufacturing and internationally traded services sectors which, over time, have the potential to develop into strong export entities.  In 2017, the Leitrim LEO supported the creation of 39 new jobs with 101 clients participating in LEO mentoring programmes and 571 clients availing of LEO training programmes.</p><p>We have made progress in creating new economic opportunities in Leitrim but we are determined to achieve more.  That is why we will continue to focus on regional development and explore how we can create new job and investment opportunities for the people of the County and the wider area.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-05-24a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1345" speakername="Martin Kenny" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018052400004#B00700"><p>I am glad to hear the answer from the Minister of State.  It is good to see that there is a focus from the Government on delivering jobs in the regions.  We have heard that before.  However, the reality in places like counties Leitrim and Roscommon and other areas in the north and west is quite different.  Last year, 89 jobs were created in Leitrim by companies supported by IDA Ireland., less than 0.5% of the total number of IDA Ireland jobs created throughout the country in 2017.  The Minister of State can understand why people in County Leitrim feel left out.  Figures from the Central Statistics Office, CSO, show that 5,467 people were on the live register in Sligo and Leitrim last month.  I know there are various initiatives to get people back to work, but the problem is that in many cases the jobs do not exist.  That need to be recognised.</p>  <p>  I appreciate that many companies have to make their own decisions about where they go.  We know that when large companies such as Bank of America MBNA came to Carrick-on-Shannon many years ago it was because of a local connection, namely, a person from Leitrim who worked for the company abroad and got it to come here.  In many cases, that is what we are depending on but we need to depend on more than that.  I would like to know that the Government has a plan with incentives and initiatives to attract FDI companies to go to the places with the most potential in rural areas of the country.  The production economics are much better in rural areas.  There is cheaper housing and everything else is cheaper for people to live and work.  Companies have an opportunity to prosper and develop those areas.  I would like the Government to do something to incentivise that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-05-24a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1272" speakername="Pat Breen" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018052400004#B00800"><p>Leitrim is a little like Clare.  My county is sandwiched between Galway and Limerick and Leitrim is sandwiched between Donegal and Sligo.  I have visited Leitrim in my role as Minister of State and I have seen at first hand the operations of fantastic indigenous companies such as VistaMed, which employs over 400 people.</p><p>There are brewery companies such as the Carrig Brewing Company, as well as companies such as Cora Systems and Prior PLM Medical, which were with me on a trade mission.  Then, of course, there is the famous distillery in Drumshanbo, The Shed Distillery .  There is a lot happening in County Leitrim in the indigenous area.  In the FDI area, there are some really good companies in County Leitrim, such as Avantcard, which has 160 employees and MCi, which has 200 employees in Manorhamilton.</p> <p> For counties such as Leitrim, it is a combination of both indigenous micro-enterprises and IDA Ireland jobs.  What is important is to keep trying to attract jobs into the regions.  If one looks at the track record of IDA Ireland, last year alone it created more than 10,000 jobs, with 45% of those outside the greater Dublin area.  I assure Deputy Martin Kenny that we are working hard to ensure County Leitrim is very much part of the overall picture for balanced regional development.</p></speech>

I am aware of and acknowledge that, but much of it is not driven by Government incentive or initiatives.  It is driven by the companies themselves who are developing and working.  What my party is saying is there needs to be more effort made to help those companies, and particularly the indigenous industries.</p>  <p>  Brexit is looming and many of our indigenous industries are fearful.  The small companies that are exporting are fearful about finding new markets and finding a way around this Brexit problem and the Government needs to do more about that.</p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in also has proposed the establishment of co-operative development units aimed at raising awareness of the benefits of co-operatives and increasing the number of such enterprises across the island.  What does the Government intend to do in that area?  That model has worked well in other European countries, where small private companies work together to build up co-operatives where they can develop, produce more jobs, produce more industry and move forward.  We need to be doing that.  Those models need to be employed in places such as County Leitrim and in the regions in general.</p>  <p>  One of the big problems we have in the regions is the absence of infrastructure.  Our roads are poor, access to the area is poor and broadband is a considerable problem.  Ireland needs to be more than just a haven for some corporations to hide money.  It needs to be a genuine tech haven where we can provide technical jobs.  If we have adequate infrastructure and adequate broadband, we can be the centre of the universe no matter where we are.  That is what we need to bring to every part of rural Ireland.  I would welcome a Government commitment to do that and to work on the area of co-operation between companies.</p></speech>

The Deputy needs to focus on the local enterprise offices, LEOs, which play an important role throughout the country in assisting companies to start up and entrepreneurs.  In County Leitrim last year, they created 39 new jobs.  I visited the LEO office in Carrick-on-Shannon at Leitrim County Council and I have seen for myself at first hand what it offers and the assistance it gives to help micro-enterprises, such as manufacturing companies and people with ideas up there.  The Deputy himself can see the success of that in the brewing companies, the distillery companies and the food sector companies that have started off in that area.  Small micro-enterprises are extremely important for regional areas where one will not get FDI.  We can bring FDI companies into Ireland to have a look at counties such as Leitrim but in the end, where they want to set up is a decision for the company itself.</p>  <p>  I take on board what Deputy Martin Kenny is saying but I ask him to acknowledge the work that is being done in Leitrim by the local enterprise offices, EI and IDA Ireland.  The local enterprise offices have 101 clients participating in the mentoring programme.</p></speech>

The Minister will have seen the most recent report where we are now burning at an alarming rate through our competitiveness advantages<i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>our international competitors.  This is a worrying development that has just been announced in the context of Ireland dropping in the competitiveness stakes.  The issue of skills shortages is something that has to be confronted because there are skills shortages now in major areas of the economy, such as agriculture, transport and hospitality, and climbing up the chain of the economy, we have skills shortages across almost every sector.</p></reply>

For this reason, equipping the workforce with the skills required for the jobs of today and for those of tomorrow is a strategic priority for the Government.</p>  <p>  While skills policy is primarily a matter for the Department of Education and Skills, my Department supports the work of the expert group for future skills needs, EGFSN.  The EGFSN is an independent body, comprised of business representatives, education providers, trade unions and Government bodies.  The body plays a key role in identifying future skills needs of enterprises and advising Government on how those needs can be met so as to enhance competitiveness.</p>  <p>  Over the last 20 years, the EGFSN has forecasted skills availability across a wide range of sectors.  In recent years, these studies have included sectors such as the marine economy; freight, transport, logistics and distribution, biopharma and hospitality.  These reports include a horizon scanning exercise and generate forecasts for skills demand over a five-year period so as to ensure accuracy in forecasting demands.</p>  <p>  A relevant example of this is the work undertaken on ICT skills demand forecast this year.  In 2013, the EGFSN published the study, Addressing Future Demand for High-Level ICT Skills.  This study included a demand forecast for ICT skills over the period 2013-2018.  The findings and recommendations of this report were essential inputs into the development of the ICT Skills Action Plan 2014-2018.  This year, the EGFSN has engaged in a refresh of the demand forecast exercise undertaken in 2013 for the period 2017-22.  This analysis will inform the upcoming ICT skills action plan.</p>  <p>  Other EGFSN work under way in 2018 includes skills forecasts across sectors such as food and drink, design, freight transport, distribution and logistics and skills for the digital economy.</p>  <p>  My Department provides works permits for those key skills which are in short supply through the employment permits system.  This system is designed to facilitate the entry of appropriately skilled non-EEA migrants to fill skills shortages.  The objective is balanced by the need to ensure there are no suitably qualified Irish or EEA nationals available to undertake the work and the shortage is genuine.  The employment permits system is managed by the operation of the highly skilled eligible occupations list and the ineligible categories list.  The rationale underpinning the inclusion or omission from the occupation lists is informed by the EGFSN and the skills and labour market research unit in SOLAS and is augmented by a consultation process.</p>  <p>  I will deal with the competition issue.</p></speech>

We have rapid growth, our GDP has increased and our debt ratios have dropped dramatically but underneath all the positive news, are the alarm bells beginning to ring due to the drop in competitiveness?</p>  <p>  If we do not arrest that particular issue, we will have the same difficulties and challenges facing the country in a few years as we had previously.  The reason I say that is it takes time to train people.  It takes time to upskill people.  It takes time to attract people back into the economy.</p>  <p>  We no longer have the pool of labour available to us from the eastern European states that we had on the previous occasion we had a major expansion in the economy because their economies have converged more with the rest of Europe in terms of growth and we will have skills shortages.  It is evident already.  In the areas of agriculture, hospitality and transport, we already have massive shortages and the construction sector is now beginning to bite severely.  Beyond that, in the trades and the higher skills, we also will have considerable difficulties.</p>  <p>  The idea that the expert group for future skills needs would look at a five-year horizon is baffling when it takes at least four to five years for an engineer to qualify and three-to-four years for a tradesperson to be fully qualified.  We must look beyond that short timeframe.</p></speech>

That is the reason we have so many FDI companies operating in various sectors in this country.  Deputy Kelleher is correct in that it is important that we update the skills.</p>  <p>  The drop in competitiveness that was evident from last night's report is disappointing.  We have gone from sixth place to 12th in the world economy but we are still in the top 15, which is important.  We are ahead of China.  The top five seem to remain in place all the time.  The USA had dropped but it is back up again.  Hong Kong had taken over.  The first three are now the USA, Hong Kong and Singapore.  We still remain in the top three within the European Union and it is important to acknowledge that.</p>  <p>  That is just one issue.  We should bear in mind the successes we have had in our ranking in other areas.  The UK is currently 20th while we are 12th.  We are ranked first in the world by the IMD World Competitiveness Center for productivity in industry and the flexibility and adaptability of our workforce.  We also perform very well in attracting and retaining talent.  That is extremely important for us.  The focus is very much on upskilling and reskilling people where jobs are changing.

We face an obvious threat in the context of Brexit and the impact that may have on the broader economy.  There are skills shortages across all sectors of the economy and I do not detect any discernible positive efforts being made to address these, either in the current context or into the future.  Even the expert group only looks at a horizon of five years.  We must look beyond that to assess what we need in the years ahead and act now as opposed to waiting for the inevitable to happen when we lose further competitiveness due to skills shortages across all major sectors of the economy.</p></speech>

However, we have to take account of the collaboration that is taking place to address the situation.  First, there is interdepartmental collaboration and then there is collaboration between multinational companies in the private sector with third-level institutions and the Department.  That is key.  There is a significant focus on apprenticeships and there are opportunities for students to pursue apprenticeships in collaboration with the big multinational companies.  That is where the third-level institutions come into play.</p>  <p>  Our unemployment rate has gone from a high of 15.1% down to 5.9%.  We are very conscious that we are almost at full employment.  We are also very conscious of the future needs of the growing population.  That is why we put Project Ireland 2040, the national planning framework, in place.  We have the resources to ensure we are ready for the change that is coming and to ensure that we have a skilled workforce because we have a very young workforce and a well educated population.</p></speech>

In November 2015, the pharmaceutical company, Roche, announced its intention to close its pharmaceutical plant in Clarecastle, in the constituency of Clare, which we share, with the loss of 240 high-quality jobs.  The Minister of State is from County Clare.  Are IDA Ireland and the Department still searching for a replacement industry for the plant in Clarecastle and what success have they had to date?</p></reply>

The situation is very much on my mind.  We both share the same concerns about employment in County Clare but I think there is good news for the county.  First, I will deal with his question.</p>  <p>  In November 2015, Roche Holding AG announced the decision to close its facility in Clarecastle following a review of its worldwide manufacturing network.  This review also resulted in closures at plants in other international locations.  Since that announcement was made, IDA Ireland has been working hard to identify a new buyer for the facility.  The site is still being actively promoted by the agency's staff to existing clients and potential investors and that will continue to be the case.  The company's senior management also met with IDA Ireland recently and are assisting the agency's efforts in that regard.  We remain hopeful that an investor will be identified in due course and that further employment opportunities will, in turn, be created for the people of Clarecastle and the wider Clare area.</p>  <p>  While I remain very disappointed by the closure of this facility, I welcome the continuing overseas investment in County Clare, where there are 68 IDA Ireland client companies employing a total of 6,775 people.  The level of FD, employment in the county has increased by almost 12% since 2013 and the Government is determined to grow those numbers further.  IDA Ireland, in promoting Clare as an investment destination, markets the county as part of the mid-west region along with Limerick and north Tipperary.  The overall trend for employment in multinationals across that region is positive, with the agency&rsquo;s client companies creating 1,481 new jobs there last year.  That represented an increase of 5% over the previous year.  Total employment in overseas companies now stands at 17,787 people across 128 client companies.</p>  <p>  Recent investment announcements by overseas companies reflect the potential of Clare and the surrounding area to attract high-quality FDI.  The decision by Jaguar Land Rover to establish a new software engineering facility in Shannon, for example, shows that the region can attract desirable high-tech investment and the employment opportunities associated with such projects.  Beckman Coulter's announcement last December that it is to expand the current facility with the addition of 70 new roles is further evidence of the area's strengths and attractiveness to investors.</p>  <p>  IDA Ireland remains focused on engaging with its client base so to harness that potential and create further employment and investment growth in the region.  We need to remember, however, that FDI forms only one part of our efforts to generate economic growth in regional locations, whether in the mid-west or elsewhere.  Indigenous enterprise also has a critical role to play.  That is reflected in the regional action plan for jobs initiative, which is a central pillar of the Government's ambition to create 135,000 new jobs outside of Dublin by 2020.</p></speech>

Three years after the company announced the plant's closure with the loss of 240 jobs - and also the loss of the subcontractor jobs that went into supplying services to the plan - the Minister of State is telling me there is still no buyer.  A replacement is critical for the people of Clarecastle.  The closure of Roche sent shockwaves through the community.  The Minister of State and previous Ministers in the Department committed to finding a buyer for the plant, which was the subject of major investment over the years.  Millions of euro went into developing the plant but the Minister of State is telling me that, over a three-year period, a buyer could not be found for it.  If we are still looking for a buyer after three years, the likelihood of finding one is diminishing by the day.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State informed me of the other jobs that were created in Clare.  In this case, however, a fundamental piece of industrial infrastructure in Clarecastle, at which production will cease in 2019, is going to be left lying vacant.  We need to get a replacement industry into the plant.</p></speech>

As he is aware, the plant at Clarecastle is not suitable for the next generation of pharma production methods because pharma companies are moving to smaller-volume products.  IDA Ireland is working hard.  It is talking to companies but it is difficult to get a buyer for an old facility as it would cost a lot of money to change it.  One would almost have to knock down the existing facility and start with a brownfield site.</p>  <p>  There is a good news story in County Clare in terms of job numbers.  A few years ago, almost 12,000 people were unemployed in the county.  Today, the figure is closer to 5,000.  Jobs are being created in other sectors.  The future of work is changing as well in terms of the type of jobs we are attracting into the county.  I referred to some positive announcements in that regard.  The arrival of the Jaguar Land Rover software facility is a game-changer for the county and there will be other job announcements in the future as well.</p></speech>

It is a piece of infrastructure that cannot be allowed to fall away and rust.</p><p>The Minister's predecessors, Deputies Fitzgerald, Mitchell O'Connor and Bruton also committed to finding a replacement industry for this plant.  They have visited the parent plant in Switzerland and engaged with the company but the Minister of State is saying that, three years later, he has failed to find a buyer for the plant or somebody who will run it.  He is the Minister of State in the Department and he is from the county.  I expected that he would have been able after three years to deliver a replacement company to take over the plant.  It is fitted out for second generation pharmaceutical production but, nevertheless, companies are engaged in this throughout the world.  Surely he can find a replacement.</p></speech>

Only last Tuesday morning, I made a good announcement together with the chief executive officer of the Californian company, Microsemi, for the town of Ennis, which is close to Clarecastle.  We announced that a &euro;3.2 million contract had been awarded to the company by the European Space Agency for a general support technical programme to develop cost-effective, integrated motor drive solutions for thrust vector controls in aerospace applications.  That will expand Microsemi's operations in the county where the company currently employs 270 people.  We have made other announcements relating to the county as well.  Microsemi is a fantastic company that exports &euro;120 million worth of products annually and it is expected to increase that by another &euro;20 million annually by 2020.  It has a state-of-the-art aviation centre of excellence.  I advise the Deputy to visit it and to see what else Ennis has to offer.  Let us be positive, not negative, about job creation.  The future of work and job types are changing.  The digital economy is changing everything we do.  The centre of excellence employs ten people but that number is expected to increase to 45 in the coming months.  Up the road, Vitalograph announced 100 new jobs last year.</p></speech>

This matter is of serious concern and annoyance to the public.  What, if anything, is the Government doing about the problem?</p></reply>
    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-05-24a.76.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1272" speakername="Pat Breen" time="11:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018052400007#E01000"><p>I thank the Deputy for her question.  The Minister is currently seeking to finalise legislative proposals on ticket resale.  The main element of current proposals for legislation on ticket resale is for a ban on resale above the face value of the ticket or on resale at a price in excess of 10% above face value.  While the Minister shares the Deputy's concern to ensure that ticket markets work better for consumers, a number of considerations have to be taken into account in deciding on these and other proposals for legislation on ticket resale.</p><p>First, the evidence available to the Department suggests that, while a statutory price cap would act to counter ticket profiteering, it is unlikely to improve significantly the ability of fans to obtain tickets for particularly high demand events.  The Department obtained detailed information from Ticketmaster and the main secondary platforms operating in Ireland about two events that gave rise to particular criticism about secondary ticket sales - the Coldplay and U2 concerts in Croke Park in July 2017.  Combined demand for tickets for the two events exceeded supply by a factor of more than three to one.  Even if all of the tickets resold above face value on the main secondary platforms had been available to buyers on the primary ticket market, they would have met less than 5% of the estimated unsatisfied demand for tickets.  In so far as the aim of legislative proposals is to ensure greater access for music and sports fans to tickets for high-demand events, there are grounds, therefore, for questioning whether it would achieve this aim. </p><p>Second, ticket reselling above face value is permitted in most EU member states.  Departmental officials discussed the experience with ticket resale legislation with consumer protection authorities in a number of countries that restrict the resale of tickets.  All indicated that while the legislation had been reasonably effective in preventing prohibited resale activity within their national borders, there continued to be significant levels of resale activity for high-demand events on secondary ticket platforms in other countries.  If ticket resale in Ireland is subject to a statutory price cap, the borderless character of online trading makes it likely that people in this country who wish to resell tickets at a higher price than that permitted by the legislation, or who are prepared to buy tickets at such a higher price, will go to secondary ticket marketplaces in countries where ticket resale is legal and not subject to a price cap.</p><p><i><font color="#2F2F2F">  Additional information not given on the floor of the House</font></i></p><p>Third, legislative proposals should obviously seek as far as possible to avoid unintended and undesirable consequences.  The established secondary ticket marketplaces offer buyers a guarantee that they will be refunded the price of tickets which are not delivered or prove to be fake.  While there are understandable reasons for disliking the activities of these marketplaces and there are questions in some cases about the implementation of the guarantees which they offer, they nevertheless afford consumers a level of protection that does not apply to secondary tickets sourced from general online marketplaces, pop-up websites, social networks or street sellers.  If, as is possible, the enactment of price cap legislation would lead to the departure of the established secondary marketplaces from the Irish market, the resale channels that would, to some extent or other, fill the gap left by their departure are very unlikely to offer the same guarantees to ticket buyers.</p><p>Fourth, it is necessary to consider whether the aims of the proposed legislation could be achieved by other means.  There are measures open to event organisers such as personalised and-or paperless ticketing that have been shown to be reasonably effective in preventing ticket resale.  A legal requirement on ticket resellers to indicate the row and seat number and, where applicable, the standing area number of tickets could, in addition to benefitting consumers, facilitate event organisers in cancelling tickets resold in breach of the terms of the primary ticket contract. As the issues raised by legislative proposals on ticket resale are complex and require full and careful consideration, the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, is not in a position at this point to give a definite time frame for the introduction of legislation.  Her aim, however, is to bring proposals to Government on the issue at the earliest possible date.</p></reply>

This is a matter for public concern for several years and it is getting worse, particularly in respect of concerts.  Last February, I asked the Minister a question about this and the reply that was following the public consultation, there were discussions going on with all the interested parties and at European level, and officials would bring all that information to her.  She said that she would prepare proposals "in the near future".  It seems from the Minister of State's reply that little progress has been made.  He described the problem but he did not say what the Minister or the Department will do.  Is it the intention to legislate?  If so, when can we expect legislation?</p></speech>

The Bill tabled by Deputies Rock and Donnelly provides for a ban on the resale of tickets above face value while Deputy Quinlivan's Bill provides for a ban on the resale of tickets in excess of 10% of the ticket price.  The Minister commends the initiatives taken by the Deputies and she is fully sympathetic to them.  I can understand how anxious Deputy Shortall is in this regard but this is a complex issue.  If legislation is introduced, it must be effective and enforceable.  The solution is not simple and straightforward.  A minority of EU member states have introduced legislation in this regard.  However, independent reviews have recommended against legislation in other countries, including the statutory cap on resale.  If legislation is introduced, it must benefit consumers and it must not give rise to unintended consequences.  The Minister is examining the issue.</p></speech>

What legislative plans does the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, have to address this undoubted and widespread problem?  There have been promises to tackle it.  Last February, she said she would bring forward proposals "in the near future".  Reference to Private Members' Bills is beside the point.  Neither of those Bills is being progressed in a serious way.  There has not been a money message, for example, in respect of the Bill that was debated recently.  There is a problem and the public are being ripped off by ticket prices and ticket touting for concerts and sporting events.  Will the Minister take legislative action in this regard?

While the marts are very well managed and run, they are very dangerous places with many very stressed cattle and many people who are anxious to look at those cattle and who often put themselves in a dangerous position in order to do so.  Marts can also be a very dangerous environment for workers.  In that context, I ask that the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, conduct a survey of our livestock marts and determine what needs to be done to make them safer so that people can enjoy their time there, which is what many patrons are doing, rather than buying or selling animals.  This is an issue that deserves some attention.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-05-24a.94" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1272" speakername="Pat Breen" time="11:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018052400008#F01000"><p>I thank Deputy Kenny for his question.  As someone with an agricultural background, I am very conscious of health and safety and the issues which may arise at marts.  The Health and Safety Authority, HSA, is responsible for the enforcement of the relevant statutory provisions set out in the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 and associated regulations related to workplace health and safety, including the promotion of health and safety in the workplace.  The authority works to a detailed annual programme of work and carries out inspections across all sectors of employment, based on the level of risk associated with different sectors, in addition to carrying out inspections on foot of specific complaints received.  The inspection of livestock marts is part of the authority's 2018 work programme.</p>  <p>  The Health and Safety Authority is an independent statutory body and the inspection of workplaces is a day-to-day operational matter for the authority in which I have no role.  The agriculture sector has a higher than average fatal and non-fatal injury rate and the authority devotes a relatively high level of its resources to agricultural safety initiatives, including inspections. Livestock safety is a major issue in agriculture, being consistently the third most common cause of farm fatalities and the most prevalent cause of non-fatal injury.  Livestock marts pose a unique set of health and safety risks as there are large numbers of animals present in unfamiliar surroundings.  In the first instance, therefore, the owners and managers of marts must ensure that a full risk assessment has been carried out and that there is a safe system of work in place.  A safe system of work is a legal requirement and mart owners have a legal responsibility to ensure that mart facilities do not create hazards or risks.  Any such potential hazards or risks should be recorded in a safety statement which sets out how such hazards and risks are to be eliminated or reduced.</p>  <p>  In terms of best practice the HSA recommends a total segregation of mart workers, farmers and other members of the public from livestock penning arrangements.  In addition, the authority has produced a detailed document entitled "Guidance on the Safe Handling of Livestock at Marks and Lairages", which has been distributed to all operating marts around the country.  I ask all mart owners and managers to take account of their legal responsibilities and to take the practical advice and guidance offered by the HSA.</p></speech>

I also raise this issue in the context of insurance problems, an issue which is very live at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform at the moment.  There have been huge increases in insurance premiums for marts which is not unrelated to health and safety issues.  We need to find a solution in a collaborative way.  The HSA should work with the mart owners and managers to find a solution.  In many cases, problems arise when the animals are penned and waiting to enter the ring.  For many elderly people, a visit to the mart is a social occasion during which they meet their friends and neighbours.  Many young people also frequent the marts.  Most Members of this House would not be at a mart unless an election was imminent.  In those circumstances, we might think of the safety of Members of this House who might get themselves into a difficult position with animals waiting to go into the ring.  We must understand that the mart is a place where people come together and communicate but it can be a very dangerous place.  We must find a solution that works for everyone and the HSA should be central to that.  I am not suggesting that the authority should be heavy handed or cause stress for those running the marts.  I am talking about finding common-sense solutions, one of which is ensuring that when animals are in the pen waiting to go into the ring that nobody other than the employees of the mart are allowed into that area.  Simple things like that can solve the problem.</p></speech>

Many of the more modern marts have overhead bridges so that people can inspect animals from above.  Under no circumstances should members of the public be in the passages between the pens or the pens themselves because cattle at marts are in unfamiliar surroundings and their behaviour can be unpredictable.</p>  <p>  I point out again that mart owners and managers have statutory obligations under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005.  They have a responsibility to ensure the safety of their employees and of the general public.  Most marts and co-operatives are very conscious of safety around animals.  The public should be in the auction rooms rather than outside where the animals are penned.  The pens should be reserved for employees only.  Marts are dangerous places, particularly in the morning when cattle are being off loaded from trailers into the pens.</p></speech>

The Minister of State made reference to guidelines issued by the HSA but the authority needs to sit down with all of the mart owners to work out a solution.  That solution must then be clearly communicated to farmers, employees and patrons of the marts.  Safety must be to the fore.  I want to send my best wishes to the man who was hurt recently in the mart in Mohill.  He is one of many people who have been injured at marts.  We all know people who have suffered broken legs, crushed feet and other injuries at marts all over the country.  We need to move away from that situation.  Some of the solutions to improve safety may require investment in the marts and perhaps the State can be of assistance in that regard.</p></speech>

Deputy Kenny is correct to point out that we often do not hear of the injuries incurred by farmers at marts.  It is only when people are killed or suffer life-changing injuries that we hear about it.  As I said already, mixing with animals is the third most common cause of accidents in the country.  I will pass on the Deputy's concerns to the HSA but it is important that people do not forget their own obligations.  I would ask all mart owners and managers to take account of their legal responsibilities and to take on board the practical advice and guidance of the authority.</p>  <p>  Some marts have screens in their restaurants on which they show safety videos encouraging patrons to be conscious of safety in the context of handling or passing cattle.  The animals are in unfamiliar surroundings, are easily frightened and often cannot see properly when they are going through from the pens to the ring.  </p>  <p>  I thank the Deputy for raising this matter which I will bring to the attention of the HSA.  The authority carries out inspections and has other ways of encouraging all involved to be more conscious of health and safety.</p></speech>

The first quarter statistics for 2018 on the number of IDA Ireland site visits across the country are quite alarming in that there are significant disparities between Dublin and the regions.  I ask the Minister of State to elaborate on that and explain why some counties are being consistently ignored in the context of IDA Ireland site visits.</p></reply>

The Minister, Deputy Humphreys, and I will focus on doing everything we can in the fairest possible way to spread the investment across the country.  The Government is working to ensure a more even distribution of foreign direct investment across the country.  Last year, IDA Ireland delivered 99 regional investments, with 45% of new jobs created outside Dublin.  The last three years have seen 30,000 new foreign direct investment jobs created outside Dublin.  The availability of marketable serviced land and buildings in advance of demand is an important element of IDA Ireland's ability to compete for mobile foreign direct investment.  Such a supply of properties helps the agency to secure job-rich investment and allows projects to begin at an earlier date by diminishing many of the difficulties associated with land acquisition, planning and construction.  It is important because it enables IDA Ireland to encourage and attract new investors to Ireland, particularly to the regions.</p><p>I am informed that IDA Ireland owns 30 properties across the country, 13 of which are occupied by its clients with the other 17 being available for prospective or existing investors.  IDA Ireland's regional property programme remains an important tool for encouraging investors to locate in areas outside Dublin.  This programme is targeted at ensuring an adequate supply of marketable serviced land, offices and industrial and manufacturing buildings is readily available in advance of demand from existing and potential client companies.  The programme includes the construction of nine new advance facilities around the country.  Buildings have been completed in Castlebar, Tralee and Sligo as part of this programme.  IDA Ireland is continuing to roll out its building programme across the country, with new buildings planned in Carlow, Dundalk, Limerick, Galway, Athlone and Waterford over the next two years.  I am confident that the regional property programme, which has already helped to generate employment in the regions, will help to secure further investment in the years ahead.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>Site visits represent a valuable tool through which investors can be encouraged to invest in regional areas.  IDA Ireland always does its utmost to ensure overseas firms consider all potential locations when visiting Ireland.  This is in line with the priority that has been placed on investment outside our main cities.  The agency is continuing to target an increase of 30% to 40% in foreign direct investment in every region of the country by the end of its current strategy in 2019.  While site visits can help to highlight the benefits of the regions to IDA Ireland's client companies, we need to remember that the final decision on where to invest always rests with the firm concerned.  Some companies are only intent on investing in urban areas for a variety of commercial reasons.  It should not be forgotten that site visit activity does not necessarily reflect investment potential.  At least 70% of all new foreign direct investment comes from existing IDA Ireland client companies.  There were 66 site visits across Ireland, excluding Dublin, in the first three months of 2018.  IDA Ireland will continue to bring new and existing clients to potential investment locations all over the country.</p></speech>

We accept there have been increases in employment across the country and a major increase in inward investment through companies supported by IDA Ireland.  Given that 51% of site visits between 2012 and 2017 were in Dublin, which sends a worrying signal to the regions, and in light of the investment platforms for the coming years that have been outlined in the national planning framework, I suggest that the Government's approach to policy development is centred on Dublin.  I am genuinely concerned that this will undermine the capacity of the regions to develop their own micro-economies.  When this alarming situation is coupled with other Government policies - such as the lack of broadband roll-out, which is having an impact on small and medium-sized enterprises - it is clear that IDA Ireland's policy of having over 50% of site visits in Dublin, with the other visits being spread across the rest of the country, is not good enough.</p></speech>

While site visits are important, it is also important to nurture the existing companies in this country.  I advise the Deputy to look at the number of jobs that have been created by IDA Ireland.  I commend the work the agency has done in this area.  At least 70% of all new jobs come from existing foreign direct investment companies in this country that want to expand their global reach and change their systems of production.  That is extremely important.  I see this for myself as I travel around the country.  Many new job announcements involve existing companies.  It is important that IDA Ireland sites are available around the country to offer a choice to foreign direct investment companies that are looking to locate here.  It is ultimately a matter for each company to decide where it wants to locate.  The availability of sites is important.  It is important for us to have advance companies as well.  That is the reason for IDA Ireland's building programme.  Thirteen of IDA Ireland's 30 properties around the country are occupied and the other 17 are available.</p></speech>

The reality is that 55% of the net job creation was in Dublin and 45% of it was in the rest of the country, which rather proves my point.  The Government's site visits policy is also relevant in this context.  It is simply not good enough that ten counties, including Cavan, Donegal, Kerry, Kilkenny, Longford, Monaghan and Wexford, were not visited in the first quarter of 2018.  Having served in this Department previously, I am aware that IDA Ireland cannot direct a company to locate in a specific location.  Companies tend to look at Ireland strategically when they are deciding where to locate.  The Government can encourage and cajole companies to consider certain areas by showing a strong commitment to regional policy.  IDA Ireland can also be cajoled to encourage companies to locate in the regions.  This was done previously and it can be done again.  More importantly, it must be done again if we are to ensure the regions do not continue to fall further behind Dublin.</p></speech>

I suggest a 12-month period should be studied to get a better picture in respect of site visits.  There were ten site visits to the Deputy's home county of Cork in the first three or four months of this year.  Site visits take place all year round.  It is not the case that there is a certain number of visits each month.  There can be extra site visits during the summer and more later on in the year.  It is extremely important for IDA Ireland to have greenfield sites as a viable tool for attracting new industry into the regions.  The reality, fair and straight, is that the regions are faring well.  As the Deputy knows, foreign direct investment, which has been mentioned, tends to go into clusters.  It is important that we have indigenous industry to back that up as well.  Enterprise Ireland's results for last year show that 65% of the net 10,000 jobs it created were located outside the greater Dublin area.  I remind the House that the local enterprise offices created almost net 3,700 jobs throughout the country last year.  Our intention is to ensure every region, county and community feels the effect of the recovery when jobs are being created.</p></speech>

IDA Ireland always does its utmost to ensure overseas firms consider all potential locations when visiting Ireland.  It is important to remember that the final decision on where to invest always rests with the company concerned.  I remind the Deputy that site visit activity does not necessarily reflect investment potential.  As I told Deputy Kelleher earlier, at least 70% of all new foreign direct investment comes from existing IDA Ireland client companies.  The employment situation in the south-west region, which covers counties Cork and Kerry, has been steadily improving in recent years.  The south-west regional action plan for jobs, which was launched in July 2015, has been a key factor in this improvement.  The plan placed a heavy focus on employment growth in key sectors such as life sciences, manufacturing and information and communications technology.  Last year, IDA Ireland client companies created 2,388 gross new jobs in the south west, bringing total employment in overseas companies in the region to 35,248 people across 158 client companies.</p>  <p>  IDA Ireland will continue to work with its clients to identify opportunities for new investment or expansion in County Cork.  In doing so, it will draw the attention of investors to the county's particular strengths.  These include but are not limited to its accessibility, including its ports and its airport, its existing cluster of medical technology and pharmaceutical firms and its strong track record as a home to overseas companies for many years.  IDA Ireland is seeking to attract new firms to Cork while working closely with its existing clients there to help to strengthen and potentially grow their respective workforces.  Regarding the specific locations mentioned by Deputy Moynihan, as data on IDA Ireland site visits are collated on a county-by-county basis, information on the number of site visits to specific locations in individual counties is not available.  IDA Ireland does not release details of the specific itineraries of potential investors on grounds of client confidentiality and commercial sensitivity.</p><p>I can inform the Deputy, however, that a total of 51 site visits took place in Cork in 2017 and a further ten site visits have been undertaken in the first three months of 2018.</p></speech>

The Minster of State is hiding behind IDA Ireland.  I have no wish to interfere with commercial sensitivity.  Are the Department and IDA Ireland looking at land banks held in Kanturk, Charleville and Millstreet with a view to promoting those sites for industrial development?  There is a highly-educated young workforce throughout Duhallow and the north Cork region.  They are as capable, and probably more capable, than any of the communities throughout the country.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State has used the opt-out clause of saying IDA Ireland does not release individuals site locations because of commercial sensitivity.  That is balderdash, to be honest.  If IDA Ireland had information that it could have furnished to the Department in the past three or four days indicating that there had been a visit, then that information would have been on the record of the D&aacute;il today.  I am challenging the Minister of State to go back to IDA Ireland and ask specifically when IDA Ireland last did that.  Was it back when we were trying to sell these sites in Kanturk or when the advanced factory was set up in Charleville and so on?  When last was there any serious discussion between IDA Ireland and the Department on these sites and how best to attract industry to these fantastic locations?</p></speech>

It is important to have the sites available.  These are feasible tools to attract companies.  In the end, however, it is up to the investors to decide where to put investment in the country.</p>  <p>  IDA Ireland is operating in a very competitive environment at the moment.  That is why IDA Ireland must compete by region rather than by town, village or small city.  IDA Ireland is up against other major cities, for example, Birmingham and Manchester, in the UK where millions of people live in one location.  IDA Ireland competes by region.  The agency must ensure the multinational companies are connected to the right location for the company.  That is important also.</p>  <p>  IDA Ireland does not have the final decision in these matters.  The companies that potentially wish to set up here have property people who look at the places where they want to invest.  We can bring the investors to the locations but in the end it is up to them to decide.  Many factors influence where they decide to locate.</p></speech>

That spawned more industry around it.  IDA Ireland had encouraged us some years ago and indicated that it was in negotiation with Cork County Council to hand over the sites to enable industrial units to be developed, yet, to date, nothing has happened.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State was throwing out the question of Birmingham and other cities.  I challenge the Minister of State in this regard because Duhallow and the north Cork region have as much to offer as any of those places.  The area has a fantastic young educated workforce.  Unfortunately, we are exporting that workforce to Dublin and other cities.  The Minister of State will know the line about the east coast tipping over into the Irish sea.  We have to be serious about balanced regional development.  I call on the Minister of State to look seriously at these locations.  They may be in IDA Ireland ownership, but are they on the IDA Ireland radar?  When last was there a discussion on these properties?  When last was there a discussion on how best to utilise these properties for the benefit of the State, IDA Ireland, the companies coming in and the region that supports them?</p></speech>

Let us consider the positives as well.  Charleville is a fantastic dairy hub, especially with the work the Kerry Group is doing there.  They make cheese strings there.  There is an engineering hub nearby also.  Millstreet has Alps Electric and Ballydesmond has Munster Joinery.  Some really good companies are based there.  Deputy Moynihan is right that north Cork has a great deal to offer but many good companies are there as well.</p>  <p>  Like any other county that has a big city nearby, there is a magnet to attract companies into the big city of Cork.  People want to work there and the talent is there because of the volume of big multinational companies.  Apple has almost 6,000 people.  People are going to travel a short distance and there is nothing we can do about that.  People can choose the places where they can get good jobs.  I understand the attraction of the towns mentioned by Deputy Moynihan.  They are and will continue to be on the IDA Ireland radar.  However, Deputy Moynihan should also acknowledge the good jobs that are in those towns at present.  We need to ensure that we sustain those jobs and employment in the future.</p></speech>

I thank Deputy Kelleher and I acknowledge that I am answering the question for Deputy Scanlon.</p><p>In 2017, IDA Ireland completed an advanced technology building in Sligo as part of its regional property programme.  Abbot subsequently took ownership of that facility, thereby deepening its existing investment in the county further.</p><p>The Deputies asked about the IDA Ireland-owned lands at Oakfield, Sligo.  I know the area because I have visited it.  IDA Ireland is in partnership with Sligo County Council on the delivery of the western distributor road to provide access to this property.  I understand that works on the road have begun.  Once completed, IDA Ireland will actively market the Oakfield site to its client base with a view to attracting new investment to the area.</p><p>While IDA Ireland has no plans to construct buildings in County Leitrim, I am pleased that Leitrim's existing client base has shown a remarkably strong level of commitment to the county.  In fact, the level of employment by overseas companies in Leitrim has increased by 46% between 2013 and 2017.  I answered a question on this point earlier for Deputy Kenny.  There are now 889 people employed in IDA Ireland client companies in Leitrim, compared to 606 in 2013.</p><p>Leitrim, along with Sligo and Donegal, is marketed by IDA Ireland as part of the north-west region.  Employment in the north-west region has been steadily growing in recent years.  Last year, for example, IDA Ireland client companies in the north west created 330 new jobs, bringing total employment in overseas companies to 6,462 people across 40 client companies.  There is a strong base of investment within Sligo and Leitrim with 28 IDA Ireland client companies employing a total of 3,073 people across the two counties.  IDA Ireland is determined to grow these numbers further and it is engaging with its client base to sustain employment creation and investment.</p><p>Indigenous enterprise is also contributing to employment in Sligo and Leitrim.  With regard to Sligo, a total of 1,733 people were employed in 69 Enterprise Ireland-supported enterprises in the county last year, representing an increase of 12% since 2016.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>The local enterprise office in Sligo, meanwhile, helped to create 51 new jobs last year, bringing total employment in LEO-supported companies to 969.  As for Leitrim, 559 people were employed across 25 Enterprise Ireland-supported companies in the county in 2017.  The Leitrim LEO also helped to create 39 new jobs, with 454 people now employed in firms it supports.</p><p>We recognise though that there is room for improvement in the north west and we are working hard across Government to further unlock the economic potential of the area.  The enterprise agencies remain pivotal to this and they continue to engage with their clients and one another to create jobs and source new investment for the region.</p></speech>

I welcome the partnership of IDA Ireland and the local authority to open up infrastructural development.</p>  <p>  The key issue is to ensure that we have a proactive campaign of site visits to promote the north west.  The Minister of State referred to clustering.  Certainly in Sligo and the surrounding part of the region clustering is evolving.  However, it has to be continually supported and sustained.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State referred to the development of the Oakfield site.  I hope he takes into account the views of Deputy Scanlon and others, who have been consistently calling for greater emphasis on site visits to the region, specifically in Sligo and Leitrim, to ensure critical capacity is created in the area.  This would enable the area to sustain itself between inward investment and the local economy, which can capture the spin-offs benefits from the multinational companies.</p></speech>

It is very much a part of our balanced regional development to ensure the north-west region grows.</p><p>In 2017 some 559 people were employed across 25 Enterprise Ireland supported companies in County Leitrim.  Sligo is a strong base for foreign direct investment, where 2,184 people are employed by 23 multinational companies.  It is important to point that out.  Local enterprise offices, LEOs, provided 51 new jobs last year, bringing the total provided by the LEOs to 969.  </p> <p> The development in Oakfield, Sligo is important and this is a turning point in respect of this greenfield site, as having access is very important.  Sligo County Council has started works on the road and such connectivity is important.  I saw it for myself when I was there last year.  A number of job announcement for Sligo have been made in recent times, and I believe more will be made in the future.  The Oakfield site is an good base for attracting companies, which is very much the target of the IDA.  </p></speech>

The fact that the Oakfield site is now coming on stream because of the collaboration between the local authority and the IDA is a positive development.  I hope the Minister of State can give a commitment that he will convey those views.  We must have continual site visits and promotion of the north west as a place to do business, specifically on the Oakfield site.</p></speech>

Balanced regional development is extremely important for the Government.  We want to ensure that the regions attract industry, which is why the Government has highly ambitious regional job creation targets.  This is why we have provided resources to the IDA, Enterprise Ireland and the local enterprise offices to ensure they can grow jobs in the region.  Sligo is very much on the radar; there are some really good companies there.  We spoke about Abbott earlier, and there are other companies there as well, including indigenous and foreign direct investment, FDI, companies, which are all contributing to the infrastructure in Sligo town, working collaboratively with Sligo County Council and other agencies.  I am satisfied that Sligo will continue to be a part of the IDA's portfolio for creating jobs and that it will benefit both from that and from tourism, which is extremely important to the region as well.</p></speech>

My Department and its agencies have this ambition at the heart of our enterprise strategy and Action Plan for Jobs and good progress is being made towards that target.  According to the CSO, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in April 2018 fell to 5.9%, a marked decline from 6.8% a year earlier in April 2017.  Significantly, the seasonally adjusted live register figures were down to 229,600 according to the CSO, the lowest number since July 2008.  The agencies of my Department have played a central role in supporting enterprise to sustain and create new jobs and indeed the employment levels in Enterprise Ireland, EI, and IDA Ireland supported firms reached record levels in 2017. </p><p>As market conditions and general economic outlook have continued to improve in recent years, there has been a natural tightening in the labour market, which has impacted on all enterprises, indigenous and FDI alike.  My Department will continue to work with the Department of Education and Skills through the National Skills Council, the expert group on future skills needs and with education and training providers throughout the country to ensure we continue to provide the skills required for a growing economy.  </p><p>In the case of EI-supported firms, 14,614 new jobs were created in 2017, with a net gain in employment of 8,945.  This brought the total employed in EI-supported firms to 209,338 for the first time.  Supporting entrepreneurs and new business formation is at the heart of our job creation strategy and in 2017, EI approved funding for 90 new high potential start up, HPSU, companies.  HPSUs are defined by their potential to become exporting businesses which have ten or more staff and &euro;1 million in sales within three years of starting up.  Enterprise Ireland also approved funding across nine calls under the competitive start funds, CSFs, for 91 early stage start-ups in 2017.  This included a call for up to &euro;500,000 in funding targeted at experienced business professionals, and &euro;1 million in funding for international entrepreneurs and recent graduates.  </p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>A call for funding worth up to &euro;750,000 targeted companies in manufacturing and internationally traded services and &euro;1.5 million in funding was made available through regional entrepreneurship and FinTech CSFs.</p><p>In addition, in the period from 1 January 2017 to 30 April 2018, the local enterprise offices, LEOs, approved 360 priming projects.  The number of priming grants is representative of the number of new enterprises established.  These projects have the potential to create just over 1,400 jobs over the next three years.</p><p>Similarly, IDA Ireland is continuing to win new investment for Ireland, in a highly competitive global environment.  The IDA set targets for the creation of jobs in Ireland over a five-year period from 2015-19 as part of its Winning strategy &ndash; this target was itself a 40% uplift on the previous strategy from 2010 to 2014.</p><p>In 2017 the number of new investments secured by the IDA was 237 and to date in 2018, the IDA has announced 32 new investments.  As of the end of 2017, there is a record 210,443 people employed in IDA supported firms nationally, with a net increase in employment of 10,684 in 2017 over 2016.  Key to the success of the IDA in winning new investment for Ireland is the quality of the talent and human capital here, which is a key element of the decision-making process by all existing and potential IDA clients to locate in Ireland. </p><p>Each investment project has a set of unique and quite specific skills requirement.  The ability of the investor to source the very best quality people, with appropriate levels of training and experience is a prime consideration for the investor and a real location differentiator.  Some of the skills required will be available from within Ireland, while others such as language skills may involve relocation from overseas or transfers from within existing companies.</p><p>The ability of Ireland&rsquo;s skill base to help support the ongoing evolution of FDI companies in Ireland and to allow them to bid for new corporate projects as they arise is critical to maintain and build their long-term employment impact in Ireland.  This is true both in the direct jobs created but also indirectly through the downstream jobs impact on Irish subsuppliers, and the economy in general.</p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s availability of skilled labour is one of the primary reasons cited by IDA clients for establishing their operations in Ireland.  A scaling up in the supply of domestic foreign languages capability in second and third level will enhance Ireland's proposition for foreign direct investment. </p></speech>

Can I further ask the degree to which Ireland remains an attractive location for foreign direct investment, given the degree of competition in the market place and having regard to issues such as Brexit and the challenges ahead?  To what extent does the Minister of State see the FDI and indigenous sectors competing with each other, with the obvious consequent beneficial effect on the employment levels?</p></speech>

The Deputy spoke about competing.  It is interesting to note that just last week Enterprise Ireland and the IDA got together to bring indigenous companies together with FDI companies in three locations - Dublin, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan's constituency of Limerick, and Sligo - where they competed with one another to subsupply into those FDI companies that are already in Ireland.  It was a great success.  There was great interaction between the indigenous Irish companies and the FDI companies we already have in this country.  That is an example of collaboration and of how the two agencies work.  That collaboration is extremely important for them.  SMEs and micro-enterprises make up 98% of all enterprises in this country and employ almost 70% of the workers.  The SME sector is extremely important, being the indigenous sector that Enterprise Ireland takes care of.  FDI is extremely important but many small companies are set up from FDI and which subsupply such companies.  That collaboration is extremely important, and we work really well in that regard, as well as in terms of the local enterprise offices.</p></speech>

What are the trends there?  Have the adequacy of that labour force going into the future and the hi-tech skills required been looked at?

It is a very good question and is an issue we are working on.  The matter of upgrading skills is a matter for the Department of Education and Skills but we work very closely with it on this matter to outline the skills shortages that exist in the workplace at present.  We are working together with third level institutions and multinational companies, and within my Department, to outline exactly what skills shortages exist.  The future of work is changing.  Digital technology is rapidly changing the way in which we do things and the type of companies we are attracting into Ireland are embracing the technology that already exists.  I am talking about robotics, artificial intelligence, drone technology, virtual reality and artificial reality.  Those areas are very much a part of what the future of Ireland will be based on.  We want to embrace that technology and are putting a particular emphasis on ensuring that we have a skilled workforce.  We are working with the multinational companies.  The education system is changing as we ensure that more apprenticeships are being offered by companies.  There is a lot happening, which is why we are the fastest growing economy in Europe and why we are a magnet for attracting FDI into the country.  That will continue into the future.  Last week I held the Digital 9 meeting in Dublin to outline exactly what we are doing to embrace the technology and ensure our third level institutions are open to that.</p></speech>

It has saved many thousands of women's lives and it has been independently and internationally verified as one of the best screening programmes in the world.  In the report for 2015&ndash;16, it is stated 198,000 women were offered screening and 146,000 took up the offer.  This is an uptake of 74.7%, which is the highest uptake to date.  In 2015&ndash;16, 986 cancers were detected, thereby giving a better outcome to those who used the service in that year.</p>  <p>  BreastCheck costs &euro;30 million per year to run.  This is money incredibly well spent.  It was described yesterday at a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health as one of the best parts of our health service.  At the hearing yesterday, however, doubt was cast on its future.  The  national clinical director of BreastCheck, Professor O'Doherty, said that since the CervicalCheck scandal broke in the media, BreastCheck has received 15 solicitors' letters.  This is extraordinary for a service that, until a fortnight ago, used to receive one or two per year.  Professor O'Doherty is genuinely worried that if these cases are successful, it could absorb all the money from the programme and may end up jeopardising it altogether.  She mentioned legal costs of tens of millions of euro.  She said the taxpayer will require the stopping of the screening programme, which would mean women would die unnecessarily from breast cancer.  As I stated, in one year 986 cancers were detected.</p>  <p>  Is the T&aacute;naiste aware of Professor O'Doherty's comments yesterday?  Has the Government a plan to deal with this challenge to BreastCheck?  Can the T&aacute;naiste state today that the Government is fully supportive of the BreastCheck programme and that it will give its full support to the management of the programme to ensure its continued success, particularly in the face of this challenge?</p></speech>

I reassure the House that the Government recognises the value of BreastCheck and the importance for Irish women of its continued success.  BreastCheck is the national breast screening programme and it offers screening mammograms every two years to eligible women.  It has been running since 2000 and since then has performed more than 1.5 million mammograms and has diagnosed more than 11,500 cancers.  It has saved thousands of lives and continues to do so.  Therefore, the issues raised yesterday must be noted by the Government.  We need to remind people, however, just how important BreastCheck and other screening programmes are.  Screening is not diagnosis but it is certainly a way of finding and exposing early signs of the onset of cancer, thereby allowing for early treatment that can save lives.</p>  <p>  It is important to reinforce the point that BreastCheck statistics are impressive by international standards.  The programme is working.  We need to learn lessons from recent weeks regarding the obligation of the State to ensure that information flow is appropriate and proper and that women can gain access to information when they want it.  I understand that the comments made on BreastCheck have been reassuring in terms of the commitments made and the lessons learned.</p>  <p>  On the legal issues that are of concern, the Taoiseach has set up a working group to examine tort law in respect of medical litigation.  We will, of course, await the outcome of the review.  We have asked Dr. Scally to examine our screening programmes generally, in addition to CervicalCheck, in his work to ensure we correct the wrongs of the past in regard to CervicalCheck and the information flow that should have happened but did not.</p>  <p>  I wish to provide reassurance that, as far as we can see, BreastCheck is performing really well and saving lives, and it will continue to do so.  The reviews of disclosure that are taking place will, of course, ensure we learn lessons from the past and that women have information available to them to which they are entitled.</p></speech>

Everyone can have full confidence in it as a screening programme, as the T&aacute;naiste said, but information needs to be given to the public generally on what screening programmes are and do and their limitations.  That information may help to avoid some of the legal confusion.</p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste referred to open disclosure.  It has been the informal policy of the HSE since 2013 to have open disclosure.  It will be 2019, however, before it is rolled out in BreastCheck.  Could the T&aacute;naiste comment on that?  Could he guarantee that there are no other underlying issues concerning any of the other screening programmes?  Could he confirm that the Government is on top of this issue and not addressing it in the way it addressed the CervicalCheck issue when it first broke?  Could he confirm that the Government will not be caught blind once again because being caught blind would undermine the confidence in the delivery of the programme?</p></speech>

BreastCheck advised that the NHS breast screening programme introduced open disclosure on a formal basis in the spring of last year.  We are learning lessons from that.  I believe England is the only country in the world providing open disclosure at that level on the back of all its systems linked to screening.  I am open to correction on that but it is my understanding.</p>  <p>  BreastCheck will be examined as part of the Scally inquiry, which is expected to report by the end of next month.  As we have said, BreastCheck indicated yesterday that it has received 15 solicitors' letters in the past fortnight and is concerned about the impact of legal action on the future of the programme.  Let us not forget, however, that a breast cancer diagnosis is the most common cancer diagnosis for women in Ireland.  Therefore, the screening programme is very valuable and needs to be protected.  If necessary, we need to continue to improve it as we learn lessons.</p></speech>

We are mindful that voting is already under way on our offshore islands.  Many will have engaged with the arguments and propositions made during the referendum campaign and have now made up their minds on how they intend to vote.</p>  <p>  I commend and thank all those who were involved in the "Yes" campaign for the job they have done.  In the face of dishonest claims peddled by some on the "No" side, they have remained grounded in facts in making their case.  They have illustrated accurately and honestly the pain and trauma that the eighth amendment has visited on women for many decades.  They have articulated in a very caring and compassionate way the circumstances in which women should be allowed to end their pregnancies.  That has not been easy in the face of some of the tactics of the "No" campaign.  More than that, however, they have made this campaign about those we love: our wives, daughters, sisters, mothers, colleagues and friends.  They need and deserve our compassion.  They also deserve our trust, our trust in them to make medical decisions about their own bodies in their own interest.  Tomorrow they need our vote.  We all know that women in crisis situations, including victims of rape, those whose health is at serious risk, and those who receive the awful diagnosis that their baby has no chance of survival, are already travelling week in, week out to have an abortion in another country, or are taking abortion pills in this country without medical supervision.  A "No" vote tomorrow will not stop that but a "Yes" vote can.</p><p>Tomorrow's vote is about people, families, a woman's access to proper healthcare and an outdated, ill-fated constitutional provision that criminalises tragedy.  That is the sum of it.  The eighth amendment must go.  The women of this State deserve to live in a compassionate and caring country that does not turn its back on them at a time when they need our care and support the most.  Will the T&aacute;naiste agree with me that voting "Yes" tomorrow is the right thing to do for women and girls in this country?  Will he join me in making a particular appeal to men to go out and vote "Yes" tomorrow?  As men and by dint of birth, we will never become pregnant but our loved ones - our wives, daughters, sisters and mothers - deserve our trust, our compassion and our support.  Tomorrow, we cannot let them down.</p></speech>

I believe that, tomorrow, Ireland will make a decision that will have real consequences in terms of how Irish society moves forward.  We have an opportunity to address the secrecy, the stigma and, in many ways, the hypocrisy of the way Ireland has dealt with the issue of abortion for most of my lifetime.  We have effectively allowed a situation where it is okay to give somebody an address in Manchester or Birmingham and send them on their way on their own but it is not okay to look after them here.  We hear arguments to the effect that the Constitution requires us to maintain certain laws that criminalise women for ending pregnancies but perhaps the answer is not to enforce that law because it would be too cruel and not appropriate.</p>  <p>  We face a choice tomorrow, and I have to say I have been hugely impressed by the way the Irish people have responded to this challenge.  This has been a two year discussion, not a month long one.  It started with a Citizens' Assembly that made recommendations that forced me to think about my own views on this issue and confront my own views on the issue that were somehow settled before those arguments were made.  I believe I represent a lot of men and many people in this country who for many years have tried to crystalise this debate into pro-life versus pro-choice, believing that by maintaining the current constitutional wording we were somehow protecting unborn children.</p>  <p>  What the discussion in the past two years has shown is that that is simply not true when we look at the facts and the data and hear the stories of many of the women who were brave enough to come out and tell intimate stories about their own trauma, vulnerability and tragedy and having to face that on their own wandering the streets of Birmingham for six hours.  The issue around the role of men in this choice tomorrow is to try to see that story through the eyes of somebody close to them.  I believe if they do that, the way in which they view this issue will change, as it has for me.</p>  <p>  From the conversations I have had, predominantly private ones, we have seen a serious consideration by the Irish people in this time of preparation for the vote tomorrow in terms of the Citizens' Assembly, the all-party Oireachtas committee, a Cabinet decision and now a people's decision.</p></speech>

It is a matter of deep regret that it took personal stories and tragedy to be shared with others in some of the most public ways to ensure that shift of opinion took place.</p>  <p>  We know that the "No" side has been using a tactic in the past week in which they are claiming there is a better way to deal with the so-called hard cases, those very real cases where women find themselves pregnant as a result of rape or get a diagnosis of fatal foetal anomaly.  They tell us that can be dealt with in the current constitutional context.  We know that is patently untrue.  We also know that is a tactic to try to sow confusion in the last week of the debate.  Will the T&aacute;naiste join me in categorically stating that the only way to show compassion to women in these circumstances is to vote "Yes" on Friday and to repeal the eighth amendment?</p></speech>

It is the fact that we refused to face up to the vulnerability, trauma and appeals for help that many women have asked for and who were sent abroad to deal with that those of us in this House have been thinking about how we can respond to that appropriately.  If it was easy to deal with hard cases, I believe we would have had some credible proposals in that regard during the past 35 years.  Certainly, the idea that there is any credibility on the part of people who are advocating in the past 24 hours to deal with hard cases on their own and not take the approach that has been the result of two years of consultation and scrutiny is, as the Deputy said, an attempt at distraction and confusion as opposed to a real proposal.</p>  <p>  I say to Irish people listening to these proceedings who are trying to make up their mind and are conflicted in terms of the morality of these issues that many of us have been through those thought processes and the conversations that follow.  Can I reassure them that from the perspective of the Government and that of the majority in this House, we are proceeding here in the only way that is possible to respond comprehensively in a compassionate way to the challenges that many Irish women will face in the future?</p>  <p>  I listened to Saoirse Long last night.</p></speech>

Hopefully, it will allow many of us, a majority, to vote "Yes" tomorrow to allow this House take on our responsibilities to introduce appropriate legislation that can care for women and also take on our responsibilities towards the unborn but, in particular, to care for women in a way that we have not been able to do for the past 34 years.</p></speech>

It is essential now to reiterate that no change in our law is possible unless people vote "Yes" tomorrow to repeal the amendment.  The last minute scramble by some in the past 48 hours to suggest that it is possible is an attempt at a con job about which we have to be very clear.</p>  <p>  The campaign is drawing to a close but whatever the result, the focus will remain on women's health.  The scandal that has engulfed CervicalCheck shows a need for the Government to go back to basics on public health information.  Through this scandal we have learned more about the science of screening and the limits of that science.</p><p>We have also seen the human side and how false negative results have led to terrible family tragedies.  It would be an appalling outcome if people stopped believing in the efficacy of screening and stopped attending for screening.  Screening and vaccination programmes have been incredibly important in reducing serious illness and premature death.  They are imperfect tools but if done properly and properly funded, they are tools that undoubtedly save many lives.  Scandals such as that involving CervicalCheck do not just affect a small number of women.  They affect all women and men because they undermine public confidence in screening in general.  They naturally cause concern.  Sadly, cervical cancer claims around 90 women's lives every year in Ireland.</p> <p> It is heartening to think that if the right public health policies are pursued, the potential is there to eradicate most cases of that disease.  A report from the co-creator of the HPV vaccine, Dr. Ian Frazer, argues that most cases of cervical cancer could be eliminated over a period of time if a thorough vaccination programme was implemented.  I am glad the Minister for Health agreed a Labour Party motion earlier this year to extend the HPV vaccine to boys as well as girls, which was one of the recommendations made by Dr. Frazer.  It is a positive take up of that vaccine that could make an extraordinary difference yet rolling out the vaccine is not enough.  We know that the national uptake of vaccines fell by 3% last year.  This involves vaccines such as the ones that prevent tetanus and diphtheria and puts children's lives at risk.  Common childhood diseases such as measles are coming back.  These are not minor diseases.  Before vaccination, 2.5 million people died from measles annually worldwide.  We saw an outbreak of 1,600 cases of measles last year in Dublin resulting in three deaths.</p> <p> There is a pressing need to restore public confidence and full participation across all our screening and vaccination programmes.  Does the Government accept that this is the case?  Specifically, what will the Government do?  Does the T&aacute;naiste agree that a co-ordinated and clear campaign of action to restore confidence in both our screening systems and increase the uptake of vaccination is now urgently required?</p></speech>

If the people decide to vote "No" tomorrow, what they are essentially saying is that we can change nothing, that Ireland is frozen in time on this issue.  We heard stories such as that from Saoirse last night and many others who in an effort to change things, have told their own stories, often in very painful circumstances.  We will hear more of those stories in two, five and ten years time.  That is not okay for me.  I do not believe it is okay for most people in this country any longer, which is why I believe people will vote "Yes" tomorrow but nobody can take that for granted.  We will continue to campaign right the way through the day and into tomorrow.  To be clear because some people seem to be suggesting again, and in my view spreading untruths, that somehow we can change things and change the law in terms of penalties and so on without changing the Constitution: that is not the advice of the Attorney General or the previous one so we must be honest and up-front with people that if they vote "No" tomorrow, no further change is possible to help and support women who find themselves in awful, difficult and vulnerable situations in a compassionate way and we will continue to send them on a flight to Birmingham and Manchester.  People should think about that before they vote tomorrow.  As the Taoiseach also said, regardless of the outcome tomorrow, if people vote "Yes", we will still have a country that is compassionate and that cares about family and children in the same way we did before-----</p></speech>

A total of 80% of Irish women have used CervicalCheck while about 74% of Irish women participate in BreastCheck.  Those figures are high by international standards and we need to maintain that.  This is why in the response to the CervicalCheck scandal, we have prioritised looking after victims of that scandal first and foremost.  We are absolutely committed to exposing what happened fully, who made the decisions and when so that we learn lessons in terms of full accountability.  On the back of that, we want to ensure that we build confidence in this system in the future so that we can ensure that Irish people get the full benefit of screening programmes as indeed they should from vaccination programmes where people should listen to their doctor rather than what they might read on social media on the impact of vaccinations.</p></speech>

I think the most impactive thing for me in the campaign over the past number of months was the personal stories that complete strangers would tell you on the doorstep much less in public fora.  People, I could name them, came to meetings around the country and in my constituency of Wexford to talk and share their experiences for the first time.  Those stories cannot be untold.  They cannot be unsaid.  They cannot be hidden again and they cannot be ignored again.  The only way to address them properly is, obviously, a "Yes" vote.</p>  <p>  A campaign on vaccination and screening is required.  It is good to say there is strong uptake but it will be undermined if people's concerns are not addressed.  The Government needs to step up and understand that and promote and explain screening.  That can only be done by complete transparency and open disclosure and by addressing the issue of anybody who actually has been wronged by a system through a non-adversarial system of redress.</p></speech>

If the Deputy talks to the Minister for Health about this issue, he will learn that there is effectively already a campaign advocating the use of vaccines like the HPV vaccine.  We have seen a significant increase in the uptake from girls.  Indeed we have been looking at ways in which we can extend that and add to and reinforce that message.  In terms of the follow on from the CervicalCheck scandal in particular, we know there is a big obligation on the Government and Department on the back of full accountability and transparency in terms of what went wrong and that there is a need for a campaign to reassure and educate people about why screening is such an advance in terms of a medical response to early diagnosis of cancer and early treatment that can save lives.  We are very much aware of that and I agree with everything the Deputy said about it.</p></speech>

There is a very strong indication that there will be a "Yes" vote from Dublin South-Central.  While people have indicated a "Yes" vote, it is really important that people go down tomorrow between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m. and plan their day to do that.</p>  <p>  I wish to raise the regeneration of St. Michael's Estate in Inchicore.  St. Michael's Estate Regeneration Team called a public meeting on 15 May 2017 saying that there is another way.  One of the speakers was Tom Healy, author of a report entitled Ireland's Housing Emergency - Time for a Game Changer.  I also wish to put on the record the fact that the Government programme embraces the concept of cost rental.  I welcome the fact that the Minister met with St. Michael's Estate Regeneration Team from St. Michael's Estate this morning.  This is a 12-acre site owned by Dublin City Council.  St. Michael's Estate Regeneration Team, which is a local campaign, has put forward a very sound proposal, namely, for the State to use this site as a pilot project for the development of publicly owned land throughout the State.  On 26 April, St. Michael's Estate Regeneration Team launched a plan entitled Inchicore for Quality: Fair Rents Homes, which is based on the fair rent model, which is a proven European model that delivers a secure tenure home at an affordable rent which remains a public asset.</p><p>It is proposing the site be used to build affordable energy-smart homes, half of which would be local authority housing and half on the cost-recovery rental model.  This would make housing affordable for those whose income is above the limit for local authority housing and would never be able to afford a &euro;350,000 mortgage and who are being screwed with exorbitant rents in the private rental sector, facing constant insecurity in short-term leases.  This morning, I checked <i>daft.ie</i>and the rent for a two-bedroom apartment was between &euro;1,900 and &euro;2,600 in our area.<br/><br/>Such a scheme would achieve a good social mix; the T&aacute;naiste previously said he did not want to see social housing ghettoes.  This is precisely the type of affordable rental accommodation with security of tenure required for people on moderate incomes such as nurses, teachers, construction workers, transport workers and all sorts of people who get up early in the morning but cannot afford the unaffordable house prices or rents in the private sector.<br/><br/>A recent report by housing expert, Mel Reynolds, estimates that 114,000 homes could be built on existing zoned land held by local authorities.  Some 70,000 of these could be built in the four local authority areas in Dublin if this land was used as proposed by the St. Michael's estate regeneration team, with 50% local authority housing and 50% cost-rental.<br/><br/>A number of Deputies from various parties attended the launch on 26 April and all gave a commitment to support the St. Michael's estate regeneration team pilot.  We have not got an indication from the Government as to whether that would be the case.  However, if the Government is not prepared to do it, it will be in the minority.  I urge the T&aacute;naiste to come back with a positive response.</p></speech>

I was on the site with the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, when I held the housing brief.  This represents a huge opportunity to develop something significant in the area.</p>  <p>  This morning, the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, met the St. Michael's estate regeneration team.  He also met other residents last week along with the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne.  The St. Michael's estate regeneration team proposal, "Our Community a better way: campaign for fair rental homes", was launched on 26 April in Buswell's Hotel.  It comprised 300 homes, 150 of which were social and 150 were cost-rental.  The State would fund the capital cost of all units at a cost of &euro;56 million.  There would be a mix of one, two and three-bedroom apartments costing on average &euro;175,000, &euro;183,000 and &euro;200,000, respectively.  Average monthly rent on a cost-rental basis would be &euro;900.</p>  <p>  Dublin City Council is proposing a minimum of 420 units on the site, which is significantly more than the fair rent homes proposal has envisaged.  It is important on key pieces of land such as the St. Michael's estate site that we make optimum use of the land assets available.  Aside from the construction costs of whatever development takes place, it is critical we so not have a loss of opportunity because of density that is too low.  Dublin City Council proposed 30% social housing, 126 units; 20% affordable housing, 84 units; and 50% private homes, 210 units.  The first phase of the social housing element, which is 52 living-with-care homes, has housing with the support of the pilot project under Rebuilding Ireland.  It has been approved by the capital assistance scheme, a funding of &euro;15 million plus a contribution of &euro;450,000 from the Department of Health towards additional communal facilities.</p>  <p>  Dublin City Council intends to develop the lands primarily for residential development with commercial, retail, enterprise and community uses as outlined in the Dublin City Council city development plan.  Proposals for interested parties can be assessed as part of the public procurement process to develop the land.</p>  <p>  This is a really significant site.  We need to proceed with the construction project as soon as we can.  Dublin City Council has a view on the way to move forward.  I know there are varying views among many people living in the community I the area.  The Government intends to prioritise the best approach here that can deliver housing units to ensure we have a mixed-tenure community with social, affordable and private housing to create the right communal environment on the site.</p></speech>

The new Minister for Housing will provide leadership, work with all relevant stakeholders, and will set out in the Action Plan for Housing, a roadmap to implement the cost rental model. </blockquote><p>The existing Government policy is not working.  Only 2,378 houses were built by local authorities and housing bodies in 2016 and 2017, which is 4% of what could be built on State-owned lands.  .  Apart from the fact that it is a giveaway of State lands, the housing land initiative will not work.  Even if developers take up the offer from local authorities, the housing built will not be affordable.</p><p>We are pushing an open door here.  Many people in the community support the concept of the pilot scheme proposed by the St. Michael's estate regeneration team.  Councillors also support the concept in general.  People on this side of the House support the concept and have committed to work together in solidarity to implement this pilot model.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste to sit down with the relevant parties, including the councillors, the housing manager in Dublin City Council and Government representatives, to implement a cost-effective rental model that will be a game changer in our community.</p></speech>

We are absolutely committed to affordable rental and cost rental as well as using land banks the State owns strategically today to ensure we can deliver on the potential of that model.</p>  <p>  The Government also insists that we want to create mixed-tenure communities where social housing is next-door to affordable rental, next-door to privately owned property.</p></speech>

It is the biggest drop by an existing country in the measure.  I am sure the T&aacute;naiste will agree the rankings drop is a serious concern, particularly to prospective inward investment as well as to all companies operating here.

We will not repeat the mistakes made in the past.  In 2011, Ireland was ranked 24th in world competitiveness.  The Deputy may have been a Minister of State in the relevant Department in the build up to that period and trying to improve our competitiveness.  This is obviously disappointing and we need to take note of it.  The reasons for Ireland's moving from sixth to 12 include Brexit; changes to international trading; exchange rate volatility; monetary tightening by the European Central Bank; and infrastructure development.  The one over which we have control and to which we are responding is infrastructure.  We have a &euro;116 billion infrastructure plan for the next ten years to respond to that.  We note this, but I assure the Deputy there is no complacency.</p></speech>

It goes without saying, but let us say it again, that BreastCheck is a vital cancer screening programme and has undoubtedly saved many, many lives.  However, we heard that Professor Ann O'Doherty told the Oireachtas health committee that her great concern is that litigation is going to cost so much that politicians will say to stop screening.  Is it not the reality that compensation for women who have genuine legal cases and screening programmes can coexist?

I understand a debate and vote will take place in the very near future.  The Bill is legally sound but it will take political will to implement it.  The people of Ireland have elected us as Deputies and I believe they demand that we compel the Government to do something about the State of Israel at the moment.  Even today, Israel has announced 3,500 illegal houses in the West Bank.  This morning I spoke to a doctor in Gaza who said the situation there is unspeakable, and it is unspeakable what Israel has done to the people of Gaza.</p>  <p>  If there is anything the T&aacute;naiste can do, as a Deputy elected by the people of this country, he should vote on this Bill and implement it in order to send a message to the State of Israel.

This is a very sought-after village with a very high demand for housing.  While I acknowledge there is a crisis with people looking for social housing, there is also a crisis with people looking to get on the property ladder.  What chance has a young couple to buy a NAMA-owned house when they cannot even get the opportunity to bid on one?  Will the T&aacute;naiste give a commitment that some of these houses will be put on the open market so young couples can have an opportunity to bid on them to try to get on the property ladder?  It is not right that these houses are bought <i>en bloc</i>.  Young couples, who are staying at home with their parents despite having young children, are trying to get into the property market but they cannot do so, given the Housing Agency is coming in and buying up houses <i>en bloc</i>.  It is not just in Claregalway and it has happened in Athenry and other places.  There must be some route whereby young people can also bid on these houses.</p></speech>

We obviously have a duty of care to the citizens of our country to make sure we are providing for them.  That is why Rebuilding Ireland is a &euro;6 billion commitment to bring 50,000 new homes into the social housing stock and, more than that, to use the private rental sector to look after people who are on the housing lists and who need housing supports.  It is very important that we do that.  It is also very important that we have a mix, whether we are building a new community or regenerating a community, and that includes taking on some of the legacy housing stock from the crisis years which was left empty, the ghost estates and the derelict housing, and bringing them back into use and to do that in a mixed way.</p>  <p>  The Housing Agency is doing great work, working with local authorities and other agencies to secure homes for social housing.  One of the things I said to local authorities at the first housing summit in September of last year was that where they are acquiring, they should only acquire in low demand areas because we want them to build more.  A 30% increase in building will happen this year because of that direction I gave them.  Obviously, as they approach each area in their own communities, they should approach them with that purpose of mix in mind, so we can get a sustainable mix in every area.  I will speak to the local authority and the Housing Agency about exactly what is happening in Claregalway and I will come back to the Deputy in due course.</p></speech>

I understand the Cabinet took a decision on that, even though, at the Committee on Budgetary Oversight, the Minister could not give us any indication of the purpose of this fund and whether it is to be an emergency fund, a counter-cyclical fund or otherwise.  Many of us believe in sovereign wealth funds and the NTMA doing what it has to do to restore our basic savings and pensions fund.  However, many, and I am one of them, are totally opposed to a rainy day fund in 2019, given fiscal space is so tight.  We need to have a full debate about putting aside over &euro;1.5 billion in such a short period.</p>  <p>  I agree strongly with Deputy Howlin in regard to his comments on the Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill and the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill.  What has been happening in recent weeks is damaging the legislative process and damaging the reputation of this House.  We have had a long debate and we are into voting mode on the Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill.  We should set aside a specific time for that Bill and get it finished, and then deal with the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill in the way Deputy Howlin has said.</p></speech>

Small retail businesses throughout the country are under serious pressure because over &euro;600,000 is being lost every hour due to illegal trade.  A sum of &euro;418 million annually is lost to small indigenous businesses in the Border region.  Ultimately, the State is losing out in this regard as a result of unpaid VAT.  In addition, there has been a proliferation of web-based companies registering under the <i>.ie</i>domain name and purporting to be of Irish origin.  This is leading to further tax avoidance.  This lack of competitiveness for retailers is being further exacerbated by the delay in introducing the long-promised commercial rates Bill, which is needed in order to balance the trading obligations of the bricks-and-mortar businesses and those trading online.  When I asked about this Bill many months ago, the previous Taoiseach promised that it would be before the House by last Christmas.

The context for the introduction of such scales by the then Government in 2011 is important.  It merits reflection and repeating.  In order to address the calamitous fiscal crisis at that time, nine budgetary events involving &euro;30 billion in consolidation measures were announced between 2008 and 2014.  Two thirds of the adjustment burden fell on expenditure, with the remainder on tax.  Approximately half of the total adjustment took place between 2008 and 2010, with the remainder occurring in the period 2011 to 2014.  A fiscal crisis of this size is without precedent in Ireland&rsquo;s recorded economic history and has few modern international parallels.</p>  <p>  Public service pay comprised 35% of total expenditure in 2008 and changes to both the numbers employed and the rates of remuneration formed an important part of Ireland&rsquo;s overall fiscal consolidation.  Between 2009, gross, and 2014, net, in the aftermath of the introduction of the public service pension reduction, PSPR, there was a reduction of &euro;3.7 billion, or 21%, in the public service pay bill.  Of this, &euro;2.1 billion was delivered through financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, actions on public service pay.  The balance of the savings was attributable to reductions in numbers, elimination of various public service allowances and productivity measures underpinned by public service agreements.</p>  <p>  The then Government also introduced a series of measures as part of the national recovery plan in November 2010.  These required all public servants to start on the minimum point on the scale and there was a 10% reduction in the pay of new entrants to the public service.  Thankfully, through the sacrifice of our citizens, difficult decisions by successive Governments, the programme for support from our international partners and continued sustainable and prudent management of the economy by the current Administration, we have now reached a far better place.  The strength of the recovery has exceeded expectations.  When the labour market reached its nadir in 2012, over 340,000 jobs had been lost and the unemployment rate stood at 16%.  Strong employment growth has seen nine out of every ten jobs lost during the recession recovered.  The unemployment rate is now down to 5.9% and a situation of full employment is fast approaching.</p>  <p>  While momentum in the economy remains strong, there are clouds on the horizon.  The UK&rsquo;s decision to exit the EU, an increase in protectionist measures and changes in other jurisdictions that affect the competitiveness of our corporate tax regime are all of particular concern to Ireland as a small, highly globalised economy.  One of the keys to addressing these challenges and ensuring that we never return to the dark economic place we have left lies in making sure that our public finances continue to be managed in a prudent fashion.  That is of particular importance considering that our public debt levels remain at approximately 100% when scaled by modified gross national income, GNI.</p>  <p>  Despite this tremendous progress, we still carry major public policy overhangs as legacies from the crisis.  We need look no further that our current housing situation to realise that this country and its people continue to pay a heavy price for the fiscal crisis and the economic mismanagement that contributed so significantly to the depth of that crisis.  Indeed, in securing the passage of the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017, which provided for the implementation of the terms of the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020, the Minister for Finance and Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, also provided for the unwinding of the FEMPI measures which have applied to public service pay and pensions since 2009.  However, those measures will not completely unwind until July 2022.  That will be 13 years after initial implementation.</p><p>This alone is testament to the depth of the fiscal crisis through which we have come and to what can happen when the public finances are not managed sustainably and prudently.<br/><br/>During the passage of the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017 through the Oireachtas, the Government accepted an amendment to section 11 providing that, within three months of the passing of the Act, the Minister would prepare and lay before the Oireachtas a report on the cost of and a plan to deal with pay for new entrants to the public service.  Also, as part of the negotiations last year which led to the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020, we acknowledged issues of concern relating to the increased length of salary scale for post-2011 new entrants and we committed to an examination of the issues and to enter discussions with the parties to the agreement in regard to it.  The agreement provided for an examination of remaining salary scale issues in respect of post-January 2011 recruits at entry grades would be undertaken within 12 months of the commencement of the agreement.<br/><br/> This was a significant body of work and staff from within the Irish Government Economic Evaluation Service were assigned to collect, collate and examine the relevant data and provide detailed point-in-time costs associated with the measure.  As the Department with responsibility for reconciling the various demands made on the Exchequer, it is necessary for us, at a minimum, to quantify, evaluate and consider whether, within the resources available to us as a nation, any spending increases being advocated are sustainable and affordable and can be prioritised among the many pressing social and other needs of Irish society.  That is not to say that all requests for additional expenditure are without merit.  The Government appreciates that extra funding is necessary and must be committed in certain areas, for example, an increase of &euro;1.5 billion in capital spending to provide the homes, hospitals and other infrastructure investments our society needs.  What is important, however, is that additional spending proposals are carefully thought through by the Oireachtas and evaluated in advance in order that the consequences and trade-offs are known before any budgetary decisions are taken.<br/><br/>I emphasise that we cannot say, on the one hand, that we need to ensure the public finances are managed in a stable way and that we must not repeat the mistakes of the past, while, on the other hand, telling ourselves that we can meet every individual demand.  We will not be able to meet the needs and demands of all groups.  We have a public service pay agreement for three years and this is year one.  We are committed to engaging with everyone in good faith.  If, however, we are saying that we need to keep the public finances stable and ensure we can afford to meet the commitments we have made, we have to understand there are responsibilities which come with that.  The Government is committed to discharging those responsibilities.  In fact, this is exactly the approach we have taken when examining the issues of concern regarding the increased length of the salary scale for post-January 2011 entrants to the public service.  This is what we agreed with unions in last year&rsquo;s pay talks and this is the process that is under way.<br/><br/>It is worthwhile outlining the main findings of the report to the Oireachtas and I will do so now.  The first finding is that there has been strong recruitment since 2011 to the estimated 237 recruitment grades across the public service, with more than 60,500 so-called new entrants, or 19% of the public service, currently working in these grades.  These include 16,000 teachers, almost 5,000 special needs assistants and approximately 10,000 nurses.  Actual recruitment would have been higher when allowance is made for those who were promoted from or left new entrant grades.  This confirms the finding of the Public Service Pay Commission that there was no general recruitment problem and that at lower pay levels there is a substantial pay premium in favour of public servants.<br/><br/>The second finding is that variation in the remuneration package offered to prospective employees in line with the economic cycle is standard practice across the labour market.  Within public service, entry level starting salaries have improved under collective agreements that have been progressively weighted towards lower-paid entry level employment.  For example, the administrative officer scale for recruitment of graduates to the Civil Service increased by 5.4%, or &euro;1,611, in the two years between January 2016 and January 2018.<br/><br/>The third finding is that the estimated cost associated with a two-point incremental adjustment for the 60,500 staff identified is significant, at approximately &euro;200 million.  Importantly, this cost is not included in the overall cost of the public service stability agreement.  Work is ongoing to refine these annualised costs by grade and by sector to improve the accuracy of this estimate.<br/><br/>The final finding is that individual benefits would be considerable.  Based on the average across all sectors, a two-point adjustment would equate to an additional &euro;3,302.  This would be on top of the pay benefits under the public service stability agreement of between 7.4% and 6.2%, or up to 10% for new entrants post 2012, which were already weighted in favour of new entrants and the lower paid.<br/><br/>The report to the Oireachtas makes clear the Government&rsquo;s commitment to working with the parties to address these issues, in accordance with the terms of the public service pay agreement, and taking account of the significant costs involved.  We started examining these issues with the parties as soon as the agreement was ratified back in October of last year.  Discussions have been ongoing since then, and we met with the unions on 27 April last to discuss the report's findings.  Further engagement will take place on this issue in early June.<br/><br/>I again thank Deputies for the opportunity to discuss these issues.  I looking forward to hearing their views.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-05-24a.222" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1217" speakername="Barry Cowen" time="13:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018052400019#U00200"><p>I welcome this opportunity, brief as it is, to give our initial views and comments on the ongoing inequalities that exist in the public service.  I do not want to revisit the reasons and the necessity for the FEMPI measures that were introduced in 2008, 2009 and 2010.  Suffice to say, it was always intended that the dissipation with respect to the emergency measures would lead to the reduction and reversal of said measures, both in terms of public service pay and the universal social charge.  Fine Gael has deviated from that approach.  That is evident in the way it dealt with the issue of public service pay and its flip-flop regarding its commitment to removing the universal social charge.  As my colleague, Deputy Michael McGrath, said some weeks ago, it was the biggest promise - worth &euro;4 billion - ever made in the history of the State.  That promise was made, loud and clear, by Fine Gael and the current Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, who would accuse others of being reckless and feckless in terms of the commitment to which they seek to adhere regarding the way in which they would disburse the funds that are available in order to address the many inequalities that exist.  The political consequences of introducing such necessary measures were all too obvious for Fianna F&aacute;il, as a political party, but we are thankful that subsequent Governments stuck to the programme, continued the heavy lifting and pursued the final third of the adjustment necessary to create a foundation for us to take advantage of an upturn, if and when it arrived.</p>  <p>  This is not the first time we have spoken about the inequality that exists in the public service.  We have spoken in particular about the inequality for new entrants since 2011.  I and my party have put forward motions on the teaching profession and others to address that issue.  However, the Government has been slow and lethargic in the way it has done so.  It has come to the table late but, nonetheless, it is at the table with the prospect of resolution.  The reason we are still there is two pronged.  The first is the lethargic manner in which the Government dealt with the issue having failed to address it to date, and the second is that it is that cohort of the workforce in the public service who are most affected by the huge cost of living expenses that have been exacerbated in recent years.  We can think of many young workers in that cohort who continue to pay up to 50% and more of their income on housing costs and who are crippled by the cost of both health and car insurance.  Traffic congestion continues to be a problem in many part of the city and the country, and there is a  deficit in public transport provision.  Both those reasons - the Government's failure to address the issue initially and then not addressing the areas of health and housing sufficiently, which has created a further burden on that workforce - have created what the Minister of State alluded to when he spoke about the difficulties the Government faces in providing the relevant finances to address this pay issue.  Pay becomes the focus of people's attention when they cannot meet the demands society places on them because of the failure of Government to address some of those issues.</p><p> We included a commitment on the Public Service Pay Commission and on addressing inequality for new entrants since 2011 in the confidence and supply arrangement that we entered into to facilitate the formation of a stable Government.  Moreover, during the passage of the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act, which as the Minister of State alluded to represents the unravelling of the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, legislation, we insisted on an amendment directing the Government to get a report from the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service costing and evaluating the adjustments needed to address that issue for new entrants.  Now, belatedly, the Government has begun the process of engaging with the relevant unions to deal with that very issue.  We support that process.  We expect the goodwill on both sides to help to find a solution.  We believe that should be addressed and agreed in the near future, in plenty of time for negotiations on the budget.</p> <p> As far as we can see, there are only some definite elements of the budget at this juncture.  They are the &euro;500 million towards the rainy day fund, the cost associated with the pension anomaly that was recognised last year, especially concerning home care credits, which is being dealt with and a first commitment on the issue of pay equality.  The cost associated with it is &euro;200 million.  It is up to both parties to come to a sensible conclusion and agreement on that issue and we support that. </p> <p> Pay inequality in the public service is quite evident across a wide range of areas.  Again, having committed to the Public Service Pay Commission, we agree with its initial task of looking at difficulties in recruitment and retention in certain areas of pivotal importance, namely, the health service, consultants and the Air Corps.  The Public Service Pay Commission is due to report to the Government in June, on foot of independent recommendations to address those issues.  Again, Fianna F&aacute;il earnestly asks the Government to engage with the relevant unions associated with those areas with a view to arriving at a successful conclusion and putting in place a pathway to address those issues.</p> <p> As I said to the Minister for Finance last week, it is the understanding of one of the unions pertaining to that process that the public service pay agreement for the next three years, of which we are in the first year, is predicated on recommendations not only being submitted to the Government, but being acted on by it in the second year of that three-year agreement.  That union, the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, is convinced that this is provided for in the Act that I mentioned earlier.  The union holds that it is provided for in clarification letters it subsequently received from the Department.  The Minister is not on the same page, based on my communication and correspondence with him.  That needs to be clarified as otherwise, the Government is facing the unravelling of the three-year deal.</p> <p> To return to the issue of inequality for new entrants, I recently have heard commentators on the public airwaves saying that because of the CAO application process and the oversubscription to various roles including teaching, nursing, the Garda or the Defence Forces, there is nothing to fear where public sector pay is concerned.  That is totally disingenuous to those who work in those areas or who wish to work in them.  Many of those working in those areas and in the public service harboured an ambition to do so for a long time.  Many young people today harbour that same ambition and their first priority is to fulfil that ambition.  The level of pay that is associated with it might only be a secondary realisation.  From their perspective, the failure of the Government to address social issues arising from their pay difficulties may also be a secondary realisation. </p> <p> I am mindful of the effort that is being made at the front line of those services.  We rightly appreciate, thank and laud their efforts at times of crisis, for example, during recent extreme weather events.  However, that is nothing but hot air and is very disingenuous unless we can recognise the difficulty that is faced in the meantime.  The three areas I mentioned are examples of the difficulties and the reasons efforts to resolve this issue must be made.</p> <p> The health service has many obvious difficulties across a wide range of areas.  People are living longer, there is an age demographic that will place greater strain on services and we have not provided adequately for that.  In recent years we have seen centres of excellence or health provision.  We have seen section 39 companies taking on a role that many would expect the State to fulfil, yet there is no recognition or coming together.  There are age-old problems concerning pay but one cannot expect age-old resolutions to rectify them.  That is just a small observation, rather than getting into it in any deep or meaningful way.  Suffice to say that we expect the Public Service Pay Commission to make recommendations that we will be watching very carefully.  Fianna F&aacute;il is very hopeful that they will reflect the sentiments that have been expressed to us as public representatives by our constitutions who are involved in that sector to the effect that there must be a sea change in the Government's approach to the provision of public services, the expectations on them and the pressures on those who are delivering those services.  I refer to pressures concerning where they live, how they travel to work, how they carry out their work and how they provide for their own families in a way that allows them to deliver the service we expect and hope to improve.  We cannot simply expect those services and facilities to improve to the level we would be happy with without addressing many other issues that feed into that.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-05-24a.224" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="13:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018052400020#V00200"><p>At the outset, my party welcomes the fact that at long last, moves are being made to address this issue.  Accompanying the Minister of State today I can see some of the officials who I met several years ago to discuss this matter.  One of the questions we were examining at the time was exactly how much it would cost to unravel all of this and deal with the issue of new entrants post 2011.  Finally we have a cost but we do not yet have a strategy.  We certainly do not have an agreement, and that needs to be put in place.</p>  <p>  I think it is important for us to put what happened to those new entrants into a wider context to truly appreciate why they see this as a real grievance.  The Minister of State's opening statement quite rightly outlined the extent of the cuts from 2008 to 2014.  Before Deputy Cowen leaves the Chamber, I note that his party was also partly responsible for the cuts and in fact was the architect of many of them.  There was the universal social charge, which was a new tax on public sector workers and all workers.  The public service pension levy was then introduced, which was solely for public sector workers.  There were pay cuts outside of those that were taken by new entrants, cuts that were generally imposed from 2008 up to 2011.  Changes to overtime and increments freezes were also put in place.</p><p><i>2 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p> <p>The totality of the changes that were made had a huge impact on public sector workers.  Between 2008 and 2014, on average a public sector worker lost approximately 14%.  On top of all this, new entrants had a further cut in their pay of 10%.  This was not simply on the starting grade.  If it was only the starting grade it would have been an inequality at that point, but all of the increment grades and rates, right up to retirement and the top rate, were all cut.  Over the lifetime of working in the service they were to lose, and lose substantially.</p> <p> Obviously there have been changes, and because of political pressure and because the Government had to do something because of pressure from trade unions there was a merging of the increment scales.  There was a reduction in the pension levy for those who were new entrants to alleviate a lot of the damage done, but there is still an injustice and legacy issues, which will cost &euro;209 million.  My quarrel with the Government when the last pay talks were ongoing was why this issue was not dealt with.  Why was this issue left on the long finger?  I could not understand it when we consider that at the heart of almost all of the industrial disputes we have seen over the course of recent years in the public sector, from garda&iacute; to teachers to nurses, the issue of equal pay for equal work was one of the core issues, but it was not dealt with.  These workers were effectively left behind.</p> <p> I remember having discussions such as this with previous Ministers, who sat there and told me it was not an issue and that could be dealt with because it would cost too much money.  There was no idea how much it would cost.  I was told it was complicated and it could not be done.  Lo and behold, suddenly the figure of &euro;209 million appeared, it could be done and a process is being put in place to do it.  This is where we have come from.</p> <p> We have to recognise that those public sector workers who are new entrants have borne all of the other cuts and all of the other increases in taxation as well as this separate cut in pay that applied solely to new entrants in the public sector.  It was a deliberate intentional strategy by the Government at the time to target young people coming into the public sector.  It is not without its consequences.  Even today, we know we have challenges recruiting nurses.  We have challenges recruiting front-line staff to our healthcare sector.  It is the same with teaching.  We have people with qualifications who are leaving the country because of that injustice.  They feel if that is how the State will treat them they will go elsewhere.  We are now paying a price for the very poorly thought out illogical strategy that was put in place back then.  We really need to send a very clear signal to those workers that it will be dealt with.</p> <p> Yes, some remedial action has been taken and I welcome this.  I hope this issue will be dealt with in its totality over the course of the next number of years through agreement.  I want this to happen.  However, what those workers have lost during the period from 2011 until now is potentially lost to them forever, and this has implications for their pensions.  This was a real grievance and a real sore, and I do not believe the Government truly understood the grievance those public sector workers felt.  We saw it manifested in industrial disputes.  It is the case, perhaps, of too little too late in some respects.  The Government was warned against this and advised it should take priority in pay talks but it ignored all of that advice.  We suffered because of industrial relations issues and disputes.  Those workers continue to suffer and only now is the Government getting around to doing something about it.  I want it done as quickly as possible so we have justice for those public sector workers who came into the system in 2011 and we have equal pay for equal work in the public service.</p></speech>

There is no excuse at this stage for any further delay in addressing a wrong.  Unequal pay for equal work is wrong and it needs to be stopped.  We need to compensate or address the anomalies that have been caused since 2011, to ensure people's pensions are not impacted because of cuts to their entrance wage or to their increments.  We are not talking about a huge number of public servants.  In the totality of the Government's budgetary figures, we are not talking about a huge amount of money.  If we address this, it would go some way to addressing some of the industrial unrest.  It might not help to reverse fully the problems we have in terms of retention of nurses, midwives or those in the Defence Forces, and there is a number of other related issues.  When we have 10,000 nurses and midwives in the health services who do the same work as their colleagues but do so on less, there is, obviously, a draw to other climes where the pay is better, or at least equal, and the conditions are better and there is much less stress because they are more appreciated by the system.  The same is true of teachers who, since 2011, have also suffered the same cuts and changes for new entrants.  They also need to be addressed.  There is nothing more galling than being in one room teaching a class while next door another teacher on a different rate is teaching a class.  This has not been addressed.  It should have been the first issue addressed with regard to public finances.</p>  <p>  Deputy Cowen spoke before us and I heard him state this was a necessary step that had to be taken by his Government, which was compounded by the current Government.  To this day, I do not believe this and that is a debate we will probably never solve.  It is a difference of approach in how to treat public servants and whether we accept their full value or not.  There are people in society who do not appreciate public servants and who are forever hammering them and who do not understand that the model which most of us espouse is an increase in public servants, an increase in public service and an increase in the quality of the service.  We understand that to do this we have to increase the amount of money invested, but we cannot even begin to think this if we have an unequal system in the first place.</p>  <p>  I urge the Minister of State to address this as quickly as possible so he does not have the situation that we have now, whereby the public service is not attractive for people to join, for example, in the nursing profession.  Currently, the HSE has over 2,000 fewer nurses than it did in 2007.  The population is growing and the complexities of the health service are growing, but we have fewer nurses to address it and there are many other issues in the health service that need to be addressed.  We do not have enough GPs currently.  What we are dealing with here is trying to ensure the public service is attractive to new entrants.  The Defence Forces have had quite a number of arguments with the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, on how to retain those who are in the Air Corps, the Defence Forces, soldiers and members of the Naval Service, and this is at crisis point at this stage because there seem to be more leaving than there are joining.  We are going from one crisis to another in the Defence Forces, but the same is true of the teaching profession and nursing in particular.  This is the urgency to be addressed in this, rather than prevaricating, waiting and delaying in delivering these changes in two, three, four or even five years' time.  It needs to be done immediately.</p></speech>

We conducted a publicity event on repealing the eighth amendment to highlight an aspect of how it impacts a certain cohort of women more than others.</p><p>That cohort includes poorer women and women in direct provision.  Most people would interpret that as talking about part-time workers, cleaners and people who work in hotels, such as waitresses.  One would think these are people who generally earn less than others or who do not earn anything and are dependent on social protection but when I looked at the Department's report on the pay of public sector workers, it is quite astonishing that it admits that 60,000 workers are impacted by discrimination and low pay in the public sector.  According to the report, it amounts to almost 20% of all public sector workers.</p> <p> One would not think that in speaking about low pay it is such a big issue.  These people are earning approximately less than &euro;28,000 per year, and it might seem to some people like a big figure.  The bar being used is a comparison with the private sector, and the argument is that these people are not so badly off because they are earning around the same or a little less than those in the private sector.  Shame on the Department for using such a bar.  If one was to forensically root through the reports from the past couple of years, one would find that in analysing the crash in the economy.  A narrative was brought about arguing that the problem was not Lehman Brothers, Anglo Irish Bank, the behaviour of bankers, developers and those who squandered the boom and drove the economy into the pits of depression, but actually the public sector.  The argument goes that it is bloated, spoiled and there are too many public servants earning too much with pensions that are too high.  It was a war on public sector workers conducted by Fianna F&aacute;il and the Greens, followed by Fine Gael and Labour, and it is has really continued up to now.</p> <p> Unless the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, makes a commitment to abolish the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, legislation and reinstate the pay levels of public sector workers to what they were, all he is saying is that he will continue to "wind down" the measures.  I am really tired of listening to him saying he will wind down FEMPI and things will happen gradually.  It is a bit like a robber consistently coming to a house, robbing it, albeit by a bit less each time, while saying the wholesale burglary is being wound down.  The pay and conditions of public sector workers have been raided to bail out the bankers and developers, as I have said.  It is about time to end the narrative.</p> <p> Looking at the reports, we can see how there is a wholesale attempt to diminish the pay and conditions of public sector workers, and as we predicted at the time, it was adopted as a model by the private sector.  The argument now can be that they all earn too little and can barely manage on the salaries they get because of increasing costs for rent and child care and the increasing inability to afford to buy one's own home.  It leaves people like nurses, teachers and sometimes doctors and people in the Defence Forces in a position where they fell pressured and sometimes ashamed that they cannot afford to rent or buy property to the required or expected standard.</p> <p> These people are struggling on low pay in an economy that is in recovery, although one might think it if one was a public sector worker.  We have the scapegoating of the public sector in order to improve the economy.  It is about time the Minister and his Department acknowledges that the war on workers must end.  FEMPI should end this year and there should be a serious attempt to reinstate the original pay and conditions of those workers, as well as the allowances paid to them.  Despite that report after report seems to deny it, the Government is facing an inability to recruit and retain front-line workers in the public sector.  In my area last year, the entire Linn Dara unit, one of the only units in the country for adolescents with mental health illness, had to close because the service could not retain psychiatric nurses.  Members know that many psychiatric workers do amazing work but the new workers that the Government is trying to recruit and retain struggle to survive on the pay they have.  That struggle to survive on the pay provided has a major impact on the services.  It is a double whammy and the Government is not just hitting public sector workers but the services they provide as well.</p> <p> Teachers, nurses, people in the Defence Forces and other public sector workers out there feel they are being robbed and not being paid enough because they must work an extra shift for nothing.  They feel they are being treated in a different and unequal way to colleagues.  I agree with their sentiments.  They must keep up the pressure on the Government to have this ended.  We are hitting June again and by next month the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, will have to stand in front of us and justify the continuation of the piece of emergency legislation that has lasted for the longest time in this State.  The FEMPI legislation is ridiculously inappropriate now that the economy is growing and in recovery; the Minister boasts about the same quite frequently.  Unless there is a serious attempt to end inequality in public sector pay, the people in the Department and the Government will be talking out of both sides of their mouths.  These reports would be absolutely meaningless in such a case.  I look forward to June's debate on FEMPI in this House and we will see where the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, takes us then.</p></speech>

This is the last day before voting in tomorrow's referendum and many of us have been trying to multitask.  The worst example of the Government's failure to address pay inequality in the public service is in the plight of section 39 workers.  I have raised this now with the Taoiseach and the Minister, starting when the last Government was coming to the end of its life and I became aware of the fact that it would start becoming an issue.  I have also raised it since we left the Government.</p>  <p>  There has been a bad strategy with section 39 workers to string out the process so they will remain deprived of the restoration of something they gave up on a voluntary basis at the height of the crisis.  I understand the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, has said on a number of occasions that he estimates the cost from studies carried out by the economic evaluation unit in the Department of Finance and others as being somewhere greater than &euro;200 million when all the cuts that section 39 voluntarily took at the country's hour of need are considered.</p>  <p>  I have spoken with many chief executive officers and other executives in section 39 organisations.  I stress to the Minister of State that they were not left with a voluntary choice as the country was going down the tubes.  They were advised by the Health Service Executive, HSE, that they had to cut their budgets in parallel with what was happening in public services generally.  It may well have been done by an overall reduction in budget capacity that was reflected in reductions in pay accepted by the workers in those organisations.  During our time in the Government, with Deputy Howlin as the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, there was a process of restoration and reinstatement of pay cuts agreed with public service unions.  People in section 39 organisations were left out.</p><p>Over the course of the past two budgets, Fine Gael was going around saying it had lots of money for tax cuts.  While we saw some of that, it did not have enough money to do the decent thing and restore payments to section 39 workers.</p> <p> There are a few examples of affected workers where there is a particular wrong.  The circumstances in this State mean that many hospices have service level agreements with the HSE to provide end-of-life services, which everyone will attest are fantastic compared to the experience of dying in busy general public hospitals with lights, trolleys, emergencies and mixed wards.  The hospice movement provides a level of care and comfort for people in their last days and their families, which has been superb.  As the Minister for Finance and his Department are well aware, hospice staff have exactly the same qualifications as the staff who work in the HSE.  On the north side of Dublin, we have the St. Francis Hospice, which Deputy Broughan and I have spoken about on many occasions.  Where nurses, doctors or therapists leave the HSE to become hospice staff, there is a great deal of research to show that providing end-of-life care is a highly stressful and important job for them and their families.  Notwithstanding all their great dedication and work and the continuous visits to the Oireachtas from hospice groups and section 39 bodies, not only are they not top of the list for pay restoration but little or no progress has been made.  In fact, there has been sleight of hand and the use of clever tricks by the Department of Finance to rule such people out.  The Department knows that they are highly unlikely to take urgent action which might affect terminally ill patients.  Thankfully, hospices are now providing end-of-life care within general hospitals which has led to great improvements in the hospital service.  I refer also to employees in organisations such as Rehab which provide essential services.</p> <p> I do not understand the Department's argument other than as sleight of hand and a case of being overly clever in asserting that section 39 bodies do not fall under general pay restoration.  It is a foolish position and the Department must enter clear negotiations.  Significant sums have been identified, but Fine Gael is still talking about tax cuts in the forthcoming budget.  While the recovery from the crash continues, certain categories of workers are being told that while they made sacrifices in the public interest, the Government is not interested in treating them equally when it comes to the restoration of public service pay.  That is simply wrong.  We have a process for the Civil Service and we need a very clear process here too.  If a nurse or doctor leaves a general hospital to work in a hospice, he or she will be offered a salary which is 2% or, if this continues, 3% lower.  People cannot do that, particularly younger staff members.  They have to pay rent.  I saw an advertisement in the newspaper offering a one-bedroom flat in the Finglas area for &euro;1,400 per month.  One could get a two-bedroom apartment in Hollywood for that kind of money.  Housing costs are distorting the real value of public service pay.  This has happened in Ireland before and it is leading to a crisis among younger people in the public service.</p> <p> I draw the attention of the Minister of State to a further anomaly, albeit I am sure he is already aware of it from his own constituency.  There are young teachers who are now significantly below the pay rate of their counterparts in the profession who decided with their unions at the time of the crash to agree to a reduction structure which affected new entrants more than existing professionals.  That decision was made then and large numbers of young people are affected by it now.  We need a clear pathway to fair restoration.  The #MeToo movement has given rise to a huge change in public consciousness having regard to the general principle of equality between men and women and the need to embed it in our modern society.  Public servants, however, are being cut out of the loop in relation to fair and equal pay treatment and there is a similar movement in relation to that issue now.  It was good of the Minister of State to set out where we are at in his opening statement, but there was no sense of urgency in what he said.  There was no sense of a demand for and recognition of equality.  There was no sense that the Government wants to take action.  Indeed, we do not even have the figures the Government has to play around with coming up to the budget.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-05-24a.249" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1361" speakername="Tommy Broughan" time="13:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018052400023#Y00500"><p>I am delighted to have this brief opportunity to speak on the important issue before us, namely, pay inequality in the public service.  Of course, I voted against the blanket bank guarantee in September 2008 which led to the series of shocking cuts and unfairness within the public sector and caused serious damage to the services offered to the Irish public.  In November 2011, I voted against the renewal of the bank guarantee.  From 2011 on, budgets continued to slash public servants' pay and significantly impacted upon those on lower pay scales in particular.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform released a report in March 2018 which showed that lower-paid staff in the public service are paid considerably less than their counterparts in the private sector.  The report also found that over 60,000 people had been affected by the lower pay rates introduced for public service personnel recruited after 2011.  There has been damage from decision made by the then Government in late 2010 to reduce pay rates for new entrants to the public service, including in the context of the capacity of the service to recruit and retain staff.</p>  <p>  The policies followed by the Government in response to the financial crisis in 2008 added huge banking debts to our national debt.  These policies were introduced by the then Government of Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party, supported by Deputy Finian McGrath and Fine Gael, the members of which sat on these benches at the time.  The years of austerity over the lost decade since have had an enormous impact on the salaries of public and civil servants at all levels as massive unilateral pay cuts were combined with significant increases in charges and taxes.  There were four waves of cuts after 2008, including by way of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts, the first of which imposed an 11-month pay freeze.  All previous pay agreements were abandoned.</p><p>In March 2009, the pension levy on public servants was introduced and their pay was deducted, causing a drastic reduction in gross pay.  The second FEMPI Act in December 2009 introduced a comprehensive pay cut from 1 January 2010.  Following these cuts, a clerical officer in the civil service suffered on average a pay loss of &euro;1,500 gross per annum.  That was followed in 2013 by the Haddington Road Agreement which introduced further cuts in public service pay and pensions.</p> <p> This agreement introduced increment deferrals, overtime rate changes and changes in flexible work practices.  As well as these four waves of cuts, the Government also restructured two levies, the income levy and the health levy into the universal social charge.  It is a shocking history of austerity that has impacted very severely on our public servants and the services they offer to the public.</p> <p> During these years successive Governments cut public service employment.  Overall, there was a 10% reduction in jobs across all the public sector.  These cuts have resulted in huge income losses for all public and civil servants, but particularly those on lower incomes.  For example, teachers who entered the profession after 2010 are on completely different pay scales to their colleagues even though they have the same duties and responsibilities.  Budget 2011 slashed new teachers&rsquo; pay by 10%.  In 2012, most pay allowances above the basic salary scale were abolished for those entering teaching.</p> <p> While the Association of Secondary Teachers of Ireland, ASTI, has made some progress in having these cuts restored, it remains that new and recently qualified teachers are on an inferior pay scales.  The joint statement by ASTI, my own union, the Irish National Teachers' Organisation, INTO, and the Teachers' Union of Ireland, TUI, about six weeks ago rightly concluded that pay inequality is having a divisive and damaging impact on teaching and education.  The presidents of the three unions pointed to increasing evidence of a brain drain from teaching as well-qualified young teachers are being offered full salaries and long contract jobs abroad.  As a result in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics, STEM, subjects especially, schools are experiencing serious difficulties in recruiting qualified teachers.  Since February 2011, graduates who entered teaching are on reduced pay and their projected income losses over a 40 year career, compared to colleagues who began teaching before 2011, range from &euro;70,000 to &euro;100,000.  The three unions' call for equal pay for equal work is unanswerable in fairness and justice and the Government must move urgently to completely right this wrong imposed in 2011.</p> <p> The damage to public services over the last decade by the FEMPI legislation cannot be underestimated.  During the period from 2008 the public service was slashed by over 10% from 320,000 to a low of 288,200 in the last quarter of 2013.  Much of this resulted of course from a moratorium on recruitment and promotion in the public service introduced by the Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party Government in March 2009.  The impact of such a dramatic slashing of public services, education, security, namely, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces, the public service itself and in local authorities created severe pressures on our public infrastructure which persists down to today.  Many of the recent controversies that we have discussed day in, day out in this Chamber, from housing to health services, all go back to the outrageous cuts and the slashing of public services staff and the failure to recruit key staff.  Recently, for instance, we discussed assessments of children with disability, early intervention assessment.  That comes down to what the Minister of State's party, Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party, supported by people such as Deputy Finian McGrath, did over this lost decade.</p> <p> The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform should immediately commit to full pay restoration for the 60,000 public servants, including teachers, who have been affected by the lower pay rates introduced for public service personnel since 2011.  The cost has been estimated at &euro;200 million to end this two-tier pay system which has existed for nearly eight years and which affects almost 20% of public service staff.  This cost equates to roughly &euro;3,301 on average for new entrants on top of exiting benefits under the Public Service Stability Agreement.  The health sector accounts for around &euro;84.3 million of the estimated &euro;200 million incremental adjustments needed.  The education sector pay equality bill would be about &euro;83 million, with around &euro; 59 million for teachers.  The similar cost for civil servants would be almost &euro;16 million with an additional &euro;12 million for the justice and defence sector and about &euro;4 million to achieve pay equality in local authorities.</p> <p> The recent Department of Public Expenditure and Reform report of course referred to the merging of new scales and the existing scales under Haddington Road which equated to adding a lower two points of the new pay scale to the existing scale and so implementing a new larger pay scale.  The impact of this has produced an extraordinary unfairness where people doing the same work are not being paid the same.  The general secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, Patricia King, correctly called for an urgent pathway to remedy this wrong.</p> <p> It seems ironic that the continuing refusal of the Government to address this issue coincides with a Cabinet decision to establish a so-called rainy day fund.  I asked the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Simon Coveney, and the Taoiseach about this earlier.  Our pension fund, which was initiated by the then Minister for Finance, Charlie McCreevey, was robbed and decimated by Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and their allies in the last decade.  I always favoured a sovereign wealth fund on the lines of Norway or the Gulf States for the long-term welfare of our people.  I am also well aware that the NTMA is refinancing huge trenches of our national debt of in excess of &euro;100 billion in 2018 and 2019.  However, setting aside &euro;500 million a year for the next three years, plus &euro;1.5 billion from the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, which is our sovereign wealth fund, seems bizarre in the context of rolling back FEMPI and creating a modern well qualified and focused public service, not to mention addressing escalating hospital waiting lists and addressing the current housing emergency.</p> <p> The Committee on Budgetary Oversight has discussed this at length.  The Minister appeared at the committee where he spoke about the rainy day fund but he could not explain why he needed it, other than that the European Union is asking us to establish it.  He could not explain if it was an emergency fund for the bad weather period we had with flooding and snow, for instance, or if it was a counter-cyclical fund.  We still do not know its purpose but the Cabinet has decided to go ahead with it nevertheless.  We know that next year's fiscal space should be &euro;3.2 billion but this has been seriously eroded by earlier spending commitments after 2018.  The removal of another &euro;500 million for the so-called rainy day fund makes the task of addressing pay inequality and other critical issues significantly more difficult.  Full pay restoration for our public servants must be a key priority for Budget 2019 and the Minister for Finance should factor the additional necessary &euro;200 million into the budget arithmetic in the summer economic statement which we expect in the next three or four weeks.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-05-24a.251" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1347" speakername="Mattie McGrath" time="13:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018052400024#Z00200"><p>Pay inequality in the public service has generated considerable public debate.  As the Minister has often noted, the Public Service stability Agreement 2018-2020 provided that an examination of remaining salary scales issues in respect of those recruited after January 2011 at entry grades would be undertaken within 12 months of the commencement of the agreement.</p><p>The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, also says that graduates entering the public service today do so on a competitive salary.  For instance, a teacher recruited in 2018 will start on just under &euro;36,000.  This will rise under the current Public Service Stability Agreement to nearly &euro;38,000 by 2020.  Across the labour market as a whole, the average starting salary for graduates is &euro;28,554, with 40% earning less than &euro;25,000.  Some of these figures are hotly contested. </p><p>I refer to the conclusions of the Public Service Pay Commission report: </p><blockquote>Having regard to all of the circumstances now prevailing the Commission has concluded as follows:1. A critical factor in any future pay agreement and/ or unwinding of FEMPI will be the State&rsquo;s ability to pay in the context of competing pressures on the public purse.<br /><br />Having reviewed the evidence presented to us in relation to pay levels and pay movements in the wider economy, we are of the view that there is a basis for parties to enter into negotiations for a further collective agreement to extend the Lansdowne Road Agreement.</blockquote><p>The Lansdowne Road agreement is part of the problem.</p><p>We have come to a situation of yellow pack workers.  I do not say that lightly.  It is terrible terminology but that is what it is.  That is the way new entrants are being treated.  I could never understand how the trade unions signed up to the Lansdowne Road agreement knowing that was going to happen.  They were all around the table.  They seem to have looked after themselves and to have forgotten about the people coming in.  It is a terrible situation in school staff rooms.  There is inequality and it is impossible for new entrants to buy a house, to get accommodation or to live, especially for those living in Dublin city, because of the associated costs.  It is awful discrimination to have within the system and within the rooms where they meet and interact, both the classrooms and the staff rooms where they are supposed to have a relaxing time.  It is total discrimination.</p> <p> It is the same with the nurses and many other public servants.  We have huge issues in my own county of Tipperary in trying to recruit nursing staff.  We just cannot get them.  At a meeting with the HSE and the management of the hospital we were told they had recently gone to the Philippines and recruited 48.  We are now in the process of having an extension built, a 40-bed modular unit.  It is hoped that it will be built by next January or February.  It will certainly be built but it requires a minimum of 75 people to staff it across a wide spectrum of roles, including nurses, doctors, cleaners, maintenance staff and the whole lot.  We are not going to be able to get them.  The HSE is overly fat with managers but we cannot get staff for this unit.  The managers are well looked after because they have been in the system for a while.  Even the new ones come in on good terms, but we cannot get the nursing staff.  It is little good to provide money for the building if we cannot staff it, although it is certainly good to provide the money to get the building.  The HSE will have to go off again to the Philippines and elsewhere to recruit.  I have nothing against the Filipino staff.  They are lovely and they are doing well but if their country's economy recovers and they are no longer available to us, what is going to happen?</p> <p> Qualified people here are voting with their feet.  General practitioners, GPs, are another area of concern.  The cuts made in respect of GPs under FEMPI were just savage.  They are self-employed people but they normally employ six or seven, and maybe as many as ten, people in a small community.  Apart from providing medical care and looking after their patients, they are also employers, ratepayers and taxpayers.  They pay for insurance, light and heat and provide other employment.  They are a source of economic activity for a small area.  They have been savagely hit.  I know there has been talk about renewing the doctors' contracts, which is nearly 50 years old.  The GP contract is totally out of date and must be dealt with.  There is something badly wrong with the system when people are voting with their feet and leaving, including young, highly qualified nurses who we want at home.  People who are highly educated, highly qualified and interested in the nursing profession are leaving and we are having to go on trawls all over the world to try to get people back in.  </p> <p> That kind of crisis is staring the Minister of State in the face across a wide variety of sectors.  One can look to the Army or even to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I heard the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na advertising this morning, thankfully, but new entrants are turned off because of the way they are treated.  They are not treated with the respect they deserve.  After all, they have gone to college and spent their money.  Their parents or whoever possibly helped them  They are then left to be treated as second-class citizens.  It is totally out of order.</p> <p> As I said, as control of the public service pay bill is a central determinant of governmental budgetary policy, it will be a matter for the parties to negotiate a timeframe that will provide for the orderly unwinding of the FEMPI legislation, having regard to maintaining sustainable national finances and competitiveness, other Government spending priorities, the public service reform agenda and equity considerations on public pay.  There are huge issues here and it is time the Minister of State got stuck into them because he cannot just ignore it.  </p> <p> There are also issues in all Departments, including the Minister of State's own Department.  For the year 2017, it spent &euro;3.5 million on consultants.  Is it that the Department's public servants are unable to do the work or that the Minister of State does not want to give it to them?  He does not mind hiving off money to these consultants.  Every individual Department is doing it.  I had another reply back this morning.  Millions and millions are being spent on consultants every year.  To take the Minister, Deputy Ross's Department for example, it spent &euro;1.6 million to have an American company look at how to organise and synchronise transport throughout the country.  Some &euro;1.6 million was paid for a report and then a paltry &euro;460,000 was thrown out as a sop to organise a rural bus link.  It has just gone bananas.  The Government should respect the civil servants it has and pay them properly, especially the new recruits.  The Minister of State knows the old saying.  If one pays peanuts does he know what one gets?  It is totally unfair.  The unions have a lot to answer for, for having allowed that situation to be brought in in the first place.  They have to answer for that.  </p> <p> It is a two-tier economy.  The Government has money for everything.  There is no problem at all paying consultants by the million.  They get paid and go on their merry way.  I have tabled parliamentary questions in respect of every Department and the figures coming back are astonishing.  There are no value for money audits.  What transport did the consultants organise in the Minister of State's county of Wexford or my county of Tipperary for that &euro;1.6 million?  None.  It is money for jam.  They can get what they want and to hell with the workers.  The workers have to eat cake or whatever they like.  It will be necessary for the Government to look at that issue.</p> <p> The Army is another area in which staff cannot be retained, as is the Air Corps.  We need and depend on these services.  They do great work in rescue operations and everything else.  As I said, yellow pack employment is thriving.  It is horrible terminology but that is what it is.  These workers are second class, they are not respected and they are not treated properly.  On the other hand, community organisations in every one of our parishes are being smothered with red tape.  They are now being threatened with a fine of &euro;100,000 and jail if they do not comply with the Charities Regulator.  I accept that we must ensure that there is no fraud and no misuse of funds but it is the big hand of the State coming down on the ordinary people.  </p> <p> The big hand of the State is mistreating younger and newer public servants and the other lads have gone off at the other end.  Even when the late Brian Lenihan brought in the pension levy - with whom I must admit I had a row - a certain cohort of them escaped it.  I asked the former Minister questions about it.  They escaped the pension levy and except those on very low incomes, they were the only people who did.  He went and checked and said that he had been told there were only 100 such cases.  There were actually 797.  That cohort never got hit with the pension levy.  That is wrong.  They are too close to power and too close to the system.  They can get what they want without accountability.  The ordinary people, especially the newer recruits, are mistreated that way.  It all came from the same crash.  The pension levy came in because of the crash but that happened and those figures are there.  A total of 797 people, down as far as the ranks of chief superintendent and director of services in the councils, all escaped the pension levy, whereas the ordinary man with a shovel on the road or the ordinary clerk with the peann luaidhe or a computer in the office had to pay the pension levy.  It is totally unjust and it is wrong morally, financially and in every other way.  It is fact.  Some people on the other benches are shaking their heads.  I have the figures and can produce them.  That cohort of people evaded the pension levy and that is sickening.  Everyone else had to pay it.  </p> <p> It is time there was equality.  We were here celebrating 1916 in 2016.  It is time there was respect for ordinary workers who are trying to eke out an existence, who are barely surviving and who find themselves in poverty and in the associated traps.  I am nearly finished and I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for his forbearance.  We have a big job of work to do and, as I said, it has to be done equitably and fairly.</p></speech>

In the few minutes I have I will just confine my comments to the report published March 16 entitled &quot;Examination of Remaining Salary Scale Issues in Respect of Post January 2011 Recruits at Entry Grades&quot;.  The purpose of that report was to lay out the options for the resolution of the unequal pay structures that were institutionalised as part of the national recovery plan and which have affected recruits from January 2011 onwards.  I note that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform made the following assertion in a response to a parliamentary question on 22 March:</p><blockquote>It seems to be popular in some quarters to assert that the public service no longer represents an attractive career option, that there is a crisis in recruitment and a continuing focus on the difficulties within the public service.<br /><br />My concern is that much of this can be counterproductive.  The truth is that the public service is a good employer by any objective measurement.  Public service offers a comprehensive set of terms and conditions, flexible working arrangements, decent pension provisions, fair wages that increase over time and secure employment.</blockquote><p>That may be correct in a number of aspects but it is not in respect of fair wages.  </p><p>The Minister of State went on to say the report bore this out and that this was evidenced by the fact that more than 60,000 people had been hired as new entrants on the unequal pay scale since 2011.  The Minister of State, in making this assertion, is really quite disingenuous.  What he claims is not the case.  That recruitment has continued apace is not because of pay inequality but in spite of it.  There are many other reasons people are keen to get into the public service.  We know that many realise very quickly it is very difficult to survive on the pay rates that are currently available.  To try to dress this up in any other way, as the Minister of State did, is quite disingenuous.  The simple fact is that in many fields graduates are voting with their feet and simply choosing to emigrate.  Pay is undoubtedly a significant factor in this.  The example of the nursing profession is one that immediately springs to mind.  According to an INMO study, the purchasing power parity of nurses in public sector hospitals and right across our health service, both at community and hospital levels, compares badly with that in other countries.  Crucially, the purchasing power parity of nurses in Ireland is below that in Australia, Canada and New Zealand, the destinations to which we know Irish nurses are most likely to emigrate.</p> <p> There is a similar pattern in the teaching profession.  According to the INTO, there has been a significant upswing in the number of qualified teachers emigrating in recent years.  Its figures suggest that pay inequality is one of the main reasons approximately 700 primary teachers leave the primary payroll each year other than for retirement.  This is the lived reality for those on pay that is lower than that of their colleagues working alongside them.  It is easier for them to live elsewhere.</p> <p> Hospitals and schools report dire problems with recruiting and retaining staff.  Unequal pay is undoubtedly a factor in this.  Our education and health services are suffering as a result of Government policy on pay.  While the economic circumstances that led to the imposition of the FEMPI cuts have passed, it is not been the case that a rising tide has lifted all boats.  This has definitely not been the case in regard to those on low wages in the public sector.</p> <p> The report makes reference to the sectoral pay increases that have been awarded and that benefit the lower paid in the public service but these have simply not kept pace with the rising cost of living for those who have been affected by unequal pay for new entrants.  A point I made previously and that bears repeating is that the imposition of these cuts has seriously and negatively impacted upon the ability of those entering the public sector to build a life for themselves.  It should be the case that people who have studied hard and who have proceeded to work in the very important professions of teaching and nursing and in the Garda should be able to have a reasonable expectation of a decent life on the salary they receive.  Unfortunately, that is not the case any longer.  That is a shameful reflection on Government pay policy.  We are paying a very significant price for that.</p></speech>

I appreciate that it is a complicated issue, rather than an easy one, but it is now 2018, seven years since the first new entrants to the public service were put on a different pay scale than that of their older counterparts.  Some new entrants have been doing the same work for less pay than their counterparts for seven years and there is still no clear end in sight.</p>  <p>  Our young people have been devalued.  They are receiving a loud and clear message that their work is not worth as much as that of their older colleagues despite the fact that they are doing the exact same job and have the exact same responsibilities.</p>  <p>  With regard to teachers, who make up a significant proportion of those affected by this inequality, a recent OECD report, Education at a Glance, found a direct correlation between teachers' pay the quality of education.  The teaching profession has been devalued.  This will have a detrimental impact on the future quality of education.  There is a multi-tier system whereby newly qualified teachers earn more than 20% less than their colleagues.</p>  <p>  Younger teachers play a vital role in the future direction of education and they are highly skilled, specialist classroom practitioners entrusted daily with major and far-reaching responsibilities.  By allowing a differential pay scale to continue, we are telling our teachers that they do not matter and that we do not care.  That is simply not good enough.  They, along with so many public servants who are suffering from similar inequalities, will continue to leave our shores if this continues.</p>  <p>  In recent weeks, the teachers' unions met at their annual conferences and backed calls for potential strike action if the Government does not properly address this issue once and for all.  An unambiguous, direct and straightforward commitment that the Government will not allow unequal pay for equal work to continue is absolutely essential.  For these teachers and so many in our public service, enough is enough.</p>  <p>  This is a very complicated issue but it is also a very simple one.  It all comes down to the simple principle for which activists and societies have fought for centuries for women and minority groups, namely, the principle of equal pay for equal work.</p>  <p>  I look forward to the outcome of the talks between the Minister and the unions but I call on the Government to continue with the clear understanding that it is not sustainable in a fair, just and equitable society to pay anyone less than anyone else for the same work.  That is non-negotiable.</p></speech>

The Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017 will cost the Exchequer an extra &euro;1.32 billion.  The cost for 2019 is &euro;372 million.  It is important that people recognise this is the cost of the pay deal.</p>  <p>  I listened to the debate with interest and I take issue with the idea coming from some Deputies that the public service, the State, is not a good employer, that it no longer represents an attractive career option, that there is a crisis in recruitment and that there is a constant doing down of the public service as an employer.  I absolutely reject that.  It is counterproductive and it is not based on evidence.  The truth is that the public service is a good employer.  By any objective measure, the public service offers a comprehensive set of terms and conditions, flexible working arrangements, decent pension provision, fair wages that increase over time and secure employment.  While public service is a career choice and people who serve are highly motivated by the public good, the competitiveness of the package on offer can be seen from the strong level of recruitment that the report has highlighted.</p>  <p>  A teacher starts at &euro;36,000 in 2018.  According to the INTO scale, a teacher who puts in 25 years will be on &euro;64,000.  If somebody enters the profession in his or her early 20s or mid-20s, before he or she is 50, he or she can earn &euro;64,000.  That represents good value and a good salary.</p>  <p>  Let me repeat the recruitment figures.  The report revealed a figure of over 60,500.  Deputy Shortall may laugh all she wants-----</p></speech>

I reiterate that 60,500 hired since 2011 are still serving in new-entrant grades.  Included are 16,000 teachers and 5,000 SNAs.</p>  <p>  I want to touch on some of the matters raised.  Deputy Cullinane said it was wrong to do what was done but it was agreed by the unions.  People seem to choose to ignore that.  At the peak of the crisis, the Deputy's then leader wanted us to default on what we had borrowed to service the State.  Had we defaulted, we would have had much more difficult issues to deal with and much deeper cuts to make.</p>  <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh referred to necessary steps.  I disagree with what he said.  It is pretty good to start on &euro;36,000.  A graduate in the public sector starts off at &euro;28,000.  The average in the State is &euro;30,000.  A teacher starts on &euro;36,000.</p><p><i>3 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p> <p> I disagree with just about everything Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith said about this issue.</p> <p> In terms of the information on the workers in section 39 bodies raised by Deputy Burton, that is being processed via the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive.</p> <p> I want to touch upon the matter about income tax.  In 2011, when we were at the bottom of the trough, so to speak, the State collected &euro;11 billion in income tax.  The amount that will be collected for 2018 is calculated at &euro;21.5 billion.  We are doubling the tax take.  People can believe that is a terrible thing but I believe it is a good thing.  I also believe that the people paying a lot of tax should be given an opportunity to have some of that alleviated.  We are an unusual jurisdiction in that people in this State who are earning the average industrial wage are being caught in the higher tax net.  That does not happen anywhere else.  We are very clear that we want to try to give people the opportunity to earn more money, pay less tax and take home more money.</p> <p> Deputy Broughan can criticise the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, all he likes but the Minister of State, Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il, the Green Party, the Labour Party and some Independents chose to participate in government rather than sit on the sidelines.  It is very easy to hurl from the top of the ditch when one is on that side of the House.</p></speech>

Ireland&rsquo;s view, and that of our European Union partners, is that significant further progress needs to be made on the outstanding withdrawal issues, notably the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, before the June European Council.</p>  <p>  This is a message that I have conveyed on several occasions to UK counterparts in recent weeks and it was reiterated at the highest level by the Taoiseach when he met with Prime Minister May last week.  However, before addressing the current state of play in the negotiations in more detail, I would like to take a wider view of where we stand.</p>  <p>  One year ago this week, on 22 May 2017, the EU adopted its detailed negotiating directives providing a mandate for Michel Barnier and his task force to commence negotiations with the UK.</p>  <p>  Ireland warmly welcomed the directives.  The robust reflection of Ireland&rsquo;s unique concerns and priorities in the EU&rsquo;s negotiating position spoke to the intensive programme of engagement undertaken by the Government to secure the understanding and support of our EU partners.  This solidarity was, I recall, captured very succinctly by Michel Barnier in his address to this Chamber earlier that same month, when he said: "Ireland&rsquo;s interests will be the European Union's interests".  At that time, negotiations between the EU and the UK had not yet formally begun.  There was strident opposition on the part of the UK to the EU&rsquo;s proposed sequencing of the negotiations.</p>  <p>  There were also very significant differences in principle between the EU and UK positions on critical issues such as citizens&rsquo; rights and the financial settlement.  No such differences in principle existed between the EU and UK sides with regard to the shared objective of protecting the gains of the peace process and safeguarding in full the Good Friday Agreement.  It was equally clear, however, that there was a very long road to travel in order to elaborate flexible and imaginative solutions with the aim of avoiding a hard border, while of course respecting the integrity of the Union legal order.</p>  <p>  We have come a very long way since then.  Over the past 12 months, under the able stewardship of Michel Barnier and his team, the negotiations have developed in a manner that has vindicated the EU&rsquo;s strategic approach.  The phased approach, dealing with withdrawal issues first, has been instrumental in delivering the outcomes we now see reflected in the draft withdrawal agreement.</p>  <p>  It is very welcome that agreement has already been reached in principle at the level of negotiators on the key issues of the financial settlement and citizens&rsquo; rights.  Also of particular importance to Ireland is the agreement reached in principle on a transition period.  This status quo transition up to 31 December 2020 will be of critical importance in providing some certainty and clarity for businesses and citizens in terms of what the situation will be the day after the UK formally leaves the EU on 29 March 2019.  This was a priority which both I and the Government raised at a very early stage of the negotiations.  I believe it was the former Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, who was first to advocate for it.</p>  <p>  Of central importance to this country is the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, which is an integral part of the withdrawal agreement and addresses issues unique to the island of Ireland.</p>  <p>  I welcome that agreement has already been reached that Ireland and the UK can continue to make arrangements to ensure the maintenance of the common travel area, which allows, and will continue to allow, free movement of Irish and UK citizens between Ireland and the UK.  It goes way beyond simply free movement but is a virtual recognition of citizenship in each other's countries.</p>  <p>  As I have informed this House in recent weeks, negotiations to close the remaining gaps in the draft withdrawal agreement are ongoing, including detailed discussions between the EU and the UK on issues relating to Ireland and Northern Ireland.  These negotiations continue this week.</p>  <p>  The UK has accepted that a legally operative version of the backstop for the Border will be included in the withdrawal agreement, in line with paragraph 49 of the joint progress report agreed last December, and that all the issues identified in the draft protocol reflect the issues that must be addressed.  These were important steps forward.  Real and substantive progress is now needed in terms of building on the progress already made on agreeing the protocol ahead of the June European Council.</p>  <p>  Over the past six months, the situation with regard to the future framework for relations has also been developing, albeit slowly.  In the guidelines adopted by the European Council last March, the EU set out in more detail its overarching approach and priorities for the future EU-UK relationship.  It reaffirms the Union&rsquo;s determination to have as close as possible a partnership with the United Kingdom in the future, a position Ireland has consistently advocated for given our very important economic relationship with the UK.  While the UK&rsquo;s current "red lines" may prohibit that future relationship being as close as we would like, the guidelines, importantly, state that the EU will revisit its position should the UK&rsquo;s approach evolve over time.</p>  <p>  This openness to adapt on the EU&rsquo;s part is particularly important and welcome in the context of the ongoing debate in the UK at present with regard to customs.</p>  <p>  A customs arrangement between the EU and UK would be a step in the right direction in the context of achieving our mutual objective of the closest possible relationship in the future and workable proposals from the UK will be given due consideration by the EU.</p>  <p>  I also welcome that, as things stand at present, the EU&rsquo;s position takes account of a number of significant Irish concerns, which my officials and I have consistently underscored in our contacts with the EU task force and our EU partners generally.  They set out an ambition for a balanced, ambitious and wide-ranging free trade arrangement with the aim of covering all sectors and seeking to maintain zero tariffs and zero quotas.  Ireland has a greater interest than any other EU member state in such an outcome.  Important sectors for Ireland are also prioritised, including agriculture, fisheries and aviation.</p>  <p>  Against this backdrop, the current phase of negotiations is about maintaining the necessary momentum to carry all of this over the line by the end of October.</p>  <p>  Because the EU has been clear that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed, and following my discussions with Michel Barnier and with my EU counterparts at the General Affairs Council last week, I can assure the House that the EU remains resolute on this.</p>  <p>  Michel Barnier has explained in very clear terms that a development of the UK position on customs, while useful within the context of the wider EU-UK relationship, would not in any way remove the need for a backstop on avoiding a hard border.  As we speak now, the backstop as reflected in the draft protocol, which centres on a shared regularly space, is the only solution on the table.</p><p>To be clear on one point, such a solution does not in any way threaten the constitutional status of Northern Ireland as enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement through the principle of consent.  It is simply a logical and legal outworking of what was agreed in December and reaffirmed by Prime Minister May in March.  These are practical solutions for solving a very challenging and political problem, namely, how to avoid a hard border in order to protect the Good Friday Agreement and the gains of the peace process.</p> <p> Of course, it is not just about the Border.  This is also about protecting other central and equally important elements of the Good Friday Agreement, most notably North-South co-operation and the rights of individuals and their rights as EU citizens.  There was a clear consensus among the EU 27 in Brussels last week that at this stage of the process, the UK must engage in a more detailed and realistic way on the draft text of the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland with a view to delivering on the clear commitments it made in December and again in March.  As I said earlier, this is a message that the Taoiseach and I have conveyed clearly to the UK side in recent weeks.</p> <p> In the interim, intensive work continues here at home on preparing people, businesses and the economy for Brexit.  The exact implications of Brexit depend on the outcome of negotiations on the future relationship between the EU and UK but we need to prepare for all scenarios.  This is why the Government is engaged in comprehensive contingency planning, which is at an advanced stage.  I would point in particular to over 30 research papers produced across Government and also the support measures put in place by the Government in budget 2018, as well as the longer-term economic strategies aimed at getting Ireland Brexit ready.  </p> <p> I welcome these statements, which come at a critical time in the negotiations and as the Government continues its intensive work on Brexit planning.  Support in this House for our work is vital and, therefore, I remain committed to keeping Members fully informed as this detailed and complex process develops over the coming months.  I hope and think that the Brexit spokespersons from Opposition parties know that I am available to talk to them on and off the record with regard to making sure everybody is kept fully briefed, particularly between now and the end of June as we move through a very sensitive but very important phase of the negotiations.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-05-24a.263" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1336" speakername="Lisa Chambers" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018052400028#DD00200"><p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate on Brexit, which is undoubtedly the biggest challenge our country has faced in decades and will face for years to come.  It threatens to weaken our economy, damage trade between Ireland and the UK and test diplomatic relations.  It is currently on a path which could lead to the stripping of rights from EU citizens living in Northern Ireland.  The possible reintroduction of a border on this island looms over all of us and to date, we still have no progress or possible solution to that issue, which would be utterly disastrous for our country.  A border is not just a barrier to trade.  It represents division and is unacceptable in any form - hard, soft or anything in between - regardless of how advanced the technology is.  It harks back to the days of violence on this island.  It is imperative that it is at all times stressed to Mrs. May and her Government that a border is a border, no matter which way one spins it, and the people of this country will not accept it.</p>  <p>  In December, it was announced with much fanfare that the Government had secured a backstop.  This was touted as a big win for Ireland at that time.  It is clear now that the backstop was oversold and the Government's interpretation of that backstop was, and still is, at variance with that of its UK counterpart.  In fact, Theresa May utterly rejected the wording put before her in March.  Here we are almost six months on approaching the June Council meeting and the backstop is still being discussed.  It is fine for everyone to agree that there can be no border on the island of Ireland but it is a very different thing to actually put that into practice and devise a solution to the conundrum in which we find ourselves where we all agree yet no one agrees.  Next, the UK presented what it viewed as two possible solutions in respect of this issue.  The first is a customs partnership, which we know will not work and which Boris Johnson, the UK Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, termed "crazy".  The second is maximum facilitation, max fac, an idea I am happy to call crazy on the record because that is what it is.  It is totally unworkable for us.  It is a border using technology that does not exist to create a situation that is not replicated anywhere in the world.  It is fairy-tale customs.  These were the two options being presented.</p>  <p>  When the penny finally dropped that the UK still had no solution, Mrs. May came up with a third option, namely, max fac plus delay, which is essentially an admission that she cannot solve the border issue right now so she is going to kick the can down the road and let someone else deal with it when she has departed.  If the intention behind this option is to delay the introduction of a technological border until the technology becomes available, then we should absolutely reject it because a border will never be acceptable - not now, not ever.  What might happen if this delay occurs?  What will happen in six, seven or ten years time when the Irish Government has changed, when the UK Government is different, when Michel Barnier may have retired, when Guy Verhofstadt is gone and when the make-up of the entire negotiating team is very different?  If we do not resolve the issue now, thereby allowing the can to be kicked down the road, we are the only ones who will be disadvantaged.  It is Ireland that will suffer.  If we see a situation where Jacob Rees-Mogg and his 60 Brexiteers in the European Research Group - a group that is essentially looking for a hard Brexit - suddenly start welcoming this third option because they think this is a good idea, alarm bells should sound across this island and loudly within the halls of Government Buildings, particularly as we know that the ultimate goal of this group is to break all ties with the EU.  The members of the group in question could not care less what happens to Ireland or to the Irish Border.  They have made that crystal clear.</p>  <p>  I was in Brussels this week and I engaged in a series of meetings to discuss Brexit and the negotiations.  I met with Emer Deane, Ireland's permanent representative, and her team.  I was extremely impressed with our team.  We are very fortunate and lucky to have such a strong team advocating for us in Brussels.  Yes, they are doing extraordinary work but they were in agreement that time is tight.  They are certainly focusing on the June Council meeting and the October's meeting but there is concern across the board that we still do not have a solution to the border issue and are still very much up in the air about whether we will have a withdrawal treaty at all.</p>  <p>  I also met with Nina Obermaier and members of the Article 50 task force.  The message was very clear.  I asked her directly about Mrs. May's third option and the suggestion that the UK could remain in the customs union for an extended period.  Ms Obermaier made it very clear that the UK cannot and will not remain with the customs union as we know it because the customs union is for member states only.  She was also very clear that the intention was that the backstop would only apply to Northern Ireland and that if there was no other solution, Northern Ireland - not the UK in its entirety, would remain in the customs union and the Single Market.  It is difficult to see how that position will somehow marry with the position being put forward by the UK because they are entirely different and right now, they do not match.  I also asked what the situation would be if come next March, we do not have a withdrawal treaty, which we must accept is a possibility.  If we do not have a withdrawal treaty, it means we do not have a transition period.  That means that next March, we are heading towards a cliff edge.  What happens to trucks that want to go from the port in Dublin to mainland Europe via England?  How will that work?  Again, Ms Obermaier was clear that this is not part of the task force's mandate.  That is not part of its work.  It is not discussing that.  The task force's focus is on maintaining the integrity of the Single Market.  Issues relating to trade and crossing the UK to get to mainland Europe are matters for the future trading arrangements.</p></speech>

However, she could not say how that was going to look.  She was very clear that her job was to maintain the integrity of the Single Market and that what is being put forward by the UK right now is not workable in its current format.</p>  <p>  While we support the Government in its work to achieve the best possible outcome for Ireland, as I said to the T&aacute;naiste previously, that support is conditional.  Fianna F&aacute;il and I are very concerned regarding domestic preparedness for the possibility of a hard Brexit next March.  We must do more to prepare for that.  I am out of time and would like to say more but I am sure there will be other opportunities.</p></speech>

The story starts with &quot;Once upon a time.&quot;  Mrs. May sold this fairy-tale vision of a post-Brexit Britain to her subjects - a Britain that was going to be fully in charge of its own destiny, a Britain that would not have to listen to any authority other than its own and a Britain that would not have to abide by any of the rules coming at it from the EU.  However, unlike most fairy tales, this story does not come with a happy-ever-after ending.</p><p>The caption in a recent cartoon in an British newspaper read &quot;The Customs Union and the Single Market is not dead - the British are hoping it&rsquo;s asleep.&quot;  With 309 days to go, the authority of the British Prime Minister, Theresa May, will come under scrutiny next month when the Brexit legislation comes back before Parliament in advance of the EU summit.  Her position may be untenable if she cannot control the opposing views within her own party.<br/><br/>She needs to be very clear on the customs issue before the summit at the end of June.  The days of indecision and vague declarations are over and for the T&aacute;naiste the buck stops at the backstop and we need to hold fast on that being contextualised legally.<br/><br/>The British Parliament will now have to decide which of the amendments coming from the House of Lords will stay and which will go.  Anti-Brexit peers voted for the UK to stay in the Single Market and in the customs union.  They removed the exit date of 29 March 2019.  The EU must be in agreement with this legislation also.  It wants clarity on the exit date and cannot let Britain dictate the terms.<br/><br/><i>The Times</i>in England has reported that the UK will ask Brussels for a second transition period that would cover trade, customs and industrial goods and last until 2023, to prevent a hard border in Ireland.  This may suit the British Prime Minister as she pushes the hard decisions further out.<br/><br/>The EU, including Ireland, is fed up with vagueness where no hard decisions are made, as am I.  The EU has made it clear it is all or nothing.  We want to see progress on the important issues at the June summit.  Fianna F&aacute;il sees all of this fudge by the British as an attempt to push out the difficult decisions that need to be faced.  We will not accept the Irish proverb &quot;Mair, a chapaill, agus gheobhaidh t&uacute; f&eacute;ar&quot; or live horse, and you will eat grass, while Britain still insists on having that proverbial cake and eating it.<br/><br/>I am happy that the EU is demanding progress on the Irish issue.  We are all still anxiously awaiting the UK&rsquo;s proposals.  On this issue, it is clear to me that the British are making preparations for a hard border.  Recently the sale of a former police station near the Irish Border at Warrenpoint has been halted because of Brexit.  This would serve a useful customs purpose in the Port of Warrenpoint.<br/><br/>I fully agree with Dr. Katy Hayward from Queen&rsquo;s University Belfast that any plans to introduce customs technology on the currently invisible border between North and South would be dangerous on all sorts of terms.  It would represent the reopening of a gaping wound.  The negative effects of Brexit are already evident in the North, with the creation of a new divide.  The peace process is very fragile.  Twenty years on from the Good Friday Agreement, the persistence of sectarianism is still very visible.  This fairy tale gets worse.</p></speech>

Obviously we all await the June summit and we want to see exactly what this real and substantial progress, which has been talked up and talked about for so long, would be.  The T&aacute;naiste knows that I and my party have supported the Government's approach and the European Union's approach to getting the best outcome for Ireland.  In December we had a political agreement, the most notable part of which was the backstop.  It was one of three options and I suppose it was the insurance policy that this State and the North would have in the absence of a better agreement - a free trade agreement or some agreement on customs and the Single Market between the European Union and the UK.</p>  <p>  One of the difficulties was that the backstop arrangement was limited.  We needed to build on the backstop but what we have seen is a different interpretation of what the backstop means by the British Government and a further different interpretation by the hard Brexiteers.  When we last discussed the matter, the T&aacute;naiste said that the Government would take its cue from the British Prime Minister and not from the hard Brexiteers, which is fair enough.  However, it is very difficult to know who is in charge at the moment and exactly what the British Government's position is.  British Ministers say they support the substance and the principles of December's agreement, but they have not put anything on the table on how they will bring that about.  They talk about "a" backstop, but not "the" backstop.  The backstop, in the December agreement, states it is maintaining full alignment with those rules of the Union's internal market and the customs union which, now and into the future would support North-South co-operation, the all-island economy and the protection of the Good Friday Agreement.  It goes on to state that the territory of the North of Ireland, excluding the territorial waters of the United Kingdom, shall be considered to be part of the customs territory of the Union.  It continues to state that a list of what issues will be subject to the customs union will be annexed to the agreement.  The difficulty is that not all areas of trade will be covered as part of this customs territory.  What has not been agreed is that the North will remain fully in the customs union and Single Market.  Even if the backstop were translated into a legal agreement with which we would be comfortable, it would still not mean the North remaining in the customs union and Single Market.  If that does not happen, we will have a hardening of the border and a difficulty.  We needed to build on the December agreement, but what we have had since is more backsliding.</p>  <p>  Earlier this week the Taoiseach indicated there was new thinking from the British Prime Minister.  We went from having in December a backstop, which was a bulletproof cast-iron guarantee.  We have had months of trying to understand and unravel what that means, getting some alignment and agreement between what the British Government, the Irish Government and the EU understand that to mean.  There has been no agreement on the legal text so that we can see exactly what that would mean in practice.  That now seems to be parked and there is new thinking and new ideas.  We have no idea as to what that new thinking will be, other than some vague reference to a customs partnership and an extension to the transition period where the UK in its entirety would stay in the customs union and Single Market for a bit longer.  Under no circumstance should we trade in the insurance policy that is the backstop for some sort of temporary solution being proposed by the British Government.</p>  <p>  For all of the talk and all the support we have given the Government, there is still no agreement as we stand here today.  There is still no sense of what it will mean for people living on the island of Ireland post Brexit.  Even with the backstop, there is no sense of what that means because there are different interpretations.  We are trying to put the best interpretation on it because we want the best possible result.</p>  <p>  There is a real focus and urgency and a real importance attached to the June summit.  If the T&aacute;naiste has a chance to come back in, he should give the House some sense of what is meant by substantial progress.  Is it substantial progress on the backstop or is it substantial progress on the so-called new thinking on which we have no detail so far?</p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste can understand our frustration.  I would like to take the T&aacute;naiste up on his offer to have a formal meeting with him and his officials in order that he can apprise us on what he means by substantial progress in advance of the June summit.</p></speech>

Despite the consistent interventions of political parties, businesses, academics, and civic engagement groups from north and south of the Border, it is a damning indictment of the current British Tory Government and its partners in the DUP that we are no closer to even an interim arrangement regarding the Border post Brexit, let alone to resolving permanently the issue of the Border on our island.</p>  <p>  It is now getting very close to decision time for all parties to this process, the Irish Government, the other European Union member states and the British Government.  It is incredulous that at this point in the negotiations, the British Government would introduce a third option for address of the Border in the context of Brexit.</p><p>I have a deep fear this is a further tactic by this deeply divided Tory Government to attempt to buy further time.  They have played and are playing a hard and fast game with the Good Friday peace agreement which is both dangerous and deeply damaging, and could result in the erosion of confidence and trust.  The fact remains there is only one solution to this problem that has been created by the British referendum.  There can be no border on the island of Ireland post-Brexit - no hard border, no soft border, not any border.  My constituents in Cavan and Monaghan do not want a border any more than the majority of citizens in the Six Counties who voted to remain the European Union in the British referendum.  This figure has since increased to 60% in recent polls.</p> <p> Just two days ago, Karen Bradley, the British Secretary of State, again announced that the North will leave the EU customs union.  If we in the House cannot yet interpret or explain how a border can be prevented without the North remaining in the customs union, then how are the ordinary citizens who will be most affected by it supposed to do so?  With 60% of citizens in the North in favour of remaining in the EU, we are going to have to start moving towards consensus politics to resolve this, and accept the will of the people.  Consent, of course, is the bedrock on which the Good Friday Agreement was planned, constructed, launched and built upon since.</p> <p> Just this week my party, Sinn F&eacute;in, along with the SDLP, the Alliance Party and the Green Party, signed a letter of consensus, again calling for no hard border and for the North to remain in the customs union.  These four parties together secured 49 of the 90 seats in the last Assembly election so the question, quite naturally, is fair to pose: for how long more can we neglect the will of the people?</p> <p> The withdrawal agreement, we are told, needs to be agreed and adopted by October.  Time, therefore, is not on our side, so what do we want?  There can be no diminishing of the rights of Irish citizens provided by membership of EU, wherever on the island of Ireland they live.  The Good Friday Agreement must be protected in every single aspect and in all of its parts.  The people on both sides of the Border have worked long and hard on peace building and reconciliation and do not want it wrecked by a reckless and divided Tory Government, which appears blind to the consequences resulting from the fallout from Brexit.  The people will not accept this and neither must we, as those entrusted to represent them, the Members of this D&aacute;il of all parties and of a variety of independent collectives.  We must act with a firm resolve - I believe that is the clear message we need to come from these statements today.  We must act with a firm resolve and we must act together in the interest of this island and of all its people.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-05-24a.273" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1370" speakername="Willie Penrose" time="14:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018052400030#FF00200"><p>It is almost two years since the people of Britain made their momentous decision to exit the European Union.  In a debate in the D&aacute;il some months afterwards, I made the prediction that they would not be disentangled from the EU framework for at least five or six years.  It is beginning to look like a gross underestimate if one factors in recent discussions pertaining to the likely transition arrangements.</p>  <p>  It is against this background that we have heard quite a lot recently about how the rules-based international order is threatened - threatened by aggressive military posturing by Russia and China; threatened by unilateral dismissal of international treaties, not least by US President Trump; but also threatened by the UK decision to withdraw from the European Union.  The rules-based international order is, quite simply, a shared commitment by all countries to act in accordance with agreed rules.  These are rules that evolve over time, such as international law, regional security arrangements and trade agreements.</p>  <p>  Membership of the European Union requires adherence to the membership rules in order to reap the extensive benefits of membership in terms of trade, security and higher social and environmental standards.  By leaving the European Union, the UK has signalled that it no longer wants to obey these commonly-agreed rules.  It does not want to be under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice or be restricted by trade deals struck by EU negotiators, yet it wants to preserve the benefits of frictionless trade with the EU market.  It remains to be seen if the UK is committed to maintaining European social and environmental standards or whether Brexit will be an excuse to unwind hard-won rights and protections for workers and citizens.</p>  <p>  This is the "have your cake and eat it" scenario that has been rejected, again and again, by Michel Barnier, negotiating on behalf of the EU.  It has been rejected by the European Commission and by member states, including Ireland.  However, talk of cakes is too frivolous for such a serious threat to Ireland and to the very basis of co-operation between European member states.  So far, two UK proposals have been rejected.  First, the maximum facilitation model relies excessively on technology, not least that hundreds of cameras would need to be placed on or near the Border to monitor the movement of goods vehicles, which is unacceptable and, in any event, clearly unworkable.  Second, the customs partnership model is yet another attempt by the UK to be effectively inside the customs union area while also negotiating additional trade deals outside of it.  Again, this is clearly unacceptable.</p>  <p>  Let us be clear.  Both of these proposals are attempts to do the impossible, which is to preserve the benefits of international co-operation without agreeing to a realistic set of international rules.  Instead, the UK has proposed fewer rules, with weak or non-existent arbitration and little or no commitment to pay towards the upkeep of the European rules-based system from which it wishes to profit economically.  The fundamental contradiction in this position is obvious to all.</p>  <p>  Last week, Downing Street finally promised to publish a White Paper before the June summit, with another proposal.  This appears to suggest that, in the absence of an agreed alternative, all of the UK will "maintain full alignment with those rules of the internal market and customs union which support north-south co-operation, the all-island economy and the Good Friday Agreement".  This version of the backstop is initially seductive.  It seems to be a plausible solution to our immediate concerns about the Border on this island and about barriers to trade between Ireland and Britain.  However, is this just another version of the already rejected customs partnership or is the UK willing to remain within all of the rules and obligations that come with membership of the customs union, including the role of the European Court of Justice and annual payments to the EU?  If it is just another attempt to retain access to the customs area while negotiating trade deals outside of it, then it is not going to be acceptable.  If it means remaining genuinely inside the rules-based customs union, with all this implies, is it politically achievable within the UK?</p>  <p>  There is clearly political pressure within the UK Cabinet to make this a temporary arrangement, not a sustainable option.  There is also likely to be a legal impediment to the UK putting detail on future trade arrangements within the text of its exit agreement.  Everything keeps coming back to the international rule of law.  When we reach the June summit, the time is up for any further fudging of issues, prevarication or attempts to get a free pass into European free trade arrangements.  The Government must ensure that the UK is prepared to sign up to a legally-binding set of rules which outline in no uncertain terms how the Irish Border will remain open and frictionless.  A proposed UK-wide backstop that is not politically stable, and potentially not legally possible, is just not acceptable.  It does not provide sufficient security for Irish jobs and it does not give us the sustainable solution that is needed for the Border.  The Government must take a firm stand at this June summit.</p>  <p>  The UK is a trading nation.  It imports goods, not least food products from Ireland, and it exports services.  We have been told, again and again, that the UK wants frictionless free trade with the EU, but trade between countries requires shared rules and mechanisms to enforce those rules and to arbitrate between businesses and between national governments.  The UK is highly reliant on exporting complex services, not least financial services.</p><p>The World Trade Organization does not provide a sufficient set of rules to oversee this kind of trade.  The UK is either a member of the European rules-based order or it is not.  If the UK wants to trade across the European Union, it must agree to follow all the rules that come with access to that market.  The European Economic Area provides access to the Single Market for countries that remain outside the political union.  The EU's customs partnership with Turkey provides a template for trade in goods.</p> <p> We must also be clear with the British Government that it cannot use Ireland's concerns as leverage to get it a customs partnership which we have already determined is unworkable and not in our interests.  Prime Minister May has spoken on several occasions recently in defence of a rules-based international order.  The great irony is that the UK's exit from the European Union is a leading example of the breakdown in rules-based co-operation between countries.  It has unleashed an ideology that is totally out of step with a hard-won European and global rules-based regulated approach to trade.  After endless months of fudge, bluster and threat, the time has arrived for clarity.  Ireland must insist that clarity is provided before we move a step further.  Nothing less will suffice.</p></speech>

It is a good saying about accepting reality.  We accept the reality of the vote in the UK on Brexit.  Another reality, however, is that Northern Ireland did not vote to leave the EU; it voted to remain.  Despite of all the work, the endless hours and resources going into the negotiations, we do not know what the reality of Brexit will be for Ireland or Northern Ireland.  I am a member of the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement which hears many presentations from and meets individuals and organisations living and operating in the North, those in the so-called Border counties and from organisations whose work covers all 32 counties.  At our most recent meetings, we heard presentations from two academics which were particularly challenging and stimulating.</p>  <p>  One of the positive points they made was that many British MPs were not alive at the time of the Good Friday Agreement and are engaging with and learning about that agreement for the first time.  They also mentioned statements by the Prime Minister on upholding the agreement.  I asked about the degree to which Ireland depend on the EU to remain firm and strong on the Irish issues as it is now, particularly if one goes on the basis of what Michel Barnier is saying and doing.  I expressed a fear that when it comes to a final resolution between the EU and the UK, Ireland could be caught in the crossfire, especially in the context of business and finance.  Recent statistics on foreign direct investment into the UK are disturbing.  The reply I received to my question was to the effect that the language of the EU is getting stronger on Ireland.  We took great solace from that.  Those are positive points.</p>  <p>  The UK withdrawal, however, has the potential to disrupt the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and undermine the peace that Irish people have, with few exceptions, enjoyed for over 20 years.  To paraphrase one of the academics' points, the nature and effect of Brexit on the Good Friday Agreement will depend on how the processes of withdrawal and transition are managed, on arrangements for future relations between the EU and the UK and on how the parties to the Agreement work on responding to those issues and changes.  The relationship between Britain and Ireland is also of great importance.  That means real engagement and communication.</p>  <p>  The Border cannot be a dividing line between the Six Counties and the Twenty-six Counties. Many of us know what it was like to have a Border and many more know what it is like without one.  There is no doubt about which is the better option.  There has been agreement on free movement and avoiding a hardening of the Border but I am not sure that Britain is on the same page in respect of what it actually means and what it will take to avoid a hardening of the Border.  In spite of Teresa May's recent speech consistently putting the Good Friday Agreement at the heart of the UK's approach it is not clear how this will be done.  A broad position paper was released last August and there has been some rhetoric about commitments and North-South co-operation, an all-island economy and avoiding a hard border but it is short on realistic details and on how that can be achieved, whereas the EU at the very least has set out the minimum requirement for the UK to deliver on this.  We know about the backstop in the case that it will not be wonderful or satisfactory and we hope that will not happen.  It appears to some that what is envisaged for Ireland is a selective and lean version of the internal market.  If that is so, that protocol will fall far short of what political and business people have been calling for, namely, to have Northern Ireland remain in the Internal Market.</p>  <p>  In a letter of 26 August 2016, Arlene Foster and the late Martin McGuinness set out the ideal outcome and stated that there should be no friction on cross-Border trade and services, continued integration of EU skilled and unskilled workers and that all-Ireland energy and agriculture regimes should be protected.  The underlying assumption was that there would be minimal change in Northern Ireland as a result of Brexit but that appears to be less and less of a reality.  There is a divide between those who want Northern Ireland to be granted some form of special status and those who will not hear of it.  There is also the reality that there is no Government in Northern Ireland.  There are questions over the use of public money, the Conservative Party is dependent on the Democratic Unionist Party, DUP, and there is infighting and disagreement within the Conservative and Labour parties.  There is a middle ground in Northern Ireland and 47% of those who occupy it say they are neither unionist nor nationalist.</p>  <p>  This day last week was the 44th anniversary of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.  Many of us were on Talbot Street on the day.  The campaigners and relatives are still waiting for the truth despite all the D&aacute;il motions and parliamentary questions.  I fear that following the UK withdrawal those legacy issues will be further down the list of priorities.</p></speech>

In the week when we celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement referendum, it is worth noting that the most recent survey shows that people in the North now more passionately oppose Brexit than they did even at the 2016 referendum.  This week the British Minister of State for Immigration told the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee that she has not even read the Good Friday Agreement.  She was there specifically to discuss Brexit and talk about what her Department was doing on Brexit in the context of Northern Ireland.  This is astounding stuff but it is only one small example.</p><p>The former Northern Ireland Secretary, Owen Paterson, a Conservative MP, and the Sammy Wilson, MP, of the DUP published a jointly written article in last Monday's <i>Daily Telegraph</i>in which they argue that re-establishing the Border will not be an issue.  Without any recourse to facts or reality they accuse political leaders on this island and anti Brexiteers in Britain of exploiting fantasies about the Irish Border.  They base this on their extraordinary discovery that &quot;There is a border: it hasn't gone away.&quot;  Yes, of course there is a Border.  It is there because there are two jurisdictions on this island.  There are separate legal, criminal justice and healthcare systems.  There are separate political and governmental administrations.  Did this news seriously come as a shock to a DUP MP and a former Northern Ireland Secretary?  Yes, there is a Border but it is as soft a border as possible.  There are no checkpoints, there is no border infrastructure and there are no military installations.  It is no longer a border that is patrolled on both sides with a heavy customs, police and armed military presence.</p><p>While Mr. Wilson and Mr. Paterson may not understand the difference between the two situations, I can assure them that I and my constituents do.  We know it based on experience.  We know what was there before and we know that we do not wish to travel one single step back towards that horrible and tragic past.  We know that the Chief Constable of the PSNI has warned of his fears and concerns at the prospect of any return to a harder border.  We know that the Good Friday Agreement was concerned with breaking down borders and that it did that by creating the political conditions that allowed both the removal of the border infrastructure on the ground and diminishing the border attitudes in people's minds.  The communities on both sides of the Border, where I live, no longer live with their backs to each other, as my colleague, Deputy Breathnach has often said.</p><p>People now live their lives together across the Border and not in separate silos on either side of it.  That progress took time.  It took decades of hard work and trust-building.  In their excellent presentation to the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, Professor David Phinnemore and Dr. Katy Hayward of Queen's University Belfast pointed out that much of the history of the European Union entails devising innovative solutions to cross-border problems.</p> <p> Brexit attempts to undo this progress and set the clock back on this island.  Both Professor Phinnemore and Dr. Hayward said that the success of the Good Friday Agreement has centred on viewing the Irish Border, and Northern Ireland more broadly, as a point of contact between Britain and Ireland and not a dividing line between them.  Therein lies the path to finding a way through the Brexit dilemma Britain has foisted upon us.  I refer to the British Government and the political establishment at Westminster,  That establishment includes the British Labour Party, which has become a passive enabler of Brexit, although I welcome Mr. Corbyn's long overdue visit to Northern Ireland today.  We need to impress upon them that the Irish Border and Northern Ireland could and should become the positive point of contact - the interface - not just between Britain and Ireland but between Britain and the European Union.  If the happens, then perhaps the people that I represent can have some hope of safeguarding and ensuring the hard won progress of the last two decades.</p> <p> I will address the remarks of Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan on the horrible atrocities in Dublin and Monaghan on 17 May 1974.  It is appalling that the British Government has failed to respond to the three unanimous requests from this House in 2008, 2011 and 2016.  We asked the British Government to give an eminent international legal person access to all papers and files pertaining to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.  While visiting Westminster last week, I had the opportunity to raise this matter with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Ms Karen Bradley.  Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan, Deputy Crowe, a few others and I have been constant advocates on this issue, along with other constituency colleagues.  We ask the Minister of State to impress upon the Government the need to ensure that this particular issue is kept to the forefront of the agenda in all discussions between the two Governments.  The British Government's total dismissal of the unanimous views of our Parliament on the awful atrocity in 1974 is appalling and reprehensible.</p></speech>

I want to take that opportunity.  This morning, I was watching a YouTube video of an interview that the BBC did last night with Mr. Steve Bannon.  It was a fascinating 25-minute video in which he set out the case for economic nationalism and trumpeted the Trump regime as having delivered higher rates of employment to the black and Mexican communities than has ever been the case in the history of the United States.  Mr. Bannon also set out how that economic nationalism was a response - which it is - to the crash of 2008 and the sense of the unfairness regarding globalisation.  I refer to this weird inversion that has occurred whereby the Republican Party in the US now represents - if we are to believe Mr. Bannon - the working class and the Democrats represent the cosmopolitan elite.</p>  <p>  On Brexit, similarly, the Tories are getting their votes in working class areas whereas the Labour Party is getting its votes in cosmopolitan Islington and so on.  If we delve down there is an absolute fallacy in Steve Bannon's rhetoric.  In the United States in the past year, wages grew by 2.6% while corporate profits rose by 26% - ten times higher.  There is a fundamental injustice in the world of globalisation. We have seen it in the last 25 or 30 years.  The share of wealth that has gone to labour has been too low and that needs to change.  The share that has gone to retained earnings and to capital is too high and that also needs to change.</p>  <p>  I do not believe, however, that economic nationalism - and a retreat to nationalism - is the solution to that problem.  It is because of that type of thinking that we find ourselves engaged in this debate on Brexit.  That thinking is happening behind the scenes and it is creating the environment for this crisis.  Meanwhile, the UK Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Boris Johnson, is in Peru.  He practically has one of those feathered jungle hats on and he is lauding the possibility of a free trade agreement.  Is the Ceann Comhairle disagreeing with my disparaging comments about the British Foreign Secretary?</p></speech>

There is a subterfuge happening in those arguments both in Britain and America.  The Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, and the T&aacute;naiste and Minister of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, have been very useful in these Brexit events.  I am not sure whose analysis it was - it may have been that of Patricia King - but there is a view that the problem we are seeing in the emerging Brexit deal, including in the draft withdrawal agreement, is that it is weakest in protecting workers' rights and environmental rights.  I do not know if the Minister of State would agree but that seems to be one of the problems that has been identified.</p>  <p>  I fear the British will not agree to any deal and will crash out of the EU as a result.  Even if they get their extended "pretended" arrangement, which seems now to be their latest withdrawal from their red-line positions, they still have to get over the hurdle of agreeing governance mechanisms in any withdrawal agreement.  The European Court of Justice clearly must have a central position in any such agreement.  I fear that Mr. Johnson and his 30 or 50 hard Brexiteer colleagues in the Tory Party will not accept that and Britain will crash out rather than swallow the final bitter pill of what, for them, will be a very weak Brexit withdrawal agreement.</p>  <p>  We have to place ourselves in that context.  To a certain extent, whatever we stand up for in the context of any arrangement should not just relate to the nature of any deal relating to our Border.  We have to stand up to the ultimate fallacy that the response to the inequities and unfairness to which globalisation gives rise lies in a retreat to a nationalism.  What we must do is change the system of globalisation in order to ensure that it is fairer and that it ensures that there will be shared workers' rights across the world and that environmental standards will be upheld.  We do not want chlorinated chicken shipped in from the United States, Peru or wherever as a response to the inequities of globalisation.  That is where I think Brexit is going and that is the fundamental weakness in it.</p>  <p>  Politically, where do we stand?  We are one of the countries that probably benefits the most from globalisation because we are one of the most globalised, most trading and most open countries in the context of international investment, especially from the United States.  We are in a particularly important and difficult position.  Our position should be based on that wider perspective.  We should be setting really high standards for a new globalisation to answer Mr. Bannon, Mr. Johnson and company.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-05-24a.283" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1222" speakername="R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall" time="15:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018052400032#HH00700"><p>When we had statements in the House last November, I asked the T&aacute;naiste for his assessment of the likelihood of a no-deal Brexit and the contingency plans that were being put in place in the event of that happening.  Six months have passed and it has to be said that we have no further clarity on what the UK will propose as its alternative solution to the so called backstop agreement from December.  It is now almost two years since the United Kingdom voted to leave the EU.  There is still no clarity at this stage on the status of the Border.  That is quite frankly, farcical.  I do not blame the T&aacute;naiste for this situation.  It seems, however, that the entire process is being held at the mercy of infighting between the deluded and the disillusioned in the Conservative Party.</p>  <p>  I note that the Taoiseach and the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, met Prime Minister May in Sofia last week and that the talks harkened to some new thinking on the part of the British Government regarding the customs arrangement for Northern Ireland.</p><p><i>4 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p> <p>If this new thinking mirrors the reports that were highlighted in some quarters of the English press last week, we may be even less further on in negotiations than we realised previously.  According to reports in <i>The Telegraph </i>last week, there is now a grudging acceptance within the hardline Brexit faction of the Conservative Party that the UK may need to remain in the customs union beyond 2020 but this is only to allow the technology that would allow for a barrier-free border to be refined, the so-called &quot;max fac&quot; approach.  The other alternative apparently being considered is a customs partnership whereby the UK would act as the EU's tax collector.  The fact that the UK cabinet is still even entertaining the idea that these solutions are workable should be ringing alarm bells for the Government and for Brussels.  Both of these solutions have already been dismissed and the Government and the EU need to emphasise this point emphatically to London and that the December 2017 backstop agreement is the only game in town.<br/><br/>The three objectives set out by Prime Minister May are a clear example of the &quot;having one's cake and eating it&quot; attitude that has dominated the UK's approach to these negotiations from the outset.  The objectives are: Britain should have its own trade policy with the rest of the world independent of the collective deals that other EU states enjoy; despite this Britain should have frictionless trade with the EU; and there are no borders between the UK and Ireland.  These aims are not only incompatible with leaving the Single Market and customs union but they are also internally inconsistent.  How can the UK hope to maintain frictionless trade within the EU with an open border with Ireland?  How can the UK hope to retain this frictionless trade without paying into the EU budgets?  Why would the UK believe that the EU should allow a former member unfettered access to the Internal Market while simultaneously negotiating preferential trade deals with non-member states?<br/><br/>The transition period is expected to end in December 2020.  While, technically, it may be possible to extend this, why would the Irish Government agree to this if we are simply being strung along, as the Conservative Party would argue, over decisions we have already stated are unacceptable?  A sense of unreality seems to permeate the UK's approach to these talks.  I would strongly urge the Government to make it clear that the time for prevarication is over.  We can no longer wait for a plan.  I note that after the meeting in Bulgaria, the Taoiseach expected the UK would table a new customs proposal in two weeks.  We can only hope we are not still discussing it in another six months but my fear is that we will be.</p></speech>

We were told in December that the agreement reached on the Border was "bullet-proof" and "cast-iron", but it and the backstop, nevertheless, remain the biggest hurdles in the negotiations.  We were told by the T&aacute;naiste, I am sure in good faith, that issues would be resolved by the June European Council but it now looks like there will be no progress until at least October.  The solutions put forward by the UK so far are unworkable and, as a party, we will not countenance any sort of Border, technological or otherwise.</p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il has repeatedly called for Northern Ireland to be designated as a special economic zone.  It would help mitigate some of the worst effects of Brexit if that happened.  Fianna F&aacute;il is broadly supportive of the Government's stance on Brexit.  However, we have a genuine concern that there is a level of complacency in our approach to preparing for Brexit domestically.</p>  <p>  Given the infighting within the UK Tory Government, we cannot take anything for granted and we must be prepared for all scenarios, as the Minister of State will be aware.  An AIB survey showed that only 6% of small and medium enterprises in the Republic have a formal plan to deal with Brexit.  This is a matter of serious concern to me and to the people in my part of the country.  There are a great number of small businesses, including many agrifood businesses mainly selling into England, Scotland and Northern Ireland.  They are fearful about what will happen in terms of Brexit and that if there is a change with respect to the Border, it will create serious difficulties. </p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il very much welcomes and acknowledges the solidarity shown to us by other EU member states and the EU negotiation team led by Michel Barnier on the Border issue.  However, significant challenges remain to be overcome and serious risks remain.  There is no room for complacency in this regard.</p>  <p>  While we are broadly supportive of the Government's international response to Brexit, we are concerned that Ireland may be losing traction on the Border.  It is therefore imperative that the Government pushes for and secures sufficient progress on this by the next European Council in June.  Ireland's unique circumstances must remain central in the negotiations ahead.  We cannot let the Border issue slip down the agenda.  The phase 1 agreement reached in December was sold to us by the Government as "bullet-proof" and "cast-iron" but the reality, as the Minister of State is aware, is that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed and there is no agreement yet between the EU and UK on the issue of the Irish Border.</p>  <p>  Regarding the domestic scene, the message needs to go out that whatever the outcome of Brexit will be, there will be changes to our trading relationship and although we do not know the extent of those changes, this reality must be faced.  On 29 March 2019, the UK will become a third country and will no longer be a member of the European Union.  While a transition agreement has been agreed, in principle, it is dependent on the withdrawal agreement being reached in 2018.  That time is short and this transition period is due to end on 30 December 2020.  Change is coming down the tracks and we need to prepare.</p></speech>

We should not panic.  We need to be absolutely assured that the EU is conducting its negotiations in the proper fashion because the EU's future is at stake.  The bottom line is that if this goes wrong, and it will not, the entire European Union will crumble within five or seven years.  We should recognise that.</p>  <p>  The UK authorities know full well that this was not about a minor border issue or anything else.  This is a wider issue that they have in mind.  They have spoken about the benefits of bilateral arrangements.  We all know that the small country comes off worst in such bilateral arrangements.  That has always been the case.  People will want to go back to the good old days, and perhaps they are deluding themselves, but there is another issue.  We want to be careful not to assume that we are losing ground because we cannot lose ground.  The European Union negotiators have in their sights what is needed, and they know what is needed.  They know that to move one iota from that will result in a serious problem not only for this country, the island of Ireland and the peace agreement but for the EU itself.  It will be only a matter of time before various other countries decide to pick away at the bricks and eventually we will have nothing.  However, that will not happen, nor should it happen.</p>  <p>  I will give examples to support that theory.  For the past 20 years on this island of Ireland we have had a single market and no Border.  We have not had friction of any description and we have worked well together as an island community.  It is essential that we continue in that vein.  It is essential that our Government represents the views of both sides of the community in Northern Ireland, including the commercial side, the business sector and the agricultural sector.  That is of huge importance to both communities on this island.</p>  <p>  We hear rumours every day about negotiations being dragged out over a number of years.  That will not happen because it cannot happen.  If it were to happen we would have a gradual erosion, which would eventually end up whichever way the UK authorities want it to happen in the end.  </p>  <p>  Regarding the question of contingency plans to make preparations in the event of something happening, we need to be very careful about those things.  The UK authorities would like to see border posts put in place just in case.  However, they would then become a reality.  They would like to see various provisions made now in the event of something happening.  That would then become the agreement at a later stage and we would not be able to renegotiate it. </p><p> I congratulate the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste, the Government and the members of the Opposition on the level of solidarity they have shown in respect of this issue.  It is an imperative to which we must adhere.  It is important for this country, North and South, it is important for the European Union and it is important for this Parliament.</p> <p> I will conclude by saying this: we need to proceed as we are doing and continue from where we started.  We need to ensure that the European Union continues on its current path.  I congratulate Mr. Michel Barnier and his fellow negotiators on the level of knowledge they have shown so far and on the interest they have taken in this island nation.  Of course, they realise full well the nature of the ultimate objective.</p> <p> The Good Friday Agreement is the finest agreement ever achieved on this island, economically, politically and socially.  The EU is the biggest single peace agreement that the Continent of Europe has experienced in 1,000 years.  We should never forget that.  We are intrinsically linked to the European Union and its future.  If the UK decides it wants to go away from that and become a third country, an international power like in the old days, that is fine.  However, the rules must apply.  There are rules that are not helpful to third countries.  We know that and the British know it too.  I will simply say that there are people in the UK who have campaigned vigorously over the past 20 years to undermine the European Union.  I refer to Nigel Farage and others.  Some people who are totally opposed to the European Union have got to positions of power and authority in the UK.  We hope they realise that what they are doing is not in the interests of either the UK or Europe.</p></speech>

I will start by agreeing with Deputy Lisa Chambers in that we are very lucky to have such a wonderful team working with us and on our behalf at the Irish Embassy in Brussels.  We also have great people at all of our embassies throughout the remainder of the EU and across the various Departments here.  Like all of us in this House, those to whom I refer are under no illusion regarding the challenges we face with Brexit and they are working towards the best possible outcome for Ireland.</p>  <p>  As the T&aacute;naiste stated earlier, the Government is continuing to engage intensively with the EU task force and our EU partners with a view to achieving the necessary progress in advance of the June European Council meeting.  However, it is important for our EU partners to hear such a clear expression of Ireland's priorities from across the whole political spectrum.  In that context, I thank all of the Deputies for their contributions.  The overwhelming sense of concern shared by everyone in Ireland regarding the challenges posed by Brexit, allied with the exceptionally high and growing support for Ireland's membership of the EU, has certainly struck a chord with many of our EU partners.  This reflects the fact that a key pillar of the Government's response to Brexit has been to underline a firm commitment to the EU membership and to work together with our EU 27 partners to build a very positive future for the European Union.  In that regard, I very much welcome the opportunity that I had two weeks ago - on the occasion of Europe Day - to address this House and the Seanad on Ireland's wider EU priorities.  I also welcome the citizens' dialogue on the future of Europe, which has enabled the Government, the people of this country and Deputies to engage with people of all ages and from all sectors in order hear their views about the Union and its future direction.</p>  <p>  I attended the General Affairs Council last week with the T&aacute;naiste and I fully echo his reflections from earlier this afternoon.  Michel Barnier and our fellow EU member states remain fully behind the principles that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed and that negotiations can only progress as long as all commitments undertaken so far are respected in full.  That is certainly reflected in my own engagement with European colleagues from France, Sweden, Estonia and recently Greece and Latvia.  To answer Deputy Cullinane's question on what we want to see from the June meeting of the European Council, I note that the EU, Ireland and all of us are very firmly of the view that significant progress is needed on the outstanding issues relating to the withdrawal agreement in advance of the meeting.  While we can discuss the future arrangement and while we wish to hear discussions on it, the withdrawal agreement is first and foremost in our minds.  This not only includes the draft protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, it also deals with other issues that are of fundamental importance, namely, the overall governance of the withdrawal agreement.</p>  <p>  There has been a very strong message of support for the approach being taken by Michel Barnier and the task force.  There is a very clear recognition on the part of the EU partners that, regardless of any evolving proposals in the context of a wider future relationship agreement, a workable version of the backstop must be included in the withdrawal agreement.  The T&aacute;naiste has said that the UK has agreed that a backstop solution for the Border will and must form part of the legal text of the withdrawal agreement.  The issues identified in the draft protocol, as proposed by the EU, will be addressed in delivering a legally sound solution to the Border.</p>  <p>  The UK has not yet officially put forward any alternative proposals.  Although since meeting with Prime Minister May last week we have heard some more detailed proposals, we need to see these put forward in a satisfactory way.  It is vital at this stage of the process that the UK engages in more detailed and realistic ways in the draft text of the protocol on Northern Ireland, particularly in dealing with the backstop.</p>  <p>  I will be travelling with the Taoiseach to the European Council in June, which will return, in particular, to the remaining withdrawal issues, including the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, with a view to assessing whether satisfactory progress has been made or, if not, what consequences it will have for the overall negotiations given the timeframe we find ourselves facing.  This Government looks forward to further engagement with this House in advance of and after that meeting.  I certainly look forward to the continuing support of all of the Members of this House.  We all strive for the best outcome for the people of Ireland and for those we represent.  That means avoiding a border on the island of Ireland, protecting the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement and ensuring as little disruption as possible to the lives of our citizens and to the trade and business on this entire island.</p></speech>

He has argued very strongly that communication makes sense.  He made that argument when it was put to him, for example, that Ireland should be questioning its relationship with Saudi Arabia in light of the total destruction that state is causing in Yemen.  He argues that it is better to keep dialogue open in order to communicate.  The position was similar regarding the Israeli ambassador after the slaughter in Palestine recently when unarmed innocent protestors were shot dead.  It was horrific.  However, the Minister stresses the need for communication.</p>  <p>  It beggars belief that we do not have an embassy in Tehran.  Deputy Clare Daly and I visited Iran last year.  We were asked to speak at a Palestinian conference there.  I was hugely impressed by the country and the people.  They are amazing, beautiful people.  They want to do business with Ireland.  In the 12 months prior to 1 May, we sold &euro;140 million worth of exports to Iran.  That makes sense, but we could be doing so much more.  Iran has a population of 80 million.  They want to do more business with us.  For example, we do not buy any beef from Iran.  That is madness.  Iranians want to buy our beef.  Not only do they want beef for themselves but they do an awful lot of business with countries in the region.  If they were to establish strong links with Ireland in the beef trade, they could sell Irish beef to the countries around them, quite apart from what they would consume themselves with a growing and developing population of 80 million.  Iran is going to become one of the fastest-developing countries in Asia.  It has the second largest economy in the Middle East.</p><p>One of the main reasons we are not doing more business with Iran is that we are scared the Americans will not want us to do so.  There is a very good reason the Americans do not want us to do business with it.  They have a problem with the fact they do not control business interests in Iran.  America would do all kinds of things to make sure it can open avenues for its business interests.  The nullifying of the nuclear agreement recently by Trump is linked to this and it is not something that European countries were in favour of.  All the European countries criticised Trump for breaking the nuclear deal with Iran because there was no evidence whatsoever that Iran had broken the agreement.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, would agree with me and he was not in favour of what Trump did.  Is there a prospect in the near future that we will come to our senses and reopen our embassy in Teheran in the interests of both sides, Ireland and Iran?</p></speech>

Ireland's diplomatic and consular network is at the forefront of efforts to promote our political and economic interests and values and provide important services to the Irish people and business community.  At present, there are 80 embassies, consulates, and representative offices In our global diplomatic network.</p>  <p>  Ireland is one of six EU member states that does not currently have resident missions in Iran.  At the moment, the embassy of Ireland in Ankara is accredited on a non-residential basis to Iran.  The ambassador of Ireland in Ankara travels regularly to Iran in support of our broad policy objectives, including the development of political relations, trade relations and supporting the needs of Irish businesses operating or hoping to operate there.  Ireland is also represented in Iran by an honorary consul.  Honorary consuls are an important element of the State&rsquo;s global engagement and provide consular services and assistance, as well as a range of other supports to citizens and to the embassy in Ankara.  Honorary consular representation is, of course, of a fundamentally different nature to diplomatic representation and I do not consider it to be a substitute for a resident diplomatic presence.</p>  <p>  A range of factors are taken into account, as the Deputy knows, in considering our diplomatic representation overseas, including our national political, economic and trade priorities, as well as the availability of resources.  The Government is, of course, conscious of the political, economic and trade factors that might warrant the opening of a resident diplomatic mission in Iran, as in a number of other countries.  As the Deputy has pointed out, Iran is an important local and regional power as well as a large potential market.  However, resource constraints do not allow us to have resident representation in all the locations that might objectively justify it having regard to all of those factors.</p>  <p>  More broadly, the configuration and scale of Ireland's diplomatic network is kept under constant review.  Last year, the Taoiseach announced the Government&rsquo;s Global Footprint initiative to double our global impact and secure our international influence.  On foot of this, work has already begun on the initial phase of the expansion of Ireland&rsquo;s diplomatic network, which includes the Government decision to open new embassies in Santiago in Chile, Bogot&aacute; in Colombia, Amman in Jordan and Wellington in New Zealand, and new consulates general in Vancouver in Canada and Mumbai in India.  These new offices will open later this year and in 2019.</p>  <p>  It is important to stress, and the Deputy raised this, that the closure of the embassy in Teheran was not related to the then nuclear dispute.  The Government was greatly disappointed by the US announcement that it is withdrawing from the nuclear arrangement with Iran.  Ireland and our EU partners, and a very broad spectrum of international opinion, have made clear that we believe the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, JCPOA, was a significant diplomatic achievement and that all parties to it should continue to implement it in full.  We share many of the concerns which the US has expressed about other aspects of Iranian policy but, as the Deputy rightly pointed out, the way to address these is not to move away from one area where significant positive progress has been made, and that remains very much our view.</p>  <p>  The EU signatories to the agreement and other parties have already held initial meetings with Iran to discuss the possibility of continuing to implement the agreement, and Ireland will fully support that objective, although the difficulties should not be underestimated.</p>  <p>  As mentioned, the question of reopening the embassy will be kept under consideration by the Government and I can confirm that the question of the reopening of the embassy will form part of considerations in the Global Footprint 2025 initiative and will be taken fully into account in ongoing work to the 2025 deadline.</p></speech>

We opened an embassy in Teheran in 1976 and we had one there until November or December 2011 when Eamon Gilmore was the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.  We also closed the embassy to the Holy See and one other embassy at the time.  In total, three embassies were closed.  We argued that we closed them for money-saving reasons.  It was not a great argument, but it was some argument given that so many less well-off people in Ireland were being put through austerity and there was some case to be made.  The Government now boasts that we have one of the fastest growing economies in Europe so that argument is gone.  The truth is that exports to Iran have doubled in the past 12 months to &euro;140 million from &euro;70 million and the Iranians have worked really hard to increase trade.</p>  <p>  It is a no-brainer.  The Government is in favour of communication but the Iranians would argue there is not enough communication or dialogue, and there is huge potential for it.  As far as I am concerned, the Americans have lost the plot in the entire region for a long period of time.  They have destabilised the region in a dramatic way.  Iran and Syria are two of the few countries they do not actually control.  American pressure should not be an influencing factor for us.</p>  <p>  I was in Malawi recently.  I went out to a refugee camp and some prisons out there.  I met Gerry Cunningham, the Irish ambassador.  I did not go there to see what the Irish were doing, but it was very interesting and the work they are doing is very impressive.  It was very commendable.  It makes so much sense for Ireland to be involved in such places.  Malawi is one of the poorest nations on the planet.  I agree 100% with us working with them, but likewise it is a no-brainer that we should be working with Iran.</p></speech>

Iran is a very important regional actor.  We want to understand their policies and influence them, but there are also a number of strongly negative aspects to Iranian's actions.  These include regional conflicts, missile development and human rights issues.  Iran's role in Syria and its support for the Assad regime has prolonged the conflict there.  While these aspects do not preclude us from looking at reopening the embassy, they have to be recognised.  I agree that on the economic front Iran is very clearly an expanding and growing economy, and the Government recognises there is potential there not just for engagement, but also export and import potential for Irish business, but it cannot be understated that Iran remains complex and difficult, and the market there remains complex and difficult to operate in.</p></speech>

We will continue.</p><p>I am glad to have an opportunity to discuss this issue.  It came out of parliamentary questions to the Minister, Deputy Creed.</p><p>The questions from me to the Minister, Deputy Creed, came from a number of small farmers who contacted me about this matter of animal welfare.  They described this as a deplorable situation, which, if it is not resolved, could threaten the future of small farms in Ireland.<br/><br/>I have been told the national bovine viral diarrhoea, BVD, eradication programme is industry-led and delivered by Animal Health Ireland.  It was introduced in 2012 and became compulsory in 2013 through legislation, requiring all animals born on or after 1 January 2013 to be tested for the presence of the BVD virus.  If the animals are found to be persistently infected, PI, they can be disposed of.  I have the figures for each year from 2014.<br/><br/>What are the problems causing all the concern, as initially it seemed to tick all the boxes?  The first question is, in what sense is it industry-led?  It would appear that industry in this case does not refer to farmers but rather companies that are getting funding and making money.  That should be cleared up.  Animal Health Ireland introduced the BVD programme in 2012 as a voluntary process and I understand 10% of Irish farmers participated initially.  I might represent Dublin Central but I know the welfare of animals is the top priority of farmers; it is their livelihood.  If this was to improve animal welfare, why was it not immediately taken up by many more farmers?  It appears, because it was not taken up, that Animal Health Ireland enlisted the help of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, which introduced legislation very quickly to make it compulsory.  There is again a question as to what engagement the Department had with farmers on this.<br/><br/>The Minister of State should also comment on what I am told is a naming and shaming system for farm families if a calf tests positive, as all the information is available.  There are questions about Animal Health Ireland.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is well-staffed and it might have dealt with this.  I believe &euro;2 million was given to the organisation for this programme.  It is also a lucrative business for the two pharmaceutical companies that manufacture and sell the BVD vaccination.  In February 2018, the <i>Veterinary Ireland Journal</i>published an article where Animal Health Ireland and Veterinary Ireland announced a proposal submitted to a rural development programme and a grant of &euro;6 million to keep the BVD and other programmes.  It gives the impression that this is for the farmers in the form of an advisory service for vets.<br/><br/>Another reply I received indicated that the control of BVD is vital because the condition compromises the immune response capability of animals and control of BVD will bring overall health benefits to the national herd.  Looking at the statistics, there is an impressive reduction in the number of PI animals from 2013.  In 2017 the infection rate was 0.1% and to date in 2018, it is 0.04%, suggesting that the eradication programme has been successful in bringing about a major reduction in the number of PI animals being born.  The anomaly appears to be with the other aspect of BVD control dealing with overall health benefits.  The next statistic indicates there were over 247,000 animal deaths in 2013.  This increased the following year, then there was a drop, an increase, a further increase and, in 2017, the number is still over 260,000.  In 2011, before the BVD programme, the number was 215,000.  Whereas BVD is being eliminated, the other health benefits supposed to come from it are not happening.  The data does not capture the causes of animal deaths and in the reply I received, I was told the cost of finding those would be prohibitive.  The Department is funding a programme which it argues brings two benefits but only one benefit can be seen.  Surely there is a need for a cost-benefit analysis of the money to determine its best use.</p></speech>

If the response does not answer some of the questions asked, I will certainly bring this back to the Minister and relay the concerns to him.</p>  <p>  The bovine viral diarrhoea, BVD, eradication programme undertaken by Animal Health Ireland was developed following an extensive consultation exercise.  Animal Health Ireland was assisted in the work by the BVD implementation group comprising its own personnel, Veterinary Ireland nominees, farmer representatives and representatives of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  The implementation group was guided by a technical working group of academics and scientists in deciding programme measures.  There has been strong input from industry stakeholders, including farmers, since the programme inception, with 91 meetings of the BVD implementation group having taken place.</p>  <p>  A voluntary programme was introduced in 2012 and this became compulsory on 1 January 2013.  The national compulsory BVD eradication programme came in on 1 January 2013 and from that date it has been a statutory requirement to test all calves and there has been a ban on the sale of calves without a negative result.  The Department offers strong support to the BVD eradication programme and provides four Department staff who have manned the BVD helpline since the inception of the compulsory eradication programme in 2013.  In addition, Department local offices operate the herd restriction system.</p>  <p>  Progress to date under the BVD eradication programme has been excellent, as the Deputy points out, and a very high percentage of herds comply with the requirement to test their calves.  The incidence of persistently infected, PI, animals has fallen each year from 0.66 % in 2013, where 13,877 animals tested positive for BVD, to 0.1% in 2017, where 2,390 tested positive.  It is a significant drop.  The incidence in 2018 has fallen further to 0.05%, where only 901 have tested positive to date.  Relative to the position before the programme commenced, it is estimated the reduction in prevalence has generated a net benefit to industry in 2017 alone of &euro;75 million.</p>  <p>  One matter that hampered progress in the early years of the eradication programme related to the retention of PI calves.  At the request of the BVD implementation group, herds retaining PI animals were restricted and the notification of neighbouring herds in a small number of cases became necessary in order to bring about early disposal of PI animals.  Financial supports towards the early removal of persistently infected animals have played an important role in bringing about reduced incidence of the disease.  It should be noted that improvements have been made in the BVD financial supports available for animals born in 2017 and 2018, with a significantly higher amount available for early disposal.  Financial supports were made available for dairy herds for the first time, including payment in respect of dairy crosses and dairy bulls.</p>  <p>  The supports available in 2017 are as follows.  For beef herds, a payment of &euro;185 will be available if the animal is removed within 21 days of the first positive or inconclusive test and a payment of &euro;60 is available if the calf is removed between day 22 and 35 of the initial positive or inconclusive test.  For dairy herds, a payment of &euro;150 is available if the female dairy and dairy cross calves are removed within 21 days of the first positive or inconclusive test and a payment of &euro;35 is available if the female dairy and dairy cross calves are removed between day 22 and day 25 of the first positive or inconclusive test.  A payment of &euro;30 is available towards the cost of disposal of the dairy bull calves within 21 days of the first positive or inconclusive test.  Payments in respect of animals born in 2017 are being processed at present, with the bulk of payments made this week.</p>  <p>  I thank Animal Health Ireland, the BVD implementation group and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine for the excellent progress made in the eradication of BVD from the Irish herd.</p></speech>

If Animal Health Ireland is to have any credibility in continuing the programme as it is, the elimination of the virus from animals should see a corresponding reduction in farm deaths rather than the increases borne out in statistics.</p>  <p>  We know the BVD virus compromises animal immune response and overall health, weakening the animal's ability to fight infection.  Eliminating BVD should see major benefits overall so if these do not come about, one must ask questions about the credibility of Animal Health Ireland.  Is it just an example of an unnecessary quango?  That is not to mention the lucrative business for pharmaceutical companies providing the vaccine.  Are these people getting funding for something that is not really working in the ways it should?  It comes back to a cost-benefit analysis and getting factual information from all farmers.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State mentioned extensive consultations and alarm bells always ring with me when I hear that phrase.  I always wonder how extensive are those extensive consultations.  I stress that small farmers were in touch with me about the animal welfare aspect of this matter, so what farmers were consulted?  Perhaps there is a need to get some more real facts from those who are most affected.</p></speech>

It is one on which the Minister of State, Deputy English, has been pressed locally and voiced his support.  I thank my colleague, Deputy Shane Cassells, who has raised the matter regularly at the Committee of Public Accounts.  The fact that Deputy Cassells has raised the matter at the PAC has put the whole subject into the minds of the people of County Meath.  Certainly, many constituents have contacted me about it.</p>  <p>  Many people have moved into County Meath.  We still call people who moved there 20 years ago "new people".  One of the first things they ask me having moved to places like Stamullin or Ashbourne is why the county has no parks department.  They notice that there is a lower level of services in Meath than in Dublin.  I suspect the Ceann Comhairle hears similar complaints from people in Kildare who have also made the move from Dublin.</p></speech>

I note to the Minister of State that there is a parks department in Kildare.  It makes my point even stronger.  Meath is bottom of the table when it comes to Government funding.  The average <i>per capita</i>amount is &euro;522 and that has been the case for years.  It is not just a recent phenomenon and things are getting worse.  I compare the &euro;522 we get per head to the &euro;1,388 Dublin city gets.  Leitrim enjoys a spend of &euro;1,115.  In the counties surrounding Meath, the figures are as follows.  The amount in Louth is &euro;517 per person with a much smaller road network and the population is concentrated to a great extent in two urban areas.  Westmeath has a population which is similarly concentrated in two large urban areas and the funding there is &euro;750 per person.  It is a bit less in Kildare, albeit still higher than Meath, at &euro;639.  The commuter belt is getting less money from the Department.  That needs to change.</p><p>The population in these areas continues to expand and the problem is going to get worse.  The Minister of State can see the building all around our county and the way in which the council struggles to provide the services the public expects from a local authority.  The county council is struggling to provide a park in Ashbourne due to lack of resources.  In Stamullin, the county council is struggling to provide a playground and it has taken a long time to provide a link road from Bettystown to Laytown.  The facilities provided and the level of maintenance which takes place are not the same as one sees in other counties.  Winter gritting is another classic example.  For many years, someone travelling from Louth through Meath to Cavan would find the Meath stretch had not been gritted.  All of the main roads in rural north Dublin near Ashbourne and Garristown are gritted, but the continued stretches of those roads into Meath are not because the council simply cannot afford it.</p><p>There must be a shift in mindset.  The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has changed the way it allocates sports grants to counties which means those with larger populations get more money.  I welcome that.  It is essential that we get facilities.  That practice will have to be matched by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  Luckily, the Minister of State, Deputy English, is at the coalface in the Department.  I welcome that.  He is working hard.  However, this is something that must be addressed.</p><p>Meath County Council has long had the additional challenge of not having a massive rates base.  I must acknowledge that there has been a complete shift in that local authority as to where its priorities should lie.  While it performs the traditional functions of a local authority, it also focuses heavily on attracting industry to the area.  I was in Dunboyne today where it was wonderful to see construction well under way at Shire and the Facebook data centre.  Indeed, the Avoca restaurant construction is also under way.  That is the type of industry Meath County Council is trying to attract to provide jobs and crucial rates income.  However, that activity must be matched by the Government if our citizens in Meath, who pay very high property taxes, are to get the services they deserve.</p></speech>

This situation has obtained for a long number of years and I am glad to have the chance to discuss solutions in the House.  The Deputy is absolutely right about the base level of funding per head of population and that Meath is not getting its fair share.  As I said when I was in opposition over many years, this is an issue which must be resolved.  In my time as a Minister of State in my current Department and in the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the Department of Education and Skills my focus has been on trying to close this funding gap.  The Deputy is right that we have to do it because we need a greater share of money in the county to provide parks and other services.  Thankfully, a review is on the way which will give us the opportunity to do that.</p>  <p>  When one analyses the population data, the difficulty one sees is the massive population increase in Meath between 1996 to 2006.  In Meath's own submission to our Department, this was flagged.  On my first day in the Department, I told officials that the funding Meath County Council was getting was not enough and had to be changed.  Everyone in the Department agrees that is a fair assessment on the basis of the population.  The huge increase in the population took place between 1996 and 2006.  During that period, Meath's population grew by 30% above the national average.  I remember trying to convince Governments at the time that Meath was not getting its fair share.  Those Governments were not led by my party.  When I took office, the budgets were not there due to massive funding decreases and the money was not there to correct that situation.  In the last couple of years, however, we have been changing that.  With increasing resources, we are in a position to allocate funds to local authorities which experienced cuts.</p>  <p>  Counties like Meath, which deserve more, are beginning to get more.  Deputy Byrne said himself that he has seen it in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  We have changed that to ensure Meath is in the top couple of counties per year in terms of funding for sports.  That is rightly so per head of population.  In the Department of Education and Skills, we have changed the methodology to ensure decisions reflect population trends.  We are doing well in that Department.  In the Department of Health and in relation to local authority funding, it is still a question of catching up with the population.  Deputy Byrne and Deputy Cassells are right about that.  I have said it for years myself and I am determined as a Minister of State to ensure my Department closes that gap.</p>  <p>  I thank the Deputy for giving me the chance to outline today the importance the Government attaches to funding for local authorities, such as Meath County Council, and our desire to ensure such funding keeps up with population trends.  The funding system applying to local authorises is complex as authorities derive their incomes from a variety of sources including commercial rates, charges for goods and services and funding from central Government.  Central government funding for local authorities is for a variety of purposes and involves current and capital transfers from a wide range of Departments and offices.  It does not come solely from my Department.  Most of the funding sourced from central government and provided to local authorities must be used for specified services.  These can be grouped into a number of broad programme categories.  The main such categories are housing, transport, environmental and recreational services.</p>  <p>  In 2016, total transfers of funding from central government sources totalled &euro;2.2 billion while my own Department provided a total of &euro;1.26 billion to local authorities across a range of schemes.  The sum provided by my Department in 2017 was &euro;1.8 billion.  Funding from my Department to Meath County Council has increased significantly over the last three or four years and is up from &euro;29 million in 2015 to &euro;45.5 million in 2017.  This is rightly so as the funding must be reflective of the services needed in Meath County Council's functional area.  I am glad that I have been able to work with the Department during my tenure to ensure that we increase the money.  A recent example was that when we announced over &euro;66 million in adaptation grants, Meath County Council got a greater share than other local authorities based on its population.  We can close this funding gap over a couple of years.  I have made it very clear to Deputy Byrne that we must close this gap given the population in counties like Meath.  However, it can only be done over a period of a few years and as money comes back into the system which was not there before.  Thankfully, we are in a position to do that.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy knows, housing issues are a key priority of Government and significant additional funding is being provided to address them.  This year, &euro;1.9 billion is being provided for housing across the board.  Meath County Council has been set an ambitious target to deliver almost 1,200 additional homes over the next couple of years through build, acquisition and leasing.  I have started to meet with officials of Meath County Council and with officials from my Department and made it very clear that this is a minimum target.  They have been told to go out and do what they can to build or otherwise acquire more houses and supply housing.  They are not being told there is a limit on the funding.  Housing was an area which did not get the proper resources in the past but that has changed.  We are making the right progress to close the gap, but it is a fair assessment to say we need to close it further.  That is something I am determined to do in my time in the Department.</p></speech>

It needs to be addressed urgently.  Hopefully, the review on baseline funding will report by August.  I hope this contribution takes into account and represents my constituency which is at a greater disadvantage even than that of Deputy Cassells.  Obviously, our concern is for the entire county.  In my part of the county, there are a lot of towns which are growing faster now than ever before.  Ashbourne is one and services are struggling to catch up.  Meath pays out a lot more than it gets back.  This is a state and there will, of course, be an element of balancing funding across the country.  I am not going to complain about that.</p><p>For every &euro;100 of income tax that a Meath resident pays, Meath County Council estimates that only 5% is returned to Meath in local government funding.  That must increase.</p> <p> There is solidarity on all sides of this country and I accept that Meath will never be a net recipient of funding but it does need to increase.  We need to have the types of services that I see in rural towns in the west of Ireland that we do not see in places such as Ashbourne, Ratoath or Dunshaughlin.  In the case of Kells, where unfortunately the town council was abolished, the services provided in that town have reduced dramatically because there is no council.  That needs to change. </p> <p> I look forward to the report being issued.  I appreciate and accept that the Minister is working on it and we look forward to change.  The residents deserve this.  They are working hard, in most cases outside the county, and it would be nice for them to come home to parks and the facilities to be able to relax when they are not working and to ensure that they have the same standards of public services as everyone else in the country, to which they are entitled.</p></speech>

It is holding its first meeting today, and I will return to that in a moment.</p>  <p>  We are all concerned with the whole of County Meath.  Deputy Byrne has mentioned some towns and I will go through the rest - places like Navan, Trim, Enfield, Oldcastle or Athboy - and match them all up so that they all get the proper resources they need to provide the services for the people there.  My job is to ensure we do that and I believe we are on the right track to do so again.  </p>  <p>  The problem was that our baseline figures were completely out of order because they were not sufficiently focused on population.  In 1996, the funding as a national percentage that we used to get was 79%.  Over the next ten or 15 years, that fell to 61% by 2005 or 2006.  That is also the current position as it has not got any worse over the past seven or eight years, and in the past two or three years, we have begun to increase it.  The funding has been wrong for many years.  It is historical but it relates to the population increase, which could not be reflected in the funding because of the recession.  The review of the baseline now under way will catch those population trends and the massive population increase in County Meath and put us in the position to close that gap over a period and get the funding to which we are entitled, in order to provide all the services that our county needs.  </p>  <p>  The setting up of the group to review the local government funding baselines is an acknowledgment of the challenges facing local authorities in funding, particularly in the context of the general economic circumstances facing the country over the past decade with reductions in central funding and constraints on income raising capacity.  Thankfully this trend has now reversed with overall funding to local authorities starting to increase again.  The most recent census in 2016 showed that Meath and several other counties have experienced a notable population increase in recent years.  Meath's population grew by 6% in recent years alone but by 78% since 1996.  Though a welcome development, I know at first hand, as does Deputy Thomas Byrne, that such changes can place additional demands on local authorities for services.  Notwithstanding this, population is only one factor to be considered in local government funding but it is central to the review group.  </p>  <p>  The review group met today, with the first item on its agenda being the population and how that factors into funding.  Under the current funding system for local government, each local authority has a minimum level of funding available known as the baseline.  Given the separate review of local property tax currently being undertaken by the Minister for Finance, it is timely to conduct the parallel review of the local government funding methodology for such general purposes that I have referred to.  That review of both the baseline and of the local property tax will give us a solution to provide the funding our county needs.    </p></speech>

The use of scramblers, quad bikes and motorbikes by young people has become the most common issue being raised in my constituency at community meetings.  In safety forums in the Finglas and Ballymun areas, it is consistently the single biggest issue being raised by residents, the local authority and members of the Garda.  People are losing patience with the Government's delay in responding to the matter by way of legislation and other measures.</p>  <p>  There is now widespread use of quad bikes and scramblers by young people in my constituency and in many others, particularly in urban areas.  It involves teenagers, in the main, driving these vehicles without tax, insurance or licence.  It is not just a case of those over 16 years, who are obliged to abide by road traffic legislation, but we increasingly see younger children.  In parts of the Dublin area at least, and probably in other urban areas, it is not unusual to see children as young as seven or eight years, and sometimes there are two or three of them on a single vehicle, racing around housing estates and on public open space, including parks, posing a huge danger to themselves, pedestrians and other road users.  It is very closely associated with a high level of anti-social activity.  </p>  <p>  This has been brought to the attention of the current Minister, Deputy Flanagan, and his predecessors on several occasions.  The problem is multifaceted.  It started some years ago with the use of these vehicles in parks and the fact that road traffic legislation did not apply.  We called for amendments there but nothing has happened.  </p>  <p>  Around Christmas 2016, I called for the Road Safety Authority and the Garda to announce an initiative to discourage parents from buying these vehicles for their children because it has become commonplace.  They are not being stolen, they are bought by parents for children to race around the local community.  It is a common practice that children as young as seven or eight years look for, and get, these vehicles as presents at Christmas or for confirmation or even first communion.  That is because the situation has been allowed to get completely out of control.  It was not stemmed originally when it was a minor problem only starting to emerge.  Because of a lack of response then, the problem has now exploded and has reached a point where it is extremely widespread.</p>  <p>  As an example, the local Garda sergeant in the Finglas area recently informed residents that he had successfully persuaded Tesco, which runs the local petrol station, to stop supplying petrol to these youngsters.  Tesco deserves praise for agreeing to do so but this must be replicated by other outlets.  That is the level of activity in which the Garda and the local council are involved in an effort to tackle this problem in the absence of an adequate response from the Government.  Will the Minister please tell us that he will take this issue seriously.  Can we expect to see some action?</p></speech>

The Deputy will recall that I responded to her parliamentary question on the same issue on 1 May 2018.  I share the Deputy&rsquo;s concern in respect of the misuse of scramblers and quad bikes.  The repercussions of anti-social behaviour arising from the use of these vehicles can be very serious.  Scrambler and quad bike users can become injured, sometimes critically, people in close proximity to these vehicles may also be injured, at times, acutely and there is the ever-present risk of fatality.  In short, the misuse of scramblers and quad bikes can have a devastating effect on the users of these vehicles and the wider community.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate I have no direct role in the prevention of anti-social behaviour or the enforcement of road traffic legislation, which are operational matters for the Garda Commissioner.  However, the impact of anti-social behaviour associated with the use of scramblers and quad bikes is clearly unacceptable in terms of public safety, which is why I am focusing on this issue.  </p>  <p>  In order to tackle a public safety issue of this nature effectively, a multi-agency response is required.  The Deputy is aware that my Department convened a cross-agency meeting on 25 April 2018.  The purpose of the cross-sectoral meeting was to ascertain whether there are additional legislative or other solutions that can assist in dealing with the misuse of scramblers and quad bikes more comprehensively, with a view to determining responsibility and timeframes for implementation of solutions identified.  The meeting was attended by officials from the Departments of Justice and Equality, Transport, Tourism and Sport, Housing, Planning and the Environment, and Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, as well as from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Road Safety Authority and the Revenue Commissioners.  My Department also met separately with representatives from Dublin City Council on 23 April.  </p>  <p>  The meeting took account of a range of perspectives on the misuse of scramblers and quad bikes and considered the various experiences currently being encountered in tackling this matter.  </p><p><i>5 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p> <p>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to work with local authorities and other public bodies with regard to implementing non-legislative enforcement solutions to deal with the misuse of scramblers and quad bikes.  It is vital that this engagement not only continues but accelerates.  The meeting concluded with an agreed set of key next steps in the context of driving tangible progress on this public safety matter.  My Department&rsquo;s officials are engaging with the Office of the Attorney General to obtain legal advice on the interpretation of a number of relevant pieces of legislation identified at the meeting to determine whether any legislative amendments are necessary to assist in curbing anti-social activity insofar as scramblers and quad bikes are concerned.</p> <p> My officials also intend to consult further with local authorities in the context of the positive engagement fostered by local authorities with local communities, examples of which include community and youth-centred projects such as the various horse projects.  The experiences of local authorities involved in these and other projects will be very informative to my Department in this matter.  As the Deputy will also be aware, an important element of this issue is the Road Safety Authority.  The authority intends to run a safety campaign with the aim of discouraging those who may consider purchasing scramblers or quad bikes as presents for minors for Christmas, birthdays or special occasions.  I stress that the supply of mechanically propelled vehicles to persons under 16 or 17, depending on the vehicle, constitutes an offence under section 30 of the Road Traffic Act 2004.  I assure Deputy Shortall that I am committed to supporting actively any positive actions that can be pursued in response to the serious public safety issues arising from the ongoing misuse of scramblers and quad bikes.  I am happy to hear from the Deputy and to listen to her views from an on-the-ground perspective.  I welcome her comments and her contribution.</p></speech>

I very much welcome the establishment of the multi-agency group to look at this issue but progress is painfully slow.  To a large extent the genie is now out of the bottle.  It has become standard practice in some communities for youngsters to have these vehicles.  Obviously the law has to be enforced in respect of those over 16 years of age.  There has to be insistence on tax, insurance and a licence, but how is the Minister going to deal with the now very widespread problem of people under 16 years of age owning and using these vehicles?  We need an urgent response to this and we are not getting it.  There have been many serious accidents and it is inevitable that there will be further serious accidents and death caused by this activity.  We are now in a period of fine weather and facing into the prospect of bright evenings and, it is hoped, long warm days.  That brings its own problems in terms of this kind of activity in communities, which really poses a huge threat to other people who are trying to live in peace and quiet.  It poses a threat to other children who are trying to use public open spaces and to people who are trying to engage in sport and so on.  Pitches and parks are being churned up by the use of these vehicles.</p>  <p>  There is no more time to lose in respect of this issue.  We need an urgent response.  It is fine for the interagency body made up of the four Departments and the Government agencies to be looking at this but we need action.  There is a need for a change in the law in respect of the seizure and confiscation of these vehicles where they are being used by children.  It is the parents who need to be pursued in terms of fines.  The legislation needs to be changed and there needs to be a much stronger focus on this issue.  There needs to be a sense of urgency from that interagency group because, as I have said, it is inevitable that there will be further serious injuries as a result of inaction in this area.</p></speech>

I acknowledge her interest in this matter.  My Department will take ownership of this issue by convening the local agencies and stakeholders concerned.  The problem has been that this issue has been passed around the various agencies and authorities.  My Department has taken responsibility and leadership by convening a multi-agency group.  We will continue to do that until this issue is resolved.</p>  <p>  Deputy Shortall will also be aware that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na signalled its commitment to increasing the overall strength of the roads policing unit with the assignment of 150 additional garda&iacute; to roads policing this year.  It is proposed to continue to increase the overall strength of the roads policing unit until the full operational strength is restored.  Road safety is the shared responsibility of all road users, not just An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Road Safety Authority and other State bodies.  I urge anyone affected by or with information about these types of anti-social behaviour to contact their local Garda station.  The phone number for the Garda confidential line is 1800 666 111.  It is a monitored freefone line which allows members of the public to contact An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with information of a confidential nature.  Crimestoppers, which operates in the Deputy's constituency, can be contacted on 1800 250 025.  I acknowledge the commitment of all of the agencies involved in the genuine collaborative engagement being nurtured with local communities in seeking viable long-lasting solutions.</p>  <p>  While the Deputy complains, I would be happy to hear her proposals for solutions along with mine because I firmly believe that this is the key to resolving the public safety concerns associated with the misuse of scramblers and quad bikes.  It is easy to complain from the Opposition benches.  In fact the Deputy has made a career of that.</p></speech>

A Report on Building Standards, Building Controls and Consumer Protection (December 2017)&rsquo;, copies of which were laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 24th January, 2018.</blockquote><p>My apologies for being late.  I think we are running a little bit ahead of time.  As Chair of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government, I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on what I believe is a very comprehensive and important report, entitled Safe as Houses? A Report on Building Standards, Building Controls and Consumer Protection, which was agreed by the committee.  I will be sharing time with Deputy &Oacute; Broin who is the committee's rapporteur for the report.  I thank our committee clerk, our policy officer and the staff of the committee - Fiona, Padraig, Trish and Brian - for all their hard work in putting this report together.</p><p>On foot of a proposal from Deputy &Oacute; Broin, the joint committee agreed to appoint him as rapporteur for the committee in the preparation of this report.  The committee held meetings with invited stakeholders and experts from a range of perspectives and also sought written submissions.  I thank all those witnesses who came before the committee and those who submitted written proposals for their respective contributions.  The insight and information provided to the committee by all the stakeholders was invaluable in drafting this report.  On behalf of the joint committee and all its members, I thank Deputy &Oacute; Broin for all his detailed work in producing the draft report.  As we know, I am sharing my time with him.</p><p>He will say a few words after me on the specifics of the report.  The issue of building regulations, building control and consumer protection was identified as a key topic for consideration by the committee.  In recent years, Ireland has seen numerous housing defects come to light and as building activity steadily increases once more, the committee believes it is imperative and prudent to examine this important area.  We must learn from lessons of the past and the committee believes that robust building regulations and controls play a crucial role in ensuring mistakes are not repeated.</p> <p> Consumer protection is an important aspect of this topic.  Effective and accessible legal remedies are needed for homeowners who have discovered and will discover defects in their homes.</p> <p> The Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014, often referred to as BCAR, have already contributed to a cultural change in compliance in Ireland.  Furthermore, the proposed legislation placing the Construction Industry Register Ireland, CIRI, on a statutory footing will also enhance compliance.  However, the committee wished to examine whether any further policy changes would be required.  Our examination of the area has led us to make a number of recommendations for reform, across four distinct areas, on which Deputy &Oacute; Broin will elaborate.  In conclusion, the joint committee, in consultation with the relevant Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, the relevant Ministers of State, Deputies Damien English and John Paul Phelan, Department officials, State agencies and stakeholders, is fully committed to monitoring the progress being made on the ongoing implementation of the recommendations contained in this report in addition to other policy initiatives.</p></speech>

The origins of the report lie in the experience of many of us in working with residents who live in buildings with latent defects that were built during the Celtic tiger period.  From my experience in Clondalkin and Lucan, I understand it was not just private developers who were responsible for building homes to a poor standard because there are, in fact, legacy defects in a significant number of social housing developments built during the boom.</p>  <p>  We decided as a committee that we would examine this issue, particularly the changes introduced by the Government in 2014, to determine the extent to which we felt they were positive, whether further changes were required, and the further policy proposals we would like to make to strengthen the regulatory regime and ensure latent defects become a thing of the past.  We wanted to ensure measures would be put in place to assist those living with latent defects in dealing with problems that were not of their making.</p>  <p>  Before 2014, many of the developments that are now household names across the country were the result of bad government regulation and bad building and materials.  The people left living in those buildings had very poor consumer protection to deal with the problems they found.  While the committee was firmly of the view that the changes introduced in 2014 were significant and marked an improvement, its view was that they simply did not go far enough.  That is why we made a number of very specific recommendations, not to discard the changes but to build on them and improve them for people into the future.</p>  <p>  We had a number of public hearings.  We heard from a wide range of statutory bodies, private sector representatives and homeowners.  There were a number of private engagements, including with building control officers who might not have felt comfortable appearing before the committee and with people in developments whose details have yet to come into the public domain who wanted to give us their views.</p>  <p>  It is significant that this report was adopted unanimously by the committee.  The recommendations, therefore, bear the fingerprints of all of us on the committee as opposed to any individual.</p>  <p>  I want to spend the bulk of my time talking about the recommendations, which fall into four very clear areas.  We were very conscious that we did not want to disrupt or introduce changes that would take a long time make.  We wanted to try to build on the blocks that already exist.</p>  <p>  The first set of recommendations, on building standards and the need for a building standards and consumer protection agency, are very straightforward.  The objective is to put in place an agency that will sit above building control authorities or local authorities and act in some respects not unlike the Consumer Protection Agency or Food Safety Authority to ensure quality standards and consistency of approach to assist building control authorities to do their job to the best of their ability, to share best practice and to assist where further improvement might be needed.</p>  <p>  Another objective is to have an agency act as a hub for people who discover latent defects, such that they can go to somewhere independent that provides them with information, guidance and, potentially, mediation facilities to deal with issues arising from latent defects so there will be a non-judicial recourse mechanism.</p>  <p>  We strongly felt the construction industry register, which we all want to see and in respect of which we all want to see the legislation progress, would be better placed in an independent body as opposed to within and alongside the Construction Industry Federation.  That was a very important proposal agreed by the committee.</p>  <p>  The building standards and consumer protection agency could also have a role in construction qualifications registration as well as being the custodian of the building control management system.  I refer to the computer database at the heart of the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations of 2014.</p>  <p>  Our second set of recommendations deals specifically with the 2014 regulations.  A strong view was expressed by the committee at a very early stage that what it wanted was a fully independent inspection regime.  The idea was that self-certification or even independent certification, or having certifiers employed by the developer, no matter how professional and independent, was not the best approach.  Our preference is that, irrespective of whether the local authority uses private individuals or employs the certifiers on a full-time basis, the assigned certifiers and design certifiers would be employed by the local authority.  The costs would be recouped by the developer but the direct relationship between the certifier and local authority would be the primary one rather than that between the certifier and developer.  Not only that, a certifier could not have any other function or role with the developer or in any other project simultaneously so there would be no conflict of interest or perceived conflict of interest.</p>  <p>  We also felt very strongly that local authorities should not be the certifiers or employers of the certifiers for their own developments.  In the same way that we wanted to break the link between the developer and certifier through BCAR, we also wanted some form of independent inspection of the local authority developments.  That is in recognition of the fact that some of the most serious latent defects, although not often widely discussed, are in local authority builds rather than private sector builds.  That is why we recommended that certification of local authority rebuilds should ultimately come from the new independent building standards and consumer protection agency rather than the local authority itself.</p>  <p>  We also made a couple of proposals on increasing the capacity of local authorities to undertake their own independent inspections alongside BCAR inspectors.  We felt there should be mandatory fire inspections of all multiple-unit developments of all types as opposed to a percentage of them.  We were very strongly of the view that no building could be opened, used or occupied without a partial or completion certificate being issued, irrespective of the kind or size of the development.</p>  <p>  With regard to latent defects, there has been an improvement in practice.  There is more voluntary take-up of latent defects insurance by developers and banks but it should be made mandatory.  It simply should not be possible to sell a property without adequate latent defects insurance attached to it in order to protect consumers.  There needs to be legal change, which is not so much a matter for the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government but a matter that could be discussed with the relevant Ministers in terms of transferable warranties, shorter statutes of limitation and a bar on non-disclosure orders when homeowners negotiate a resolution, perhaps with a builder or seller, but would still like to comment on it publicly.</p>  <p>  There needs to be a review of the sections and punishments for developers or builders who breach the regulations.  Thankfully, while there have not been any significant breaches so far, we can already see there may be some coming down the line.  The need for strong enforcement is crucial.</p>  <p>  The next recommendation is very simple.  A bar on the awarding of publicly funded construction project tenders should be introduced to prevent such contracts from being awarded to any builder or developer found in breach of building control regulations or standards.</p><p>A very simple measure would be a bar on the awarding of publicly funded construction projects for any builder or developer who has been found in breach of building control regulations or standards.</p> <p> The final area of the recommendations was what to do with the legacy.  Part of our difficulty is that we simply do not know the size of the problem in terms of Celtic tiger latent defects.  We know some of the high profile projects in the public domain.  Some of us know of others in our constituencies that have yet to be made public.  However, we do know that there is a problem and that the people who bought those homes in good faith should not be left to their own devices to cover the cost of the defects.  We have had pyrite mediation in some homes, although not all.  I understand there has been progress under the mica remediation programme, which I welcome, but there has to be some mechanism for people, whether in Beacon South Quarter, Longboat Quay or developments throughout the country to secure assistance.  The committee was deliberately non-prescriptive in that regard because we understand the matter is complex.  The issue of who pays, eligibility criteria, etc. is not straightforward.</p> <p> One of the things for which I call - it is a call that is not included in the report but which I believe most committee members would support - is that the Government announce a short public consultation process of about three months to enable stakeholders to express views on how we can have a proper latent defects legacy redress scheme.  We could consider an industry levy, taxpayer funding, tax breaks or tax write-offs for homeowners to deal with safety concerns in their properties, but some mechanism must be put in place.  For householders who may be facing costs of &euro;9,000, &euro;15,000, &euro;20,000 or &euro;40,000 - they are the kind of figure at which we are looking - we need some mechanism to secure redress for latent defects for which they are not responsible. While, in the first instance, bad developers should be forced to pick up the tab, this was possible because the regulatory regime pre-2014 was not robust enough, for which the State has to accept responsibility.</p> <p> Last night, in advance of this debate, we invited any of the people who had contacted the committee, either through formal submissions or after the publication of the report, who had been affected by the issue of latent defects to come to a private meeting.  We also invited members of the housing committee to attend.  Some could and some could not come, but they were all made aware of it.  We had abut 20 or 25 people in attendance from a range of developments.  They were very complimentary of all the work committee members had done, as well as by other Deputies, including Deputy Catherine Martin of the Green Party for her tabling a similar motion at an earlier stage.  What they want from us is not to allow the report to simply sit on shelves and gather dust.  They want us to engage on a non-partisan, non-political, cross-party basis with the Minister and the Department to see what we can do to try to strengthen the changes introduced in 2014, introduce new levels of consumer protection to compliment the BICAR changes and also, crucially, put some latent defects redress scheme in place in order that at some point in the near future - preferably in and beyond budget 2019 - the people living in properties with significant safety defects through no fault of the purchasers will receive some support from the Government and the Oireachtas to tackle these issues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-05-24a.333" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1295" speakername="Eoghan Murphy" time="16:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018052400041#RR00200"><p>I thank Deputies for the report which addresses a fundamental concern that has a direct impact on the daily life of many living in the State.  Stronger compliance with building standards has been to the forefront of our building control reform agenda which was initiated in 2011 when a high level working group reviewed the existing building control regulatory framework.  The key deficits identified in the regulatory regime were the lack of involvement of construction professionals on site and lack of accountability in compliance with the building regulations.  In response, a three pronged building control reform agenda has been developed - reform of the building control process; establishment of a national building control management project; and putting Construction Industry Register Ireland on a statutory footing.</p>  <p>  Building control regulations set out the procedures for implementation of the building control system.  They provide for commencement notices, fire safety certificates and disability access certificates, statutory fees and the keeping of a statutory register.  It was through the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014, known within the Industry as BCAR, that the key deficits in the system were first addressed.  The amendment requires that the owner must assign competent persons to design, build, inspect and certify building works he or she has commissioned.  They, in turn, must account for their contribution through the lodgement of compliance documentation, inspection plans and statutory certificates.  The roles and responsibilities of owners, designers, builders, assigned certifiers, etc. during building works are set out in the code of practice for inspecting and certifying buildings and works of September 2016.  It has brought clarity and accountability, a focus on compliance and a new order to bear on construction projects.</p>  <p>  It is worth taking a moment to consider the most significant changes that have occurred on foot of BCAR.  Certified design and compliance documentation is now submitted to the local building control authority before works commence by a competent registered construction professional; owners must appoint a competent builder to undertake and certify construction works; an assigned certifier has to prepare an inspection plan for the building works and carry out, or oversee, inspections in accordance with the inspection plan; the builder and the assigned certifier must sign a statutory certificate of compliance on completion which must be accompanied by plans and documentation showing how the constructed building complies with the building regulations and also the inspection plan, as implemented; and it is an offence to open, occupy or use a building unless the certificate of compliance on completion has been submitted to a building control authority and included in the register.  This is also a recommendation made in the committee&rsquo;s report.</p>  <p>  I largely agree with the intention of recommendation No. 1 in the committee's report that proposes the establishment of a national office to assist building control authorities.  These are some of the very areas at which in the past few years we have worked closely and productively to strengthen with the Local Government Management Agency, the County and City Managers Association and other industry stakeholders, under the umbrella of the National Building Control Management Project, NBCP.  However, I disagree that there should be a new national agency or quango.  The National Building Control Management Project was set up to provide oversight, direction and support for the development, standardisation and implementation of building control as an effective shared service in the 31 building control authorities.  It provides all of the benefits of a centralised structure for the governance and oversight of building control but embeds it in a lead local authority.  I am pleased to confirm that Dublin City Council has recently been approved as the lead building control authority.  This creates the central and stable executive structure needed to oversee the local building control function to its maximum effect.  The lead local authority will be governed by a board, chaired by a county manager, with a range of public and private sector stakeholders.  Three building control regions have also been created. This engenders collaboration across the regions and provides an important mechanism for regular communication and feedback between the lead and local authorities.  My departmental officials take an active role in these committees.</p>  <p>  The key achievements of the NBCP are, first, the building control management IT system, BCMS, which facilitates the electronic administration of building control functions and provides a common platform for clear and consistent administration of building control matters across the local authority sector.  Second, the framework for building control authorities, BCAs, was published to standardise work practices, systems, procedures and decision-making in the oversight of building control activity across the sector.  The latest version was published in June 2016.  Third, a compliance support mechanism has been established for dealing with queries, either from building control staff and-or private practitioners making submissions to BCAs at a centralised level that can then be applied consistently nationally.  Fourth, to fully empower staff in BCAs to carry out their work effectively, training programmes have been and are being developed.  Fifth, fundamentally, the inspection policy is being reviewed.  The minimum national annual Inspection target, as agreed with the local authorities, is 12% to 15% of new buildings covered by vaIid commencement notices received.  In reality, the majority of local authorities exceed this target.  The National Oversight and Audit Commission, NOAC, collects and publishes these data annually.  The new policy will position building control authorities to carry out risk based targeted inspections by making more efficient and effective use of the resources available to carry out inspections.  A key component of the policy will be to ensure fire safety inspections of new building works, during construction, to check compliance with Part B of the building regulations, are carried out by competent building control personnel.  This echoes the committee's recommendation for fire safety inspections.  The two reforms, BCAR and the National Building Control Management Project, complement each other by ensuring all involved in the construction process and regulatory system carry out their roles effectively and are focused on ensuring compliance at every stage and level.</p>  <p>  Owners, builders and designers are legally responsible for the design and construction of buildings in accordance with the relevant requirements of the building regulations.  Design certifiers and assigned certifiers must be members of regulated construction professions.  They face serious potential professional and financial consequences in respect of the statutory certificates they lodge with building control authorities.  Registration bodies take seriously their obligations in dealing with professional misconduct or poor professional performance.  The recommendation made in the committee&rsquo;s report to have design and assigned certifiers directly employed by the local authority blurs the lines of legal responsibilities, doubles the number of professionals involved in the process and waters down the role of those at the coalface.  I consider this a backward step.  The current system is modelled closely on the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Construction) Regulations 2013 which place statutory obligations on clients and builders during the design and construction stages.  The Health and Safety Authority inspectorate carries out inspections to promote, monitor and enforce compliance.  It has been very successful in improving safety on sites.</p>  <p>  The committee&rsquo;s report suggests the system is one of self-certification, which I believe to be a misnomer.  For the majority of projects, design and assigned certifiers are independent of the builder.</p><p>Design-build projects are the main exception to this.  For public sector design-build contracts, the assigned certifier is employed directly by the client.</p> <p> The Building Control Act 2007 established a statutory system of registration for architects and surveyors.  Last year, the Government approved the general scheme of the Building Control (Construction Industry Register Ireland) Bill to establish a mandatory statutory register for builders and specialist subcontractors.  The Construction Industry Register Ireland, CIRI, which was established on a voluntary basis in 2014, now has over 800 building entitles registered.  The Government&rsquo;s commitment to placing CIRI on a statutory footing is another strand of our ongoing reform agenda.  The Bill was referred to the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government for pre-legislative scrutiny and I am considering the committee&rsquo;s recommendations and progressing the drafting at present.  The main objective of the Building Control (Construction Industry Register Ireland) Bill is to develop and promote a culture of competence, good practice and compliance with the building regulations within the builder community of the construction sector.  The establishment of a robust and mandatory statutory register of builders and specialist contractors is an essential consumer protection measure giving those who engage a registered builder the assurance that they are dealing with a competent and compliant operator.  The Bill will also allow for complaints against registered builders to be made on a number of grounds and provides for a range of proportionate sanctions to be imposed after investigation.  The committee&rsquo;s report recommends a review of sanctions and punishments but I draw Members' attention to the section 17 of the Building Control Act, which sets out the fines and prison sentences that may be imposed.  In addition, a person may be disqualified from signing and submitting certificates of compliance with building regulations for two or ten years depending on the offence.  This has taken on a more significant impact with the introduction of the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations, BCAR, 2014.</p> <p> The proposal in the committee's report to create new legal remedies or redress procedures or dispute resolution facilities for homeowners affected by defects would require broader consideration, including with the Department of Justice and Equality and others. While it may have benefits in some instances, it does not represent a panacea for the resolution of building compliance issues.  Changes to the statute of limitations, for example, may affect constitutional rights and must be seen in the context of the civil liability code in Ireland.  In this context, in February 2018, my Department wrote to the Law Reform Commission and also corresponded with those involved with the review of the administration of civil justice in Ireland requesting that it consider the issue of effective and accessible legal remedies for homeowners who discover defects in their homes.  The Government&rsquo;s focus has primarily been on ensuring strong and effective regulation in the building control system and the construction industry and on improving compliance in the building regulations.  This reduces the risk and the incidences of detective buildings and has provided insurance underwriters with sufficient confidence to introduce new latent defect type products in Ireland despite a general retrenchment and conservatism in the wider insurance industry.  These new products are first-party insurance policies that cover damage and non-damage - breaches of buildings - claims to varying degrees.  This means that the purchaser does not have to make a claim through the builder but can submit a claim directly to the insurer.  This would be of particular benefit to a homeowner in circumstances where the builder or developer has ceased trading.  It is worth noting that while latent defects insurance is not a mandatory requirement, lending institutions and consumers are likely to demand it.  As Members are aware, the Government is prohibited from interfering in the cost or terms of insurance offered on the market but as this insurance becomes more popular, it is likely that the market will become even more competitive.  As such it is critical that consumers, house purchasers and the public are aware of the various Insurance products and the scope of such policies.  With this in mind, my Department is currently engaging with the Departments of Finance and Business, Enterprise and Innovation, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission and the Central Bank with a view to exploring appropriate methods of raising awareness about insurance products and other property-related consumer protections.</p> <p> While the reforms I have outlined address the compliance of buildings going forward, I fully understand and acknowledge the distressing situation that some owners and residents have found themselves in through no fault of their own due to defects in buildings arising from non-compliance with building standards.  The economic and personal consequences of these situations can be significant.  However, building defects are matters for resolution between the contracting parties involved: the homeowner, the builder, the developer and/or their respective insurers, structural guarantee or warranty scheme.  In this regard, it is incumbent on the parties responsible for poor workmanship and/or the supply of defective materials to accept their responsibilities and take appropriate action to provide remedies for affected homeowners.  My predecessors and I have supported homeowners through a number of expert reports and investigations into legacy problems such as the report of the pyrite panel in June 2012 and the report of the expert panel on concrete blocks in June 2017.  Also, in the interests of supporting owners and residents living in developments where concerns regarding non-compliance with fire safety requirements arise, I published the framework for enhancing fire safety in dwellings in August 2017.  While the committee&rsquo;s report recommends a redress scheme, it is not possible for the State to take on responsibility or liability for all legacy issues of defective building materials or workmanship nor would it send the right message to the industry regarding its responsibility for compliance.  </p> <p> In the aftermath of the Grenfell Tower tragedy in June of last year and in recognition of fears expressed in respect of fire safety, I tasked the national directorate for fire and emergency management with convening and co-ordinating a task force to oversee a review of fire safety in local authority provided rnulti-storey, multi-unit social housing and a separate review of medium to high-rise buildings greater than 18 m or six storeys and as well as to lead a reappraisal of our approach to fire safety in Ireland.  I have just received this report, which I am considering and I expect I will bring it to Cabinet shortly.  </p> <p> The failures in construction of the past have arisen largely due to inadequate design, poor workmanship or the use of improper products or a combination of these factors.  The significant reforms that I have described this evening are aimed squarely at addressing these issues.  I thank the committee for its time and analysis of the building standards, building controls and consumer protection.  While, as I indicated earlier, I can subscribe to many of the principles in the committee's report, I believe that the building control reform agenda and other initiatives underway provide a full and comprehensive road map to embedding a culture of real compliance within the construction industry.  In fact, many of the findings and recommendations outlined in Dame Judith Hackett&rsquo;s recent report entitled Building a Safer Future - Independent Review of Building Regulations and Fire Safety, which appeared in May 2018, are commensurate with the reforms and measures already put in place under the Government&rsquo;s broader building control reform agenda.  I thank and acknowledge the engagement, commitment and determination of the local authority sector and industry stakeholders who have been instrumental in shaping and implementing this reform agenda and changing the culture of the construction industry.</p></speech>

There was horrific loss of life in that appalling fire.  I do not think it is any exaggeration to say that we are incredibly lucky that something similar has not happened here because all of the same features exist.  In Holywell in Swords in 2007, fire spread rapidly through cavity walls destroying six units in under half an hour.  Had that fire occurred at night when people were asleep, there would undoubtedly have been casualties.  The same scenario happened in Millfield in Newbridge.  It is only as a result of these catastrophic problems coming to the fore and an opening up of some of the properties afterwards that we have revealed massive non-compliance in a number of areas such as Fingal, south Dublin, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, Louth, Kildare, Cork and, undoubtedly, every other local authority area that has not yet been touched by this.  There were breaches of building regulations in Holywell.  A fire safety examination of 22 homes found poor workmanship, breaches of fire safety and other regulations yet the developer, Albany Homes, said it was nothing to do with it, blamed the local authority, shrugged its shoulders, denied that it had ever received the report and did nothing to rectify the works.  The Department's long-awaited report into the fire at Millfield, which was very weak, also revealed deficiencies that affected the spread of fire, poor workmanship, improper jointing of plasterboard to separating walls within the attic space, fire stopping missing at the top of the separating walls, cavity closers missing at the top of the external walls and penetration of separating walls within the attic with the roof timbers.  These are not isolated examples.  The Minister needs to be proactive in terms of establishing the extent of these legacy issues because it is only through tragedy that some of the issues about which we are aware have emerged.  We must ask ourselves why this is the case.  It has been touched on by the report, which I welcome.</p>  <p>  If we look at a redress scheme like the pyrite remediation scheme, the question arises as to why it is there.  It should never have been there.  The State was culpable in not having a proper system of checks at the quarries.  It acted improperly and had to take some of the responsibility in that regard.  We have a scheme in place because residents had to go out and fight for it.  In fairness, the late Shane McEntee was instrumental in delivering that scheme but it is no longer fit for purpose.  It needs to be changed and the Minister is well aware of this.  The defects in that scheme have been flagged.  We have the scenario where householders are buckling under the pressure of damage to their property through no fault of their own.</p>  <p>  The root of this is the lack of proper inspection.  We know that the decision taken by Fianna F&aacute;il in 1990 to abolish independent building control inspections by local authorities and allow self certification has been a disaster.  However, I do not agree that the control regulations of 2014 have solved anything.</p><p>The report has been good in highlighting some of the weaknesses in that those regulations did not go far enough in tackling non-compliance.  There is nothing to provide the purchaser of a house with confirmation that the builder was or is competent.  It does nothing to improve the performance of contractors and nothing to improve standards of workmanship.  All it does is identify someone the buyer could potentially sue later down the road if his or her life is falling apart because he or she bought a property that is buckling in that regard.</p> <p> The assigned certifier is very problematic.  While I welcome much of the report, we need to return to a public inspection system.  The local authorities do not really have the clout to carry out that function as they have been so undermined.  We need independent building control in the public arena that gives robust powers to an inspector who has no conflict of interest unlike the present assigned certifier who is paid by the developer.  That person should have access to a site at any stage during construction to carry out any inspection deemed necessary, particularly regarding fire prevention and fire retardant materials as well as foundations, drainage, plumbing and so on.  The inspector must have the power to stop non-compliant work and to be able to order the taking down of a building that has not complied with regulations.</p> <p> Such a system requires the employment of skilled and experienced tradespeople by the local authority or another body to empower a public inspector.  If we do not do this we will have a re-emergence of the problems that everybody is complaining about now and the absolutely appalling vista that the victims have to pay for the damage that has been done, which is absolutely disgraceful.</p></speech>

The Minister said:</p><blockquote>The Government&rsquo;s focus has primarily been on ensuring strong and effective regulation in the building control system and the construction industry and on improving compliance in the building regulations...<br /><br />I believe that the building-control reform agenda and other initiatives under way provide a full and comprehensive roadmap to embedding a culture of real compliance within the construction industry.</blockquote><p>I can guarantee the Minister that in 2030 we will have as big a percentage of poorly built houses and apartments as we have now.  Nothing will change; I see absolutely nothing new in how we are doing things.  Does the Minister talk to the people who actually build this stuff?  It is not difficult to build a house or an apartment block properly.  One can build it well just as quickly as build it badly.  Sometimes it costs more to build it well, but it is not any more difficult.</p><p>When a young couple buys a house the bank, in fact, owns the house.  The bank gets someone to certify the house.  More often than not it gets an architect, but architects know nothing about building.  Architects design; they do not build.  A bank will not accept certification from a builder; it will accept it from an architect.  It gets an architect to go out and look at it and he will sign off on it.  His insurance is supposed to cover it.  If trouble arises and the place is falling down, it goes back on the client - the person who was foolish enough to buy the house.  If the bank owns the bleeding property, why does the bank not take responsibility for the fact that it did not get it checked out properly?</p><p>If any of the Deputies present want to buy a house or an apartment in this town in the next couple of years, they can give me a ring, and I will go and look at it.  I will tell them if it is built right or not.  I can tell them whether the apartment or house is okay and whether the overall complex is built properly.  I will not even charge them for doing so.  It is not rocket science; building is simple.</p><p>There is so much stuff in the Minister's speech and many areas being looked at.  However, nothing is changing.  We have a big problem in how we supply housing and there is no monitoring of how we do it.  We are going to increase inspections from 12% to 15%, which means we will not worry about 85% of them on the basis that they will be grand.  Not only should the local authorities be inspecting 100% of them, but we will need to train them to do it because they are not fit for purpose because they have been allowed to go in that direction.  We need people who understand what they are looking at.  There is no point in talking around in circles on all this stuff.  If one really wants to change what is happening and the whole culture around the quality of housing, the control of how things are done and the lack of enforcement, God help us and save us, one would not be well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-05-24a.338" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1357" speakername="Pat Casey" time="17:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018052400043#TT00300"><p>The report we are discussing this evening represents the committee's genuine efforts to work constructively on housing matters and to provide solutions that will work and are realistic.  It is essential that we learn the lessons from the previous housing bubble and the resulting financial crash.  It is essential to ensure that the increased supply of housing which is so badly needed and the existing housing stock are of the highest possible standard.</p>  <p>  At the end of the day a house is a home for people and it should be built to last.  At the very least every home in the Republic should be certified as safe for habitation.  The tragedy at Grenfell Tower just under a year ago is an appropriate yet horrific reminder of the consequences of poor materials and insufficient fire safety controls in buildings.  Examples of inadequate controls in Ireland gave us the infamous Priory Hall development, and the pyrite and mica disasters.</p>  <p>  We also need to be clear about what exactly we are talking about so as not to be cynically raising people's fears about building standards in Ireland for political motives.  Everyone here wants the best standards and is working towards that end.  The standards in place for the construction of homes in Ireland are very high.  Fire safety standards and building regulations are of a high quality and are on a par with best practice internationally, as has been confirmed by many experts in evidence to the committee.  It is also confirmed in external expertise that we have sought for policy development in this area.</p>  <p>  However, there is little point in having very high standards and comprehensive building regulations that can be pulled off a shelf every time there is an issue.  We need a strong, independent and rigorous inspection system which is controlled by the State and enforces the regulations with serious penalties for breaches.  I and my colleagues in Fianna F&aacute;il will insist that we work purposefully and relentlessly towards an independent inspection regime of 100%.  This will take a sea change in current thinking when it comes to the State's role in the housing sector and one that I genuinely hope can still happen.</p>  <p>  I have been working with Deputy Darragh O'Brien and my colleagues in Fianna F&aacute;il in drafting legislation on an inspection regime that is fit for purpose and can be trusted.  That is what is needed here.  We are also concerned about the lack of inspections in the private and public rental sector and through our vacant housing Bill we will also be clamping down on abuses that are occurring.</p>  <p>  I agree that the current building control model, commonly referred to as BCAR, has made significant progress but it still has flaws in the committee's opinion.  The current inspection model during construction involves an inspector known as an assigned certifier, who is employed by the builder or developer of the housing development.  It does not take a public policy expert to see the potential conflict of interest that exists between the inspector - the assigned certifier - and the fact that the person who is paying the inspector is the developer of the house in question.</p>  <p>  Another flaw lies in the prosecution for serious breaches in the inspection of building regulations.  There must be severe and appropriate penalties on failures of inspectors.  Under SI 9 of 2014 each professional body investigates complaints against its own members.  For example, architects investigate architects and chartered surveyors investigate surveyors.  This self-regulation is not appropriate in our view.  That no sanction has been brought against an architect or surveyor for the last six years is evidence of the failures inherent in the current BCAR regime.  Self-regulation on too many levels means no regulation.</p>  <p>  It is obvious that we need independent and professional distance between the inspection regime and the developers and builders who construct our homes.  There are plenty of international examples of such systems and the model the committee proposes is very worthy.</p><p> It is our view that the most appropriate platform for delivering this independent building inspection regime is the approved certifier list, which can be managed by the local authority and will provide the independent framework, with Department guidance.  It will be the local authority and the State which will provide the steel that is needed for a robust inspection regime and it will be the State that will sanction and penalise any failings on behalf of the developer or the inspection system.</p> <p> The committee's proposal of a new building standards and consumer protection agency is the one-stop shop that is needed to regulate and inform policy and procedures in this area.  Over time, as this new system beds in and develops, there is massive potential for the local authority, qualified inspectors and builders and developers to learn from one another and to work in partnership to ensure the homes that are built in Ireland are safe, built to an exceptionally high standard and can be trusted, having being independently verified as such.  This new model of building regulations and controls will also serve to restore trust in the State's ability to oversee important areas of social policy on an ongoing basis.  As a progressive step, this is an example of a D&aacute;il committee producing a workable proposal.</p> <p> I want to take this opportunity to thank the committee's acting rapporteur, Deputy &Oacute; Broin, and our Chairman, Deputy Bailey, for their work in preparing this report.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-05-24a.340" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1228" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="17:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018052400044#UU00200"><p>I thank Deputy Casey for sharing time.  I have read the report and the appendices, although I was not a part of the committee at the time.  I commend Deputy &Oacute; Broin and the Chairman, Deputy Bailey, on the work they have done.</p>  <p>  In the few minutes available to me, I will focus on a couple of issues.  There are some very practical recommendations.  What I thought telling from all the remarks thus far is that I believe all of us understand that the regime as it is now is not fit for purpose and could be improved greatly.  While it has improved somewhat since the 2014 regulations, more needs to be done.  Where I agree completely with Deputy Casey and with others is on the recommendations in regard to a building standards and consumer protection agency.  The most significant and expensive purchase anyone or any family will make is the purchase of a family home.  The idea that the State should not be involved in overseeing that by way of consumer protection is something with which I do not agree.  I hope the Minister hears the comments of the members of the committee.  While I do not mean this as a criticism but simply as a comment, the Minister in his response seemed to suggest very little of the report is acceptable to the Government.</p>  <p>  I want to address two items.  The Minister stated that building defects are matters for resolution between the contracting parties involved, such as the homeowner, the builder, the developer and so on.  It would be great if that were the case but he should talk to the people who had pyrite in their homes.  Members across the House, including the former Minister of State, Shane McEntee, were crucial to setting up the pyrite remediation scheme that is in place.  However, let us consider how Homebond was allowed to walk away.  We talk about structural guarantees or warranty schemes but - I debated this at the time with the then Minister, Phil Hogan - no one in the industry has paid into the scheme, although some builders have done so voluntarily.  We need to look at how warranty schemes and companies like Homebond, OSG and others operate.  We need to be in contact with the Financial Regulator and the Central Bank in order that the licence of an insurer that basically states the defects are not structural and therefore it is not paying out, thereby blanking thousands of homeowners, can be examined.  That is where a consumer protection agency comes into play.</p>  <p>  I draw to the Minister's attention the issue that arises on page 14 of the report with regard to protecting against latent defects, in particular part 3, which raises the issue of the Statute of Limitations.  The original pyrite report of the expert panel highlighted the issue of the Statute of Limitations needing to start from the date any defect - not just pyrite - is independently identified.  Many people have been hamstrung by the Statute of Limitations as it currently exists.  I produced a Bill in the last Seanad that would have dealt with this.  I believe this recommendation by the committee is crucial because there can be instances where issues do not arise or present within seven years and they are then outside the Statute of Limitations.  That is something we can do and it is not going to cost the Government any money, so I believe it is a reasonable suggestion.</p>  <p>  I am glad to hear the Minister is in receipt of the report from the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management.  As part of that, and we could take the Metro Hotel incident as an example, I believe the area risk assessments were insufficient and when the Minister has had time to study the report, we might have an opportunity to debate it in the House and to see how this can be improved.  Fire safety across commercial and residential is paramount to all of us.  Thank God no one was injured or killed in the Metro Hotel and that was down to the swift action of the Dublin Fire Brigade.  However, we need to learn lessons very quickly with regard to how we can improve.</p>  <p>  I very much commend the committee and all its members on putting together this report and on highlighting clearly some practical recommendations that can be implemented.</p></speech>

Many of the issues it covers and many of the actions it suggests were also included in a motion on building standards and homeowner protection tabled by the Green Party that was passed by the D&aacute;il last June.  I commend all the members of the committee on their work on this report, as well as all the expert witnesses who contributed to it.</p>  <p>  The issues this report outlines are damning.  For those people who save up and take on a mortgage, a house and a home is the most expensive and important decision which they and their families will ever make, yet control and regulation in this area is still woefully inadequate.  We can see that we still have a culture of industry self-regulation.  We still have massive under-resourcing and bad communication in and between the building control sections of local authorities.  While the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014 constituted a positive change to the regime that was in place before, it is still a system of self-certification.  The lack of regulation and quality control on our homes is something which is still hanging over us.</p>  <p>  Last week the independent inquiry into building standards that was ordered by the UK Government following the Grenfell tragedy was published.  That report speaks of a race-to-the-bottom culture in the construction industry - doing things as cheaply as possible - where concerns by others involved in the building process, or residents of housing, are ignored.  It also speaks of a lack of enforcement of the regulations, which are not seen as an effective deterrent.  This certainly was the case in Ireland during the boom era and may still be true today.  Residents are living in dangerous homes, afraid for their safety, with no help from Government to fix defects.  Enforcement is under-resourced and practically non-existent.</p>  <p>  The recommendations the report before us outlines would go some way towards ensuring the safety of our homes.  This report sets out four sets of recommendations.  The first set calls for a new State regulator for building standards.  Such a regulator would be along the lines of the Food Safety Authority and the environmental protections.  It would be a strong, well-resourced independent building regulator, something which was also called for in the Green Party's motion last June.  We desperately need such a regulator to oversee national building control and actively and robustly regulate those involved in construction.  We cannot ensure there is appropriate building control compliance in this country without a fully resourced, new building regulator office with a real and effective enforcement agency.</p>  <p>  This ties into the second set of recommendations, which looks at making the building control regulations truly independent.  The Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014 put in place a system of assigned certifiers but this is still effectively self-regulation by the construction industry.  Orla Hegarty of UCD has said that a self-builder or developer is effectively appointing someone to police him or herself, while the appointed person does not have to be independent of the process and has no legal powers.  Under the current system, there is absolutely no guarantee that the assigned certifier under the 2014 regulations must be independent of the developer.  He or she can still be an employee of the developer and have other close links to the developer he or she is certifying.  We do not accept self-regulation in the food industry or in regard to the protection of our environment.  Why do we accept self-regulation in regard to the industry that builds one of the most important things in our lives, our homes?</p>  <p>  The third set of recommendations relates to the need for substantial law reform.  Since Fine Gael took office in 2011 there has been no substantive legislative reform to create new remedies for anyone who finds he or she is living in a defective house.</p><p><i>6 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p> <p>I have been working with construction law expert Deirdre N&iacute; Fhloinn in drafting new primary legislation to include robust legal remedies for homeowners from builders and those involved in the building process, and I hope to introduce it to the House before the end of this term.</p> <p> The fourth and final set of recommendations relates to dealing with the legacy of defects in housing.  In my constituency of Dublin Rathdown, there are developments where families are facing bills of up to &euro;30,000 to rectify problems not of their making.  These families are left with dangerously defective housing with no legal recourse to the corner-cutting cowboy builders who built shoddy homes in an unregulated environment and then sold them to unsuspecting homeowners.  There is not even a phone number that they can ring to seek advice on the numerous frightening letters which they have received in recent weeks.  They are terrified that boom era building defects will financially ruin them through no fault of their own.</p> <p> The Government has been inactive on this issue, relying on the homeowners' fear that if they go public the value of their properties will be destroyed, putting them in further financial peril.  This is not right, fair or just.  Every time I have raised this issue with the Taoiseach and members of the Government, it has been dismissed as being entirely a matter between private parties to a private contract.  The Minister did so again tonight.  This is a public health issue brought about by an ineffective building control regime exploited by cowboy builders through the boom under the State's watch.  Will it take a tragedy to occur or lives to be lost before the Government takes action?</p> <p> Practical reliefs for people living in substandard and defective homes need to, and must, be considered in the upcoming budget.  These can be simple and practical measures like property tax relief or expanding VAT relief on works, which will impose minimal cost on the Exchequer, particularly as the Government provides similar tax reliefs to developers.  These people are not looking for a handout.  They are asking for practical information and assistance.  They are pleading that the Government not abandon them.</p> <p> The Green Party motion on building standards and homeowner protection passed by the D&aacute;il last year and the "Safe as Houses?" report we are debating today outline the measures Government can take.  Inaction is no longer an option.  The conversation on relief for these homeowners must not end with this debate today.  It cannot be wrapped up and filed away on a shelf in Government buildings like so many other reports on which no action has been taken.  These recommendations have the potential to improve things not just for the future but also for people dealing with defects in their homes right now.</p> <p> The Minister said that he believes that the building control reform agenda and other initiatives under way provide a full and comprehensive roadmap to embedding a culture of real compliance with the construction industry.  This report contains the roadmap for improving the position and lives of these homeowners.  It is the real roadmap that Government needs to follow.  Will the Minister please give a commitment tonight that he will at the very least explore all options for giving assistance to the many homeowners who are pleading for his help? </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-05-24a.343" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1337" speakername="Helen McEntee" time="17:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018052400045#VV00200"><p>I thank the Deputies for the report tabled this evening which addresses an area of fundamental concern that has a direct impact on the daily lives of many people living in the State.  I reiterate the sentiments of the Minister for Housing Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy.  Stronger compliance with building standards has been a key priority for Government and has manifested in the building control reform agenda which was initiated in 2011.</p>  <p>  A three-pronged building control reform agenda has been developed: first, reform of the building control process; second, the establishment of a national building control management project, NBCMP; and third, putting the Construction Industry Register Ireland, CIRI, on a statutory footing.  It was through the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014, Sl 9 of 2014, known within the industry as BCAR, that the key deficits of the system were first addressed.  This amendment requires that the owner must assign competent persons to design, build, inspect and certify building works he or she has commissioned.  They in turn must account for their contribution through the lodgement of compliance documentation, inspection plans and statutory certificates.</p>  <p>  The Department largely agrees with the intention of recommendation No. 1 in the committee's report that proposes a national office to assist building control authorities.  It disagrees, however, that there should be a new national agency or quango.  The NBCMP was set up to provide oversight, direction and support for the development, standardisation and implementation of building control as an effective shared service in the 31 building control authorities.  This provides all the benefits of a centralised structure for the governance and oversight of building control but embeds it in a lead local authority.  I am pleased to confirm that Dublin City Council has recently been approved as the lead building control authority.</p>  <p>  This creates the central and stable executive structure needed to oversee the local building control function to its maximum effect.  The lead local authority will be governed by a board, chaired by a county manager with a range of public and private sector stakeholders.  These two reforms, BCAR and NBCMP, complement each other by ensuring that all involved in the construction process and regulatory system carry out their roles effectively and are focused on ensuring compliance at every stage and level.</p>  <p>  The Building Control Act 2007 established a statutory system of registration for architects and surveyors and last year the Government approved the general scheme of the building control (construction industry register) Bill 2017 to establish a mandatory statutory register for builders and specialist subcontractors.  The Bill was referred to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government for pre-legislative scrutiny and the Minister is considering the committee's recommendations and progressing the drafting at present.  The main objective of the building control (construction industry register) Bill 2017 is to develop and promote a culture of competence, good practice and compliance with the building regulations within the builder community of the construction sector.  The establishment of a robust, mandatory, statutory register of builders and specialist contractors is an essential consumer protection measure, giving those who engage a registered builder the assurance that they are dealing with a competent and compliant operator.</p>  <p>  The creation of new legal remedies or redress processes or dispute resolution facilities for homeowners affected by defects would require broader consideration.  While it may have benefits in some instances, it does not represent a cure-all for the resolution of building compliance issues.  Changes to the Statute of Limitations, for example, may affect constitutional rights and must be seen in the context of the civil liability code in Ireland.  In this context, in February 2018, the Department wrote to the Law Reform Commission and also corresponded with those involved with the review of the administration of civil justice in Ireland, requesting that they consider the issue of effective and accessible legal remedies for homeowners who discover defects in their homes.</p>  <p>  The Government's focus has primarily been on ensuring strong and effective regulation in the building control system and the construction industry and on improving compliance in the building regulations.  This reduces the risk and the incidence of defective buildings and has provided insurance underwriters with sufficient confidence to introduce new latent defect type products in Ireland.  These new products are first party insurance policies which cover damage and non-damage, breaches of building regulations, and claims to varying degrees.  This means that the purchaser does not have to make a claim through the builder but can submit a claim directly to the insurer.  This would be of particular benefit to a homeowner in circumstances where the builder or developer has ceased trading.  While latent defects insurance is not a mandatory requirement, lending institutions and consumers are likely to demand it.  It is critical that consumers, house purchasers and the public are aware of the various insurance products and the scope of such policies.  In this regard the Department is engaging with the relevant agencies with a view to exploring appropriate methods of raising awareness about insurance products and other property related consumer protections.</p>  <p>  While the reforms I have outlined address the compliance of buildings going forward, I fully understand and acknowledge the distressing situation that some owners and residents have found themselves in, through no fault of their own, due to defects in buildings arising from non-compliance with building standards.  The economic and personal consequences of these situations can be significant and devastating in some instances.  Building defects, however, are matters for resolution between the contracting parties involved: the homeowner, the builder, the developer and-or their respective insurers, structural guarantee or warranty scheme.  It is incumbent on the parties responsible for poor workmanship and-or the supply of defective materials to accept their responsibilities and take appropriate action to provide remedies for affected homeowners.</p><p> I know some Deputies have raised the issue of pyrite.  I have engaged many homeowners in my constituency on that in recent years and I am fully aware of the devastating effects it has.  The Government and taxpayers are paying millions of euro to remediate these homes because, when these homes were built, the legislation put in place by consecutive Governments before was not strong enough to hold the relevant parties accountable.  We are now looking at that and have changed it in many instances.  That is important to note.</p> <p> The Minister and many of his predecessors have supported homeowners through a number of expert reports and investigations into legacy problems.  It is not possible, however, for the State to take on responsibility and liability for all of the legacy issues of defective building materials or, indeed, workmanship.  That would also not send the right message to the industry regarding responsibility for overall compliance.  The failures in construction have arisen largely because of inadequate design, poor workmanship, the use of improper products or a combination of all of these factors.  The significant reforms announced tonight are aimed at addressing all of these issues.</p> <p> I thank the committee members for their time and their analysis of building standards, building controls and consumer protection.  As the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, indicated earlier, we can subscribe to many of the principles in the report.  We believe that the building control reform agenda and other initiatives under way provide a full and comprehensive roadmap to embedding a culture of real compliance within the construction industry.  I thank the committee and acknowledge the engagement, commitment and determination of the local authority sector and industry stakeholders.  That has been instrumental in shaping and implementing this reform agenda and changing the culture of the construction industry.</p></speech>

I thank all of the contributors for the ways in which they put forward their ideas and solutions for us to compile this report.  We as a cross-party Oireachtas joint committee have regular engagement with a wide range of stakeholders.  I refer to chartered surveyors, the Royal Institute of Architects of Ireland, the Construction Industry Federation, local authorities, Department officials, and Ms Sarah Neary, who is a regular visitor and contributor to a huge number of the policies that we want to implement.</p>  <p>  We work on a wide range of policies to make sure that the standard of development in this country will be high going forward instead of what we had in previous decades.  Numerous policies have been put in place in compliance and certification, the building control (construction industry register Ireland) Bill, CIRI, the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014, BCAR, and the building control management system, BCM.  Other policies have been put in place to remedy the problems we had in the past and to make sure that the standard going forward is the highest we can possibly implement.</p>  <p>  This report is one of the many that the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government has published and will be publishing.  We are working on a cross-party policy on housing for older people, assisted living and independent living.  We have always been a solution-focused committee.  I have said before that while we might differ on the way we get to those solutions, we all want the same outcome: to provide a safe roof over people's heads wherever they live in the country.  We all want to make sure that the standards are adhered to and regularly checked.  Many of the policies put in place will make sure that happens.  We must promote, as the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, has said, a culture of good practice and accountability and give great transparency for purchasers.  We are on the road to doing that and have implemented it in many ways.</p>  <p>  The roles of all involved and the delivery of homes must comply with all of the codes of practice.  I refer in particular to continued engagement with local authorities during construction to make sure that is being closely monitored.  The building control reform agenda and other initiatives that are under way provide a full and comprehensive roadmap to embedding a culture of real compliance within the construction industry.  I look forward to the ongoing engagement.  As committee members, we have two to three in-depth meetings each week and it has been a massive challenge for the Department and the committee.</p>  <p>  We have a very good working relationship with ongoing open communication and dialogue to make those solutions happen.  I look forward to the ongoing positive engagement we have.  I thank all the committee members for their commitment and for the time they give.  That is not only in committee but in the time before that.  A huge amount of preparatory work goes on.  A huge level of data have to be collated and the Department is very good at giving us all the information we require.  The Library and Research Service here helped us to form these policies not to sit on a shelf but to be implemented.  That is where we are different.  We are going to make sure that they are implemented so that we all have the standard of development in this country that people desire.</p></speech>

We tried at the committee right throughout this debate to keep it non-partisan and non-political.  That is one of the reasons the report has such strength.  The speech from the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, however, was very disappointing.  It was also disappointing that an almost identical speech was read by the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, in effect reading the same speech a second time.  It speaks to the problem where somebody tells us they agree with the principles of something but they do not agree with the practical proposals made.  That often says that they do not really agree with the principles of the report.  I accept that the Minister and all of the officials in the Department want to see the strongest possible building control regime.  They want to ensure that we do not go back to the mistakes of the past.</p>  <p>  The committee has not made these kinds of recommendations lightly nor have we made them without careful consideration of all of the information and opinions before us.  Many of the recommendations in this report were recommended to us by experts in the field.  It was on that basis that we made them.  I want to make a few specific responses to the Minister's speech.  Nobody proposed a new quango.  Nobody on our committee wanted to set up a body for no reason.  Just as the Environmental Protection Agency and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland provide an exceptionally important service to the State, we fundamentally believe that a building control and consumer protection agency is needed.  It could be a small and light agency, not unlike the other two that I have mentioned.  It could provide real added value, not just to local authorities but also to homeowners who find themselves in properties with difficulties.  It could provide the location for, as we said at the start, adequate provision of information.  Non-judicial mediation and resolution are significant issues and are issues which, unfortunately, can and probably will arise in the future, although it is hoped nowhere near the scale that we have had.</p>  <p>  On the issue of BCAR and the independence of assigned certifiers, and this is one of the things that has truly baffled me from the very start, we have never said in committee that the professionals who will work through the BCAR system are not fully professional and acting with integrity.  They are, however, employed by the developer.  That is the core of the difficulty which leads many of us to believe that it is another form of self-certification.  There is not a clear separation between the builder, the architect that the builder employs and the assigned certifiers and design certifiers.  Many of these people are part of the company of the architects employed by the developer.  That is not fully independent.  It is clearly better than the old system of certification off the plans, but it is not independent and that is why we have recommended the proposed change.  We could have said scrap BCAR altogether.  We could have said just directly employ local authority staff, but that was not a practical solution because there are assigned certifiers and design certifiers, many of whom are providing a very good quality service.  It made no sense to discard that.  Where a local authority feels that it could employ those people full time within the local authority, however, it should have that option.  Where that is not necessary, it should be able to make the decisions about which assigned certifiers and designed certifiers are employed.</p>  <p>  Legislative changes are a big problem.  The idea that the industry is using latent defects insurance more now than before and therefore we do not need to make it mandatory does not make any sense.  If everybody is doing it, then making it mandatory is not particularly controversial.  If not everybody is doing it, however, that is all the more reason it should be mandatory.  I welcome the fact that the Minister has asked the Law Reform Commission to look at other proposals we have made.  These are eminently sensible ideas that exist in other jurisdictions and we should support them.</p>  <p>  The biggest disagreement I have with the Minister is on the legacy issues and one of his concluding remarks.  He said that the failures in the construction of the past arose largely because of inadequate design, poor workmanship or the use of improper products.  I do not disagree with that.  All of that is only possible, however, if the regulatory regime within which those things happened allowed them to happen, whether intentionally or unintentionally.</p><p>The very fact that the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014 were introduced shows that the Government and the Department officials knew that the regulatory regime in place prior to 2014 was not up to scratch.  Therefore, the State has some responsibility.  We did not propose that the taxpayer would have to foot the bill for latent defects.  All we asked is that the Department and the Minister would consider a redress scheme that could be industry funded and allow homeowners to offset the costs of fire safety or water ingress latent defects against tax liabilities or that there be consideration in respect of families who might not have the means to make the changes to have a taxpayer-funded option.</p> <p> People living in certain properties and are facing bills, as Deputy Catherine Martin said, of &euro;20,000, &euro;30,000 or &euro;40,000.  Some of those individuals may have the money to cover the cost involved but they rightly believe they should not have to do so because what happened was not their fault.  However, other people, including some of the people from Beacon South Quarter who met Deputies last night, do not have the money.  They are receiving threatening letters from the management company.  They are being denied access to car-parking facilities or to other aspects of the communal areas of the developments because they do not have the money to rectify a problem for which they were not responsible.</p> <p> It is on that basis that the Government should explore the possibility of some form of a redress scheme.  It is incumbent on the Minister to at least explore the proposal I have put forward regarding the setting up of a short, three-month public consultation to listen to the very sensible ideas many people have to put such a redress scheme in place in budget 2019 to take effect from next year.  Many of us will be returning to that issue, both at the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government and in our direct engagements with the Minister and the staff of the Department.</p> <p> I thank members of the committee and the staff of the committee secretariat.  I also thank the officials from the Department who made themselves available to the committee and to me, as rapporteur, on many occasions in order that we fully understood the process.  However, it is incumbent on us not to allow this report to simply sit on a shelf and gather dust.  If even some of the changes we have proposed find their way into improving our building standards, building control and consumer protection regime, we will have done some service to those people who need our assistance and to home buyers into the future.</p></speech>
