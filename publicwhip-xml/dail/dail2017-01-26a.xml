    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-01-26a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017012600003#A00200"><p>I am pleased to have the opportunity to address the House this morning and to have the opportunity to discuss the outcome of the symphysiotomy <i>ex gratia</i>payment scheme and the report of Judge Maureen Harding Clark, assessor to the scheme.  It is fair to say we have all been touched by the stories of the women who underwent symphysiotomy and the Government&rsquo;s aim was to take as humane and dignified an approach as possible to help bring closure to as many of the women as possible.  The scheme has helped to bring that closure to a large number of women and I welcome that.  However, I will address a number of issues raised in the House on 1 December 2016, including the terms of reference for the scheme, the issue of consent by women undergoing a symphysiotomy, the level of proof required to seek awards under the scheme and the right to appeal.  I will do so during the course of this speech, as well as setting out the background to the establishment of the scheme.</p><p>Following examination of two earlier independent reports commissioned by my Department, it was agreed by the Government in July 2014 to establish an <i>ex gratia</i>scheme for women who underwent a surgical symphysiotomy.  The surgical symphysiotomy payment scheme was established in November 2014 following engagement by the then Minister for Health with the three patient advocacy groups that support women who underwent the procedure.  It is an important point for the House to note in our discussions today that two of those advocacy groups welcomed the Government-approved scheme.  One of those groups has stated its clients were happy to have been vindicated and to have had their suffering acknowledged.  This support group also indicated that they had positive feedback concerning the scheme from the women and their families, and it stressed the importance of providing redress for the women, given the older age group to which many of the women belong.  This group has indicated that it supported in excess of 250 of the  women in 2015.  One advocacy group rejected the scheme and continued to advocate for court settlements for the women.  The scheme provided an alternative, non-adversarial and person-centred option for women, many of whom were elderly and did not wish to pursue their cases through the courts.</p><p>As Deputies are aware, the first independent report commissioned by my Department was undertaken by Professor Oonagh Walsh.  Professor Walsh is a renowned medico-social historian with a special interest in female medical history.  Professor Walsh outlined the history of symphysiotomy in Ireland and recommended that an <i>ex gratia</i>scheme be established.  Importantly, Professor Walsh&rsquo;s research also included a national public consultation process with the women themselves and with other interested bodies.  The Walsh report noted that symphysiotomy was an exceptional and rare intervention in obstetric practice in Ireland.  The procedure was used in mild to moderate disproportion and in obstructed labour.  It occurred in less than 0.05% of deliveries between 1940 and 1985.  The report estimates that approximately 1,500 symphysiotomy procedures were undertaken in Irish hospitals and that there were approximately 350 women still living who underwent the  procedure.  The second report was prepared by Judge Yvonne Murphy, who was commissioned by the Government in 2013 to undertake a further independent review on the legal aspects of symphysiotomy in Ireland.  Judge Murphy advised the Government on the merits and costs of proceeding with an <i>ex gratia</i>scheme relative to taking no action and allowing the court process to proceed.  Once again, Judge Murphy recommended that an <i>ex gratia</i>scheme be established.</p><p>Regarding the issue of consent, based on the evidence available to the Department of Health, it appears that in a number of cases the procedure was carried out without a woman's knowledge or consent.</p><p>However, this was not the case in all hospitals.  It would also appear that the lapse of time, the demise of the clinicians involved and the paucity of records may have made it difficult to establish whether reasonable efforts to obtain consent were made.  Hospital records in some instances showed that it was an elective procedure.  The data on symphysiotomies in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda include a high number of elective procedures, which would have been carried out with patient consent.  A total of 20% of respondents to Professor Walsh during her research were private patients.<br/><br/>Until the 1960s, it was common for many women in the Dublin area in particular to only present for a hospital delivery once complications had set in.  Professor Walsh alluded to cases where patients had been in labour for extraordinarily long periods before admission to hospital.  A labour period of 50 hours was high but not exceptional in those early years.  Judge Yvonne Murphy found that a court was not likely to hold that it was necessary to have obtained an informed consent in unexpected lifesaving emergency situations of obstructed delivery during labour.<br/><br/>Judge Harding Clark provided a comprehensive report and we now have available a thorough overview of the historical and medical context of symphysiotomy in the country.  The report included several appendices containing information gleaned by Judge Harding Clark and her team during the operation of the scheme.  Appendix I includes information on radiological imaging used in the assessment of symphysiotomy, entitled Symphysiotomy &amp;amp; Pubiotomy Review - an Imaging Perspective.  Two further appendices contain historical documentation relevant to symphysiotomy in Ireland.  Appendix II contains extracts from the Transactions of the Royal Academy of Medicine in Ireland between 1943 and 1967.  Appendix III contains extracts from the annual clinical reports of four major maternity hospitals: the National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street; the Rotunda; the Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital; and Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda.  It also contains medical papers published between 1940 and 1960.  Contrary to some reports in the media, the information provided in appendix II and appendix III shows that symphysiotomy was not a secret procedure at the time.  In fact, it was debated and discussed in many medical papers by eminent physicians.<br/><br/>The total cost of the symphysiotomy payment scheme was a little under &euro;34 million and payments of &euro;50,000, &euro;100,000 or &euro;150,000 were made to 399 women who met the criteria for awards.  All of the women have received their respective payments, totalling &euro;29.85 million.  The majority of claimants were aged over 75 years and payments were made to women between the ages of 51 and 96 years.  Many women took legal advice and the scheme provided for payment of their legal costs.  The total legal costs were a little under &euro;2.1 million.  A breakdown of amounts paid to the solicitors involved is available in appendix V of Judge Harding Clark's report.  A little under &euro;1.25 million was expended on administrative costs.  These included rent, telephone, fees and salaries, office equipment and supplies, utilities and broadband.<br/><br/>The scheme was designed to be simple, straightforward and non-adversarial.  It was designed to offer to women an alternative to pursuing their cases through the courts if they so wished.  The women were not expected to give oral testimonies, unlike in a court setting.  Although the scheme was non-adversarial, the provisions took into account that women may have wished to consult a solicitor and take legal advice and assistance in submitting applications to the scheme.  In the interests of accountability, the scheme required each applicant to prove that she had a surgical symphysiotomy or pubiotomy to be considered for the assessment of an award.  The level of proof required to qualify for an award was clearly set out in the terms of the scheme.  It is important to note that the proof required was, rightly, considerably lower than the burden of proof that would have been required by a court.  Judge Harding Clark worked with each woman or her legal representative to locate medical records.  When she considered it necessary, Judge Harding Clark met some of the women in different parts of the country.  Where claims could not be reconciled with established facts, women were examined by relevant medical experts.  Judge Harding Clark encouraged women who believed they had undergone a symphysiotomy to apply to the scheme, advising them that they did not give up their right to pursue their cases through the courts.  It was only on accepting an award under the scheme that a woman had to discontinue her legal proceedings.  The vast majority of women opted to do so.<br/><br/>The scheme was administered to the highest standards in line with its terms of reference.  The scheme had an independent website to provide advice, assistance and information to interested persons as the scheme progressed.  Applicants and their family members could contact the office of the scheme by telephone.  Where an applicant was too infirm to apply herself, applications were accepted by proxy on her behalf.  All awards were transferred electronically to the applicant's account.  Importantly, at the end of the scheme, all applications and supporting documents were returned to the applicants or were confidentially shredded in line with the wishes of each applicant.  The scheme did not hold any original medical records.<br/><br/>In order to undertake her role under her terms of reference in an informed manner, Judge Harding Clark drew on the professional expertise of certain medical specialists.  These clinicians specialised in the areas of obstetrics, radiology, orthopaedic surgery, pelvic injury and urology.  They advised on the scheme throughout the process.  This ensured an effective, fair and well-informed method of assessment of the applicants by means of a comprehensive clinical case review in line with best practice, whenever this was required.  Many hundreds of hours were spent examining the medical records of applicants.  Each application received individual and careful assessment.  Medical evidence was sought to explain delivery records.  When claims could not be reconciled with established facts, the applicant was examined by relevant clinical experts.  Some applicants were examined by several experts.<br/><br/>When all efforts failed to obtain records, the scheme moved to seeking secondary proof of symphysiotomy by evidence of a scar and radiology evidence.  In 12 especially difficult applications, Judge Harding Clark held a discussion conference between her medical team and the medical expert representing the women.  Consensus was reached based on the medical facts in each case.  Out of almost 600 applicants, 185 women were unable to establish that they had a surgical symphysiotomy.  The report states that all of these applicants were assisted by members of the team in trying to establish their claims.  The resources relating to the scheme were applied in rigorous investigations before a claim was declared ineligible for the scheme.  On reading Judge Harding Clark's report, I get a real sense that the team and the judge worked with each applicant to try to establish facts, obtain records and ensure that an applicant to the scheme had every support and opportunity to have records and medical evidence presented.<br/><br/>A total of 23 women experienced a spontaneous symphysiotomy during birth.  While this condition is not particularly common, it is well recognised.  These women did not quality for an award under the terms of the scheme because they did not have a surgical symphysiotomy.<br/><br/>Pubiotomy is a distinctly different procedure to symphysiotomy.  It was also included in the scope of the scheme at the request of the support groups.  Pubiotomy was frequently claimed by applicants but was established in only one case.  Significant disability was established in that case.<br/><br/>It should also be noted that medical services, including medical cards, are facilitated for the women by HSE-nominated symphysiotomy liaison officers based throughout the country, regardless of whether a women has availed of the scheme.<br/><br/>In July 2014 one of the advocacy groups made representations to the UN Human Rights Committee concerning symphysiotomy.  Ireland takes its membership of international organisations seriously.  The country is absolutely committed to human rights.  This is why we always engage with these processes in a meaningful way through providing information and updates, responding to recommendations and attending reviews held by these organisations.  This gives us an opportunity to set out the Government position on Human Rights.  Shortly, we will provide more details about the scheme to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women.  While the Government notes the comments made by the UN on symphysiotomy, it believes that the provision of the <i>ex gratia</i>scheme and the ongoing provision of medical services by the HSE represent a comprehensive response to this issue.<br/><br/>My Department has received the report that one of the support groups, Survivors of Symphysiotomy, has submitted to the UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, which has symphysiotomy on the agenda for its meeting on 15 February.  There are serious inaccuracies in this report that cannot go without comment.  The opening paragraphs refer to women having their pelvises broken during childbirth.  A symphysiotomy does not involve breaking the pelvis.  The procedure involves cutting the fibrous cartilage of the pubic joint.  The report to the UN claims that no independent or thorough investigation has been carried out in Ireland into the practice of symphysiotomy.  The contrary is the case, and I have already set out the background to the thorough work which has been done on the matter, most recently by Judge Harding Clark, but by others before her as well.<br/><br/>I urge anyone who wishes to get a fair and balanced view on the issue of symphysiotomy to read Judge Harding Clark's report.  She was unfettered by Government in completing her work.  She could have simply administered a payment scheme, and she would have been able to do so and fulfil the terms of reference.  However, she chose to use her judicial skills and experience and that of her clinical team to examine all aspects of the issue and to review the evidence collected in the two years of her work.  The report states that my Department has refused to supply information concerning the research conducted by Professor Leo Lawler, consultant radiologist at the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, visiting consultant at the Rotunda Hospital and a member of Judge Harding Clark's clinical advisory team.</p><p>This is not correct.  My Department was not involved in this study and therefore it has no further details other than the documents we have supplied in response to a recent freedom of information request.<br/><br/>It is important to emphasise the importance which we place on patient safety and quality in our modern maternity services.  Ensuring that quality of patient care is at the heart of our health services and that we keep our patients at the centre of the provision of our services is key.  We must continually learn and work to make our services safer.  One year ago, my Department published Ireland&rsquo;s first national maternity strategy in a concrete demonstration of a new, enhanced and long overdue focus on maternity care at both policy and service delivery level.  Just before Christmas, I launched the new HIQA national maternity standards.  Taken together, these initiatives provide a roadmap for how we can continue to improve maternity and neonatal care in the years ahead to promote and assure safe, standardised and high-quality care.  In addition, I am pleased to note that all maternity services are now reporting monthly maternity patient safety statements and are participating in national data collections, including the Irish maternity indicator system.<br/><br/>More broadly, my Department remains fully committed to progressing a programme of major patient safety reforms.  These measures are focused on legislation, the establishment of a national patient advocacy service, the introduction of a patient safety surveillance system, extending the clinical effectiveness agenda, commencing a national patient experience survey and setting up a national advisory council for patient safety.  In December, I launched our new national patient safety office, which will be the driver behind many of these reforms.  Within the programme of legislation we intend to progress the licensing of our public and private hospitals, the health information and patient safety Bill and provisions for open disclosure.<br/><br/>In conclusion, the brief given to Judge Clark in November 2014 was not an easy one.  At that time, the advice to the Department of Health was that many women would face an uphill struggle in proving their claims in the courts and we did not want women to have to face that uphill struggle.  Each woman would face an uncertain outcome, as each case would be adjudicated by the courts on its individual merits.  We now know that this is the truth.  For example, in one of the small number of cases that have gone through the courts, the judge in that case found that even though the woman had a symphysiotomy 12 days before her baby was born in 1963, this procedure was &ldquo;not a practice without justification&rdquo; at that time.  This <i>ex gratia</i>scheme was to avoid the adversarial courts-based system.  Judge Clark's independent report is a thorough body of work and I hope the implementation of this scheme has helped to bring closure to many women.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-01-26a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1229" speakername="Billy Kelleher" time="10:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017012600005#C00500"><p>I welcome the fact that the House and the Government established an <i>ex gratia</i>payment scheme.  We said at the outset that an adversarial court procedure in the context of individuals having to go to court to vindicate their rights was something that we had grave concerns about.  As alluded to by the Minister, the fact that every individual case would be taken on its merits and individually assessed by a court, with awards granted or not, would have been unfair to many of the survivors of symphysiotomy.</p><p>Reading the report, there is no doubt that some of the language could be seen to be abrasive if one looks at it in the context of where some of the survivors are coming from.  It is hard-hitting.  When one goes through the whole report, it does sit a little bit uncomfortably at times.  Of course, the reality is that some women did not experience symphysiotomies in their time but we should also be conscious that they may have had very difficult labours and that it was many years ago.  There were very few supports and services available to women who had forceps deliveries and extended labours of sometimes up to 50 hours, which would not have been uncommon at that time.  There were very few supports available to those women after birth.  That is an issue that is acknowledged in the assessments of Judge Yvonne Murphy and Judge Maureen Clark of people who went through very difficult experiences.</p><p>As has been said in this Chamber, there is no doubt that symphysiotomy was quite a barbaric practice and was continuing long after it was no longer seen to be a conventional medical intervention across the western world.  It continued for a longer period of time in Ireland than elsewhere.  It must be acknowledged that for whatever reasons, some obstetricians continued the practice when it was no longer deemed to be a recognised intervention for a complicated delivery.  That is certainly something of which we must be conscious.  We failed to bring forward supports both for these women and in the context of the wider maternity services, which left a lot to be desired for many years.  There was no proper oversight.  Peer assessment and peer review of obstetricians, practices and outcomes were not what they are today.  Leaping forward in time to our modern maternity services, there needs to be a consistent underpinning of standards in the delivery of care, as well as for professional clinicians, peer assessment, peer review and in the oversight of HIQA, which is critically important.</p><p>Some people are still very unhappy with this report.  Let us be clear about that.  Survivors of symphysiotomy have issued a very hard-hitting statement.  We have to acknowledge equally that many women are satisfied that it was an opportunity for their rights to be vindicated and for compensation to be paid.  The payments themselves range from &euro;50,000 to &euro;150,000.  It had been anticipated that in the region of 350 women would apply for the scheme, but, in fact, 590 applied.  Around 400 women, I think it was 403, were awarded some form of redress in compensation.</p><p>Judge Clark encouraged women who believed they had had a symphysiotomy to apply to the scheme, advising them that they did not give up their right to pursue their case and vindicate their right through the courts.  I believe that is critically important.  There were concerns that if people entered the scheme, they would lose their right and entitlement to vindicate themselves in a court of law.  Of course, as the Minister pointed out at the end of his speech, there was a case in which a person did go to court.  A symphysiotomy had been carried out but no compensation was offered and her right was not vindicated.  It does put into perspective the risk for women who were damaged by symphysiotomy in going to court and having their case individually assessed.  We said at the very outset of the scheme and the establishment of same that its purpose was for people to have their rights vindicated, for compensation and redress to be given and for the money to go to the victims as opposed to their legal representatives in very expensive court cases.</p><p>Judge Clark's report contains very hard-hitting language in many aspects, but she does refer to the issue of some people making applications based on evidence presented by others who were successful in their claims in court and things like that.  A huge number of women suffered appallingly at the hands of the maternity services in Ireland in a previous time.  It would be shameful and distasteful, to say the very least, if a small number of people were using the misery and the trauma that was visited on those women to try to seek redress.  Even if there was only one or two, it would be shameful.  The last thing we need to do is undermine the traumatic stories that people told us.  Listening to the evidence was utterly traumatic, to be truthful.  We met them in the AV room and listened to some of those affected.  It was exceptionally difficult just to listen to their stories of what they endured.  Let us be honest, the vast majority of them were vindicated in the context of their applications to the <i>ex gratia</i>payment scheme.  We have to put that in context.  It would be remiss of me to not accept the fact that there may have been a very small minority who used the tragic circumstances of symphysiotomy and the scheme itself to try to seek redress for themselves for ulterior motives.</p><p>The UN Human Rights Committee recommended that &quot;the State party should initiate a prompt, independent and thorough investigation into cases of symphysiotomy, prosecute and punish the perpetrators, including medical personnel, and provide an effective remedy to the survivors of symphysiotomy for the damage sustained, including fair and adequate compensation and rehabilitation, on an individualized basis&quot;.</p><p>In that context we have done some of it.  Whether or not the D&aacute;il or Government would consider the prosecution and punishment of perpetrators, that would not necessarily be a role for us as legislators, but we must continue to ensure rehabilitation for the individuals.  The fair and adequate compensation that was awarded through the<i>ex gratia </i>payment has been accepted by a lot of the survivors of symphysiotomy, but we still have a substantial group that feels dissatisfied with the report in its entirety, and not only the <i>ex gratia</i>payment.  They are also dissatisfied with the recommendations made in the report prior to that by Judge Yvonne Murphy's.  It is a difficult issue to address to try to ensure everyone feels they could embrace this particular scheme, and that is regrettable.  I sincerely hope we do not end up with people going to the courts continually with some of them finding that they will not get redress or compensation there.  That is something we did not want to happen but it looks like it will happen now, unfortunately, for some people who did not embrace the scheme in that context.<br/><br/>We must be mindful of the language that was used in the report.  While it was hard hitting and direct, in some areas one could say it was abrasive.  Ms Justice Maureen Harding Clark used her judicial experience, of which there is no doubt, but it was very direct.  I want to put on the record that we must be very mindful that there were a huge number of women who were badly damaged at the hands of the health services at the time and we should never lose sight of that.  We can sometimes get caught up in what was said in the report with regard to the 185 women who did not qualify for the scheme, but that does not mean that many of those 185 women did not endure some form of traumatic experience at the hands of the health services in the context of difficult labours, forceps deliveries and almost no supports after the births of the kind that would be offered nowadays.  We must also acknowledge the fact of postnatal depression, an area of which people are now very conscious.  Back then, however, it was not even discussed.  Many women are still damaged that have not received redress through this scheme.</p></speech>

We believe the scheme was a genuine attempt to try to bring a resolution to this matter.  Many of the findings of the report made for very distressing reading.  The practice of symphysiotomy had stopped In other countries for many years but, unfortunately, continued for some time later in Ireland.  The procedure has caused debilitating physical, psychological and huge emotional side effects for many women who have had decades of medical problems as a result.  It is to be hoped they will be able to access the treatment and supports they so badly need.  Unfortunately, four of the women passed away before the report was published.  Thankfully, symphysiotomy is no longer an accepted practice in obstetrics and it is crucial that the medical professions have learnt lessons from the past.</p><p>In 2014, the UN Human Rights Committee recommended that, &ldquo;The State party should initiate a prompt, independent and thorough investigation into cases of symphysiotomy, prosecute and punish the perpetrators, including medical personnel, and provide an effective remedy to the survivors of symphysiotomy for the damage sustained, including fair and adequate compensation and rehabilitation, on an individualized basis.&rdquo;  Ms Justice Maureen Harding Clark&rsquo;s report on the surgical symphysiotomy <i>ex gratia</i>payment scheme was published in November.  The scheme was aimed at women who underwent a surgical symphysiotomy in the State between 1940 and 1990.  It had been anticipated that in the region of 350 women would apply to the scheme, but in fact 590 applications were received.  Ms Justice Harding Clark encouraged women who believed they had had a symphysiotomy to apply to the scheme, advising them that they did not give up their right to pursue their case through the courts.  I would like now to read an extract from the report:</p><blockquote>All objective evidence received or obtained was carefully considered and any doubt was applied in an applicant&rsquo;s favour.  If an applicant identified a specific disability, her subsequent delivery records and her GP records were examined for evidence of any treatment or investigation capable of supporting the fact of that disability.  The applicant&rsquo;s personal statement was reviewed and considered in the totality of the evidence.  That is not to say that all statements and reports were accepted uncritically.</blockquote><p>I must confess to a feeling of sadness for those applicants who somehow believed that they were victims who had survived a symphysiotomy only to learn that they were mistaken and that their recollections were based on error.  Elderly women should not have to face such emotional turmoil.  I have no doubt that some of them spent good money presenting their claims, which cannot be recouped.  Those who have been active in representing themselves as victims to the media must now retrace their lives and this, understandably, must be upsetting.</p></speech>

It is hoped that the findings will quell the hurt and anger of the elderly women who have undergone the procedure and that this subject will now be laid to rest."  With these words Judge Maureen Harding Clark concluded her chapter 1 overview before addressing the costs of the scheme and recording her thanks to those who assisted her over the two years of her role as judicial assessor over the surgical symphysiotomy payment scheme.  Harding Clark seeks to assure the public at large that she conducted her role with objectivity and compassion.  There is scant evidence of this claim in the pages of her report and there is none at all in their harrowing accounts of their experiences of the process and their reaction to Harding Clark's "insulting and wounding commentary", by several of the survivors.</p>  <p>  Judge Harding Clark's brief was, I understood, to preside over the assessment of claims of those who were subjected to surgical symphysiotomy, to determine the legitimacy of claims made as best the women's testimony and available records would allow, to evaluate the extent of discomfort or disability arising from the procedure and to award the applicant accordingly in line with the three categories of payment prescribed from the outset of the scheme.  I was not aware that Judge Harding Clark had been commissioned to provide a history of symphysiotomy or pubiotomy, but she has.  I was not aware that Judge Harding Clark had been commissioned to evaluate the long-term effects of symphysiotomy on those who were subjected to the procedure, but she has.</p>  <p>  Judge Harding Clark describes the payment scheme she was commissioned to oversee as "an ex gratia, non-adverserial scheme".  She goes on to state that "once symphysiotomy...was established, a compassionate and generous view would be applied to the assessment of each claim".  It is possible that some who applied under the terms of the scheme would view Judge Harding Clark's disposition towards them as compassionate and generous but not all of them would, nor near all by any means.  The tone of Judge Harding Clark's report shows little empathy with the claimant women.  Many of them, we know from their testimonies before us in the Houses of the Oireachtas and elsewhere, have lived a life of reduced capacity, discomfort and the presence of embarrassing side effects.</p>  <p>  Judge Harding Clark acknowledges that 142 of the 183 women who were awarded the higher payments were assessed as having suffered "significant disability", yet she goes on to state in the subsequent page that "The majority of applicants who underwent symphysiotomy made a good recovery".  That must surely be a comfort for the cadre of obstetricians who have defended their and their colleagues' actions in years past.</p><p> How far in the past, however?  A footnote on page 18 speculates it is possible that one or two symphysiotomy procedures were carried out in 2003-04 at the Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda.  Members take note.  That is in 21st century Ireland.  What I find most galling of all is that Judge Harding Clark did not interview all of the claimant women as declared.  Based on her so-called findings, and with an eye of deference towards the consultant representative body and the reputations of its members, past and present, she stated that the evidence before her "did not confirm that symphysiotomy inevitably leads to lifelong pain or disability or [that] those symphysiotomy patients aged in a manner which was different to those of non-symphysiotomy women."  I assure Judge Harding Clark that there was a difference.  It was there in the lives lived and in the daily reality of those women for a lifetime.</p> <p> I wish to place on record what Judge Harding Clark did not hear and did not seek to hear, namely, the story, in part, of a woman whose documentation alone secured her a payment under the scheme but who, like so many others, was not heard.  I will refer to her as "Rose", which is not her real name.  Rose was taken into an empty ward at midnight.  They strapped up her legs and began sawing her pelvis under a local anaesthetic, while a doctor leaned across her to block out her view.  She remembers the terror as the felt the sensation of the sawing and there was an eerie silence among the six to eight people in the room, only broken by one of the students asking something about the severity of the operation.  At no time did anyone explain what they were doing, either before or after.  Rose was expecting the child to be born but was told the child would not be born now, leaving her thinking the worst.  They then gave her an injection to put her to sleep.  When she began to wake some hours later, they were holding a mask across her mouth which put her out again.  When she came around, she was no longer pregnant but there was no baby to be seen.  Although her husband and sister tried to assure her that the baby had been born, such was her condition, the hospital did not bring the baby to her for two days.  Therefore, as well as her physical pain, she suffered the mental anguish of fearing the worst for those two days.  She also had an E. coli infection from the symphysiotomy.</p> <p> Released from hospital, Rose had to move from her home in Dublin and live with her parents in another location because it took six months before she could walk properly and look after the baby on her own.  The pain in her lower back and hips became part of her life, her daily reality for the rest of her life.  She also had some problems with incontinency.  She did not understand what had happened to her.  She miscarried her next pregnancy and subsequent pregnancies had her in nervous dread of what she might have to face giving birth.  It was only after Survivors of Symphysiotomy was set up that she realised she was not alone.  She was able to talk to others who had suppressed their horrific experiences for decades.  Her son has written to me to state that while being able to talk about what happened has been somewhat therapeutic for Rose, what he has described as Judge Harding Clark's "one-sided report" that attempts to whitewash over this shameful episode in Irish medical history has compounded the traumatic stress of these women, rather than seeking the truth, which might have gone some way to helping Rose and the other women come to terms with the consequences of their experiences.</p> <p> This report is shameful.  The character and integrity of the women has been placed in question.  Judge Harding Clark's conduct of the scheme entrusted to her has been, in the view of many, both flawed and dismissive.  Her treatment of the victims and - let there be no doubt about it - the paltry payments involved, in my opinion, as both a Deputy and as a convenor of the support group over a decade with colleagues in this Chamber, amount to a national disgrace.</p></speech>

After everything these women have been through, some suffering for over 60 years, they are effectively being re-traumatised.  Let us be honest about it.  The elderly women and their supporters believe they are being accused of dishonesty, of deceit and of making fraudulent claims.  How unfair it is that these women, one of whom is in her 90s, are left feeling their reputations and honesty are called into question and that their years of suffering are belittled.</p><p>The judge asserts that a compassionate approach was adopted in assessing the claims of these women.  Frankly, this is hard to credit.  It is worth repeating that the barbaric and controversial procedure used on an estimated 1,500 women in Ireland up to the 1980s involved the cutting of the cartilage of a pregnant woman's pelvic bone and of breaking the bone itself in some extreme cases to widen the birth canal.  The thought of it is horrific, not least for those of us who have had babies ourselves.  Many subjected to the procedure were left with long-term medical difficulties, including incontinence and chronic pain.</p><p>The UN Human Rights Committee, the only independent body which examined the issue, described the practice of symphysiotomy as being cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, amounting to torture.  Judge Harding Clark's report takes a different view, arguing that this brutal procedure was non-injurious and medically appropriate.  The consent of the patient, she further argues, was unnecessary and not required.  The UN committee also recommended that the State should identify, prosecute and punish those who had carried out these procedures without the prior consent of the women involved.  The recommendation was to identify, prosecute and punish but the State and the Government have chosen to ignore it.</p><p>This lack of accountability adds to the injustice inflicted on these women.  As is so often the case in this State, the persistent, relentless campaign for recognition and justice by a determined group of people has forced the Government towards offering some form of redress in compensation for an historic injustice.  Judge Harding Clark was appointed as an independent assessor.  She processed and assessed applications from almost 600 women who had been subjected to symphysiotomy or pubiotomy.  Judge Harding Clark examined hospital records and medical tests to verify the claims of these women.  As the Minister announced, payments were offered as redress - &euro;50,000 to those who could show they had had a symphysiotomy; &euro;100,000 to those who could link that procedure to ongoing health consequences; &euro;150,000 for pubiotomy; and so on.  The Minister referred to the non-adversarial nature of this process.  It was also, of course, <i>ex gratia</i>, which is the crucial point.</p><p>I could say so much more, but I want to finish on the following point.  Women have suffered all their lives with the consequences of a symphysiotomy.  It impacts on entire lives, on families and on physical and mental health.  This report has not healed the old wounds.  In fact, I would say it has opened up new ones.</p></speech>

Many women in our community have been left with lifelong disability and it has been a life of trauma and upset for both the women and their families.  Symphysiotomy procedures dropped off after the 1960s in most parts of the country in favour of caesarean sections, but not at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda, where they were, unfortunately, carried out right into the 1980s.</p><p>I welcome the fact many women were offered compensation under the surgical symphysiotomy <i>ex gratia</i>payments scheme but this was not the scheme the survivors or their supporters wanted after they had endured a long, hard fight to get to this stage.</p><p>Liability was never admitted by the medical profession or others, and the survivors were not afforded the opportunity to give oral evidence, to tell their story or have their voices heard.  While some women who underwent the procedure made a full recovery, many who had a symphysiotomy have suffered significant pain, illness and psychological damage as a result of the procedure.  It is only right that this is recognised by the State and by Irish society.</p> <p> It comes as a disappointment that the Harding Clark report and media coverage of it left a bad taste in some of the survivors' mouths.  There was much focus on the women who did not receive payments under the scheme and the inference is that they were confused or deluded, or even that they were lying.  This does a disservice to the women involved.  As the inquiry only accepted written evidence, it was difficult to prove that a medical procedure had taken place 60 or 70 years ago.  Doctors pass away, medical records are lost - even disposed of - and memories fade.  Many women were not even told that they had undergone a symphysiotomy and they did not realise what was the cause of their symptoms or the agony that they went through until many years later.  In the absence of medical records, the scheme employed radiological evidence and medical assessments.  Survivors of symphysiotomy have stated that this type of evidence is not conclusive for a myriad of reasons, for instance, scars fade, the gap in the pelvis made by this procedure can heal itself.  Women have endured a long history as second-class citizens but the Harding Clark report did not do justice to many of the survivors of symphysiotomy.</p></speech>

First, I again extend my sympathy to all of the women who were affected by this.</p>  <p>  I have read the different reports, including the report of the socio-medical historian, Professor Oonagh Walsh, who goes into the history of it.  This was in Ireland, where there was no legal access to contraception and where the question of the mother being subsequently perhaps able to deliver multiple babies successfully was a key element of socio-medical strategy.  This was part of the background to what happened in maternity hospitals.  Also, the great privacy attaching to pregnancy, which still pertains for instance in most of the developing world where there is very little discussion it is fairly secretive.  Once women have a baby successfully delivered, very often what most people want is to forget as much as possible as quickly as possible.  That pertains to this day.  We have practices which in future years may be looked back upon where we have a lot of arrangements around very high numbers of Caesarian sections, which are running close to 30%, without a huge amount of discussion.  It is true that while for some women delivering a baby is not only a happy and joyful event, it can also be relatively speedy and less painful than it is for a certain proportion of women on the other end of the spectrum for whom, even today, delivery can be extraordinarily and exceptionally painful.</p>  <p>  When I was part of the then Government that discussed this, I was of the view that the redress approach should not be the same as an inquiry, that it should be a redress scheme which would be set up and which would invite women who were affected to go through the procedure to seek to get their redress.  Let me say why I take that position.  I have just heard Members suggesting there should have been a more court-based adversarial process.  I personally knew many affected by the different inquiries into children who were held in institutions, in some cases as adult women in Magdalen institutions for the greater parts of their lives.  While some are robust in going through procedures and telling their stories, for others, who are both fragile and damaged, it is an incredibly difficult experience where not only must they share with whatever the procedure is but then they must explain to their families and children something which, like this procedure, they may never have explained previously.  Setting up a process that would allow women to be compensated was certainly uppermost in my mind and the Labour Party's mind, given that we were coming off a long period.  In 2003, as I recall, Deputy Mich&eacute;al Martin was Minister for Health.  The Deputy is a compassionate person but he did not do anything to address the stories that were coming forward then.  That happened over a long period of time.  It was put to one side.  Really, it was not addressed until the various more detailed examinations which were undertaken, starting with Professor Walsh's report, going on to the good report done by Judge Yvonne Murphy and then the redress scheme administered by Judge Harding Clark.</p>  <p>  What is interesting about the scheme is that, initially, it was thought - this was following on two previous detailed expert reports - that approximately 350 women would apply.  In fact, there were 950 applications.  That is no one's fault.  Inevitably, when a scheme is advertised those who feel they were affected as well as those who perhaps had been involved in different groups over a long period of time campaigning on it would, of course, go forward.  It is also interesting how many awards were made.  Liability was established in over 400 cases.  That is a shocking figure.  In that sense, the scheme dealt with and made awards to far more women than were even anticipated would come forward when it was set up at the outset.</p>  <p>  There have been comments here about the fact that awards were classified in groups by amounts awarded but that is often done internationally where one is making a scheme easy to access.  It is quite a sensible approach to take because it lessens the trauma for most of those concerned.  We need to be honest about that.  We have had so many cases in here of women who have been accused of sexual abuse who have been thrashed on social media because of what they have said, and we have discussed that here.  I entirely disagree with the idea that these most private matters would be entirely in the public domain and before a court-type procedure because of the cases of those of whom I am aware who either chose or did not choose to go before court-type procedures on previous occasions.</p>  <p>  Three-hundred and thirty-nine applications received awards, 166 of which were awarded &euro;100,000.  I am not saying that in any way compensates for what the women suffered but it is a significant sum.  Some 15 assessments involved awards of &euro;150,000 because those women suffered potentially significant disability which, as the House will be aware from the women's testimonies, affect their lives in profound ways.</p>  <p>  What do we do as a consequence of learning this?</p><p>I suggest that we invite the authors of the various reports to make presentations to the Oireachtas health committee and to have a discussion with the members about the history, with due regard to the sensitivities of people who suffered in this way.  That would be a valuable public exercise in terms of education.</p> <p> We should consider this as well in today's context.  About three weeks ago I sat with over 20 women in a hospital and rehabilitation centre in Dar es Salaam in Tanzania in east Africa, where I worked in the 1980s.  I wish to speak particularly to all the women who are present, because this is very much a women's concern.  In Africa and in most of the developing world, the follow-on and current day practices to which symphysiotomy relates is called fistula.  This is where after a delivery, as a consequence of vaginal or rectal damage, a woman basically becomes incontinent in respect of urine and, in some dreadful cases, in respect of faeces as well.  It is truly horrifying because in many countries and societies, women to whom that happens are ostracised and shunned as though they have done something wrong.  We never had such a history in Ireland; we would never do that.  When we are looking at the past through the prism of the present sometimes we do not sufficiently recall what Ireland was like and what the different forces of authority in Ireland were.  In any event, we should point out here today that where parallel practices continue to be staple treatments for women who are being delivered of babies in the developing world, this country in its development programmes should help in trying to provide recovery for the women and girls affected.</p> <p> Of the approximately 23 women I spoke to in Dar es Salaam, who had all had potentially life-saving operations to correct what had happened in a recent childbirth, about seven were teenagers.  The youngest was around 15 years of age.  As we in Ireland seek to address a dreadful wrong and what women here suffered in the past, we must also thank those women for telling us about it and for sharing what happened to them with later generations of women.  The eldest of the women who received the awards was 91 years old while the youngest was 51.  All of us would like to believe that the services in Ireland have moved on dramatically, but we should not forget that this type of dangerous event during pregnancy is still very prevalent in much of the developing world.</p> <p> The other voices that are missing from the debate in Ireland are those of midwives.  People who have watched the popular television programme "Call the Midwife", which is based on Jennifer Worth's memoir of being a midwife in the east end of London in the 1950s, will be aware that it was the development of the British National Health Service by Aneurin Bevan, the great Labour Party Minister, which brought an end to some of the terrible practices of that time, as outlined in the books and the television series.</p> <p> I propose that the authors of these detailed reports be invited to appear before the committee.  I am pleased that hundreds of women have received some redress.  I hope it has helped them in their lives.  It will not have cancelled out what happened to them but, hopefully, it will have given some comfort to them and their children.  We should also be proud of the Irish development aid programme, which partly sponsors the hospital and facility I visited.  Thousands of women's lives are being saved every year partly through the development money that Irish taxpayers contribute through their taxes.  In that way they are bringing an end to parallel sufferings that, unfortunately, women are still undergoing.  The tragedy, both then and now, is that when these things happen in a maternity case the baby is often lost as well.  The woman is not only physically damaged but her capacity to have children is also severely damaged.  Again, that is an enormous heartache for people.  It was in the past and it is now.</p></speech>

The report is unbalanced, flawed and not objective.  It should not be accepted and promoted by the Government.  The report was released before Christmas but we are only discussing it at the end of January because a number of Deputies intervened and demanded that it be discussed in the D&aacute;il.  In the meantime, some in the Catholic right, the media and the medical establishment have seized on the report and used it as an opportunity to cleanse what happened in the past and to pretend it was not so bad.  The message being conveyed in the last month or so is that the women concerned were not believed then and will not be believed now.  That is shocking and outrageous.</p><p>Judge Harding Clark's report came up with the concept of alternative facts before Donald Trump even thought about it.  The Government, Fianna F&aacute;il and the Labour Party should think very seriously before giving this report their <i>imprimatur</i>.  The Irish State has an appalling record in dealing with women's health, women's bodies and women's lives.  Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Labour Party have all participated in Governments which took decisions to relegate women's health in general, to sub-contract women's bodies to the church and its institutions and to challenge in the courts women who were making claims against the State for abuse and injury.  Before they consider signing off on this report, they should recall the other chapters in a very bad saga.  Those chapters include the Magdalen laundries and the mother and baby prisons - we should stop calling them homes because that gives them a cosy sounding name.  There is the export of the abortion trail, where women with crisis pregnancies are shunned out of the country.  The death of Savita Halappanavar is another chapter.  Of course, let us not forget the glorious plot, with denial and fighting to the very end, against the anti-D women who were poisoned by a State institution.  Key figures in this Government and D&aacute;il who played a role in that shameful episode 20 years ago are potentially playing a role now in respect of symphysiotomy.</p><p>Let us be clear and frank about what is happening here.  A process was commissioned by the D&aacute;il that was supposed to be restorative for women damaged by medical professionals, church and State.  Instead, a flawed report is being seized on by the same establishment and ardent Catholic commentators to give the impression that it was not that bad, that was how things were then and a woman's lot was hard everywhere.  However, let nobody fool themselves.  Ireland was not a normal European country then with its maternity practices, and nobody should fool themselves that it is a normal European country now with the eighth amendment and the continuation of utterly condescending patriarchal maternity practices.  I can give two quick examples.  The heads of the hospitals that look after women giving birth are still called &quot;masters&quot;.  Some of them are archbishops, such as the chairman of the board of the National Maternity Hospital as a result of an Act that Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Labour Party have not bothered to repeal in 80 years.</p><p>Instead of restorative justice to damaged women, is what we are seeing in this case an attempt by the Government to spin this story out until the last of the aging symphysiotomy women die?  Frankly, that is how it appears.  There is disdain in this report on the part of the judge towards the women.</p><p>She used language such as that they were "amenable to ... emotional contagion", subject to "acquired group memory" and "self convincing confabulation of personal history".  The women were subjected to symphysiotomy because of patronising and patriarchal views of women.  They did not give consent and were not informed about what was happening to them.  It would seem they are being condescended to again in the 21st century by the judge.  The tone of the report suggests the women were ignorant and it is claimed at one point that they were under the influence of campaigners, rather than that the women were well aware of what happened to them and the trauma it created afterwards, especially during subsequent pregnancies.  At one point, Judge Harding Clark used the defence that the women were Roman Catholic themselves.  It is incredible.  Does the fact that 95% of the population is born Roman Catholic mean they should not be asked for consent to have their pelvic bones broken?</p> <p> Symphysiotomy was a human rights violation.  It disregarded the women's rights to bodily autonomy.  Whether the doctors intended to harm people is irrelevant.  The point is that they did.  The tone of the report is what we see again and again in this country when it comes to women's health, namely, the idea of an acceptable standard of suffering.  Harding Clark is obsessed with whether it can be proven with "near certainty" - a standard that is not even applied in personal injury law - that the woman endured lifelong suffering, not just any suffering, it has to be lifelong.  As it was, 35% had to prove they suffered significant disabilities which lasted more than three years.  A similar threshold of suffering was applied in the case of Savita Halappanavar, when doctors literally stood over her to measure whether her life, not just her health, was at risk.  The issue is that the women did not consent to the procedure and were not informed of it.  There are many flaws in the report, which I do not have time to deal with.  They have been taken up by people such as Marie O'Connor, M&aacute;ir&eacute;ad Enright, Professor Linda Connolly and Dr. Jacqueline Morrissey.</p> <p> The Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, mentioned the 185 so-called false claims.  He repeated that 185 people were unable to establish their claims.  Midwives for Choice went through these cases and outlined the facts.  Could the Minister please correct this?  A total of 65 people withdrew their claims.  We do not know why; there could be any number of reasons.  Eight people engaged in the process initially but did not engage any further; 21 had inaccurate medical records; 12 were late applications given that the women were given only 20 days in which to make an application; and one person died.  This means 78 people did not establish a claim, not 185.  The Government is using the figure of 185 inaccurately.</p> <p> The 78 women are not liars.  The process had no oral testimonies.  It was centred on written medical records and the judge even claimed that there was no evidence of a religious rather than obstetric reason for the claims.  Again, I do not have time to go into it.  However, I validate the work done by Survivors of Symphysiotomy Ireland and I hope they will fully answer this outrageous report, which tries to demean them and the women involved.</p></speech>

It reminded me greatly of the litany of offences that the women who suffered from the anti-D serum in the hepatitis C scandal went through for years at the hands of the State under the current Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan.</p><p>We listened to the evidence of women who suffered from symphysiotomy although we could not hear the evidence of the many such women who are dead.  Some of those who gave evidence to us at the time when the scandal was breaking have since died.  I pay tribute to those women and their families who fought for truth and justice in this case and who, I am afraid, will have to continue to fight for truth and justice.  The truth is not out and justice has not even been attempted in the Harding Clark report.  It is a whitewash.  It is utterly disgraceful and totally prejudiced against those women who suffered the violation of their bodies in this manner.  I thank the academic M&aacute;ir&eacute;ad Enright, who has done brilliant work in highlighting how flawed the report is.</p><p>Of the 275 pages of the report, 133 are commentary from the judge while 142 are extracts from medical literature.  She assessed applications from 600 women who believed they had been subjected to symphysiotomy, she oversaw searches of hospital records and medical texts and she allocated payments according to what she believed was just.  The judge allocated &euro;50,000 in some cases, or &euro;100,000, to those whom she believed could link symphysiotomy to ongoing, lifelong health consequences.  However, M&aacute;ir&eacute;ad Enright points out to us that the extensive defence of what is a uniquely Irish practice of non-emergency dealing with women in pregnancy is not an independent report and that survivors are entitled to more under international law.  I entirely agree with her.</p><p>What is independent about a report that spends more than a whole chapter criticising and condemning women who mistakenly claimed they had had a symphysiotomy and spends less time examining why doctors carried out the practice?  I argue the reasons for which they carried out the practice were rooted in the conservative, Roman Catholic nature of Irish society and not just the church itself but how it is linked to the operation of everything that happens with the State, crucially in the health service.  Therefore, we find a very heavy concentration of the use of the procedure in somewhere like Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, which was dominated by a Roman Catholic ethos, as Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in pointed out.  It is clearly linked to the role the State plays in dealing with women.  Deputy Ruth Coppinger has gone through how the State has dealt with women on many issues, from abortion to contraception.</p><p>In the 1970s and beyond, when the operations were being carried out, doctors probably thought, with their Catholic heads on, and with discussion with hospital management, that if a woman was in trouble during her pregnancy it was better to break her hip bone so she could easily have more children than to put her through a caesarean section, which would make it more difficult for her to have children.  They probably thought what they wanted out of the country was for women to have more and more children, that childbirth was fundamental to what a woman was in Catholic Ireland in the 1970s.  Symphysiotomy guaranteed that women could have more children, and that the process of reproduction, of women's bodies being used to reproduce more human beings, would not be interfered with.</p><p>This goes to the heart of what M&aacute;ir&eacute;ad Enright points out and which was ignored entirely by the report.  The report, by its very nature, is flawed, given that it fails to deal with the direct consequence of the linkage between church and State, particularly in the health service and on the question of women's reproductive rights.  We will not interview a doctor who will admit he or she thought a woman should have lots more babies and broke her hip bone to guarantee it would happen.  However, this attitude would have been enshrined in the ethos of the hospitals and the management of maternity services at the time.  One of the reasons it was enshrined in it was linked to the fact that women did not have access to contraception.</p><p>The judge referred to women who went on to say that although they suffered pain during sexual intercourse for up to a year afterwards, it did not stop them from having more babies.  Hello.  All it says is that they had sexual intercourse without contraception, during which they suffered pain, because at that time it was understood that it was their role in life to have more babies regardless.  The fact that they had no access to contraception or abortion is crucially linked to how they were treated.  There are many misinterpretations and opportunities in dealing with it.</p><p>We need a new report and a new study as well as a new attitude to the countless women who suffered physical and emotional pain.  They also suffered, as was stated in many of the testimonies, from distress and powerlessness.  Imagine one's body is being used for experimentation in a medical practice to ensure future generations will be procreated.  C-section or surgery were not to be used.  Instead, a procedure was used to ensure women could have more babies.  This is what is at the heart of this and what has been missed.  To add insult to injury, the judge said one person's case is worth &euro;50,000, another&rsquo;s, &euro;10,000 but she hardly believes others suffered.  The judge should be coming out with a report that utterly condemns the system of symphysiotomy, the hospitals that oversaw it, as well as the health service which continues to whitewash it and do these women down.  Hats off to those women for fighting.  It must be very difficult to do.</p></speech>

They are also the effects which have been completely rubbished by the assessor of the Government's symphysiotomy redress scheme, Ms Justice Harding Clark.  The exclusion of survivors&rsquo; oral evidence from the terms of reference of the scheme and a narrow focus on medical records going back 50 years as proof of disability make it near impossible for many to prove they are in fact victims.  Hospitals are not required to keep medical records going back more than seven years.  The burden of proof, therefore, lies unfairly and disproportionately with the victim.  In cases where medical records are available, in many cases symphysiotomy was not recorded, even when it took place.  MRI scans were also used in assessing victimhood but the report itself admitted that the use of modern radiology to measure disability occurring half a century ago is unsupported by any orthopaedic literature, yet it was used as a diagnostic tool.</p>  <p>  While the UN Human Rights Committee classified symphysiotomy as torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment and involuntary medical experimentation, Harding Clark decided it was not that bad.  According to her report, it was medically appropriate and patient consent was unnecessary.  Not only does the State not believe many of the women who came forward as victims, but in classic victim-blaming mode, Harding Clark actually accused many of them of making false statements for financial gain.  The voices of the victims were trumped by accounts of doctors who engaged in the practice of symphysiotomy, many of whom were guided by their own religious convictions.  It may seem unbelievable now that C-section was once seen as a form of birth control.  However, we only have to look at the State&rsquo;s ongoing violation of the human rights of women through its draconian stance on abortion to see religious nuts still call the shots as regards women's bodily integrity.</p>  <p>  One would think after the Magdalen laundries, the death of children in mother and baby homes and the sex abuse scandals in the Catholic Church, the State might start to take responsibility for its many crimes against women.  Yet this scheme strips victims of their constitutional rights, denies applicants their right to appeal and forces them to see their abusers as harmless.  For anyone who actually read the survivors&rsquo; testimonies, the idea of describing the perpetrators as harmless is sickening.  The report is an exercise in the protection of the medical hierarchy.  It is a load of rubbish.</p></speech>

He said she could have simply administered a payment scheme but she chose to use her judicial skills and experience, and that of her clinical team, to examine all aspects.  That is shocking.  She was given a job to do which was to administer a compensation scheme.</p>  <p>  I have read the report and, given my previous life in law, I am absolutely shocked at its tone and the fact the judge went completely outside her terms of reference.  &ldquo;Abuse&rdquo; is a strong word, but the language in the report is one of abuse, pointing out to women that they are not believed when the majority who came forward showed they had a symphysiotomy.  Of those who could not, the figure is fewer than the judge claimed.  It was in fact 58.  The fact she repeatedly used a substantial section of the report to say these women lacked credibility - perhaps not in that language but that is what she inferred - is shocking.  Not only that, these women were subject to outside influence of a nature which overwhelmed them.  She did not focus on the fact that of the 590 applicants who came forward, the majority had the operation and suffered.</p>  <p>  Interestingly - the judge does not dwell on it - symphysiotomy was an unnecessary procedure in the UK.  The report actually stated &ldquo;in the major public hospitals in Liverpool, Leeds, Manchester, Glasgow &hellip; where significant communities of Irish Catholics lived&rdquo;, there was no necessity for symphysiotomy.  That in itself deserved three chapters as to how that could possibly have happened and what led to it.</p>  <p>  The Minister should take his own recommendation and read the report</p></speech>

It led to horrific health problems for these women with intense suffering and discomfort that affected their lives and their relationships.  In the previous D&aacute;il, we had the opportunity to meet some of the women affected to hear exactly what had happened to them and the effects on their lives afterwards.  We debated it here and had Leaders&rsquo; Questions on the matter.</p>  <p>  Survivors of symphysiotomy have serious and genuine concerns, despite what the Minister said.  What will happen to those concerns?  There are concerns about the content of the report and how little actually concerns the subject matter with so much skirting around the central issue.  There are also concerns about the requirement for the contemporaneous medical records, records which are not readily available; the exclusion of oral evidence; that the terms of reference did not comply with the recommendations made by the UN Human Rights Committee; that none of the perpetrators were held to account and there was no admission of wrongdoing; that the report did not respect the integrity and credibility of all applicants; that the burden of proof required went beyond that required by courts, which the Minister disputed in his speech; the finding that some leading symphysiotomy survivors who had one did not; that the infant mortality rate was not considered by the judge; and that the radiological review used applicants&rsquo; health data without their knowledge or consent.</p>  <p>  These are serious concerns which have been brought to the attention of the House and the Minister.  What will happen to these concerns?  Will they be just let slide?  It is doing a complete and utter injustice to those women who have these concerns.  I hope the Minister will address these in his reply.</p></speech>

The terms of reference called for the assessor to report to the Minister on the activities and the expenditure of the scheme.  I believe Ms Justice Harding Clark overstepped the mark in this case.  It was highly inappropriate for her to comment on ongoing litigation because some cases are going through the courts.</p><p>The report on the scheme, overseen by Ms Justice Harding Clark, can only be read as a defence of the uniquely Irish practice of non-emergency symphysiotomy, as it served to diminish survivors&rsquo; claims that the non-emergency substitution of symphysiotomy for caesarean section, without consent as practised in Ireland, violated many women's human rights.  This was taken up by the United Nations Human Rights Committee, which found that symphysiotomy, as practised in Ireland, constituted torture, cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment where patient consent was never sought.  The report has caused tremendous anger and upset among women who successfully applied for the scheme and those whose applications were unsuccessful.</p><p>I believe it is an attempt to undermine the women by concentrating on unsuccessful applicants and brushing over the fact that 70% of applicants applied successfully to the scheme.  The scheme's burden of proof made it difficult, if not impossible, for some women to prove their cases.  It demanded absolute certainty.  For women who were unsuccessful applicants and had no right to appeal, the report has just added insult to injury.  It is hostile in its tone and attempts to smear the survivors and discredit them rather than own up to a bad and damaging policy and a poorly administrated redress scheme which not all people supported when it was set up.<br/><br/>I will finish by reading out an e-mail that was sent to me before Christmas, for the debate we were supposed to have in December, from a young woman whose mother-in-law was subjected to symphysiotomy.  The latter is quoted in the e-mail as stating:</p><blockquote>It is with a feeling of hurt and sadness I have read Judge Clarke's and the Irish Times view of the end of the symphysiotomy scheme.  It was to be an non-adversarial scheme, and on the advice of my solicitor and because of my age (79) it would be easier for me to apply for the scheme (even though I had all my documentation of proof).  I was prepared to go to court.  Now as a group we are all being maligned as cheats and liars.  Such a pity that [Mr.] Varadkar told us how straightforward this non-adversarial scheme was going to be.  I remember the words he used.  In future, schemes like this will remember our treatment as an example of trusting a minister and his appointee.</blockquote><p>It goes on, but I will leave it at that.  The report has affected these women very badly and should be withdrawn.</p></speech>

It is abhorrent and shameful and should be withdrawn.  The Justice in her remarks went way beyond her remit and made accusations without evidence.  The report was flawed in its objectivity, full of conjecture and raises serious concerns about the scheme in its entirety.  Let us be clear: there would never have been a scheme at all if the women and their advocates had not and campaigned over years to demand justice and accountability for what happened to them.  When it was put in place, the scheme was roundly warned about by Members on this side of the House as being inadequate in the manner in which it was structured.  Other Deputies have made these points.  It was an abysmal scheme.  The kinds of awards that were covered by it, for a lifetime of pain and hardship, were minuscule.  Obviously, I am glad the women received something, but Ms Justice Harding Clark got more in a year than these women did for a lifetime of suffering.  Other Deputies have made the points about the 20 days within which to apply, the methodology for the burden of proof being flawed and the reliance on documentary evidence.  The scheme allowed for oral evidence; Ms Justice Harding Clark chose not to use this.  The scheme allowed for awards to be made without the admission of liability.  This amounted to an expression of regret without responsibility.  It is just not on.</p>  <p>  The report by Midwives for Choice is an excellent critique of the Harding Clark report.  It points out that the Harding Clark report is characterised by a reticence to present actual figures, using vague generalisations instead of key findings, as though keeping the reader in the dark, and that such an absence of transparency and proximity to objective scientific standards at any level means that they do not recognise any contribution to the body of knowledge on symphysiotomy.  Midwives for Choice is correct.  That the Minister sought to claim in his introductory remarks that this narrative added to our understanding of symphysiotomy clearly demonstrates to me that he has not read the report because the data and methodology for establishing symphysiotomy and any resulting disability were completely inappropriate and unscientific.  I challenge the Minister to read the report.  In fairness, Midwives for Choice makes the point about the challenges faced by the judge in the absence of objective evidence due to inconsistencies across medical records, birth registers, annual clinical reports and so on.  However, it also makes the point that irrespective of these challenges, there was an onus on the judge to do justice to the best of her ability to the women who had put their faith in her, and that the failure to acknowledge the limitations of the scheme's methodology in favour of branding honest and responsible elderly women as false claimants and setting an arbitrary diagnostic bar in full knowledge of the impossibility of women whose symphysis pubis had reapproximated over time reaching it is far from the justice to which these women are entitled.</p>  <p>  These actions are irresponsible, and the media coverage was irresponsible and hurtful.  The 800-page report devotes just 82 pages to the scheme.  The rest consists of the judge's bizarre opinions - and this is not for the first time.  She wrote to some of the complainants - and language is important - telling the women to "treat themselves" and commiserating about their "unhappy experiences".  She wrote to me and Deputy Wallace in terms which to me were like the ravings of a lunatic.  They certainly were not the words of a competent, independent assessor.  It was bizarre language, and this bizarre language, the inference and her own ideology seep through the report.  It is a defence and a whitewashing of the State's involvement in barbaric practices which have been condemned by international human rights organisations.  It utterly should be withdrawn.  This issue will not rest.  The questions asked by Deputy O'Sullivan about the scientific critique of the report must be answered by the Minister and the Department.</p></speech>

It covered a period of 50 years from 1940 to 1990 and was set up on the assumptions that symphysiotomy led to lifelong disability and was impelled by Catholic teaching on contraception and that Irish doctors were alone in the English-speaking world in using the procedure.  However, the report found that the procedure for many women was non-injurious in the long term and medically appropriate and that patient consent was not necessary.  These findings could not have been upheld if oral evidence had been taken.  This also calls into question medical ethics.  It is completely unacceptable that procedures would be carried out on anybody, even in 1940 to 1990, without obtaining consent or explaining the procedure.</p>  <p>  The process of the procedure was very invasive and barbaric and was not a first option in allowing women to deliver their children.  It certainly was not an option when caesarean section was freely available at the time.  It was carried out because women were deemed to have pelvic disproportion, which is a small pelvis.  This was a very difficult diagnosis to make up to the 1990s, certainly in the 1940s and 1950s.  The procedure was carried out very often on first-time mothers who were not given a trial of labour and who could have had a caesarean section if their labour was not progressing.  To use symphysiotomy in this regard was therefore completely unacceptable.  Many procedures were carried out as an alternative to caesarean section, not because the women could not deliver the child.</p>  <p>  The issue of consent is very important.  Many women availing of this scheme did not know what procedure had been carried out.  They were unaware that they had had symphysiotomies.  This may have led to difficulty regarding the Maureen Harding Clark hearings.  A total of 107 of the applicants were between 85 and 96 years of age at the time of application.  These women could be forgiven for memory lapse and their ability to sustain a claim.  Who would falsely claim redress for a procedure he or she did not experience?</p>  <p>  The report relied on medical records, if they were available, going back many decades.  Medical records going back 40 or 50 years were quite often not available, whether the survivors' GP records or their hospital records.  They were subjected to an examination for evidence of a surgical scar, but this would not be absolute evidence of whether they had a symphysiotomy.</p><p>The scar was small and could have faded in time.  It also relied on radiological evidence of the symphysis pubis gap being large, which would have been the case in many of those who would have had a symphysiotomy, but that may have healed over time and would not be absolute evidence that they did not have a symphysiotomy.  Written evidence was taken but often discounted and no oral evidence was taken.  The scheme applied an almost criminal standard of proof, beyond reasonable doubt, as opposed to the civil standard of proof, which would be on the balance of probability.  Lack of consent or explanation of what had been performed was one of the inhibiting factors in this report and symphysiotomies were carried out before and during labour and even after a woman had had a caesarean section, to, in my view mistakenly, aid their next delivery.  Of the 590 women who applied for inclusion in the scheme, 185 were excluded as they did not meet these criteria even though failing to meet them did not mean they had not undergone the procedure.  Many were left to deliver their babies through a now traumatised, unstable pelvis adding to their labour and their pain.  Thankfully, this procedure is no longer carried out in modern medical obstetrics.  This report has many deficiencies.  A major one was the failure to take oral evidence.  If oral evidence had been taken, women could have outlined the mobility difficulties they had after the procedure, the pelvic instability they endured for many years, the urinary incontinence, the damage to their pelvic floor and the chronic pain they endured.  Many lived a life of misery.  The integrity of the 185 who did not meet these criteria has been called into question.</p> <p> The procedure was not necessary and it led to poorer outcomes for baby and mother, when taking into account the availability of caesarean section.  This is a crucial point.  Infant mortality increased over and above what would have been available through caesarean section by having a symphysiotomy.  It was a procedure that could damage the baby as well as the mother.  The procedure was carried out in Ireland almost exclusively in hospitals which had a very strong Roman Catholic ethos in respect of fertility, contraception and particularly tubal ligation.  This report has not brought closure to many people who went through this process, particularly the 185 who did not meet the criteria.  They were assaulted, the procedure was unnecessary and their integrity has been called into question which is to be regretted. </p></speech>

For them this problem continues.  We have not given what we should have given, an upfront apology, a recognition that what went on was wrong and recompense for the huge damage, loss and pain that occurred over their lives.  I listened to the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, ask how we could have done that if Judge Harding Clark did not deliver that for those women.  While we did not want to go into an adversarial, inquisitorial system, was it not possible to listen to those women in a humane way rather than merely stating they did not have the records?  That would have been an appropriate response to what had gone on.  I regret that we are not getting that today but we are getting a similar defence of the system that was indefensible.  That is a terrible missed opportunity and that is why this debate today is important.</p><p>The way our medical system deals with births remains an issue today.  Let us hope the new national maternity strategy published last year will lead to a genuine change and shift in the system.  The statistics show we have not learned the lessons we would have learned had we stepped back, apologised and said our approach is wrong.  The doctors and consultants say the statistics show we have the safest and best system but we could refer to other statistics.  The level of inductions in birth in Irish hospitals at 31% is approximately three times what the World Health Organization, WHO, recommends.  That has real consequences today for mothers and babies.  I have seen oxytocin used as part of this active management of labour.  Symphysiotomy was also part of that system.  The Minister for Health said certain labours went on for 50 hours.  We have created a managed system which tells a woman that if her chart is not going the right way within 12 hours, the doctors will intervene and apply oxytocin which has real medical consequences for the child, particularly some in crisis pregnancies, and mother.  This is done, as I have seen, without really consulting, preparing or offering choices to the woman.  It is the same interventionist approach in which doctor knows best and one should not listen to the mother that still happens today.  </p><p>According to the statistics from the National Maternity Hospital approximately 27% of women have an episiotomy.  That has real consequences.  Our level of caesarean births is high at 30% and in some hospitals it is as high as 38%.  In some instances that is no doubt the right medical procedure.  We have to stand up for our doctors because there are certain acute cases where they provide lifesaving, important interventions but that level of intervention has knock-on consequences, making the average mother's recovery period at least two or three times what it would be with an alternative approach.  Today, 60,000 women are suffering the consequences of that excessively interventionist, medicalised, doctor-knows-best approach.  It is against all the recommendations of the WHO and other international scientific best practice.  We say we are the best in the world but the statistics say otherwise.  Our approach fits women into the consultant's or active management timetable, rather than trusting and working with them to make their deliveries the best they could be.</p><p>Breastfeeding is connected to this and is a cultural problem within our medicalised interventionist system.  Why are our levels of breastfeeding the worst in the world?  Only 6% of mothers here breastfeed after six months.  I do not want to send them on a guilt trip and far be it from me as a man to talk about it but we cannot ignore the statistics.  We spend only &euro;100,000 a year on supporting breastfeeding but we spend &euro;15 million a year on the acute infections in infants which could be addressed by higher levels of breastfeeding because it is the healthiest alternative.  All the evidence is clear on how we raise our babies but we do not do it because we are still stuck in this consultant-led system.</p><p>Today we should be celebrating the work of M&aacute;ir&eacute;ad Enright and Dr. Jacqueline Morrissey and the Association for Improvements in the Maternity Services, AIMS, who have done a fantastic job, as well as the women themselves but it should not be up to those women to fight their case.  It should have been for the State to acknowledge the facts, admit we were wrong and to listen but not in an adversarial way.  Had the doctors really listened to Savita Halappanavar, her tragic case might not have happened.  Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital was mentioned several times.  Michael Neary should have listened to the midwife who was having her baby there and screamed at him not to do a hysterectomy.  She was not listened to.  We should be listening to those women today.  We should be responding, as Deputy Bruton said, not in an adversarial or inquisitorial way but a listening way and responding accordingly to admit we need to change.  More than anything else that comes out of this debate let us respect, honour and apologise to those women.  Let us give them due recompense.</p><p> More than anything else, we should use this opportunity to admit that the delivery of medical services in the obstetric health system is still not right and is still not mother-centred in nature.  We have chased after midwives who have tried to provide alternatives such as home births, which should be available.  We have hounded them out.  I have seen it personally.  They have been demonised and hounded out.  I understand that just 5% of deliveries are led by midwives, even though such deliveries are just as safe as doctor-led deliveries.  I am speaking from personal experience when I say that this completely different cultural and medical approach is fit for purpose in many pregnancies.  It should be commonplace.  To my mind, we should have a completely midwife-led system.  I appreciate that in cases of acute medical emergency, consultants and others have to be brought in to save the lives of babies and mothers.  We have allowed doctors to control the system.  I am afraid they need to learn the lesson that they are not gods.  We need to have a system that is led by midwives and mothers.  We need to apply the lessons of the symphysiotomy experience to all mothers today.</p></speech>

Nevertheless, there remains an ongoing crisis at all levels across the housing sector.  In Dublin alone, 1,200 families - including 2,500 children - are living in hotel accommodation.  Last November, there were 6,985 men, women and children in emergency accommodation throughout the State, a 31% increase on the number in November 2015.  Unfortunately, there is no evidence of additional supply coming through by way of the provision of social housing.  This has led to an over-dependence on the housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme, which uses the lower end of the private market to supply homes to families.  Rents are at an artificial high across the country notwithstanding the welcome legislation that was passed last December to limit rent increases to 4% in particular areas.  Unfortunately, that measure will not alleviate the problem in the short to medium term because it addresses only future increases and does not deal with the existing artificially high rents across the State.</p>  <p>  Simon Communities of Ireland delivers supports and services to more than 8,300 people every year who are experiencing homelessness or are at risk of becoming homeless.  Today it published its latest Locked Out Of the Market report illustrating the stark realities of rental increases across the country and how, despite modest increases in social housing payment caps, 80% of rental properties are beyond the reach of rent supplement and HAP recipients.  Private rental supply, the report notes, is down 44% since May 2015.  The report shows the average number of properties available to rent decreased by 19% in the 12 months since the last report in August 2015.  There is a growing gap between rent supplement and HAP caps and current market rents.  The report confirms the number of properties available to that cohort is shrinking, particularly for individuals and couples.  Simon Communities Ireland personnel work at the coalface and they are extremely worried that if things continue as at present, the crisis will deepen in the short term.</p>  <p>  Today's report from Simon Communities of Ireland is further evidence that the imposition of rent caps should not have been limited to Dublin and Cork.  I assure the Minister that the crisis is affecting all parts of the State.  In my own constituency of Mayo, I have families coming to me on a weekly basis seeking help to find homes.  These people have given up hope of ever getting a place in social housing and are seeking my assistance to secure a private rental property.  It is next to impossible to find a three-bedroom family home in Castlebar that falls within current HAP limits.  Westport is a no go area as far as affordable accommodation is concerned.  More must be done and done soon if we are to meet the challenges presented by an artificially high rental sector.</p>  <p>  Simon Communities of Ireland has called for the rent certainty measures to be extended as a matter of priority.  Will the Minister indicate when the reviews of areas outside of Dublin and Cork will be completed and when the rent increase limits will be extended to those areas?  What does the Government intend to do to address the supply issue?  Without more supply, the problem will only get worse.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-01-26a.48" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="11:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017012600015#N00300"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue, to which the Government is giving intense priority and in respect of which we have devised solutions for the short, medium and long term.  In terms of social housing, we made an unprecedented commitment to the delivery of 47,000 new homes.  These are to be constructed through various agencies.  That is a massive commitment to social housing, which was neglected for more than a decade.</p>  <p>  Short-term measures to address the housing situation include the extension of the HAP scheme to Dublin from March.  Some 12,000 families were housed last year under that scheme.  Under the homeless HAP initiative launched by the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Coveney, 550 families in Dublin were accommodated last year.  That is a significant intervention.  Last year, 1,000 homes were purchased to provide immediate accommodation.  In addition, there is a commitment to provide 350 rapid-build homes in Dublin.  In regard to the rental cap, the Minister will very soon indicate the areas of extension beyond the current locations of Dublin and Cork cities.  We have seen very high increases as a result of supply constraints.  The rental cap is a short-term measure to deal with that and will provide certainty for people by imposing a cap on rental increases.</p>  <p>  On the wider front of housing supply, it is encouraging to see housing starts showing considerable growth at last, in Dublin and in other parts of the country.  The numbers remain well short of where they need to be but the measures the Minister is taking to streamline the planning processes and make it easier to access finance and to build will assist in accelerating the housing supply.  We all agree that increasing supply is the key solution, both in the private sector and the public sector.  We allowed a situation to develop where public sector direct provision fell away to levels that were way below those of any other country while, at the same time, relying too heavily on the private rental sector to deal with social housing.  The measures the Government has introduced will help to restore the balance in that regard.  We have a balanced set of measures that are being rigorously driven forward and which include provision for quarterly reporting.  The Minister is intensely aware of the huge number of families that are depending on the success of his strategy.</p></speech>

We have had major commitments from the Government in terms of building housing, but they are slow to translate to action.  There are still 2,000 vacant homes awaiting refurbishment across the various local authorities.  The housing repair and leasing initiative that was piloted in Cavan and Waterford seems to be going well, but it needs to be extended.  My constituency would certainly benefit from such an initiative.</p>  <p>  Simon Communities of Ireland has called for a twice-yearly review of the HAP increases.  Will the Government commit to facilitate that, given the acute challenges outlined in today's report?  Out of the ten areas covered by the study, which included major towns and cities, only eight properties were available for rent to single people and only 11 were suitable for couples.  There are plenty of initiatives being launched but we are not seeing the effect in increased supply.  A twice-yearly review of the HAP increases should be initiated.</p></speech>

The number of people who will be accommodated under those programmes in the coming year is 21,000, an increase from 14,000 two years ago.  There is an intensification of efforts in this regard and it is delivering in terms of supply.  The concept of extending the homeless HAP scheme beyond the current areas is under active consideration by the Minister and it is hoped to do so later in the year.</p>  <p>  On rental reviews, the Minister will examine the effectiveness of the relevant measures based on the evidence.  We need to get supply moving and focus on the initiatives in the areas of purchase, rapid build, the homeless HAP scheme and so on.  Those measures offer a particular targeted intervention for the categories of persons about whom we are especially concerned, namely, the 1,200 families living in hotel-type accommodation.  Those are areas of intense concern and the Minister is focused on delivering for the families concerned.</p></speech>

Yesterday, he signed executive orders to build a wall along the US border with Mexico and to crack down on cities which shield undocumented immigrants.

It is extremely worrying that some of the most dangerous and divisive rhetoric heard during the US election campaign is now being followed through with actions.</p><p>Let us be clear.  It is not for us here to judge who the US people choose as their President.  That is the prerogative of American citizens.

This is a very important day for the Irish in America.  Will the Minister tell me what message the Taoiseach will convey to the US President on our behalf on all of these matters?  A particular focus of the Government, as we have said before here, has been the very real issue of the estimated 50,000 undocumented Irish citizens in the United States.  These concerns were voiced yesterday by Ciaran Staunton, the president of the Irish lobby for immigration reform in the US.  The new administration's stated desire to tackle so-called sanctuary states is deeply alarming.  The Irish International Immigrant Center in Boston said yesterday that President Trump's actions could contribute to a growing anti-immigrant sentiment in the US.  The Irish Government has raised the issue of the undocumented in the past and I appeal to it to persist in this in the time ahead.  Irish America has always been the bridge between this island and policy makers in Washington and there is alarm there just as there is here.  It is imperative that efforts to resolve the plight of the undocumented Irish living in the US continue.  I urge the Government to adopt a stance with the President that reflects that need.  We also need to hear the Taoiseach articulate the politics of upholding equal and respectful treatment of all across the globe regardless of race, gender, background or sexual orientation.  What message will the Taoiseach bring to the White House and what efforts will be made in respect of the undocumented?</p></speech>

We have had long trading, political and social connections with the United States and they continue to be really important to us in terms of employment, social connection and the political handling of issues such as the one the Deputy raised on the undocumented Irish.  We deal with countries with whose politics we do not always agree.  In terms of pursuing the interests of Irish citizens, we have to be conscious that in every state, people will select people whose policies we do not all agree with.  Ireland upholds the highest standards in all international organisations in terms of the protection of rights and so on and it will continue to do so.</p>  <p>  Specifically on the issue of the Irish undocumented, there have been meetings, as the Deputy knows, between the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Flanagan, and representatives of the US Government at all levels, including the Houses of Congress, the Senate and the Administration.  Those will continue to be pursued because it is a really important area of public concern for our citizens, which the Government has an obligation to pursue.  We will continue to do that.  We will support organisations that deliver front-line services and community care to Irish emigrants in those situations through emigrant support programmes and otherwise.</p>  <p>  The Deputy expressed concerns about some of the campaigning that occurred and some of the policies that might ensue.  Our primary interest is to make sure that in some of these new policy directions, we work to ensure that Irish citizens' interests are protected.  There are changes in many areas including migration policy, tax policy and at home.  These are elements on which we need to be alert to the potential implications for us.  I assure the Deputy that all parts of the Government are very alert to those elements.  It will protect Irish interests, the interests of Irish people and will work with the new Administration and the wider interests on Capitol Hill, which remain a fundamental part of long-term decision-making.  The US constitution contains the concept of balance of power and it is important that we relate to all sections of the administration and democratic representation within the US.  If we pursue that, as the Taoiseach has done consistently, we will protect the interests of Irish citizens and, in particular, the undocumented Irish for whom Deputy McDonald has expressed a particular concern.  </p></speech>

The Minister, Deputy Flanagan, will be in Washington at the end of the month.  The ambassador, Anne Anderson, has already convened a stakeholder meeting in respect of the concerns that Ireland has in respect of Irish immigrants.  The President has extended an invitation to the Taoiseach and the Vice President will be hosting the traditional St. Patrick's Day events.  This is an opportunity for Ireland to exercise influence on the incoming Administration, as well as continuing to maintain the important contacts that have been a very important element of the Irish-US relationship over many years.  New directions present challenges for us but we have seen that Ireland has been able and resilient in adapting to changes.  We will prove again that in this situation we will adapt to the new environment and protect our citizens effectively though diplomatic and direct political channels.</p></speech>

For over a year now, the Government has been talking about this plan as a panacea for the crisis yet day by day, the situation gets worse not better.  Today we have highlighted that we have reached a shocking and unprecedented level of 7,100 people in emergency accommodation, including 2,500 children.  The housing assistance payment limits, which the Government has put in place and which are a central pillar of its entire so-called solution to the housing crisis, are grossly inadequate for the extortionate rents that are now being charged.  In my area and in the whole of south Dublin, there is one one-bedroom apartment within the limits.</p><p>There are two two-bedroom residential units within the limits today.  That comes against the background of an absolutely disastrous crisis.</p> <p> To add further insult to all of that, the Government has flogged or allowed to be sold via NAMA and the banks we bailed out vast amounts of property and building land where these companies, which make extortionate profits and pay no tax on them, can jack up rents and make people homeless.  In my own area, just before Christmas, on 23 December, a vulture fund that bought an apartment block put up rents in the entire block by up to 175%.  That was on the day the legislation was supposed to come into force.  The vulture funds doing this are paying no tax.  Last year, Cerberus had &euro;77 million in profits but paid &euro;1,900 in tax.  Lone Star paid $34.6 million in dividends to shareholders abroad.</p> <p> The Government has allowed that to happen and its policy has actively facilitated it but now it plans to worsen the issue by selling two thirds of public land in key sites such as Shanganagh Castle in Shankill in my own area, the Oscar Traynor Road site and other publicly owned sites.  It will sell virtually the whole of the Irish Glass Bottle site or Cherrywood via NAMA and we will only get 10% back on sites.  Will the Minister stop this?  Will he stop digging the hole that is causing such misery for people suffering from the housing crisis?</p></speech>

The Minister has introduced a strategy that is barely six months old and it is already having an impact.  The first step was to increase emergency accommodation.  There are 250 extra beds and 2,000 emergency beds in Dublin.  We have had to step up the provision for emergency accommodation but it is very much an interim measure.  The Deputy knows that the programme commits that by the middle of this year, there will no longer be families in bed and breakfast-type accommodation.  There is a very clear commitment and although there is a transition, we are moving on.</p>  <p>  The Minister has also dealt with the point of rent certainty.  We now have in place caps on rents in Dublin and Cork that will later extend to additional areas.  Most important, the Minister has committed to a supply line that we have not had for public housing.  As I indicated to Deputy Chambers, there will be 47,000 social homes.  We are also extending the housing assistance payment, HAP, which despite the suggestions from one source today accommodated 12,000 families last year.  This is working and the HAP homeless element accommodated 550 families in Dublin.  This is working but we must continually roll it out.  It will be extended, as the Deputy knows, in March.</p>  <p>  With sites such as the one at Oscar Traynor Road in my constituency, under the Minister's plan, that site, which has been derelict for 40 years in public ownership, will be built upon.  We will have affordable rental homes, social homes, starter homes and a variety of houses supplied to the market to meet the huge needs we all know about.  The alternative strategy of sitting on our hands, as we have done for 40 years, and the site has been derelict for that time, is not a solution to the housing crisis.  We are moving to get building happening.  There is a welcome rise in housing starts in Dublin and we need to build on that.  The Minister's strategy is committed to that approach.</p></speech>

The number of people in homeless accommodation has increased by 91% in the past two years and 34% in the past year since this Government came to office.  How the Minister can possibly claim it is working is beyond me.</p>  <p>  There is the issue of the disposal of sites like those on Oscar Traynor Road, Shanganagh in Shankill or the NAMA sites in Cherrywood and so on.  If these are given to private developers, how will they be affordable?  They will not.  The Government has not defined affordable housing.  Public housing is affordable but sites that previously would have seen 100% public housing will now only have one third with public housing, with the rest controlled by the private sector.  They will control the rents or property prices, which will not be affordable.</p></speech>

That is designed to be affordable for families and not just those on housing lists.  It will apply to another tranche of many families who are finding it increasingly difficult to get housing.  The affordable rent is directly targeting a group that needs support and the remainder will be private housing.  We need to see private housing develop because many families aspire to home ownership and a starter home built on public lands will provide more affordable access for them than any of the alternatives.  It is a creative solution to a challenge and I commend the Minister for it.</p></speech>

It is also anticipated that Fitzgerald Stadium will be one of the venues for the 2023 Rugby World Cup.  This infrastructure will be of vital importance to strengthen Ireland's bid for the tournament and we must provide proper access to Fitzgerald Stadium in Killarney, which will have capacity for at least 50,000 people.  It is arguably one of the most picturesque pitches in the country.</p>  <p>  Many deputations from Kerry County Council have met representatives of Transport Infrastructure Ireland and the National Roads Authority about this project over many years and again recently but it is clear the project will not go ahead until the Government makes the funding available.  When the review of the capital investment programme takes place in the next few months, I ask that the Macroom bypass be brought forward.  The project is expected to cost approximately &euro;230 but more than a third of this will be recouped by the Government in repayments of VAT, taxes, licences and permits.  It is anticipated the job will take at least three years to complete so if we work back from 2023, the latest the job can start if it is to be finished in time for the tournament is early 2019.  A commitment to the project must be given by the Government to allow for the tendering process to proceed and the work to be carried out and finished in time.</p>  <p>  Killarney and Fitzgerald Stadium would make a wonderful venue as the town is renowned as one of the best tourist attractions in the country, with wonderful hotels, restaurants, bed and breakfasts and the massive INEC event centre, and there are many hotels in nearby towns.  I appeal to the Minister to have his Government play its part in providing proper access to Kerry and Killarney in particular.</p><p>We do not want these fine big broad men getting stuck going around the back turns in Ch&uacute;l a' Bhucaigh or when parked in traffic jams in Macroom.  All Deputies need to pull together to bring the World Cup to the country and to showcase our country to the rest of the world.  I believe this mighty event will be the next great opportunity to showcase our country to the world.  I am asking the Government to play its part in doing just that.</p></speech>

The Government recognises that the road is an essential link between Cork and Kerry.  It has been approved in principle in the plan, as Deputy Healy-Rae is aware.  It already has full statutory approval and advance works have been carried out.  There has been a solid commitment of funding since 2014 to undertake and deliver advance works.</p>  <p>  Clearly, within the context of capital planning this is a high priority.  It is one of possibly three top priorities in the Cork Kerry region recognised by Government.  It is a major project though, covering 22 km and requiring &euro;160 million of investment.  It is approved in principle.  Clearly, as the project develops it will have high priority.  The Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Coveney, and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, have emphasised this point and have met representatives of Transport Infrastructure Ireland in that context.</p>  <p>  It is good that the Deputy continues to raise the matter because it continues to emphasise the priority.  Ultimately, however, we have to work with capital plan to enable us to fund a balanced range of projects.  Clearly this project will be considered high priority as we make our expenditure commitments in the context of the capital review.</p></speech>

Transport Infrastructure Ireland has said it will cost &euro;230 million.  The Minister is saying it will cost &euro;160 million.  The lesser figures surely make it more attractive to get it going quicker.</p>  <p>  IBEC said yesterday that we have the lowest capital investment programme in Europe, even though interest rates and money were never cheaper.  We must work at something like this; it is vital.</p>  <p>  This is a wonderful opportunity to get the project going and finished in time for the World Cup and indeed for all the people who have been looking for the bypass for over 35 years.  It is 35 years since it was sought and approved by Kerry County Council.  Surely, the people of Kerry are entitled to a proper road in to our county.  We are denied investment primarily because of this road, which is not of a proper standard.</p></speech>

We can see that in many of the problems we are having to deal with in housing, health and other areas.  That is equally true in this area.</p>  <p>  However, it is encouraging that as the economy has recovered the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has been able to increase the capital budgets.  He did this already last year.  We are now approaching a capital review in the context of which, because of the progress we are making, we will be able to see additional capital programmes.  We are in a position to start to repair the damage.  We need to understand that our capacity to do that will be limited because we are in recovery mode.  It is a question of using the money to the best effect.</p>  <p>  I can assure Deputy Healy-Rae that, on the basis of everyone I have spoken to, this is regarded as a priority project.  It is recognised as a priority for Kerry and Cork.  There is broad Government belief that this project is high priority.  I reckon that will colour decisions in future.  Clearly, however, I cannot give an indication today on decisions that will be taken in future.</p></speech>

That is an increase of 36% year on year and a 91% hike on figures seen two years ago.  It is out of control.  We know that the single greatest cause of families losing their homes at present is the sale of buy-to-let properties in the rented sector.</p>  <p>  At the end of last year, Focus Ireland proposed an amendment to the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Bill that would have made it more difficult for professional landlords to evict tenants on those grounds.  We supported the amendment, but it was blocked by Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il.</p>  <p>  We do not believe that it will be possible to get agreement between landlords and banks on the basis of the current rental strategy.</p></speech>

They are a stark reminder to the Government that a great deal of work remains to be done to solve the problem of homelessness.  The family figures remained more or less the same.  In fact, the number of dependents reduced by 44.  That is understandable since in many cases children will stay with extended family during the Christmas period.</p>  <p>  The Deputy raised the issue of protecting tenants.  We introduced a new amendment to prevent tenants from being evicted when one institutional investor sells a development property to another institutional investor.  That is exactly what we did.  There were limits to it on the basis of advice from the Attorney General&rsquo;s office.  The Deputy is or should be familiar with that.</p>  <p>  The Deputy referred to further protections for tenants in rental properties that may be in receivership.  We have given a commitment that, by the end of the first quarter of this year, my Department and the Department of Justice and Equality would examine ways to transfer the kind of legal responsibilities that landlords have to receivers.  That process is under way.</p></speech>

The programme for Government extended that commitment to all children under 18 years.  Last October, a full year after we budgeted for those under 12 years, the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, confirmed that negotiations had not even begun on the issue.  Extending free GP care to all those under 18 years will require further legislation, although there is no mention of that in the published programme.</p>  <p>  Will the Minister indicate when we will see the legislation to provide for the extension of free GP care to all under 18 years, as set out in the programme for Government?  When will the commitment, made in October 2015, to provide GP care to all children under 12 years be fulfilled?</p></speech>

On page 29 of A Programme for a Partnership Government, there is a commitment to provide greater protection for mortgage holders and tenants whose loans fall into the hands of vulture funds.  Here we have the most vulnerable tenants that one could possibly think about in this country: people in direct provision.  They were being given refuge by one arm of the State, whose loans were sold by another arm of the State, NAMA.  It is a quite incredible situation.  What is the Government going to do about these vulture funds getting their hands on, in this case, a State service for the most vulnerable?  What happens to workers in these situations?  The Government talks about protecting businesses but says nothing about workers whose loans fall into the lap of vulture funds as well.  There are 12 people unemployed.

I understand that part of it involves a review of the declined cases arrangement that is in place to deal with situations in which people who are legally required to have insurance are not able to get it.  I believe the Government recognises that this is an area of real challenge.  However, I believe if the Deputy reads the report, he will see that the sources of this problem are very numerous.  It will take systematic action across a number of headings, including by the industry itself.  Part of that will be to make the way insurance costs are put together more transparent.

The Government's Action Plan for Housing states that Tusla "will provide additional emergency refuge spaces so that victims forced to flee the family home often late at night or in the early hours of the morning do not find themselves homeless".  Can the Minister tell me when Tusla's 2017 business plan will be published?  What level of additional funding will be provided for domestic violence accommodation services and how many new emergency refuge spaces will be provided for those experiencing domestic violence?</p></speech>

Unfortunately, I have written to the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, but seemingly for the last two or three weeks he has not been able to sign a letter.  Is this going to be done in the Department of Social Protection or not?  The Civil Public and Services Union, CPSU, is involved but seems to be dragging its feet on it.

As things currently stand, Government policy is that if the ASTI membership rejects the offer that is on the table, junior certificate English students in ASTI schools this year will automatically lose 10% of their marks.  That is not really putting the best interest of the children first.  I know the Minister, Deputy Zappone, is present too.  What is the fallback position for those students?

Earlier this week the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Naughten, went to Ballymahon and announced a whole lot of things to help rural Ireland.  Yesterday, I discovered that the post office in my area, Aughavas in County Leitrim, is going to be closed because the pub and business there has been sold and An Post is saying that it may not renew the contract to have a post office in that area.  If the Government is making such efforts to invest in rural Ireland, one of the first things it should be doing is to ensure the services that exist in rural Ireland are not withdrawn.  That is the basic principle of it.  This post office has been in the community for more than 150 years and to think that at the drop of a hat it can just go.  We have a similar situation in Ballygawley.  Yesterday, I brought up the issue of the regional veterinary services being withdrawn and centralised to Dublin-----</p></speech>

Is mar sin a bh&iacute; s&eacute; &oacute;n bhliain 1929 agus bh&iacute; rath ar an gcol&aacute;iste &oacute; shin i leith.  Ba cheart d&uacute;inn cuimhneamh go bhfuil an col&aacute;iste seo istigh sa 250 ollscoil is fearr ar fud na cruinne.  Is toradh iontach &eacute; sin nuair a smaoin&iacute;onn muid gur chathair an-bheag &iacute; Gaillimh le hais cathracha an domhain.  Mar sin, iarraim cead an Bille seo a chur roimh Thithe an Oireachtais.  Ba mhaith liom bu&iacute;ochas a ghlacadh le mo chomhghleacaithe i bhFianna F&aacute;il don taca&iacute;ocht at&aacute; tugtha acu dom leis an mBille seo.

We must remember that in 1929, under Cumann na nGaedhael, the college was given a special statutory responsibility in regard to the Irish language.  This was updated in 2006 and it is a statutory obligation on the university to promote and to have as a core objective the teaching through Irish of a range of subjects.This was laid down in a special amendment to the Act passed by the Oireachtas in 2006.  The Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs provides extra funding to the university to help it achieve this aim.  The college has four centres that operate solely through Irish, three of which are in the Gaeltacht .  The city of Galway was recently granted the status of a bilingual city.  The Irish language is worth hundreds of millions of euro to the region.</p><p>I believe that in those circumstances it is reasonable that the president of the college would be capable of doing his or her business in both of the official languages.  It has been that way since 1929 and it is fair to say that the college has progressed excellently well under this policy.  It is now in the top 250 universities in the world and when one considers the size of Galway, which in world terms is a micro city, this is an amazing achievement.  I ask the Members' permission to introduce the Bill.  I thank my colleagues in Fianna F&aacute;il for their support.  I hope the Bill will be enacted into legislation before damage is done to the reputation of Galway as a bilingual city and to the university.</p></speech>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-01-26a.230.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="13:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017012600026#Y00500"><p>The requisite funding in respect of the recent Government decision for an additional payment to public servants with annualised salaries of up to &euro;65,000, as provided for under section 6 of the Lansdowne Road agreement, will be met from available public resources, taking into account the scope for the reallocation of expenditure while ensuring that core public services are not adversely affected.  Regarding the separate Labour Relations Commission decision in favour of increased Garda remuneration, the Government agreed in December to fund half of the estimated &euro;50 million cost of this recommendation, with the balance to be met from savings within the Department of Justice and Equality group of Votes to be achieved during this year.  The additional funding of &euro;25 million from the Exchequer was provided in the Revised Estimates Volume, which was published before Christmas.</p>  <p>  The extent to which Departments are in a position to meet the additional cost of the broader recommendation with unions will only be determined later in the year.  The Government will monitor the position closely and consider how best to meet any additional funding requirements where the need arises.  However, given that the additional cost represents 0.2% of total gross voted current expenditure, most Departments should be accordingly in a position to absorb the additional costs arising from this decision.  As reported in the end-December Exchequer returns, savings of &euro;168 million were achieved in 2016, which is less than the sum of money in consideration for this year.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that this is effectively a once-off additional payment for 2017; it is not a recurring payment.  This is because the payment will be replaced by the already scheduled and budgeted payment for public servants on similar terms of &euro;1,000 to annualised salaries up to &euro;65,000 from 1 September 2017.  The carry-over costs into 2018 of this payment have therefore already been provided for in respect of the Lansdowne Road agreement for 2018. </p></reply>

As a consequence, any new increases in expenditure, such as to fund higher public sector pay, imply lower spending in other areas unless offset by compensatory tax changes.</blockquote><p>Can the Minister give a guarantee that there will not be any impact on services delivered by any Department in this regard?  I am concerned that we are now coming into the beginning of the second month of the year and that he has allocated &euro;120 million worth of expenditure in respect of which he still does not know where it will come from.</p><p>Finally, I ask him to comment on the overnight development regarding the HSE's decision to withdraw its appeal to the Workplace Relations Commission regarding the payment of consultants and the potential this may have for a necessary increase in the Department of Health budget.  Will he outline the Government's strategy for dealing with this position?</p></speech>

I will not comment on the details of the two individual cases that were agreed overnight.  However, I want to be very clear to the House that the Government will vigorously defend our case regarding consultant contracts over the coming period.  As we move into the period of defending our case in this regard, the Department of Health, the Department of Finance and my Department will be parties to that case and we will vigorously defend our views and our legal case regarding this matter.</p>  <p>  Regarding the two other areas the Deputy has raised with me, I have outlined a process whereby throughout the year I will identify this funding and I will be accountable to him and to the House in that regard.  The other challenge I face is that if I had not made this agreement, I could have faced far greater uncertainty in the public finances for 2016.</p></speech>

How can he say the Government is vigorously defending a case when it has withdrawn the appeal?  I do not want him to comment on the two specific cases but I do want him to comment on the reports we are seeing across all the media today that this could cost up to &euro;350 million.</p></speech>

Given the fact that it has withdrawn the appeal against the case, the notion of vigorously defending its case seems rather hollow.  I appreciate the Minister cannot comment on the two specific cases, but what are the overall implications of this decision not to proceed with the appeal?  What are those implications for the health budget in 2017, 2018 and beyond?  When will we have a strategy from the Government as to how it will deal with this?  Will that strategy impact on services that are already in crisis in the health sector?</p></speech>

I have commented on two individual cases that reached agreement over the past 24 hours, but my comments refer to those cases that are to come, of which there are a significant number.  The Government will make very clear that we will robustly defend our views regarding consultant contracts, which date back to 2009.  This is an issue that has been going on for a number of years.  I will not comment on the terms and settlements regarding those individual cases that were settled.  That would not be appropriate.  To deal with the question the Deputy has just asked me about the cost, it would be absolutely irresponsible of me to come into the Houses of the Oireachtas and outline a liability regarding cases which the State will defend and in respect of which we will make very clear our robust views.  I am happy to confirm this to the House.</p></speech>

The economic and political landscape in Ireland has changed very considerably since this work was last done in 2014.  There are now increasing and competing public service demands across a period in which expenditure growth is planned at a moderate pace.  The approach taken to this review will therefore be tailored to reflect the changed context and lessons from previous reviews.  We will systematically identify the cost of existing projects and, as part of doing this work, we will look at the role of PPPs.</p>  <p>  PPPs offer an alternative model for delivering infrastructure that can be effective in particular circumstances.  Under the comprehensive policy framework for PPPs that has been put in place, there is detailed guidance on the value-for-money tests that must be applied at different points in the procurement cycle to determine a project's appropriateness for procurement as a PPP.</p>  <p>  While I am open to considering, on the basis of this review, the role they may play in priority public capital infrastructure, as I said to the Deputy in the meeting of the Committee on Budgetary Oversight, the complexity of determining the off-balance-sheet status of a project can, in certain circumstances, introduce a level of uncertainty into capital planning.  Consequently, at a point in the future the Government can find itself facing difficult choices over commitments made if it turns out that the planned level of off-balance-sheet funding simply is not feasible.</p>  <p>  The affordability and fiscal sustainability of PPPs are particularly important considerations for the review in light of the higher cost of private finance and the long-term nature of the financial commitments arising from PPPs.</p></reply>

The question is whether they are viable and represent value for money.  Even conservative economists such as Colm McCarthy have raised concerns about their use.  There are significant oversight issues that  need to be addressed but nothing in the Minister's response indicates this will be the case.  The Comptroller and Auditor General says he does not have the resources to give the Committee on Public Accounts the reassurance it wants about value for money.  He said there is a need for post-project reviews to be carried out.  Very few of these reviews were carried out and presented to the Committee on Public Accounts for proper scrutiny.  There are no real checks and balances and no opportunity, despite the Government's talk of reform, for us to assess the value for money of PPPs.  Unless the Minister is prepared to present us with a value-for-money report and a review of the existing use of PPPs, it is unlikely that he will get support for further PPPs.</p></speech>

I am well aware of their operation from their extensive use in the provision of public transport.  The Deputy continually presses me on the need for increased capital investment.  He points to the projects that need to be delivered.  Surely, therefore, it is appropriate that we consider the role PPPs may play in the future in delivering very important transport infrastructure projects.  PPPs have enabled the delivery of five bundles of schools and a variety of road projects across the country, including those relating to the M11 and N25.  We will deal with the benefits and costs of that approach in the capital review.</p></speech>

There is already flexibility in capital spending whereby any investment can be spread over four years, which is why Sinn F&eacute;in provided for &euro;1.2 billion of additional capital investment in our alternative budget.  The Minister flunked that and missed an opportunity to have significant capital investment this year when it is most needed.  According to a response to a query to the Minister's Department, only 11 post-project reviews of PPPs were carried out.  The reports were never published or laid before the Committee on Public Accounts despite requests for them.  In other jurisdictions, it is the norm to have pre and post-project reports.  The level of monitoring and oversight in respect of PPPs in this State is very poor and lax.  That is why we do not have the confidence that we are getting value for money because even the post-project reports are not being properly scrutinised by the Oireachtas.</p></speech>

I made very clear that the capital spending review will consider the options, benefits and costs that such PPPs offer.  Many projects have already been built but because they were pursued under the PPP model, there are payments the State will have to honour in coming years in respect of their maintenance.  As the Deputy knows, many documents are not made public because they are commercially sensitive and because of the agreements we have made with Irish and international companies that have been paid to deliver significant infrastructure projects.  I am not committing to more PPPs because I want to do the work to ensure I do the right thing for the infrastructure projects the State needs.</p></speech>

I will be bringing to Cabinet in the next two weeks papers and proposals further laying out the process and the manner in which I aim to deliver this work.</p>  <p>  This review will systematically examine the costs of existing policies to identify scope for funding of new initiatives from existing resources.  This represents a change from the approach taken in previous spending review rounds, with a focus on the need to prioritise between competing demands, rather than a need to reduce overall expenditure.  This review will also see a move away from the comprehensive approach taken in previous years to a system of rolling selective reviews.  All current departmental expenditure - with the exception of pay rates - will be examined over a three-year period. </p>  <p>  The expenditure report for 2017 details the expenditure ceilings from 2017 to 2019 for each of the ministerial Vote groups, which are within the allocations allowed by the latest forecasts of available funds.  The aim of this process is not to review or reduce expenditure ceilings, rather to examine existing spending within those ceilings to identify less efficient or effective areas and thereby create space for new, higher priority, more effective and efficient initiatives.  This process operates within the wider budgetary architecture and the medium-term expenditure framework, which supports sustainable expenditure policy, anchored by adherence to the fiscal rules.  This reprioritisation and focus on totality of spend, rather than on incremental increases in expenditure, is something I have repeatedly emphasised.</p>  <p>  The spending review will operate as a separate but parallel process to the budget.  This year, the spending review process is beginning earlier than would have been the case previously.</p></reply>

There will be rolling selective reviews and new processes.  When will Departments be informed of the process?  Does the notion of a rolling selective review mean that some Departments will not be involved in the process this year or will they all be involved?  Will this process be completed ahead of the summer when Departments submit their various budget priorities for 2018?  What will be the consequences?  The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council said previous expenditure reviews and ceilings were consistently breached and raised.  What will the consequences be or will there be discussions about consequences for a Department that does adhere to its expenditure ceilings?  Will the new controls arising from the fiscal rules be part of this review?</p></speech>

We have selected, at official level, specific subheads within each Department that are equivalent to approximately one-third of the expenditure under which this approach will be used, setting out the objectives for those expenditure subheads and using cost-benefit analysis and other economic techniques to determine whether they are delivering the objectives set in respect of them.  I would expect the work to be completed in the second half of this year rather than the first half.  It will be exceptionally serious if a Department breaches its expenditure ceiling.

Clearly, my objective is to get this work done as early as possible in the second half of 2017.  That would facilitate the redeployment of existing expenditure in the hope of delivering new initiatives next year, or delivering existing objectives in a better way.  Areas of expenditure were selected on the basis of policy relevance and discussions between officials in my Department and the Department that is responsible for the relevant subhead.  The answer to the Deputy's question about whether other areas of expenditure will get away with it is "No".  We have outlined a rolling process.  The objective is that we will cover a third of Government expenditure every year.  This means we are aiming to cover all Government expenditure over a period of approximately three years.</p></speech>

As the Minister knows, members of the Association of Secondary Teachers in Ireland are balloting this month.  Quite rightly, the association's central executive is recommending the rejection of the Government's proposals.  The Government is continuing to refuse to commit to the simple principle of equal pay for equal work for which workers have been fighting since the 19th century.  There used to be a pay gap on gender grounds.  We now consider it completely unacceptable for women to be paid less than men for doing the same job.  It somehow seems acceptable to this Government that young workers should be paid less for doing the exact same job in the exact same school on the basis that they are younger and started work after 2012.  What does the Minister intend to do about it?</p></reply>

It was intended that the first phase would address anomalies arising from the recent Labour Court recommendations in respect of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the second phase would negotiate a successor to the Lansdowne Road agreement.  My priorities for the first phase were to secure the continued implementation of the Lansdowne Road agreement, to maintain the productivity, industrial peace and stability provided by that agreement and to ensure issues of mutual concern to the parties are addressed in a fair and reasonable way and, above all, in a manner that safeguards existing Government expenditure commitments and the broader fiscal position.  Under the settlement that was reached last week, and in acknowledgement of the anomaly that has arisen, the Government in its capacity as the public service employer agreed to an increase in annualised salaries of &euro;1,000 for the period from April<b></b>to August of this year for those on salaries up to &euro;65,000, those who are parties to the Lansdowne Road agreement and those who do not stand to benefit from the Labour Court recommendations issued in respect of the Garda associations.</p><p>The issue of addressing the difference in incremental salary scales between public servants who have entered public service employment since 2011 and those who entered before that date was addressed with the relevant union interests under the provisions of the Lansdowne Road agreement.  In addition, flexibility provided for within the Lansdowne Road agreement has allowed the Government more recently to address particular sectoral issues such as the restoration of supervision and substitution payments, new entrant payments in the education sector and the restoration of rent allowances to new entrant firefighters.  This shows the value of a collective approach.  The Deputy will be aware that the Public Service Pay Commission intends to examine evidence on recruitment and retention of identifiable groups and to compare public service remuneration to prevailing private sector or market rates.  It will include its findings in its report, which is to be published in the second quarter of this year and will form the basis of the second phase of our negotiations.</p></speech>

Under the new proposals, a person who started teaching after 2011 will earn &euro;6,000 less in his or her first year of teaching than somebody doing the same job who happened to come in before 2011.  That figure will be &euro;5,800 in the second and third years of teaching and &euro;6,000 in the fourth year.  This pattern will continue until the ninth year, when the pay gap will be &euro;8,500.  Service officers and ushers in the Oireachtas are affected by this.  Those who came in after 2012 get 10% less than those who came in previously.  People who are working in this building are being paid &euro;2,500 less for doing exactly the same job.  Does the Minister think that is acceptable?  I do not.  Will he commit to equal pay for equal work?  Does the Minister agree it is ironic that the actions of teachers and garda&iacute; who took industrial action and refused to accept the Lansdowne Road agreement have forced him to give an extra &euro;1,000 to those inside the agreement, but he will not give this payment to those who actually fought to achieve it?  Essentially, he is putting the Sword of Damocles over their heads.</p></speech>

I responded to the various matters he raised in the question and I explained the process the Government is using as it seeks to deal with all of these matters.  Unlike the Deputy, I am responsible for deciding how to allocate taxpayers' funds between competing demands.  It is simply not possible to deal with this matter in isolation from all the areas in which improved public services are needed, not to mention the other pay issues that are being raised by the trade union movement and employees.  I would respond to the Deputy's reference to the Sword of Damocles by expressing my belief that it is absolutely appropriate for the benefits of the agreements we reach with representatives of employees to be confined to those employees.</p></speech>

I remind the House that no trade unionist ever had a ballot on the system of pay apartheid that was unilaterally imposed by the Government to deny young people equal pay for equal work.  Given that new-entrant nurses are receiving 10% less pay than existing nurses, is the Minister surprised that the Government is unable to recruit nurses at a time when everybody acknowledges more nurses are needed?  When that is considered alongside the mess in the health service, it is no wonder they do not want to work here.  This problem is going to get worse as the need for public sector recruitment increases.  Even more workers will join the teachers in being paid less when they come in.  How are they supposed to afford a roof over their heads?  The Minister is simply not addressing the issue of equality about which I asked him.  The Government could make Apple pay its taxes to pay for this.  That would be an alternative way of boosting the budget.</p></speech>

I want to ensure we have the right level of public services for those who need them.  I want us to be in a position to build the homes that Deputy Boyd Barrett quite correctly referenced the need for, to invest in hospitals and universities and to deliver the transport infrastructure mentioned by Deputy Cullinane earlier.  The challenge is that the same funding which would have to be used to deliver all of this is the same funding we have to use to pay public service workers.  Any single change in the State's pay and pension bill of approximately &euro;15 billion would have substantial consequences for our ability to improve our public services and pay every public service worker fairly, regardless of the point in time at which they entered the public service.  It would be great if Deputy Boyd Barrett were to refer in his analysis of this issue to the fact that we concluded our negotiations with the INTO and the TUI with an agreement that seeks to deal with the issue of teachers' pay in a phased manner across 2017 and 2018.</p></speech>

That restoration is welcome but we need to know the detail of how the moneys will be found.  There is a concern that the Government will cut services to fund the cost of the pay restoration.  When the Minister says the increase will be paid for through efficiencies and savings, he has a responsibility to spell out what exactly he means by that.</p></reply>

I am confident that if I had not taken this measure, Deputy Cullinane would be criticising me on that basis.  I have adopted a particular measure and explained the process by which I will identify the funding for it, funding which is less than the amount of savings I identified in 2016.  Across the year, through the reviews that are ongoing in my Department in the run-up to budget 2018 and in advance of the publication of the various papers that form part of the budgetary process, I will deal with this matter.  Deputy Cullinane welcomed the progress we have made in this area.  If I had not made this intervention, I would be subject to criticism today on that head.</p></reply>

I was not able to stay for the end of the Minister's contribution but there was grave dissatisfaction with his explanation in that regard.  There was extensive discussion with Deputies Cullinane and Pearse Doherty about savings and efficiencies but the Minister did not shed much light on exactly how the moneys will be found.  We welcome the restoration of the savage cuts in public sector pay since 2009.  However, the Minister seems to be saying that if he had not taken this measure, he would have been facing even greater expenditure later in the year in the wake of the Labour Court finding on Garda pay.  Did he seek any advice from the newly-established Public Service Pay Commission before coming to his decision?</p></speech>

Workers are entitled to pay restoration, even in excess of the proposed &euro;1,000, but we do not accept that money should be taken from services to fund that.  We are seeking a commitment that services which are starved of funding will not be hit as a result of this measure.  The Minister likes to ask where else the money will come from.  We are tired of telling him that his envelope is too small because he consistently resists our appeals to him to look elsewhere for additional revenue.  Additional moneys could be found by making the vulture funds and companies like Apple pay their taxes, by introducing a financial transaction tax, and by obliging landlords and higher earners to pay more taxes.  There is plenty of money to be had and it should be used to redistribute the wealth in this country in a fair way, which allows us both to fund public services and give public sector and other workers decent pay levels.</p></speech>

I did not do so because the terms of reference of that body refer exclusively to the potential for and aftermath of a replacement to the Lansdowne Road agreement.  It would not, therefore, have been appropriate to ask the commission's view on this matter.  Regarding the Deputy's analysis of why I chose to take this particular action, there is much truth in the point he makes.  I had a very substantial concern that if the Government found itself in a position, in the course of the year, of having to deal with a set of competing sectoral pay claims, that would have completely undermined our plans for public pay for the second half of this year and the costs thereof, which would have had extremely serious consequences for service delivery.</p>  <p>  In fairness to Deputy Boyd Barrett, he is unusual in always sketching out the ways in which he proposes to raise additional moneys.  However, where he and I differ is in my view that all the revenue-raising measures he is suggesting would have negative consequences which would, in turn, affect the performance of our economy, security of jobs and our ability to pay for public services.  The Deputy referred to Apple but made no mention of the fact that company employs thousands of people in this country.  In referring to financial services he did not allude to the tens of thousands of Irish people employed in that sector and that multinational investment is a core part of how we provide employment throughout the State.  There are alternative sources of income but implementing the measures the Deputy is proposing would undermine the kind of revenue and economic growth we need to pay for the public services improvements we wish to see.</p></speech>

If I were to come into this House and put forward a proposal that cost &euro;120 million, the Minister would ask how I proposed to pay for it.  If I responded that it should be collected through general savings and efficiencies, I would be laughed out of the Chamber, as would any of my Opposition colleagues.  We are obliged to line-item and cost every single proposal, down to the cent, that we suggest.  The Minister seems to think he can operate in a different set of circumstances, merely having to waltz in and announce a cost of &euro;120 million for this particular measure.  I agree with the decision on pay restoration but this is about having a process and ensuring the Minister is accountable.  He has not offered us one line item showing how a single cent in savings will be achieved apart from general broad-brush references to savings and efficiencies.  That is not good enough.  It is not appropriate to treat the Oireachtas and the committee which has responsibility for budget oversight in that way.  I am asking the Minister to do what he asks us on this side of the House to do by offering a detailed outline of how the moneys will be found.</p></speech>

However, we have a responsibility to ask the questions we are asking.  If the Minister were in our position - even if he agreed with our proposal, as we do with his - he would want to know how exactly it was proposed to do it.  Does he intend, for example, to rely on tax buoyancy and the expectation the tax take will be ahead of target as the year develops?  Has he factored in how this measure will impact on overall spending throughout the year and into the following years?  We spoke at the committee about issues like inflation and increasing staff numbers in the public sector.  Will the Minister give us concrete answers to the questions we have raised?</p></speech>

There was not &euro;60 million available to bring forward social welfare payments to the beginning of January but now there is &euro;120 million for this initiative.

I want to see pay restoration and a hell of a lot more of it.  I was talking to some of the service officers in here and they are nearly crying as a result of some of the pay levels they have to put up with.  They need this pay.  What I do not like, which was implicit in what the Minister said, is that it is essentially one or the other - it is services that are cash starved or it is pay.  We do not accept that.  We want the details, which the Minister would expect of us, as Deputy Cullinane said.  It is not just hypothetical.  We have been laughed at and ridiculed by the Minister when we put forward other tax revenue-raising proposals.  He said they was nonsense, that he wanted costings and that they would destroy the economy and so on.  The Minister insists on detail and he is not prepared to provide any such detail.  As a result, we are concerned that this is a case of robbing Peter to pay Paul.  The Minister has an obligation to tell us from where the money is coming.</p></speech>

Since I made this announcement, I have outlined that I would put in place the measures and decisions to ensure that services are not affected as a result of doing this.  I welcome that all Deputies have agreed with the decision I made and indicated that it was an appropriate response to the matter that developed in the aftermath of the Labour Court recommendation.  In line with the commitments I have to the Oireachtas in 2017 on the publication of the work that is necessary in advance of budget 2018, I will identify the choices I will make to deliver this funding while not reducing service commitments to citizens.</p>  <p>  I will conclude by responding to the point Deputy Curran made.  I remind him that this issue developed in the aftermath of the budget in October.  The Labour Court recommendation and the consequences of it for garda&iacute; happened after the budget was presented to the House.  If I had stood up in the House and presented higher figures for public pay than were agreed in the Lansdowne Road agreement, I would have been asked by the Deputy and other colleagues why we were changing assumptions on public pay under the Lansdowne Road agreement and why we were asking the House to sanction people being paid more.  That would not have been the appropriate thing to do at that point.  In 2017, as we move through the management of a budget of &euro;58 billion, I will identify how I will deliver the commitments I have laid out.</p></speech>

It is a rolling review because it would not be possible to review all Government expenditure in the level of detail I want within a single year.  The amount involved is over &euro;58 billion.  Second, we will identify a third of Government expenditure per year.  That is why I refer to it as a rolling review.  I anticipate that it will take three to three and a half years to complete this work.  It differs very much from previous spending reviews in our recent economic history, which the Deputy has referred to, because the objective of those reviews was to reduce the amount of Government expenditure.  That is not an explicit or implicit objective of this.  Within agreed expenditure ceilings, I am looking to find out if there are better ways for policy objectives that Government Ministers are looking to deliver to be achieved.  In that regard, it differs significantly from spending reviews that have been undertaken by the previous Governments.</p></speech>

I mentioned the report in the Department of Social Protection.  Are all Departments compiling reports on certain programmes?  Does the Minister nominate which programmes he wants to hear back on, such as, for example, the free travel or the school clothing and footwear allowance schemes operated by the Department of Social Protection?  Does the Minister decide that and then other Ministers have to have the reports compiled?  Who actually makes the decision?  How are inflationary pressures taken into account?  We have spoken, both at the relevant committee and in this Chamber, about important new measures and innovative services that the Government could put in place.  Are the latter built into the rolling review?</p></speech>

The report that gave rise to this debate was one that was put in place many years ago.  We did not change that scheme at the very depth of the economic difficulty the country faced and it will not be changed now.</p>  <p>  The Deputy asked me how the policy area will be agreed.  It will be mutually agreed between me and the Minister leading the other Department.  There has not been any dissent to date in terms of selection so we have not had to get to a point of enforcing the selection of a particular policy area.  There has been a happy meeting of minds on selection.  The Deputy asked about new policies and innovation.  We are conducting this review to discover if there are savings that are possible to identify and that will allow new services to be delivered.  The Deputy made reference to the fact that expenditure on public services has been reduced.  It was reduced in response to the horrific crisis the country faced.  We exited a bailout programme and we are increasing public expenditure year on year but we are looking to do it in a way that delivers better public services.</p></speech>

That is related to demographics.  We will not select a particular area based on the impact that demographics or inflation will have on it.  With regard to public services, the growth of inflation has a particular effect on social welfare payments.  It is the responsibility of the Government of the day to make a decision on the changing of either social welfare payments or public sector pay.  I do not believe it is the right thing to commit to automatic indexation because we have to respect the ability of a Government to make a decision about how to best use taxpayers' money.  The area in respect of which demographics is most important is that relating to primary and secondary schools.

We have had two examples of where sufficient information was not given to the committee.  The first is the issue of the &euro;120 million, with which we have already dealt.  I do not want the Minister to rehearse that because we have heard the response and it is still not satisfactory.</p><p>The second was raised by a Teachta earlier, with regard to consultants' pay and contracts.  The Minister did not answer the question to any satisfaction at all.</p></reply>

I was very clear in the answer I gave to Deputy Calleary, that with regard to approaching cases, the State will robustly defend itself.  The Deputy is asking me to come in here and identify a potential liability for the State that would then be the subject of court action.  This runs counter to the interests of the taxpayers he purports to represent.  He referred to the views he has on my not sharing information on how we will fund the agreement, which we debated earlier.  I have answered this.  As the Deputy outlined my participation in the committee, I hope he will take cognisance of the many information needs the committee has articulated to me and the Department which we have met and will continue to meet.</p><p>With regard to how we are looking to work in the coming year and beyond, as the Deputy is aware, in advance of budget 2017 we furnished to the committee the mid-year expenditure report, which laid out the expenditure expectations of the Government for 2017, 2018 and beyond.  Since then, the Department has shared a range of documents and information to assist members of the D&aacute;il and committee in exchanging and discharging their work on the budgetary process.  Our expenditure report of 2017, which was published on budget day in October, set out the Government's proposed voted expenditure allocations and our expenditure measures for 2017.  A summary response to the committee's views in its report on budget 2017 on issues relating to my area of responsibility was also published alongside the Estimates documentation.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i></p><p>The Revised Estimates Volume published in December provides additional details in respect of the total gross voted expenditure allocation of more than &euro;58 billion, with the expenditure Estimates supplemented with key performance information regarding programme output and impacts.</p><p>On a monthly basis, my Department prepares voted expenditure reports that are published with the monthly Exchequer returns.</p><p>The Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service publishes a range of documents that can inform budgetary discussions and these are available at <i></i>.</p><p>As part of the ongoing engagement between the Department and the committee I understand the committee is scheduling a meeting with the Secretary General of the Department.  I am fully supportive of the work of the committee and welcome the opportunity for the Department to discuss with the committee a structured process for the provision of information.</p></speech>

I am not asking the Minister to comment on a liability which does not exist.  I am asking him to explain, as he has been asked previously, how he will defend the consultants' contracts he says the State will defend potentially to save the State money if the State has decided to drop a High Court case relating to two individuals.</p></speech>

The Minister must deal with the fears we have that there may be cost on this issue, and he has not done so.  The issue was raised by another Teachta in the same context.  It is a very important issue.  It is the first time we have had an opportunity to put the question to the Minister with responsibility, and I hope he will be able to provide answers for us because until now he has not been able to do so.</p></speech>

We will deal with the matter in court and make very clear, and in the strongest manner possible make known, the views of the Government on the contract for consultants and with regard to payments which they believe they are due which we will dispute.</p>  <p>  With regard to my engagement with the Committee on Budgetary Oversight, as the matter develops, and where appropriate, of course I will be happy to deal with questions from Deputy Cullinane on the matter.  It is a matter that will be dealt with in court and I reiterate I am not going to come into the House to quantify the level of costs which the State does not believe are due.</p></speech>

I hope he will not be back in one, three or six months speaking about a cost and stating there will be a liability.  In any event, I have dealt with the issue.</p>  <p>  There is a real issue with regard to the ability of the Committee on Budgetary Oversight to do its job properly and fairly.  I have given a number of examples where information will need to be given to allow us to scrutinise proper spending of public money.  I appeal to the Minister because a number of Members in the House sit on the committee and we want it to work.  We want to play a constructive part in holding to account the Government, which is our role and job, but we can only do so if we are given the information necessary for us to hold Ministers to account properly.  Some on the committee fear that, until now, this has not happened and we are not being given the respect we deserve or the tools we need to do the job asked of us.</p></speech>

Will the Minister provide the background material to the Committee on Budgetary Oversight?  We do not need what is being used to fight the case.  We want the material that is giving the Minister the confidence which he clearly has in the Chamber that no liability is likely to accrue because of this.  How many more cases are pending?  How many cases will potentially be pending?  This is the type of information that needs to be provided to the Committee on Budgetary Oversight in order that it can adjudicate and its members can make up their minds, as is the responsibility conferred on them by the Oireachtas, on the potential severity of the issue.  We cannot take the Minister's assurances.  We need the information he has in order that the Oireachtas oversight committee can make a call on it.</p></speech>

This is funded.  With regard to the issues raised by the Deputies regarding the number of potential cases and what might happen in the coming period, I am willing to supply this information to the Committee on Budgetary Oversight.  They were not the subject of this particular question, which is why I will not do so now.  I reiterate, as I have made clear throughout the discussion, that with regard to the approaching cases, the State will strongly defend its view on the consultants' contracts and defend the actions taken then, because it is in the long-term interest of taxpayers and reflects policy decisions correctly taken at each point in the process.</p></speech>

The Minister needs to give the commitment to address a very real sore which has been at the heart of so many industrial disputes in the State in the public sector.</p></reply>

I will read out to Deputy Cullinane the number of expenditure requests he has articulated in recent weeks.  He has called for increased investment in University Hospital Waterford, increased investment for services for people with disabilities in his county, additional classrooms for a school in his constituency, the amalgamation of two grades in the Civil Service, increased investment in transport in his area, more people to be assigned to the Garda divisional unit, increased investment in Waterford Institute of Technology, funding for Institute of Technology, Carlow and funding for University Hospital Galway.  Alongside these, he is asking for increased money and increased investment in public pay.</p><p>I have made clear to the Deputy a number of times, indeed well over 100 times, that I am committed to doing so, but it has to be done in an affordable manner.  As I have just demonstrated, Deputy Cullinane makes calls in the House for increased expenditure in area after area without taking account of the fact that the overall cost of those calls is not one that the taxpayer is capable of meeting.  For these reasons I have said that where possible I will deal with questions of how to improve public pay, but that it must be done in a way that is affordable in the long run and allows many of the other initiatives for which the Deputy has called to happen.</p></speech>

The people of Waterford deserve proper schools, hospitals and infrastructure, as every city and county does.  Contrary to what the Minister said, though, we costed every proposal in our alternative budget to the cent.</p>  <p>  When the Minister states that the issue of equal pay for equal work is not going away but that we need to focus on improved public services, what those who have entered the system since 2011 and are being treated differently and discriminated against hear is that the recovery of public services must be on their shoulders.  That is not fair.  I had this conversation with the Minister yesterday.  Even now, his Department is unable to cost a return to a single-tier pay structure.  If the Minister is not prepared to agree to the principle of equal pay for equal work, will he give me a commitment to the effect that, by next year's budget, his Department will be able to cost for my party a restoration to a single-tier pay structure?</p></speech>

He works hard to represent the people of Waterford effectively, but they also deserve consistency from their public representatives.  They deserve and need to know how, when he calls for particular matters to be addressed, those issues will be paid for.</p>  <p>  The Deputy referred to the need for improved rates of public pay.  Under the FEMPI legislation alone, the amount of unrestored earnings is &euro;1.4 billion.  The Deputy is asking me to deal with a particular matter - that of new entrants' starter salaries - in isolation, but it is vital that we demonstrate fairness for those who need public services as well as those who work within them.  That is what I am doing.</p></speech>

We have had several discussions on this issue, so it is on the record that my party is not asking for every FEMPI cut to be unwound in one go.  We have called for a new collective agreement, one that is properly negotiated with the trade unions, in respect of 2019 to 2021, inclusive.  In that context, it is appropriate that we once and for all put the issue of equal pay for equal work and the restoration of a single-tier pay structure on the table.  The Minister asserts that I have a responsibility to account for such proposals, but how can I do so when even he, his Department and its Secretary General cannot provide one?  When I met three of his departmental officials, they were unable to provide the cost.  Provide the costings and then we can debate how to go about doing this, for example, in one year or over two or three years.  Please, do not accuse us of being unable to do something that is impossible to do because the Department will not provide the costings.</p></speech>

We cannot change wage curves for people who are joining the Civil Service, teaching or any other part of the public service without there being profound knock-on consequences for the entire wage bill.  For this reason, the issues of retention and starting salaries must be examined in the context of the overall public service pay bill, which amounts to more than &euro;13 billion.  That is what the Public Service Pay Commission is doing.  It will produce a report for the Government and the Oireachtas in the second quarter.  In the aftermath of the Lansdowne Road agreement, we will begin negotiations, which I hope can be concluded, with unions to determine how we can make progress on these issues in an affordable way.</p></speech>

The issue includes community and employment supervisors and assistant supervisors who have been seeking, through their union representatives, the allocation of Exchequer funding to implement a 2008 Labour Court recommendation relating to the provision of a pension scheme.  In light of the recent appointment of a new chair to the high level forum, a meeting is accordingly being arranged between the parties concerned with a view to scheduling a date in the first quarter of 2017.</p>  <p>  It continues to be the position that State organisations are not the employers of the employees concerned and it is not possible for the State to provide funding for such a scheme.  The employees are or were employees of private companies, notwithstanding the fact that the companies are or were reliant on State funding.

The issue is known to the Minister and departmental officials.  I welcome the appointment of a chairperson.  I noted in previous replies that the forum met in November 2015 and on 11 April 2016, so it is well and truly due to sit again.</p>  <p>  The Minister explicitly stated that these supervisors were not direct employees of the State, but he also admitted that their employing organisations were primarily funded by the State.  Following benchmarking, pay relativity and so on, these employees were closely aligned with public servants.</p>  <p>  In all of the Minister's replies, he has indicated that this matter will be examined by the high level forum, which is welcome.  However, the matter has dragged on for a long time.  The forum has met twice but has not done so for some time.  With the appointment of a chairperson, I hope that it will meet actively and address this issue with the requisite level of seriousness instead of allowing the matter to continue year after year.</p></speech>
