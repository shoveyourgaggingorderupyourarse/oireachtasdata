The co-operation with Northern Ireland scheme provides support for projects that have a clearly demonstrable North-South element and which seek to make a contribution to enhancing, celebrating or commemorating the art, culture, music, film or heritage of the whole of the island of Ireland.</p><p>Some &euro;127,500 in funding will be allocated under this scheme in 2019 with a maximum of &euro;15,000 awardable per applicant.  Projects are awarded on a competitive basis and I will announce the results of the 2019 scheme on my Department's website in the coming weeks.  A total of 30 applications were received in 2019, which is an increase of 18 on the number received in 2018.  The years 2016 and 2017 saw an unprecedented demand with 90 applications being received in those years.</p><p>In addition, my Department also provides annual funding of &euro;100,000 towards the Cross-Border Orchestra of Ireland Peace Proms event.  This event is a unique and ambitious musical education programme in which 20,000 children from 250 schools throughout the island of Ireland participate annually.  It is a musical and cultural celebration and provides an important platform for young people to showcase their talent while promoting peace, unity and tolerance through music.</p><p>In 2019, my Department will also be providing &euro;12,000 in support for <i>An tUltach</i>magazine, which was first published in 1924 and is considered to be the oldest periodical in the Irish language. </p><p>There are other agencies under my Department which also engage in cross-Border co-operation on cultural projects.  For example, the Deputy may be familiar with the Tyrone Guthrie Centre, which is one of three residential artists&rsquo; spaces operating on the island of Ireland.  This is funded annually by both the Arts Council and the Arts Council of Northern Ireland.  This Centre is currently undertaking a significant capital development to which my Department has committed &euro;309,000 in funding.</p><p>Culture, in general, operates beyond borders and boundaries and can facilitate cross-community and cross-cultural understanding at the deepest level.  My Department will ensure that culture continues to play an important role in fostering all-island dialogue, and in particular dialogue between Ireland and Britain, especially during this decade of centenaries, and now in the context of the UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the EU.</p></speech>

Brexit, alongside the absence of a working Assembly, has put a whole new level of strain on North-South cultural connections.  Regardless of the outcome of the Brexit negotiations, cultural links between Ireland and the North of Ireland must be strengthened and supported .</p>  <p>  In recent weeks I had the pleasure of meeting some of the staff from the MAC gallery in Belfast city centre and perhaps the Minister may have done so also.  Being from a Border county and having worked in curatorial practice before I ever became a politician, I had the experience of bringing together artists from North and South.  I see a huge opportunity for the Border counties as to what is happening on the bigger political scale at the moment with Brexit.  </p>  <p>  Having spoken with artists, arts practitioners, curators and educators from the North of Ireland, there is a real concern and paralysis arising from the non-functional Assembly.  It is leaving them almost in limbo.  There is a real desire, interest, energy and enthusiasm on their part to engage further with the Minister, with us, and with the culture and artistic sector of the Republic.  There is a real opportunity.  Aside from what has been happening with North-South co-operation, which has been happening for the past ten years, what new initiatives are the Minister and her Government undertaking to strengthen those links?</p></speech>

I highlighted there the role of the Creative Ireland programme, with which the Deputy will be familiar and which launched at the end of 2016, and the culture component of Global Ireland - Ireland's Global Footprint to 2025, which was published in May 2018, to ensure that artists and other creative workers are properly supported to allow them to continue to operate in the cultural sector on a self-sustaining basis.</p><p>The key reassurance required for the cultural sector remains the continued operation of the common travel area, as highlighted on Friday, 1 March, by the directors of the arts councils in Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and England.  Our key message remains that regardless of the outcome of the Brexit process we remain committed throughout the island of Ireland to engaging through culture with our friends in the UK, with our partners in the EU and globally.  While Brexit will impact all aspects of the Department's brief, it has not identified specific legislative measures for inclusion in the omnibus Bill on the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.  Notwithstanding this, the Department and those bodies under its aegis are subject to the challenges posed by Brexit and in the event of a no-deal scenario they will benefit from the practical measures contained in the Bill.</p></speech>

Does the Minister have specific information on what she intends to do to bring a breath of fresh air and a new way of doing things in the arts, and in engaging in a new relationship with the arts sector in the North of Ireland?  With Brexit looming and a non-functioning Assembly, these people are asking for our help.  They have visited Leinster House to discuss with all parties their desire to work and to formalise the relationship.  Will the Minister outline the specifics of what she intends to do?  I would appreciate it.</p></speech>

Cavan County Museum has an exhibition on the War of Independence and the Civil War.  The Cavan and Fermanagh conference will be held in October, which will deal with the impact legacy of the events of 1919 to 1923 on the Border.  The conference programme is being developed.  The exhibition will be County Cavan focused and the conference will be a joint project between Cavan and Fermanagh museums.  Work is at an early stage in developing the conference.</p>  <p>  Culture Ireland also does a significant volume of work.  It operates on an all-Ireland basis and supports artists from Northern Ireland presenting their work globally.  It partners with the Arts Council of Northern Ireland and shares promotional stands at the world music trade fair each year, which is part of the horizons partnership to co-promote music at global events.  In April, Culture Ireland officials met the executive of the Arts Council of Northern Ireland to discuss how the co-ordination of support to artists can be enhanced, particularly in respect of the focus on key art forms.</p></speech>

The Creative Ireland programme is a five-year, all-of-Government, culture-based initiative, led by my Department, that emphasises the importance of human creativity for individual, community and societal well-being.  When we talk about creativity, we are talking about it in its widest possible sense, including, as the Deputy mentioned, traditional heritage-based activity.</p><p>The main source of funding for local craft enterprises under the Creative Ireland programme is pillar 2, enabling creativity in every community.  In 2019, my Department allocated a sum of &euro;2 million and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government allocated a sum of &euro;1 million to all 31 local authorities, which is a total of &euro;96,000 each approximately, to enable them to support an extensive programme of activities, events and initiatives in each county.  Each local authority has established a Creative Ireland co-ordinator and a local culture team to manage and allocate this funding in accordance with local needs and in line with their five-year culture and creativity strategies.</p><p>Projects funded include arts projects, grant schemes, concerts, conferences, exhibitions, festivals, outreach projects, publications, research programmes and workshops, among other activities.  They cover topics such as archaeology, architecture, biodiversity, crafts, heritage, dance, film, history, literature, music, photography, poetry, storytelling, theatre and the visual arts.  The Deputy&rsquo;s constituency of Tipperary has a very rich programme in place with some great examples of heritage related projects.  For example, in 2018, the local culture team, with the support of the Creative Ireland programme, funded Ode on a Castle and a Tower, a communal drawing project carried out as part of the community engagement on a project of heritage-led regeneration works on the streetscape in Carrick-on-Suir.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>In addition to this core funding, the Creative Ireland programme has allocated &euro;15,000 to each local authority outside of Dublin and &euro;75,000 each to the four local authorities in Dublin to develop a special programme of events for Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g, the national day of creativity for children and young people.  Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g is taking place on 15 June 2019 and includes a range of traditional heritage based activities for all ages.  Full details of the programme can be found on the Creative Ireland programme website. </p></speech>

Unfortunately, we have already had the announcement of the closure of a regional craft gallery, the Craft Granary in Cahir town.  The way it was handled was simply appalling.  It was unfair to the staff, the gallery's suppliers and the craftspeople who used the gallery.  I salute the management and staff, including the acting manager, Rachel.  What happened there was unfair.  The board knew about this decision but decided for some reason to keep it hush hush until after the local elections.  That is an appalling treatment of a valuable industry in Cahir and of a space where artists and creative people could display and sell their wares.  It was run by a community employment scheme.</p><p>Those community employment projects deserve more respect and we need to do more to support these.  An allocation of &euro;96,000 per county is a pittance.  Concerns were expressed to me some time ago but it was decided to be deceitful, disrespectful and downright disingenuous to the staff, management and artists involved.  They have put on many an excellent display in the building which I have attended.  Something should be done to keep wonderful buildings like this.  It is based in Cahir town with the support of the South-East Regional Authority.  The 2017 to 2020 arts strategy for Tipperary is clear about the importance of the Craft Granary not only to Cahir town but the south east.  It is reprehensible that it will be closed when we are exiting a recession.  It will leave a significant gap in the landscape for artists and creative people, not giving them exposure for their wonderful gifts and talents as well as the chance to sell their products.</p></speech>

For pillar 2 of the Creative Ireland programme for creative communities, my Department allocated &euro;2 million while the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government gave &euro;1 million.  That means &euro;96,000 has been allocated to each local authority.  My Department and the Creative Ireland programme do not prescribe what creativity is and what activities can be supported, however.  Autonomy is granted to the local authorities, community groups or schools partaking in any Creative Ireland project or initiative.</p>  <p>  There is an array of creative activities, including traditional heritage-based activities and events, which are being supported by the Creative Ireland programme.  Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g, the national day of creativity for children and young people, for example, will take place this Saturday.  In 2018, there was the Ode on a Castle and a Tower event.  There was also the Vox Materia exhibition of sculpture and prints by the renowned artist, Alice Maher, which was curated by the Pluck Projects and commissioned by Brendan Maher of the Source Arts Centre in Thurles.  This exhibition was inspired by a visit to Kilcooley Abbey and the 12th century carving of a mermaid there.</p></speech>

It was one of the only dedicated facilities in the ownership of a local authority whose mandate was crafts promotion.  We have R&oacute;is&iacute;n Treacy and Mr. Maher, as well as other creative people.  We need this focal point.  As such there is an obligation on the local authority and the Department to ensure its activities collaborate with enterprise support agencies, council, regional bodies, higher education institutions, training bodies and the private sector to protect the future viability of the Craft Granary.  There has been a clear lack of ambition in ensuring this happens.  There is little point in developing glossy tourism strategies if we cannot protect the excellent resources we already have.  The Craft Granary building has been in use since 1809.  It is vital, therefore, that we not only protect the existing jobs there but the building's important historical legacy.</p></speech>

It provides a variety of programmes and supports for the sector.  Its activities are funded by the Department of Business, Enterprise, and Innovation via Enterprise Ireland.  My Department provides funding through the Creative Ireland programme to local authorities for the implementation of their cultural and creativity strategies.  In doing so, it sets out the broad parameters for the uses to which this funding is applied.  The precise projects which are funded and the manner in which the moneys are dispersed is a matter ultimately for each local authority.

I do not believe there has been a sale of the island since but there may well be tenders.  Will the Minister reconsider the State purchasing the island on behalf of the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, to maintain it as a sanctuary?</p></reply>

The day-to-day care of this national monument is undertaken by the Office of Public Works, OPW, on behalf of my Department which has overall policy responsibility for its long-term conservation.  The property is also part of a larger special protection area, SPA, under the birds directive.  My Department is aware that recent surveys have found larger colonies of certain bird species than were known previously.  Some of the survey work was partly funded by the Department.</p><p>My Department continues to explore ways to optimise the protection and presentation of heritage sites under our control in a way that is compatible with conservation objectives and that provides excellent value for money outcomes to the state.  In some instances this has included strategic land purchases.  As it is in State care, the national monument on this site is fully protected under the National Monuments Acts.  Any works at or in its vicinity may only be carried out with ministerial consent under those Acts.  This will remain so, irrespective of future ownership arrangements.  As we have discussed before, access to the site is very difficult and, therefore, any acquisition would bring little benefit in terms of visitor access to the monuments on the site.  The same access issues also mean that disturbance levels are low, which is of benefit to the breeding birds.</p><p>Property acquisition by my Department is the exception rather than the norm.  The countryside is populated with a rich range of almost 150,000 archaeological monuments.  The Department, working with OPW, is only in a position to acquire, maintain, conserve and present to the public a limited number of properties and monuments.  Acquisitions are, therefore, only contemplated where there is a clear, tangible and substantial benefit to the overall quality and management of the State&rsquo;s heritage portfolio.</p><p><i><font color="#2F2F2F">  Additional information not given on the floor of the House</font></i></p><p>In this case, the national monument and other recorded monuments are already well protected.  Even if the entire property were in public ownership, public access would continue to be hazardous and unsuitable for large-scale visitor exploration, which of itself also provides a significant safeguard for the bird population.  Additionally, value for money principles must be carefully considered where any acquisition is proposed.  Neither would it be appropriate or prudent for me to compromise any possible acquisition proposals by publicly disclosing interest or otherwise in any property.</p></reply>

It is not just because of the national monument on it and that the OPW should have an interest.  The NPWS should also have a critical interest in the island.  The recent scientific analysis from the island shows it is a spectacularly important location with 4,000 breeding pairs of storm petrels and an important colony of Manx shearwaters.  Seabirds are one of the most threatened species.  The seabirds on this island travel to the north Atlantic to feed.  We are in a row with Scotland about Rockall.  If we want to show we are serious about what is happening in the north Atlantic and preserving its ecology, it is important the NPWS takes ownership of islands like this and manages them.</p>  <p>  Last summer, I was on the beautiful Inishkea Islands, similarly located off the far west coast.  There is a real problem there of overgrazing, even though it is isolated and hard to get to.  We need to manage certain particularly sensitive sites.  High Island is one of the most sensitive of them all, not just for its archaeology but for the birdlife on it.  There is a prospect of managing this if we owned it.</p></speech>

As I have outlined previously, the site referred to contains a national monument owned by the Department and is in the day-to-day care of the OPW.</p><p>It does not have the potential to become a significant tourist attraction, in any event, as access is hazardous.  The asking price, which I think is &euro;1.25 million for approximately 32 hectares, is significant, and there are value for money principles which must be given careful consideration in the case of any acquisition.  The acquisition of land for the purposes of presentation or protection of national monuments, as I said, is the exception rather than the norm.  It is only considered where the national monument is otherwise not adequately protected, which is not the case in this instance.</p> <p> As the Deputy mentioned, the site is listed for a number of bird species but the difficulty of public access means a high degree of protection for the birds.</p></speech>

I understand the value for money proposition, which any Minister has to take into account.  However, to have no bid and no interest is, to my mind, a real missed opportunity.</p>  <p>  I want to draw the Minister back to the key question.  Let us put the national monument aside, although it is spectacular, and focus on the ecology.  The island, the birds on it, the monitoring of them and the management of the island to assist that, could be a critical part of our understanding of what is happening in the ecology of the north Atlantic.  In a world where climate change is changing weather systems, feeding systems and bird life systems in the north Atlantic, that is not an insignificant issue.  The populations there are not small; they are huge and hugely important.</p>  <p>  On that one issue alone, we should give the National Parks and Wildlife Service a real management capability.  I know the island is isolated and hard to get to.  However, I know the NPWS would love to have that sort of site within its portfolio and we would show we are interested in what is happening in the north Atlantic.  We could then go to the Scottish Government and say we have a real interest because we are engaged and because we are active in managing that whole system.</p></speech>

The site is listed for the following bird species: fulmar, barnacle goose and Arctic tern.  Some 358 fulmar pairs are estimated to breed on this site, which is approximately 1% of the total Irish population.  Another protected species, the barnacle goose, frequents this site in winter but, due to its remoteness, a precise and accurate estimate of site use is not available.  Bird survey and monitoring work is undertaken there by UCC and is part-funded by my Department.  The surveys led to population estimates for two additional species, the Manx shearwater and storm petrel, that are much higher than previous estimates and indicate that the place is of significant conservation value for these species.  Therefore, the designation may have to be amended to reflect this new information.</p>  <p>  Though not in State ownership, the site currently enjoys very low levels of human or farming disturbance, which benefits the birds.  It can be difficult to secure optimal grazing levels on offshore islands but, in this case, the access difficulties may well prevent that problem.</p>  <p>  The Department would be a statutory consultee on any planning proposal and should, therefore, have substantial influence over any proposal to build there.</p></speech>

This is an increase of &euro;36 million, or 12%, on the previous year.  This compares with a 5% increase in overall voted public expenditure in 2019.</p><p>Primary support for the arts is delivered through the Arts Council, whose funding has increased in recent years and now stands at &euro;75 million in 2019, an increase of &euro;6.8 million, or 10%, over 2018.  The Arts Council, which is independent in its funding decisions under the Arts Act 2003, operates within a published ten-year strategic framework, entitled Making Great Art Work.  This strategy prioritises support for artists throughout their careers by the involvement of many agencies in cultural provision, by the impact of the arts on the creative economy and by the depth and breadth of people's engagement with the arts.  For example, the Arts Council now includes, as an assessment criterion, the organisation&rsquo;s policy on the remuneration of artists in an effort to ensure that organisations in receipt of Arts Council funding should offer fair and equitable remuneration to artists.</p><p>My Department supports a broad range of programmes and initiatives across its remit to promote Ireland&rsquo;s image, including, in particular, the Creative Ireland programme and Culture Ireland.  The remit of Culture Ireland, which is a division of my Department, is to promote and advance Irish arts worldwide, thus strengthening Ireland&rsquo;s cultural profile and global reputation.  Strategic priorities include providing support for the international presentation of Irish artists and arts organisations, developing new and diverse international audiences and markets for Irish arts, and linking culture into the Government&rsquo;s international promotion strategy, in tandem with other relevant Government agencies.  Critically, the work of Culture Ireland is focused not just on promoting Ireland but also increasing career opportunities for Irish artists.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i></p><p>The cumulative impact of these funding increases is further testament to the commitment to double Government spending in the arts, culture and heritage sector.  My Department and I will continue to work rigorously with all of my Government colleagues towards delivering on the commitment to increase Government spending in the arts and culture sector on a trajectory that will see funding doubled by 2025.  In this context, I am already delivering additional supports to the arts and culture sector, building on the &euro;1.2 billion earmarked for culture, heritage and the Irish language under Project Ireland 2040, thus leading to increased activity and employment across all sectors under the remit of my Department.</p></speech>

I ask the degree to which philanthropists can be encouraged to assist in the very wide programme at both local and national level.

They are a mixture of practising artists, arts practitioners and teachers with an understanding of creativity and its potential to transform the lives of children and young people.</p>  <p>  There is also the creative funding that was mentioned in regard to County Kildare.

Thankfully, usage of waterway facilities is significant.  There is a need for ongoing maintenance and improvement of facilities that are being used and that attract great numbers of visitors to our country.  I understand that the budget last year for capital programmes was &euro;7.8 million, of which &euro;2.6 million was from Waterways Ireland's resources.  It is a small capital budget for such a vast area of State property so there is an urgent need to increase the capital funding available and ensure that necessary maintenance and upgrading of facilities are carried out to make sure our waterways continue to be a prime tourist attraction.</p></reply>

The current expenditure of the body is funded 85% by my Department and 15% by the Department for Infrastructure, which reflects the distribution of the navigable waterways in each jurisdiction.  Capital expenditure is funded 100% in the jurisdiction in which the capital works are carried out.  In addition, development work has been sustained through attracting third part investment from a wide range of sources.  </p><p>Waterways Ireland's work programmes are critical to providing a safe and high-quality recreational environment for the public while also preserving the industrial and environmental heritage of the waterways for future generations.  These challenges must be balanced with its objective of increasing recreational activity across all our waterways.</p><p>The Estimates for 2019 have provided for an allocation of &euro;25.117 million for Waterways Ireland, comprising &euro;20.737 million in current funding and &euro;4.38 million in capital funding.  This is an overall increase of &euro;1 million on the original 2018 allocation with capital funding increased by &euro;800,000.  Additional funding from Waterways Ireland in 2019 is not contemplated by the Estimates process and it will, like all other agencies under my remit, need to live within its capital allocation.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>As Minister, I have many competing and compelling requests for funding in 2020.  I am acutely aware of the value of our inland waterways' amenity and the excellent work that Waterways Ireland carries out.  Of particular importance is the strong community and business outreach and partnership policy that the organisation has implemented to engage with and deliver services for communities adjacent to the waterways to create social, recreational, health and economic benefits.  The inland waterways are also an intrinsic part of the island's tourism attractions and Waterways Ireland plays a key role in their marketing and promotion.</p></speech>

The Minister mentioned a figure for 2019 of &euro;4 million.  I do not know how an increase has come about.  Was she referring to Waterways Ireland drawing down funding from other programmes?  Could she clarify that?</p>  <p>  Can she also confirm that the capital works that were promised regarding the provision of moorings at Castle Saunderson with the restoration of part of the Ulster Canal will be carried out this year?  It is nearly 30 years since the Shannon-Erne Waterway was made navigable.  These facilities have been used extensively and have attracted a significant number of tourists to the Fermanagh-Cavan-Leitrim area as well as counties Roscommon and Longford.  There is a need to upgrade the facilities.  Perhaps the Minister could indicate to the House whether particular programmes will benefit the Shannon-Erne waterway and ensure that it continues to be the major attraction it has been for most of the past 30 years.</p></speech>

The Deputy mentioned the Ulster Canal.  In July 2007, the North-South Ministerial Council agreed to a proposal to restore the section of the Ulster Canal from Upper Lough Erne to Clones.  Planning approvals for the project have been secured from the relevant authorities in both jurisdictions.  Government approval to restore a 2.5 km stretch of the Ulster Canal from the upper Lough Erne to the international scout centre at Castle Saunderson, which was mentioned by the Deputy, near Belturbet in County Cavan was secured on 24 February 2015.  Work to extend navigation on the Ulster Canal from the upper Lough Erne to Castle Saunderson was completed in December 2018 with a bypass canal channel and a new bridge at Derrykerrib.  Installation of moorings at Castle Saunderson has been completed to enable its use as a destination for boats using the newly opened navigation from the Erne to Castle Saunderson.  To date, more than &euro;3 million has been spent on the entire Ulster Canal project.  Expenditure of &euro;1.13 million completed this portion of the navigation in 2018.</p></speech>

There is a need for a comprehensive capital programme to ensure that they remain up to standard in order that they can continue to attract visitors.  I again appeal to the Minister to ask Waterways Ireland to revisit the proposal we discussed in this House previously regarding the possibility of making the Erne navigable from Belturbet to Killykeen and Killeshandra.  It would be a major project but if an indication was given by the Minister, her Department and Waterways Ireland that some progress could be made in the planning of that project, it would be a worthwhile development.</p></speech>

I have put this question to previous Ministers.  What Waterways Ireland has done in all other areas is fabulous but no works have been carried out on paths and towpaths in that area and there are no moorings.  There is a need to address that.  Is it because this section of the canal goes through a mainly working-class area or is it because this is a forgotten part of the canal?</p></speech>

Similar to facilities in the North and the Border area, these canals are significant amenity resources.  Does the Minister have a policy whereby when Waterways Ireland undertakes any initiatives in conjunction with local authorities, it advises local residents what the proposals are, particularly in respect of protecting the wildlife corridors that exist along the canals?</p></speech>

Waterways Ireland officials met the chief executive officer of Cavan County Council and its elected representatives in 2017 and earlier this year in the context of the Ulster Canal advisory forum.</p>  <p>   I note the comments of Deputies &Oacute; Snodaigh and Burton on pollution.  I can come back to them with a full report, which I do not have to hand.  One of Waterways Ireland's main priorities is the maintenance of canals and delivering a prioritised management and maintenance programme for the waterways concentrating available resources on their greatest area of use and benefit.  It also wants to increase the use of inland navigations creating and promoting recreational opportunities for local communities and visitors, and delivering economic, social and health benefits.  I can come back to Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh regarding the moorings at Harold's Cross. </p>  <p>  In response to Deputy Burton's point about residents and their views, public consultations are usually undertaken, but I can certainly bring back the Deputy's concerns to Waterways Ireland.</p></speech>

The Government is committed to increasing funding for the arts.  In the past two years, I have secured a significant increase in funding for artists, primarily through the Arts Council, which the Deputy will be aware has experienced an increase of 15% in its annual funding since 2017 to &euro;75 million in 2019.  In addition, the Government has allocated &euro;1.2 billion in capital funding for culture, heritage and the Gaeltacht over the ten years to 2027 as part of the national development plan.  That includes &euro;200 million for the Audiovisual Action Plan, which sets out the Government's commitment to investing in the screen industry.</p>  <p>  In tandem with securing additional funding, my Department has also worked to address conditions and employment rights in the performing arts and screen industry in conjunction with the relevant agencies under its remit.  For example, the Arts Council, as part of its assessment of applications for funding now requires details of an organisation's policy on the remuneration of artists in an effort to ensure that organisations in receipt of Arts Council funding offer fair and equitable remuneration to artists.</p>  <p>  Regarding the screen industry, which we recently discussed, the film regulations require all applicants for section 481 tax credit to include with their applications a signed undertaking in respect of quality employment, which requires both the producer company and the qualifying company to comply with all obligations in the field of environmental, social and employment law.  The producer company and the qualifying company must be responsible for compliance with all statutory requirements of an employer and have in place written policies and procedures on grievances, discipline and dignity at work.  The companies are also required to provide details of any Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, decisions aligned with confirmation that any findings against the companies have been followed or an explanation where the finding has not been followed.  That is now a key requirement in the application process.  Screen Ireland also has similar requirements for companies in receipt of its funding.</p></speech>

My question is how we show that in reality.  I am not just talking about increased funding to the Arts Council; I am talking about the precarious nature of the work, the lack of stability, the short-term contracts and how very difficult it is for the majority working in the arts area to make a living.  I wish to stray into the area of social protection.  There is a need for a social welfare payment for those involved in the arts industry when they are out of work.  We know there is jobseeker's allowance and jobseeker's benefit.  Given the questions that are being asked of artists and actors to avail of either scheme, the system does not seem to take into account the sporadic nature of the work.  The circumstances of professional actors are unique and they do not suit the current JobPath programme.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, has introduced a pilot scheme for the arts, which was welcomed by the National Campaign for the Arts, but it is limited to those who are self-employed artists in just two specific communities, that is, literature and visual art, and the majority of working artists do not have access to that.  Does the Minister communicate with the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection on the issue because it is directly related to people who are working in the arts and culture area?</p></speech>

We are currently engaged in positive discussions to amend the system to encompass some of the people delineated by the Deputy.  However, it is a work in progress, which I hope to expedite as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  Employees in every industry and sector are entitled to all existing legal protections of employment law and the performing arts and film industries are not exempt.  There can be a perception that they are, but they are covered under the Employment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2018, which was signed into law by the President in December.  It will also improve the situation of insecurity and unpredictability of working hours for employees on insecure contracts, which the Deputy mentioned, and those working variable hours.</p></speech>

The issues were protection for workers and health and safety complaints procedures, among others.  The reality of what we heard that day was compelling, including passionate stories from people who have been working in the industry for many years.  They say that they have been blacklisted because of issues they raised and they have not been able to secure work.  Everybody in the audiovisual room agreed with the need to engage in some type of forum, yet when the Minister made her speech on this, she said that she felt it was not possible to have a collaborative approach now.  The current situation is intolerable for many of those who have been working in the industry for a long time.  They are now out of work and their skill set is being lost.  Will the Minister consider supporting a forum?</p></speech>

From 28 March, all applicants for section 481 funding, including producer companies and the qualifying companies, are required to sign an undertaking that they have in place written policies and procedures on grievances, discipline and dignity at work, which includes harassment, bullying and equal opportunity.  That means employers now have an obligation to provide workers on their productions with a workplace that is free of harassment, bullying and intimidation.  The obligation includes ensuring that workers are not harassed, bullied or intimidated by other workers.  If the producer companies or the qualifying companies cannot provide workers with a proper workplace environment they will not be able to obtain section 481 tax relief.</p>  <p>  We discussed the film forum at length on the previous occasion.  It is something I am concerned about.  I have instructed my officials to examine a way of mediating this dispute.  I know that issues arose from the presentation in the audiovisual room, even among the people in the room itself.  There is evidently a deep difference in the views and feelings of those involved.  If we seek to try to deliberate on an alternative route, we may be able to work something out.</p></speech>

Sites in my ownership or guardianship are maintained by the Office of Public Works.  Conservation matters in respect of these sites are managed through regular liaison between the OPW and my Department, identifying condition issues and proposing appropriate conservation actions.<br/><br/>My Department provides financial support for the protection of heritage buildings and historic structures through the built heritage investment scheme and the historic structures fund, which are administered by local authorities.  On 28 March this year I announced funding of &euro;4.3 million to 478 projects under these schemes.  Under the built heritage investment scheme 2019, Kildare County Council was allocated &euro;79,000 to support 13 projects.  These included the Church of Ireland in Kilberry; St. Michael's Church in Athy; Johnstown graveyard and church in Johnstown; Sean Chill in Donaghcomper in Celbridge; the Church of the Holy Saviour in Narraghmore; Ard Na Gr&eacute;ine, Canal View in Sallins; 7 Canning Place, Newbridge; Leixlip Boathouse; Pebble Hill House in Maynooth; Riverstown House in Kildangan; Grattan Vault, Tea Lane graveyard in Celbridge; Mill Cottage in Millicent South, Sallins; and Thatched Cottage in Thomastown.  The total was &euro;79,000.  Under the historic structures fund 2019, Kildare County Council was allocated &euro;25,000 to support a project at Newbridge College.<br/><br/>Educating young people about our heritage is fundamental to its preservation.  To this end, the Heritage Council, funded by my Department, runs a highly successful heritage in schools programme, which aims to encourage greater awareness among primary school children of Ireland's rich heritage through engaging and stimulating visits to schools by a number of heritage in schools experts. </p></speech>

Are moves afoot to identify sites that have missed out over the years and have become largely unknown in their localities?  I refer to the importance of local history and the need to protect such structures and develop them archaeologically, perhaps with a view to excavation.  I once had the opportunity to visit the rock of Masada and was very impressed with what had been done there.  I think we can do a considerable amount here.  I ask the Minister if we can look at the tapestry of historical sites and buildings throughout the country that seem to have been neglected over the years, notwithstanding the good work that has been done, with a view to encompassing them in a campaign for restoration.</p></speech>

We have to ensure that our national monuments are protected and preserved.  As the Deputy knows, I am the owner or guardian of almost 1,000 national monuments ranging from prehistoric burial monuments to medieval fortifications and religious sites.  Under the provisions of the National Monuments Acts, my Department has established and maintains the record of monuments and places.  This affords legal protection to over 120,000 recorded archaeological sites and monuments in the State.  Anyone proposing works to a monument that is included in the record of monuments and places must give my Department two months' prior notice before works can start.  There are a number of mechanisms under the National Monuments Acts aimed at protecting Ireland's archaeological sites and monuments.  They include any works to national monuments either managed by the OPW or those in the care of a local authority which require my consent under section 14.  Two months' notice of any works to a monument which is included in the record of monuments and places must be given to my Department.  Any excavation at an archaeological site can only take place under licence from my Department.  For the Deputy's information, in 2018 there were 956 excavation licences issued.</p></speech>

For example, a site in the middle of a forest may become extremely vague in so far as the local people are concerned.  Measures might be put in place to ensure that such sites and locations are not lost forever with the passage of time.  I suggest that we might initiate a particular programme of archaeological investigation and excavation to allow the present generation to avail of the benefit of such sites' existence and the knowledge that goes with it.</p></speech>

There is a fine balance there.  In respect of supports, my Department provides financial support for the protection of heritage buildings and historic structures through the build heritage investment scheme and the historic structures fund, which are administered ultimately by local authorities.  I announced funding of &euro;4.3 million to 478 projects under these schemes.  There is also the Heritage Council, which is funded by my Department and which runs a highly successful heritage in schools programme.  That programme is about enjoyment for present as well as future generations.

Nevertheless we have to look at all of this from an impartial perspective.  Project Ireland 2040 has given explicit recognition to the importance of our culture, language and heritage.  It sets out the Government's objectives for capital investment in Ireland's culture, language and heritage.  The plan includes a total of &euro;40 million, or &euro;4 million in each of the ten years from 2018 to 2027, to secure existing investment in arts and culture infrastructure nationwide and to ensure regional balance.  A total of &euro;3.9 million was spent on arts and culture infrastructure in 2018.  This level of investment will ensure the upkeep of regional infrastructure right across the country.</p>  <p>  The recent arts and cultural capital scheme to which the Deputy refers allocated &euro;10.214 million to 134 projects under three complementary grant schemes for the refurbishment and enhancement of the existing arts and cultural facilities throughout the country.  Over &euro;1.5 million of this was drawn down in 2018 and over &euro;3.9 million remains to be paid out over the coming years.  This is the most significant investment in cultural infrastructure in a decade, with funding provided to arts centres, theatres, galleries and museums, artists' studios and creative spaces.  The list of these projects with the amounts of their allocations is available on my Department's website.</p>  <p>  The capital scheme is making a significant difference to many individual organisations.  My Department is already seeing good outcomes and receiving positive feedback.  My Department is currently giving consideration to a new round of grant funding for this capital scheme which is to be announced later this year.</p><p>In the meantime, the Arts Council in conjunction with local government, via the County and City Management Association, CCMA, commissioned an independent, strategic review of the network of venues and arts centres throughout the country.  The review focuses on the infrastructure of professionally managed arts buildings that are open to the public throughout the year, and that will be used to help develop a co-ordinated, spatially informed strategy to support and develop the built infrastructure for the arts.</p></speech>

The seven flagship projects in that scheme all got grants between &euro;300,000 and &euro;1 million.  The rest of the funding was then scattered across 55 schemes.  Is the Minister considering the same scale of funding for a new scheme?  How ambitious will any new scheme be?  What is the total funding available for the scheme?  It is three years since a fire caused the closure of the Briery Gap cultural centre in Macroom.  An ambitious plan is being put in place for a &euro;4 million redevelopment.</p>  <p>  The county council, with fewer resources than the Minister's Department, has allocated &euro;1 million to the project already.  There is also insurance funding available.  The Minister's Department has provided some moneys, about 6% of the overall cost.  When we consider the size of the project and the type of schemes previously in place, the scale does not match up.  Will there be an ambitious scheme that will meet the needs of projects such as Macroom and many other facilities throughout the country?  The project in Macroom seeks to establish not just a cultural centre for the local area but one that will serve a wider regional and national audience.</p></speech>

Deputy Moynihan is correct when he states that &euro;3.9 million was spent in 2018 from a total of &euro;10.214 million.  Another &euro;7.6 million is to be paid out.  The Deputy may have noticed that I mentioned that we are waiting for the Arts Council to publish a report it has done on a review of local arts centres throughout the country.  We cannot go ahead with the capital scheme until we have that report.  It is important to note that the Arts Council incorporated a consultation phase into that study.  All stakeholders had an opportunity to participate in that consultation.  The Deputy mentioned the types of funding available.  This review will inform my Department's framing of the new round of arts and cultural capital funding.</p></speech>

The previous scheme was announced in 2017.  Groups have been getting down to work since then.  It took about a year at that stage for applications to be processed.  If this scheme were to be opened tomorrow morning, it would still be almost 2020 before it would be possible to make an application.  The Minister will understand the urgency given the absence of a scheme since 2017.  There has been a gap in funding for three years.  How quickly will a new scheme be put in place?  Will the Minister ensure that this scheme is given more urgency?  In addition, will the scheme have the scale of funding needed for projects such as the Briery Gap in Macroom and many others as well?  As an example, an investment of &euro;1.5 million in the redevelopment in Macroom would facilitate the provision of a &euro;4 million regional and national cultural centre.</p></speech>

Is the Minister giving any consideration to an ongoing programme of minor works for arts venues?  Many such venues find that they do not have the money to do basic daily and annual maintenance.  That builds up into a greater need for capital expenditure over time.  In the context of the Arts Council review, will the Minister consider a minor works scheme that will allow such basic work to be done on an ongoing basis?  To make a broader point, does she have plans, given the extra running costs and current expenditures, such as utility costs and insurance costs, to increase the level of expenditure of capitation on our various arts venues?  Many of those venues have not had an increase in funding in many years.</p></speech>

I am waiting on that report.  This point also addresses Deputy Calleary's question.  That report will inform the type of cultural capital scheme that we will put in place.  I take Deputy Calleary's points on board.  At the moment, however, it is possible for any arts centre to apply for funding for maintenance works.  We have funded different arts centres that were having difficulties such as a leak, an issue with rewiring or similar problems.  Small amounts of funding are available to help address such issues.</p>  <p>  I appreciate that urgency is required from the perspective of both Deputies, and indeed from my own.  I am anxious to help artists and arts centres.  From our experience to date, the Department has noted that it is better value for money to provide smaller grants to organisations.  The maximum grant that would be likely in that context would be about &euro;200,000 to &euro;300,000.  It is most likely, however, that a smaller capital scheme for amounts up to &euro;50,000 will be announced.  I take on board the points made by the Deputies, and I understand the emphasis that Deputy Moynihan places on the need for urgency regarding the Briery Gap theatre redevelopment.</p></speech>

The peat bogs that Bord na M&oacute;na devastated are not being restored.  Trees that were planted have all been ripped out of the ground and cut up.  About half of them have been burnt and the carbon released back into the atmosphere.  It is vital, therefore, that we do something else to sequester carbon quickly and in a permanent way.  About 170 km of our coastline is protected by salt marshes.  What is the Minister's Department doing to preserve those salt marshes and are there any plans to expand the existing areas?</p></reply>

He will be missed in the D&aacute;il but I wish him all the very best.</p>  <p>  My Department is the lead Department responsible for implementing EU nature legislation in Ireland, including the habitats directive.  Under Articles 11 and 17, Ireland is required to carry out scientific monitoring of habitats and species and report on their status to the EU.  My Department recently completed a draft report for 2013-2018.  A decline in seagrass beds in several bays was recorded.  The cause for such declines in some cases appears to be related to water quality, which in turn may be due to run-off from municipal or agricultural sources.  Further research is needed, however.  The scientific advice from my Department, based on experience elsewhere in Europe, is that replanting of seagrass is rarely successful and that dealing with water quality is likely to be the best option for restoration.</p>  <p>  The Article 17 report assessed salt marshes and reported that nationally they are in an "inadequate" state but are relatively stable.  Small losses were noted due to infilling and other activities.  The main threat to salt marshes is sea level rise due to climate change.  That could cause so-called coastal squeeze, whereby hard coastal defences would obstruct the natural shift of salt marsh habitat as the sea level rises.  This is a matter to consider in the context of climate change adaptation planning.  My Department&rsquo;s biodiversity sectoral climate change adaptation plan recommends the development of an integrated coastal management strategy.  That strategy should include ecosystem-based adaptation actions to manage climate risk and to build resilience to climate change.</p>  <p>  The habitats directive also requires Ireland to develop a prioritised action framework for 2021 to 2027 for protected species and habitats, including salt marshes, seagrass beds and other coastal habitats.  As well as reviewing the results of the scientific monitoring programme, my Department will be examining all of these other issues.  Finally, mangrove forests generally occur in tropical and subtropical habitats worldwide and do not occur naturally in Ireland.</p></speech>

We have to accept that salt marshes are very impressive at sequestering and storing carbon.  Some studies have estimated that, per hectare, a salt marsh can sequester carbon at 40 times the speed of a tropical rainforest.</p><p>Vegetated coastal ecosystems such as our salt marshes currently store huge quantities of carbon and need to be protected and expanded.  The Government is not doing enough in this respect.  For instance, in a connected area, ecosystems such as Bantry Bay, which support much flora and fauna and biological communities and work as a carbon sink, the precautionary principal should be used.  Unfortunately, however, in Bantry Bay, the profit principle is king.  The Government has given permission for an industrial project in the bay, which is upsetting people who have an interest in protecting the ecosystem no end.  I plead with the Minister to examine this again.</p></speech>

There are several smaller salt marsh areas in Wexford harbour too.  Perhaps, when the Deputy is in the EU, he can bring it to the attention of the European Parliament also.</p></speech>

It makes some interesting insights and recommendations.  There is clearly concern about the number of laboratories which are being used to outsource testing, which is 16 rather than the original six, but Dr. Scally is assured that did not impact on quality.  We must reassert that screening programmes are very important.  They can help to prolong and save lives.  The CervicalCheck programme has saved many lives and has had positive effects in terms of earlier interventions.  It has been impactful and we should reassert the importance of the screening programmes.</p><p>Since the scandal broke a year ago, commitments were made on a number of issues, primarily the establishment of a compensation tribunal to take the issues out of the courts and the introduction of open mandatory disclosure.  There have been significant delays in progressing both.  Women have had to go through the courts and endure the trauma and distress of court appearances.  We remain unsure of the timeline for the review being undertaken by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists on the Irish smear tests.  It was August originally and it has now slipped back to October.  Will the Taoiseach update us on that point?</p><p>Those within the 221 group still await reimbursement for the costs involved in their having to do their own independent slide reviews, which they were obliged to organise for themselves and was not included in the original support package.  In the critical part of his analysis, Dr. Scally makes the point that there is a crying need for a change in approach to the mechanisms used to respond on the rare occasions when harm results from error in screening programmes.  He notes: </p><blockquote>The legal processes currently in place are deeply unsatisfactory.  They convert error into injustice, and then convert that injustice into financial remedy.  The process is traumatic and filled with uncertainty for the person at the centre of the legal action and for their family. </blockquote><p>He notes that the established legal processes clearly fail to meet the wishes of the patient.  A no-fault scheme with dialogue could bring about compensation with &quot;listening, hearing, grace and compassion &ndash; and the real hope that what happened in the past shall not happen again&quot;.  Scally's recommendation on this is central to how the screening programmes go forward in terms of its interaction with patients and those who avail of the screening programmes.  There is no question that women caught up in the CervicalCheck scandal have been forced into very traumatic and expensive legal cases in the pursuit of an explanation or apology.  Women want to be told the truth.  They want to be given an apology and they want reassurance that it will not happen to anyone else.</p><p>It is well over a year since the scandal broke.  Is Dr. Scally correct that a no-fault compensation approach the most effective way to deal with this?  Will the Taoiseach indicate if the Government is prepared to introduce such a no-fault compensation scheme in the context of the CervicalCheck programme?  When does the Government believe the tribunal will be established?  Can he give the House a timeline for the establishment of a tribunal? </p></speech>

I thank Dr. Scally and his team for their supplementary report, which was published yesterday.  It was discussed at yesterday's Cabinet meeting.  Reading through the report yesterday, I was struck by the words of one of the women affected by the controversy who is quoted as saying "The only way we can ever fix anything, is by highlighting the failures of the past and fixing them".  In many ways that sums up everything we are trying to do, which is to identify the failures of the past, to highlight them and then fix them.  That quote contained in Dr. Scally's report is central to this in so many different ways.</p>  <p>  The revelations that some of the laboratories outsources slides to other laboratories is serious and unacceptable.  It was not approved and it may have been a breach of contract.  It should not have happened and it should have been picked up by CervicalCheck's own quality assurance and management scheme, but clearly was not.  It is reassuring, however, that the labs were accredited, albeit one retrospectively, and that Dr. Scally says that there is no reason to believe that those labs were in any way substandard.   </p>  <p>  On the actions undertaken in the last year, the Scally inquiry was established and has now reported twice.  Most people accept that Dr. Scally and his team did a very good job.  Had we gone down the commission of investigation route we would probably not have a report, and we would be talking about extensions.  Dr. Scally has done a very good job in a relatively short period.  A package of supports has been put in place for the 221-plus women and their families, including medical cards, experimental medicines and various payments, which now total over &euro;1 million.  The Government has decided to introduce the HPV vaccine for boys, which will begin in September.  We also decided to move towards primary HPV testing of smears, which is more accurate.  We will be among the first countries in the world to do so.  Funding has been provided for that in this year's Estimates and the policy decision to do it has been taken.</p>  <p>  The Deputy asked about the compensation tribunal.  I spoke to the Minister of Health about it this morning.  He is very keen to publish that Bill in the next couple of weeks and have it through the Houses before the recess.  However, he will require the co-operation of the Joint Committee on Health on this, as in order to get this done in the next five weeks and have it made law by mid-July so that it might be established in the autumn, it will be necessary for the joint committee to waive pre-legislative scrutiny.  Both he and I appeal to the members of that committee not to delay this and to please agree to the Minister's request in this case.</p>  <p>  The HSE's new policy on open disclosure will be published very soon.  The legislation around mandatory disclosure will be introduced in the autumn session.   </p></speech>

It is a tactic, a pattern that the Taoiseach engages in continually.  I asked a very basic question on the central point that Dr. Scally made that the screening programmes are crying out for a no-fault compensation scheme because the trauma visited upon the women involved is too severe.  They convert error into injustice, and then convert that injustice into financial remedy.  The process is traumatic and filled with uncertainty for the person.</p><p>It does not take 15 months to discover that.  I asked the Taoiseach whether he agreed with Dr. Scally that we should set up such a no-fault compensation mechanism and whether the Government is committed to doing that.  It is central to the continuation and the future of screening programmes and how issues like this will be treated in future.</p> <p> The Taoiseach, again, has a habit of endeavouring to deflect to the Opposition.  The Opposition has been nothing but co-operative on this.  It is not the Opposition's fault that the legislation on the tribunal was not produced until relatively recently.</p></speech>

It is something that requires consideration.  We did not discover that as a Government in recent months or during the past year.  We have set up a group to examine this matter and tort reform under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice Charlie Meenan.  We are waiting for him to come back to us with his suggestions in that regard.  This is a good idea.  It is something that was in my party's manifesto.  It was also in the programme for Government.  However, I wish to say two things about it that are important.  First, it could apply not only to screening errors but beyond them to vaccine-related injuries and cerebral palsy cases, which are difficult ones as well.</p></speech>

Generally, when no-fault schemes are established - they exist in other parts of the world and in Ireland - the awards are quite modest and they are no fault.  No fault means that nobody is to blame, nobody is held to account, nobody is deemed negligent and nobody is deemed liable.  If we are going to go down that route, we need to understand that because many people are looking for accountability and want to know who made an error.  They want that person held to account.  That cannot happen with a no-fault scheme, so this needs to be thought through and teased through.</p></speech>

In recent weeks, we have learned that the HSE has effectively suspended the allocation of home help hours to new applicants until November of this year.  The HSE also confirmed that there is to be a reduction in the number of recycled hours or reallocating of hours.  This comes at a time more than 6,000 people are waiting for home care supports.  There is no doubt that this will have a major impact on older citizens in need of care and their families, and on people with disabilities and their carers.  It will also have a major impact on the wider community because reducing home help hours places pressures on our hospitals as a result of delayed discharges.  It forces older people who are fit to be at home into nursing homes.  These people want to be at home.  They want to be in their own environment.  They have been medically discharged and can go home provided the supports are in place.  However, they cannot go home because the home care supports are simply not in place as a result of this decision.</p>  <p>  All of this is happening because the HSE says it needs to balance its budget for 2019.  The Taoiseach said yesterday, in response to a question from Deputy McDonald, that the budget for home care supports has increased.  I accept that, although it has increased significantly less than the amount we in Sinn F&eacute;in called for at the time.  The HSE has said that the increase had not translated to an increase in the number of hours of care that was expected.  The reality is that the budget increase has been eaten up by demographic pressures and service provision.  It is not even standing still compared to last year.</p>  <p>  The real measure of the performance, if we need a real measure, is to look at some of the facts.  There are now in excess of 6,000 people waiting for home care supports.  Countless others have had their home care provision cut by half an hour here or an hour there.  Now, we have a freeze on reallocating additional hours to patients until November and the recycling of other hours.</p>  <p>  We know home care support is good value for money.  We know it represents excellent value for money in the immediate term, the medium term and the long term because it allows people to remain in their homes and go safely from hospital to their own environments and settings but, without the home care supports or home help hours, patients are forced to remain in hospitals.  This represents a drastic inefficiency within the health service.  It has a significant cost and is a major burden on patients and their families.  Individuals either have to remain in hospital or nursing homes or else families are forced to seek private operators and pay for the costs themselves.  Neither of these options represents value for money - we know that clearly.</p>  <p>  I am asking the Taoiseach what we asked yesterday.  Will he give us an undertaking to look at where the funding can be found within the HSE budget to ensure that additional home help hours are provided for the rest of the year for those patients who are in need of them?  That this would ease the budgetary pressures on other sections of our health service.  Will the Taoiseach commit to doing this quickly?</p></speech>

Home care helps patients to get out of hospital quicker, thus freeing up hospital beds for others who need them.  There is no disagreement in the House about that.</p>  <p>  I spoke to the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Daly, about this matter yesterday.  I understand there will be a debate on it in the House tonight.  We are trying to get all the information about this.  There seems to be quite a lot of variation from one community healthcare area to another.  It may not be the case, as has been reported, that there will be no new hours until November, at least not in all parts of the country.  We are trying to get a fix on that in advance of the debate tonight.</p>  <p>  Resources are being increased for home help and home care.  The budget for home help and home care in 2015 was a little over &euro;300 million.  This year, it is &euro;446 million, which is a 50% increase in four years.  While there has been an increase in population in the past four years, the population has aged slightly in the past four years and the cost of home care has increased in the past four years, they have not increased by 50%.  It is reasonable for us, as citizens and taxpayers, to expect a much better service for a 50% increase in funding.  It is the responsibility of the HSE and Government to ensure that happens.</p>  <p>  An extra &euro;30 million is provided for this year.  This will provide 18.3 million hours in home support.  That is an increase of 800,000 on last year.  That is 800,000 more hours this year than last year, which is a significant increase.  I am informed, on the basis of a note I was provided with earlier today, that this takes account of the Tyco decision and the fact that home help staff are paid for travelling time.  We are trying to get to the bottom of this ourselves.</p></speech>

We know all of that in respect of delayed discharges and the number of people who are on trolleys.</p>  <p>  I am sure every Deputy in the House knows of multiple cases in their constituencies involving people in our acute hospitals who have been medically discharged and who should be in their homes but who are not at home because there are no home care supports for them.</p><p>Let us look at the numbers. The Taoiseach, coming from the medical profession, knows this.  It costs the State &euro;6,000 per week to have someone in an acute bed.  It costs &euro;160 if they can get the home care support package.  This represents huge inefficiencies.  We talk about inefficiencies and wastage in health.  It makes no sense that patients who are medically discharged are not able to go back into their home environment because a blunt instrument from the HSE says it has run out of money and cannot provide home care supports for them.  There is a need for both additional allocation and more money.  We argued for that at the time but regardless, we now know the facts.  We now know there are 6,000 people on waiting lists, that countless others have had their hours cut, that home help hours will not be provided until November and that the HSE is not going to recycle or reallocate home help hours when they come back into the system.  We need more than a debate.  The Taoiseach is in charge and his Minister is in charge.  This is huge inefficiency and waste and it is causing serious distress to patients, their families and their carers.  I ask the Taoiseach to act quickly on this. </p></speech>

I come back to the basic, important, and fundamental point that the budget for home help has increased by 50% in four years.  It has gone up from &euro;300 million to &euro;450 million this year.  Wage inflation is about 2% or 3% a year, while demographics in aging might account for 1% or 2% extra a year.  That is nowhere close to a 50% increase.  What is happening commonly, unfortunately, in health and social care is that huge amounts of additional money are being put in; much more than is required to cover demographics and inflation.  Yet, citizens, patients and people are not getting the increased service they should be getting.  We must have learned by now that when it comes to health and social care, just allocating more money all the time is not the solution.  If it were, the 50% increase in the past four years would have provided a much greater and better service.  We need to listen to the advice of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council on that, as well as to our own common sense.  Major increases in spending on health and social care in recent years to record levels, beyond demographics or inflation, have not provided the better services that people deserve, that patients need and for which taxpayers pay.  The solution is not always more money.</p></speech>

When we negotiate in Europe and have to hand over any of our rights in these negotiations, we have been handing over the rights of our fishermen and the Irish Sea bit by bit.  This has meant our fishermen have had to travel out of their own waters as they fight for a livelihood and watch frustratedly as foreign vessels flood the Irish Sea every day without any rule or regulation to prevent them from doing so.  Only two months ago, a small crisis erupted in Irish seas as two Irish fishing vessels from Northern Ireland were detained for fishing within six nautical miles of the Irish coast.  Our Government then frantically jumped through every guideline so we could hand over the only rights we had to the coast around Ireland.  I was called unpatriotic by a Minister in the Government when I and other Independents pleaded with the Government to stop the panicked handover, and to put the Sea-Fisheries (Amendment) Bill 2017 through pre-legislative scrutiny so as to give us time to weigh up all options.  However, the Independents in the D&aacute;il were not listened to and the Government, together with Fianna F&aacute;il and Sinn F&eacute;in, panicked to give away the rights of Irish fishermen once again.</p>  <p>  Fast forward just two months, and we now see the shocking error we have made as the Scottish Government has made it very clear to this Government that it intends to fully protect its fishermen going forward.  It has clearly instructed our Government that it will ban all Irish fishing vessels within 12 miles of Rockall, an area where Irish fishing vessels had previously operated unhindered, fishing haddock, squid and other species.  Since this has become public, we have heard calls from all over the Irish political spectrum to intervene but many fishermen have rung me to say these are crocodile tears, as the time to stand up and be noticed was a few months ago when these same politicians handed over our fishing rights without the blink of an eyelid.  The frantic rushing through of the Sea-Fisheries (Amendment) Bill in the D&aacute;il a couple of months ago left huge unanswered questions.  All I or any of my Independent colleagues ever wanted was more time to look at that Bill in more detail to see if we could negotiate a better deal.  We were ignored by our Government, however, and now we are in a serious situation where the Scottish want us out.  We also potentially face further crisis in the fishing industry regarding Brexit, because the British have made it clear that they also want Irish vessels out of their waters after Brexit.  The fishermen of this country deserve honest answers.  How long has this Government been aware of the Scottish issues with Rockall?  Was it aware before the Sea-Fisheries (Amendment) Bill was rushed through the D&aacute;il two months ago?  Was the Taoiseach aware of this problem?  Were Fianna F&aacute;il or Sinn F&eacute;in made aware of the potential Scottish Rockall crisis in their negotiations around agreeing to vote in favour of the Sea-Fisheries (Amendment) Bill two months ago?  In my view, this is the only bargaining chip Ireland had, and we frantically handed over further fishermen's rights inside the D&aacute;il two months ago.  I am convinced that if any political party in this country which had the interests of the people at heart knew of this problem in Scotland, no one in his or her right mind would have thrown away our rights without first having fishermen's rights protected elsewhere. </p></speech>

There was no guillotine, nor has any legislation been guillotined in this D&aacute;il, which has now been in existence for three years.  Adequate time was provided for the discussion of that legislation, and there was no attempt to curtail or limit debate on it.  The Government was informed in relation to the position the Scottish Government has taken.  The T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, were informed several months ago that Scotland had a view and an opinion that it had exclusive rights to fishing within 12 miles of Rockall, that it was minded to enforce that, and that it would come back to us and give us notice before it was enforced.  That happened in the last week or so.  I cannot say whether Fianna F&aacute;il or Sinn F&eacute;in were aware of that.  The Deputy would have to ask them.</p></speech>

Deputy Michael Collins's question about Fianna F&aacute;il and Sinn F&eacute;in has been answered for him.  Ireland's position regarding Rockall is that there is no basis for excluding Irish fishing vessels from Rockall waters, as they are legitimately pursuing EU fishing opportunities and have done so unhindered for decades.  We believe any concerns should be handled through dialogue rather than universal enforcement action.  The House will be aware that the T&aacute;naiste recently received a formal letter of notice from the Scottish Cabinet Secretary for Culture, Tourism and External Affairs, Fiona Hyslop, stating that Scotland would deploy vessels in the Rockall area to take enforcement action against Irish vessels found within 12 miles of Rockall from last week onwards.  Jurisdiction over the 12-mile area has long been disputed.  The UK claims sovereignty over Rockall and thus a 12-mile territorial limit around it.  The Irish Government position has been and remains that we do not recognise this claim, that the waters around Rockall are part of the UK's exclusive economic zone and they accordingly form part of the European Union waters under the Common Fisheries Policy, to which the principle of equal access for all European vessels, including Irish vessels, applies.  Irish vessels have operated unhindered in the Rockall zone for many decades, fishing haddock, squid, and other species.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine met representatives of the fishing sector on Friday to inform them of the letter from the Scottish authorities but also to confirm that Ireland's position on Rockall has not changed.  The industry was appreciative of that engagement but was also extremely concerned about the possibility that unjustified enforcement action might be taken against it.  In engaging with the Scottish authorities, Ireland's position has been that there is no basis for excluding our vessels from the Rockall waters as they are pursuing EU fishing opportunities in these waters and have done so unhindered for decades.  It has been agreed that a process of intensified engagement will now take place, led by senior officials from both Administrations.</p></speech>

I speak to fishermen from my constituency of Cork South-West daily.  Whether they are inshore fishermen or fisherwomen or work on larger trawlers, they are furious with political parties that time and again have thrown away any rights Irish fishermen have.  They want a stand-alone Minister in this country whose sole responsibility is to fight for their rights, the same as in other European countries.  Every call for fishermen by myself and others has gone unheeded.  Only last year, I made call after call for Ireland to apply for a bluefin tuna quota like its fellow European nations.  This was resisted until the Government was eventually embarrassed into doing so.</p><p> My calls for a cull of seals have gone ignored.  The livelihoods of inshore fishermen in Castletownbere and throughout west Cork have been destroyed by the large number of seals at sea.</p> <p> The throwing away of our rights within six nautical miles was the last straw for many fishermen.  We can now see the major fallout for them.  The Bill was rushed through the D&aacute;il.  There was no pre-legislative scrutiny and no time given for us to discuss it.  It was cut short.  Why was the D&aacute;il never told about the Rockall dispute with Scotland two months ago during our short discussions on the Sea-Fisheries (Amendment) Bill 2017 when there had been ongoing issues since 2017?  Had we known of them during our discussions, surely we would have tried to negotiate a deal that would have protected the rights of Irish fishermen for once.</p></speech>

I am afraid I just do not see how the Sea-Fisheries (Amendment) Act 2019 relates to the Rockall dispute.  This is a question of the Scottish Government, on behalf of the UK or, rather, off its own bat, asserting sovereignty over Rockall and thereby claiming an exclusive zone of 12 miles around that.  We take a different view.  When the exclusive economic zones were drawn, the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea was applied, and that treats uninhabited, uninhabitable rocks such as Rockall as if they do not exist.  We accept that Rockall is in the United Kingdom's exclusive economic zone - everyone does - but what we do not accept is that Rockall has a 12-mile exclusive limit around it.  For so long as the United Kingdom is part of the European Union, these are European waters and Irish fishermen are entitled to fish for their quota and for non-quota species in any part of that UK exclusive economic zone, but obviously with Brexit that will change.  One thing that is often not fully appreciated is that Irish fishermen take a lot of fish out of UK waters.  Perhaps 35% of all the fish that we take comes out of UK waters, including some of the most valuable species such as shrimp, mackerel and so on.  That is why in any negotiation around Brexit we are going to need to do a lot of work to limit the damage to our fishery sector and to make sure that our rights are protected.</p></speech>

During the recent local election campaign, the undermining of our Defence Forces was one of the most frequently raised issues on the doorstep.  It is clear that the policy being pursued by the Taoiseach and his Government, which that commenced with the so-called reorganisation of the Defence Forces and the closure of barracks in 2012, has led to a crisis in the service.  There have been significant reductions in numbers, pay, allowances, pensions and conditions of service.  There is low morale, anxiety, increased stress and mental health difficulties among serving personnel.</p><p>On 1 March this year under the Taoiseach's watch, there were 210 fewer serving personnel than on 1 March last year.  Some 3,200 personnel left the Defence Forces between 2014 and 2018.  In the first four months of this year, there were 256 discharges.  Staff shortages mean that ships are unable to go to sea and aircraft are unable to fly.  This is a picture of a service that is not fit for purpose due to the deliberate policy of this Government.</p><p>Please do not tell us that we do not have the money to resource and pay our Defence Forces properly.  Ireland is the eighth richest country in the world.  We know that the top 10% of financial asset holders have &euro;50 billion more than they had at peak boom levels in 2006, yet they are not asked to pay a single cent in tax on that windfall.  We know that the top 10% of income recipients pay a smaller proportion of their incomes in tax than the lowest 10%.  In today's edition of the<i>Irish Examiner</i>, Social Justice Ireland confirmed that the poor in this country are subsidising the rich through tax reliefs.</p><p>I wish to take this opportunity to commend the community group, Respect and Loyalty, which is campaigning to raise awareness about the plight of our Defence Forces and is lobbying for the restoration of pay, allowances and pensions.</p><p>The Taoiseach is the Minister for Defence.  In view of the crisis affecting the Defence Forces and the resulting national danger that he and his Government have allowed to develop, why has the matter of allowances not been addressed in line with allowances in other public sector bodies?  Will the Taoiseach fully restore to pre-2008 levels the pay, allowances, conditions of service and pensions of serving and retired members of the Defence Forces immediately?</p></speech>

I confirm to the House that the Cabinet yesterday approved the deployment of the Army ranger wing to the UN mission in Mali.  That will require a motion of the House, so I ask for the House's support for that.  It is the first time in nearly ten years that the rangers have been deployed in this way.  It is something that the Defence Forces very much welcome.  It is a big part of our peacekeeping efforts and our commitment to the UN, but it also will help them to maintain and develop their skills.  I know it has been very much welcomed by the Defence Forces.</p>  <p>  We are investing in our Defence Forces.  The budget for defence this year is &euro;50 million higher than last year.  What does that mean?  It means new vessels.  Our fleet has never been as modern as it is now.  It means new aircraft-----</p></speech>

Recruitment is going very well but retention is not.  I absolutely acknowledge that a large number of people are leaving our Defence Forces for various reasons, not least the fact that, because they are so well skilled, their skills are very much sought after in the private sector where there are also major skill shortages and labour shortages because of full employment.</p>  <p>  When it comes to the issue of pay - I acknowledge that pay is an issue for a lot of members of our Defence Forces - the public sector stability agreement, the deal that we did with ICTU and all the trade unions that covers 300,000 public servants, applies to the Defence Forces as well.  That means ongoing pay restoration.  For the vast majority of public servants, including the vast majority of people in the Defence Forces, they will have their pay fully restored by October of next year.  That is already happening in tranches.</p>  <p>  However, the Deputy is asking me to single out one group, the Defence Forces, and fully restore their pay, pensions and allowances before everyone else's.  While that might appeal to me as the Minister for Defence, I could not possibly do that as Taoiseach because that would be totally unfair to all the other public servants-----</p></speech>

We have a similar situation in our Defence Forces at present.  The Taoiseach has acknowledged the significant difficulties that exist in the Defence Forces.  The cases of the garda&iacute; and the nurses offer the Government a clear precedent in dealing with the issues in the Defence Forces.  All it takes is political will on the part of the Government to ensure the Defence Forces are properly paid and get their proper allowances.  It is a matter of political will for the Government to ensure pay and allowances are restored in full immediately.  The Government should do this now.</p></speech>

Those disputes were resolved following negotiations and, in the end, in the Labour Court.  In resolving those disputes, we needed to make sure we did not bring down the entire public sector pay agreement.  We cannot afford to bring it down.  We are trying to resolve the Defence Forces pay dispute.  We asked the Public Sector Pay Commission to examine issues like allowances that are specific to the Defence Forces.  The commission has reported.  We have the report and we will bring it to the Cabinet in the next couple of weeks.  I hope that will be adequate to resolve this issue.  We cannot provide a fast track to pay restoration and additional allowances to one group of public servants without accepting that it will have a knock-on effect across the board.</p></speech>

We are joined by Richie Ryan's sons, Ultan, Cillian and Declan, his daughter, Aoife, his brother, Jim, and their partners; as well as by Richie's close friend, Carmel Feeney, and her daughter, Councillor Anne Feeney.  John Browne's family and friends include Nancy, Carmel, Flan, Mark, Kate, Deirdre, Lisa, Niall, our former colleague, Fergal, Maeve and Maria.  This is a poignant day for all of you.  It is tinged with bittersweet memories as you join us in the D&aacute;il Chamber, where both Richie and John spent many years at the service of their country and the people of their constituencies, which they served with honour and loyalty.  As we gather to reflect on their lives, their contributions in life and their political legacies, I hope the memories shared here in the Chamber will serve to support you all at this sad time.</p>  <p>  Although I did not know Richie Ryan personally, I knew of him as an erudite man who excelled in academia before enjoying a long career in local, national and European politics.  He was a man of learning and culture.  He lived a full political life, particularly in the difficult, challenging and often acrimonious days of the D&aacute;il in the 1970s.</p>  <p>  John Browne retired from this House in 2002, which was the year I was first elected to the D&aacute;il.  However, I served for two years in the Seanad prior to 2002.  During my short time serving in the Houses with John Browne, I knew him to be a man of the utmost integrity.  He represented his home county and his country assiduously and with fairness and honour.  I had the pleasure of serving in the Oireachtas with his son, Fergal, who I am pleased to see here with other members of the Browne family today.</p>  <p>  All of us are here to honour two deeply committed public representatives who served Fine Gael, their constituencies and their country with honour and dignity.  As Ceann Comhairle, I pay tribute to them both for their long and distinguished service to this Chamber.  I offer my sincere condolences to the family and friends of Richie and John at this difficult time.</p></speech>

Ba pholaiteoir prionsap&aacute;lta &eacute; Richie Ryan.  Threoraigh s&eacute; c&uacute;rsa&iacute; airgeadais na t&iacute;re seo tr&iacute; cheann de na tr&eacute;imhs&iacute; is measa in &Eacute;irinn.  Is cuimhin linn &eacute; mar dhuine neamheaglach a thug c&uacute;namh do ch&aacute;ch agus &eacute; ag f&oacute;namh d'&aacute;r dt&iacute;r le gradam.  Richie Ryan was very much a politician of principle.  He guided our country's finances through some of the darkest times.  Today we remember someone who was fearless in serving our country.  During the 1970s oil crisis and the years that followed, Richie proved himself to be a capable and steady pair of hands at a very turbulent economic time.  On television and radio, and even at the Christmas panto he attended with his grandchildren, Richie was satirised for his economic policies.  He took it in good humour and he never wavered in his mission to save our economy and protect jobs and livelihoods.  We should also remember that working alongside his colleagues in the Labour Party, he introduced legislation that ended the marriage bar in Ireland, extended the tax base and widened social welfare coverage considerably.</p>  <p>  Having served as one of our first MEPs, Richie went on to top the poll at the first direct elections to the European Parliament in 1979 and again in 1984.  His campaign slogan was simple - "Richie was Right" - and I believe time has vindicated the truth of that assertion.  He served as chairman of the International Monetary Fund, IMF, and the World Bank and with distinction as a member of the European Court of Auditors.  Following his retirement, he continued to serve the public in a number of voluntary roles.  We all remember his work over many decades as a Commissioner of Irish Lights, a job he loved.  Although I never had the privilege of serving alongside Richie, I met him on several occasions over the years.  I believe his legacy of distinguished and selfless service remains a benchmark for those of us in public service today.  His beloved wife, Mair&eacute;ad, predeceased him.  I offer my condolences to his children, Declan, Cillian, Ultan, Aoife and Bl&aacute;thnaid, his brothers, his grandchildren, his great-grandchildren and his extended family and friends.  Ar dheis l&aacute;mh D&eacute; go raibh a anam d&iacute;lis.</p>  <p>  Chaith John Browne a bheatha a tabhairt c&uacute;naimh go d&iacute;ograiseach go dt&iacute; daoine eile.  Seirbh&iacute;seach poibl&iacute; cr&oacute;ga agus l&aacute;n d'ionracas ab ea &eacute;.  Bh&iacute; gr&aacute; m&oacute;r aige don Ghaeilge, mar a chonaiceamar go minic san Oireachtas.  Chuir s&eacute; go m&oacute;r le cruth&uacute; beartas poibl&iacute; agus t&aacute; &aacute;r dt&iacute;r n&iacute;os fearr de bharr a &eacute;achta&iacute;.  John Browne was very much defined by his love of community.  As a teacher, he encouraged and inspired his students to achieve great things and their respect for him was long-lasting.  As a public servant, he made many contributions that shaped public policy and made our country a better place.  I saw his political qualities at first hand.  I have to say I admired his loyalty and hard work, his somewhat mischievous sense of humour and his insistence on always telling it as he saw it.</p>  <p>  As a Deputy for the Carlow-Kilkenny constituency for almost 14 years, and for a time the only Member of this House from County Carlow, John Browne made valuable contributions on issues close to his heart such as European affairs, education, social welfare, the Irish language, criminal law and international development.  As Fine Gael's spokesperson on justice and health in the early 1990s, he played a significant role in the development of our policies.  John was a great lover of the Irish language and, as we often saw in this Oireachtas, he did much to encourage its use.  Today we remember a man from Clare who became the heart of Carlow.  He was much loved by everyone who came into contact with him.  As we know, John's son Fergal has continued in his career of public service, serving in the Seanad and on Carlow County Council.  Both men share the honour of being elected chair of Carlow County Council, 17 years apart.</p><p>I wish to offer my condolences to John's loving wife, Nancy, and their four children, Carmel, Deirdre, Geraldine and Fergal, their grandchildren and all their families and friends.  John was somebody who dedicated his life to politics as a means of helping others and he will be much missed.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam d&iacute;lis.</p></speech>

N&iacute;l aon amhras ach go raibh cl&uacute; agus c&aacute;il ar Richie Ryan, go h&aacute;irithe i rith na 1970d&iacute; nuair a bh&iacute; s&eacute; ina Aire Airgeadais.  T&iacute;rghr&aacute;th&oacute;ir a bh&iacute; ann gan dabht agus duine a thuig t&aacute;bhacht an seirbh&iacute;s poibl&iacute; agus an dl&uacute;thbhaint idir todhcha&iacute; na t&iacute;re seo agus todhcha&iacute; na hEorpa a bh&iacute; ann.  T&aacute; c&aacute;s na t&iacute;re seo agus c&aacute;s na hEorpa mar an c&eacute;anna.  Sin an tuairim a bh&iacute; aige agus sin an feals&uacute;nacht a bh&iacute; aige.  Duine cumasach, l&aacute;idir a bh&iacute; ann ag an am.</p>  <p>  Richie Ryan had a long and illustrious life with a very distinguished record of public office.  He was first elected to the D&aacute;il in a by-election in 1959 and was elected at every election he ever contested, though he had a close call in Dublin South-East in 1981, when he had just one fifth of the quota after the first count but made it through, showing his appeal across the divide.  I always marvel at such escapades and the ability to make it through after a low total in the first count.  He was a very robust political personality, a trait that was, no doubt, nurtured at Synge Street and in UCD, where he graduated with a first-class degree in politics and legal science.  He was also an award-winning orator and auditor at the Literary and Historical Society in UCD.  He had his own solicitor's practice on Dame Street and was an active partner until he was appointed Minister for Finance in 1973.  It was an unexpected appointment at the time, given that he had been foreign affairs spokesperson in opposition, while Garret FitzGerald had held the finance brief.</p>  <p>  It is probably difficult for people who did not live through the 1970s to realise the extent of Richie Ryan's prominence during that decade.  I was a second level student at the time and I can recall the political heat he was under during the decade.  As Minister for Finance in the 1973-1977 Fine Gael-Labour coalition, he had the task of steering the economy through the difficulties of the oil shock of 1973 and its consequences.  It is difficult for people to comprehend how fundamental the shock was to our economic course at the time.  I remember being in Denmark some years ago, where the 1973 oil shock was a catalyst for fundamental change in energy policy which has lasted until the present.  It is quite interesting that we did not take the same long-term approach as Denmark did in respect of climate and energy issues but that was how deep, fundamental and profound the oil shock was at that time.  He was not fazed by those turbulent times, notwithstanding inflation soaring above 20% in the mid-1970s as a consequence of these events.</p>  <p>  Less prominent, but just as important to him, was his service in Europe.  He was fully committed to the European ideal and was one of the first Irish Members of the European Parliament, where he returned after ceasing to be Minister for Finance in 1977.  We owe a great debt to the politicians of the 1970s, including Richie Ryan, who understood the centrality of Europe to the future of Ireland.  They had no hesitation in recommending membership of the European Union, which was the European Economic Community at the time, for this country, and they have been vindicated.  He contested the first direct elections to the Parliament in 1979, topping the poll, and he did it again in 1984.  He became a member of the European Court of Auditors in 1986 and was, interestingly, reappointed to that position by Charles Haughey in 1988.  Clearly, the latter held him in high esteem.</p>  <p>  He showed huge courage in his personal life and met and overcame many challenges, showing great resilience in countering them.  He was predeceased by his wife Mairead so I offer my sympathies to his children Declan, Cillian, Ultan, Aoife and Bl&aacute;thnaid; his brothers Jim, Mark and M&iacute;che&aacute;l; and his grandchildren, great-grandchildren and wider family.</p>  <p>  Fear l&aacute;ch agus cean&uacute;il a bh&iacute; i John Browne chomh maith, fear a bh&iacute; d&iacute;lis d&aacute; mhuintir f&eacute;in agus do mhuintir a d&uacute;iche f&eacute;in.  N&iacute;l aon amhras ach gur oibrigh John go dian d&iacute;cheallach Domhnach is d&aacute;lach ar son muintir a d&uacute;iche.  Fear eile a thuig an t&aacute;bhacht a bhaineann le seirbh&iacute;s poibl&iacute; a bh&iacute; ann gan dabht agus fear a thuig an t&aacute;bhacht a bhaineann leis an gc&oacute;ras polait&iacute;ochta at&aacute; ann i saol na t&iacute;re, go h&aacute;irithe &oacute; thaobh an saor&aacute;nach de a bh&iacute; ann chomh maith.  Deirtear gur m&uacute;inteoir den scoth a bh&iacute; ann agus bh&iacute; s&eacute; soil&eacute;ir sa Teach seo go raibh meoin an m&uacute;inteoir le feice&aacute;il laistigh den Teach anois is ar&iacute;s.  Mar a d&uacute;irt an Taoiseach, bh&iacute; gr&aacute; faoi leith aige &oacute; thaobh c&uacute;rsa&iacute; Gaeilge de.  John Browne was first elected to the D&aacute;il in 1989, the same year as my good self, and we had a very good and enjoyable relationship.  He had previously contested general elections in 1981 and 1987 but, once elected, he retained his seat at the 1992 and 1997 general elections before retiring at the 2002 election.  He had turned 65 at that time and had recently undergone major heart surgery.  Remarkably, given his long career as a public representative in Carlow, he was a native of County Clare.  That speaks to the unique DNA of Clare people when it comes to politics, something we in Fianna F&aacute;il know only too well and which we hope will flourish not so much in future elections.</p>  <p>  He was a lovely family man and a very decent individual.  He had a great sense of community and was very involved in the Gaelic Athletic Association.  He told me of one weekend when he had been in west Cork and met my late father, who was on holiday there.  They had a great conversation, though he did not realise it was my father he was speaking to, and they discussed non-political matters from the GAA to other issues.  It showed that he had a basic sense that there was life outside politics.  He was well rounded and had great breadth in his philosophy towards life.  His political life stemmed from his active community involvement.  He liked to help other people and he believed in making a positive contribution.  He made serious contributions to debates in this House and he was a man of wit and culture, as one would expect from a former teacher.  When Charles Haughey was in the process of standing down in 1992, Deputy Browne rose to quote Hamlet, telling him: "Good night, sweet prince, And flights of angels see thee to thy rest!"  After retiring from politics, he stayed actively involved in the community, especially in the GAA, where he chaired the county juvenile committee, and he rejoined us earlier this year in the Mansion House to mark the 100th anniversary of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  He was well appreciated as the quality public servant he truly was.  I offer my sympathies to his wife Nancy, to whom he was married for 53 years, their four children Carmel, Deirdre, Geraldine and Fergal, the last of whom was a colleague of ours in the Seanad from 2002 to 2007, and his 11 grandchildren.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam d&iacute;lis.</p></speech>

On my behalf and that of Sinn F&eacute;in, I extend sincere sympathies and condolences to the families and loved ones of former Deputies Richie Ryan and John Browne, both of whom passed away in March this year.  I did not know Mr. Ryan but he had a lengthy career in public service, both domestically and internationally.  He had the great privilege of serving as a Teachta D&aacute;la for over 20 years, representing the constituency and people of south Dublin from 1959 to 1982, as well as serving in the distinguished role of Minister for Finance from 1973 to 1977.  He also served as a Member of the European Parliament.</p><p>He was part of our first team of representatives in 1973 and was directly elected on a number of occasions thereafter right up until he left in 1986 to become a member of the European Court of Auditors.  He served in a number of public service roles following his retirement from front-line politics.  His contribution is to be marked and welcomed.  I am sure that his family and his party are rightly proud of his lengthy career in public service.  I extend my sympathies to his children, Declan, Cillian, Ultan, Aoife and Bl&aacute;thnaid, and to all his friends and family as well as his colleagues in Fine Gael.</p> <p> Similarly, I did not know Mr. Browne.  He served before my time in this House.  He too had a lengthy career here in Leinster House, including in the Seanad, and in local politics.  He spent three terms in the D&aacute;il representing the people of Carlow-Kilkenny and served as a member of Carlow County Council.  N&iacute;l dabht ar bith go raibh seirbh&iacute;s f&aacute;d-t&eacute;arma aige &oacute; thaobh polait&iacute;ochta de go h&aacute;iti&uacute;il, sa Seanad agus sa D&aacute;il.  Bh&iacute; s&eacute; &aacute;balta na tr&aacute;nna sin uile a fhreastal don phobal ag an am c&eacute;anna agus &eacute; mar dhuine as Contae an Chl&aacute;ir.  That he managed to do all of that - to serve on Carlow County Council repeatedly, to be elected to the D&aacute;il, to serve in the Seanad, and to represent the people of Carlow and the constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny - despite being a Clare man is a mighty feat.  I am sure that his family and his party colleagues are very proud of his long career in public service, a tradition carried on to this day by his son, Fergal, who is a councillor in County Carlow.  Bh&iacute; gairm fhada aige in oifig phoibl&iacute; agus t&aacute;im cinnte go bhfuil a mhuintir agus a ph&aacute;irt&iacute; br&oacute;d&uacute;il as gach aon rud a rinne s&eacute; ina sheal sa Seanad, ar an gcomhairle, agus anseo sa D&aacute;il.  I extend my deepest sympathies to his wife, Nancy, his daughters, Carmel, Deirdre and Geraldine, his son, Fergal, all his grandchildren, his friends, his extended family, and his colleagues in Fine Gael.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam d&iacute;lis.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-06-12a.218" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1353" speakername="Brendan Howlin" time="13:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019061200018#Q00200"><p>On behalf of the Labour Party, I join all my colleagues in the House in expressing our appreciation for the honourable service of two very distinguished former Members and in offering our deepest condolences to the families, friends, and political party of both Richie Ryan and John Browne.</p><p>Richie Ryan was well known across Ireland for decades.  My own political mentor, Brendan Corish, was T&aacute;naiste in that famous Government that ran from 1973 to 1977 in which Richie Ryan was a distinguished Minister for Finance in the most difficult of times.  I myself know something about trying to manage finances in difficult times.  I know the sort of pressures that were on him.  I recall conversations I had with Brendan Corish subsequently.  He held Richie Ryan in enormously high regard and considered him to have courageously done right by the country regardless of the pressures on him.  That is the sort of service that ultimately stands to a person.  His family can be extraordinarily proud of him.</p><p>I am wryly amused at some of the titles Richie Ryan accrued in his life in politics, one of which was &quot;Red Richie&quot;.  From a Labour Party perspective he may not have earned that title but his Government did introduce a wealth tax.  I believe it was &quot;Hall's Pictorial Weekly&quot; that determined he merited that title.  I imagine he was quite amused by it himself.</p><p>Others have said that he was a pathfinder for Ireland in Europe.  As a new member of what was then the European Community, Ireland needed people of his experience, calibre and vision to reach out within the European institutions, especially the European Parliament which was embryonic at that stage.  He then served as a distinguished member of the European Court of Auditors because of his incredible experience.</p><p>One thing which has not been mentioned is his legal work.  He took on, <i>pro bono</i>, some important legal cases that changed the course of history here.  Some of his legal challenges helped to broaden the rights base of all our citizens, which gave rise to what are now known as unenumerated rights under the Constitution.  In many ways these invited the courts to advance the rights base of all our citizens.  He had many dimensions as a public servant.  If any of us could look back on a career with that level of public service, we would do so with a great sense of pride.  I send my deepest condolences and those of the Labour Party to Richie Ryan's family, friends, and party.</p><p>I knew John Browne.  He and I came into the House by the same means at the same time.  We were both Taoiseach's nominees to the Seanad way back in 1983.  Getting a Taoiseach's nomination is a very easy route by which to get into politics.  One just needs the vote of one individual.</p></speech>

I had just contested my first election of any description in Wexford - I stood for the D&aacute;il - when I was appointed to that Seanad.  I got to know John Browne in that context.  I did not realise until his passing that he was a Clare man.  I always assumed he was a native son of Carlow.  He never gave me any indication that he was not.  He was not only a fluent Irish speaker but extraordinarily proud of an teanga Ghaelach.  He used the Irish language to great effect and with great fluency whenever he could.  He was also the health spokesman for Fine Gael in the difficult period of the 1990s.  When we went into government, I became Minister for Health.  I remember his views on matters at that time.  I know of his involvement in the GAA.  He brought a sense of calm and determination to, and adjudicated honourably on, most of the issues with which he dealt.  To his wife, Nancy, his son, Fergal, who continues the tradition in politics, and his daughters, Carmel, Deirdre, and Geraldine, I send my deepest condolences and those of my party.  All friends of both of the individuals we honour today can reflect with great honour and pride on their service to our country and to our parliamentary traditions.</p></speech>

He was a native of my own parish of Kilmihil in County Clare.  In fact, when I look out my breakfast room window in the morning, I see his home across the valley.  I knew John very well and I particularly know his daughter, Carmel, who is the principal of the primary school in Kilmihil.  I had the pleasure of meeting Carmel here in the company of her father two years ago when Kilmihil national school came to visit the D&aacute;il.  John Browne had a passion for education which he passed on to his family, including both Carmel and his son, Fergal, who is the principal of St. Joseph's national school in Carlow.  I express my sympathy to Carmel, to all family members and, in particular, to Nancy Browne, who has been a frequent visitor to Kilmihil.  It was my pleasure to look after the Browne family for many years in my former role as a GP.  John died at the age of 82 and he still maintained the affection of the House.  He came to the celebrations of the centenary of the D&aacute;il last January and, as I have said, he was here two years ago in the company of the primary school in Kilmihil.  In fact, he had the pleasure of meeting his grandchildren-in-law - I believe that is the proper way to describe them - who came as part of that delegation.</p><p>His first step into politics was when he was elected to Carlow County Council in 1979.  He was nominated to the Senate by Garrett FitzGerald in 1983.  He became party spokesperson on communications following his election to the D&aacute;il in 1989 and remained here for 13 years until 2002.</p> <p> He had a wide range of interests, including European affairs, education, health, rural affairs, social welfare, the Irish language, of course, criminal law and overseas aid.  He was also a fluent Irish speaker and made many contributions to the D&aacute;il in Irish and English.  I offer my sympathies to the family.</p></speech>

Mr. Ryan, who lived in Terenure, was predeceased by his wife, Mair&eacute;ad, and his three brothers and one sister.  He is survived by five children, whom I welcome here today, three brothers, grandchildren and great-grandchildren.  He was also predeceased by his great granddaughter, Angela.</p>  <p>  A solicitor by training, in 1973 the Taoiseach appointed him to the portfolio of Finance.  He introduced a wealth tax as well as increases in VAT.  Deputy Howlin took to D&aacute;il privilege in reminding us of "Hall's Pictorial Weekly" and Red Richie.  I also remember Richie Ruin; I say that in total jest.  I have fond memories of him in "Hall's Pictorial Weekly" at the time.  Those were difficult challenging times and he was an exemplary Minister.</p>  <p>  Mr. Ryan later became an MEP as well as Ireland's representative on the European Court of Auditors in Luxembourg.  He had longevity and got re-elected many times to this House and then as an MEP.  He had a distinguished career and gave sterling service to his community, his country and Europe.

I offer sincere sympathy to both families on the deaths of loved ones.  This is a sad day for them to be here, but they can take a lot of solace from it in that we are paying tribute to two men from Carlow-Kilkenny and Dublin who distinguished themselves for many years in this House.</p>  <p>  I am from the Carlow-Kilkenny constituency of the late John Browne.  I knew him for many years.  I did not serve with him here; he left in 2002 and I came in in 2007.  However, I knew him through Carlow County Council as I had been on Kilkenny County Council for many years.  His son, Fergal, is continuing that tradition in carrying the baton for the people of Carlow-Kilkenny and I welcome him here today.  I offer my sincere sympathy to his wife, Nancy, and their four children.</p>  <p>  He was a very likeable man and well loved by the people of Kilkenny and Carlow - in particular Carlow.  He served his constituency with pride for many years.  May both of them rest in peace.</p></speech>

I welcome, in particular, his family to the Distinguished Visitors Gallery.</p>  <p>  John was my immediate predecessor as a Fine Gael Member representing the Carlow-Kilkenny constituency and specifically County Carlow.  He was first elected to the D&aacute;il in 1989, almost 30 years ago on 15 June.  As has been mentioned, he was a spokesperson on health and justice during that time.  Prior to that he served a term in the Senate when appointed by the then Taoiseach, Garrett FitzGerald.  He first entered politics when he was elected to Carlow County Council 40 years ago in 1979.</p>  <p>  John arrived in Carlow in the 1950s from County Clare as a very enthusiastic teacher, who wanted to use his educational skills to ensure that every child had the opportunity to prosper in life.  He spent 27 years as principal of Bennekerry national school.  It was in this area that his roots in community activism started to come through.  His involvement with the GAA and his love of the Irish language were an important part of this, and he made many contributions as Gaeilge in this Chamber.</p>  <p>  At local level, John was considered a Palatine GAA man, but it was with his rival club, O'Hanrahan's, that he won a senior football championship medal in 1961.  Once his playing career was over, he cemented himself in the Bennekerry area, in particular the GAA club's many community activities.  In 2009, he wrote a history of the Palatine GAA club to honour its centenary.  When John retired from politics in 2002, he re-immersed himself in GAA activities.  At that time, I was the chairman of the county board in Carlow.  He agreed to become the juvenile board chairman for a period of time.</p>  <p>  John was an educator and a politician but a community activist by nature.  He worked tirelessly all his life for the advancement of others.  He was ever generous with his time, support and commitment to the community, country and county.  He will be greatly missed by all. </p>  <p>  To his wife Nancy, daughters Carmel, Deirdre and Geraldine and son Fergal, and his extended family, I express my sincere sympathies.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam d&iacute;lis.</p></speech>

I welcome them to the House today.  As Deputy Aylward said, it is a sad day, but is also a fitting tribute to two men who in different ways represented their communities with distinctions as Members of the Oireachtas and members of other bodies further afield.</p><p>I particularly welcome Nancy Browne and her children, Carmel, Deirdre, Geraldine and Fergal.  I congratulate Fergal on his re-election to Carlow County Council a couple of weeks ago, where he is continuing a tradition started by his father 40 years ago in 1979.</p><p>I got to know John Browne when I became actively involved in politics in 1994.  I was a transition-year student and John was one of the Deputies for Carlow-Kilkenny.  I got to know a man who, as others have said, was very witty and very capable.  He had a bit of steel in the glove, which is a requirement for anybody who wants to be elected.</p><p>I voted for the first time in the 1997 general election on Friday, 6 June, which was the third day of my leaving certificate exams.  I went to the polling station with my late father.  There was an unusual arrangement in Carlow-Kilkenny between the two outgoing Fine Gael Deputies in that a significant chunk of Fine Gael voters in Kilkenny were asked to support John Browne from Carlow.  He got one of his biggest votes in that election and was re-elected.  I was delighted that the first vote I ever cast was for him.</p><p>John was someone who commanded genuine affection.  We often hear horror stories about social media and the comments people make there in other senses.  However, the comments made particularly by his former students on social media about a person whom I knew to be a likeable man showed he was obviously a much-respected teacher.  He arrived in Carlow at the end of the 1950s and had made such an impact that by the end of the 1970s, he as a member of the county council.</p><p>He gave much of his life, interestingly his life after retiring from politics in 2002, to go back head, neck and heels into the GAA again, including chairing the juvenile board in Carlow.  Not many people who have stepped back from public life would do that, but it was the mark of the man.</p><p>He was also well known for his poetry appearing in the pages of the <i>Sunday Independent</i>at one stage.  Many of his witty contributions were published.</p><p>In his time here Oireachtas Members shared offices, with up to five or six people in an office.  John Browne was a kind of father figure for many younger men who might have been new to Dublin and away from home.  His advice was sought on many occasions.  Even in the graveyard at his burial, some of his former colleagues recounted some stories, which are probably for another place.</p><p>I got to know Richie Ryan at the end of his life.  There is an old phrase that one should never meet one's heroes.  The flipside is also true.  If one meets one's heroes and they turn out to be decent, lovely people, it is great.  Richie Ryan was that in every sense of the word.</p><p>I extend sincere sympathy to both the Browne and Ryan families.  They should be very proud of the contributions John Browne and Richie Ryan made to public life in Ireland.</p></speech>

It is time for full transparency and a comprehensive response.  The question relates to the commitment made by the Minister for Health nearly two years ago to introduce a compassionate access programme in respect of medical cannabis.  The Taoiseach will be aware that the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, recommended quite a long time ago the introduction of a compassionate access programme in respect of drug-resistant epilepsy, people who get sick from chemotherapy, and spasticity among multiple sclerosis sufferers.  Approximately 14 import licences have been given to various individuals.  Many have been waiting and waiting for the introduction of the access programme but we are no wiser now, so long on.  I ask the Taoiseach to outline the Government's position on the introduction of the compassionate access programme.  If he does not have the details now, will he provide me with a comprehensive response as soon as possible?</p></speech>

I commend Dr. Scally on the work he is doing under very difficult circumstances.  A number of sections jump out in the report, not least the chapter relating to the procurement of laboratory services.  The report raises a number of serious questions, including why the HSE reduced the weighting for quality assurance and capacity and increased the weighting for costs in the tendering process.  That is an important issue.  The rationale for reducing the emphasis on quality and capacity in favour of increasing emphasis on cost needs to be explained in full.  The report also raises other issues in regard to laboratories subcontracting other laboratories without the knowledge of the HSE, and questions are asked in respect of retrospective accreditation.  Does the Taoiseach support a call for time to be made available in the D&aacute;il for statements on this issue so we can get answers to these serious questions?</p>  <p>  The Scally report is critical of the lack of payment for the work put in by the relatives of those directly affected by this scandal and who are now involved in transforming the system.  From a Government perspective, will consideration be given to this payment in the time ahead?</p></speech>

As he will know, the Ringsend wastewater treatment plant treats approximately 40% of public wastewater.  It has been operating over capacity for some time and it is not now compliant with national and EU environmental regulations.  The most recent EPA report states we are not addressing the deficiencies in wastewater treatment infrastructure at a fast enough pace and that our health is at risk.</p>  <p>  Half of our waste discharges do not meet pollution and health standards.  Untreated sewage is being pumped into our seas and wastewater in 38 towns and villages across the country.  What is the Government going to do to address these genuine inadequacies in wastewater treatment?  When can we have a solution for the wastewater treatment plant in Ringsend and the problems in the 38 towns?</p></speech>

It is impossible to do everything in one year, as I am sure the Deputy will appreciate, but it is part of Project Ireland 2040.  It is a massive investment programme.  It has helped to reduce the number of boil water notices and the number of leaks around the country.  It will improve circumstances with regard to wastewater.</p></speech>

It is two and a half years since the report came out.  It was commissioned by the HPRA.  Its main recommendation was that the cannabis access programme be set up.  Since then, there has been no access programme.  In the past two and half years, 16 licences have been granted to 16 individuals in the State.  Of those 16 licences, three have involved financial reimbursement.  There are, therefore, 13 other families who have not been reimbursed.  A family contacted me over the past few weeks.  Mary and Joe Stevens, who live in Waterford, were granted a licence last December for their daughter, Cassandra, and they were given notification yesterday by the HSE that they would not be reimbursed.  The cost is &euro;9,000 per year.  The family still has to go to another jurisdiction, namely, Holland, to get the medication.  As of August, however, the family will not be able to afford the medication for their daughter.  According to their words and the clinical notes, we have learned that the product has made a dramatic difference to the daughter's life.</p>  <p>  This is so important.  I have been banging this drum for the past three years.  I am so frustrated.  My frustration does not compare with the frustration of the families.  Is there a commencement date for the cannabis access programme?</p></speech>

I have raised this with him since.  I spoke to him in his office only two weeks ago.  The task force was appointed in name only.  Ms Alison Harvey, whom I wish well, was appointed and had initial meetings but not one red cent has been approved by the Government to support the task force and enable her to collaborate and engage with all the groups involved - Jobs for Tipp, The March for Tipp, TIRD and many other community groups.  We have a new chief executive in the district in Tipperary town.  We look forward to engaging with the council, all the groups and the newly elected councillors but one cannot proceed without money.  The Taoiseach told me he would revert to me.  I received a reply to a parliamentary question late last night from the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, who stated there are applications in.  Reference was made to other issues that apply here, there and everywhere, as the</p>  <p>Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Humphreys, told me recently, but there is no dedicated fund so Ms Harvey and her team may do the proper investigative and collaborative work to which the people of Tipperary town and the rest of the area are entitled.

I discussed the matter with somebody earlier who suggested that the next step would be to appoint a dedicated liaison person because some families are getting supports while others are not; it has not been co-ordinated properly.  On foot of the Deputy's query, I will follow the matter up further today and see if we can move things along more quickly because I know the response to date has been somewhat piecemeal.</p></speech>

It will extend the right to vote in presidential elections to citizens living outside the State, including citizens in the North.  That is an overdue but welcome and good development.  At a time the British Home Office is disputing the rights of Irish citizens in the North to be recognised as citizens, this is crucially important legislation.  </p>  <p>  It is the norm in other states that citizens living outside the state vote in elections.

I welcome the recent decision of the Minister for Education and Skills to allow students who suffer a bereavement in the course of their leaving certificate examinations to resit those exams in July.  I ask the Taoiseach to discuss with the Minister if that privilege could be extended to also apply to students sitting the junior certificate, which is also a State examination.  I accept that it is not of the same importance as the leaving certificate but it is nonetheless an important exam for the students sitting it.  Any student who suffers a bereavement would be in no position to perform to the best of his or her ability.  The results of those exams sometimes inform the direction in which he or she goes for their fifth and sixth years.  It is a reasonable proposal that it be extended.</p></speech>

Although the junior certificate is not quite as life forming or life-changing as the leaving certificate, the same principles apply, and we should make allowances for students who are bereaved to allow them to do their exams at a later date.  I am glad that change has now happened for the leaving certificate.  The Minister for Education and Skills is away at the moment but, when he comes back, I will certainly let him know that the suggestion was made and will ask him to liaise directly with the Deputy.</p></speech>

I have a constituent who has unfortunately tried to commit suicide on a number of occasions, most recently last Sunday.  Her psychiatrist has diagnosed that the best form of treatment for her would be a course of dialectical behavioural therapy.  Her consultant has recommended that therapy.  I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, on his efforts in trying to get her access to such therapy but because this young lady has a Tipperary address, she is denied access.  This therapy would be available to her if she had a Limerick or Cork address but she is being discriminated against because she is from Tipperary.  It is bad enough that we have no psychiatric beds in our county but it is not good enough when a person is denied an essential service because of his or her address.  This young lady has a life-threatening condition and I sincerely ask the Taoiseach to renew efforts to get people from my county access to this therapy.  I do not lay blame at the door of the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, as he has tried to get this young girl access to this therapy for the past couple of months.</p></speech>

I do not know the details, obviously, but it does not seem right, on the face of it, that somebody should be without access to a necessary treatment based on the fact that they live in Tipperary rather than Cork or Limerick.  The Deputy mentioned that he has raised the matter with the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, and I will also talk to him about it to see if something can be done.</p></speech>

Those claims are not being processed so not only are they providing this excellent service, they are running their cars at their own expense.  As the Taoiseach knows, the geography of Kerry means they have to travel long distances in their cars to give care to elderly people or people who are ill in their homes.  They are doing so entirely at their own expense.  I ask him to ensure that this situation will be put right for home helps in Kerry and whatever has gone wrong in the processing of their claims for petrol and travel expenses will be corrected immediately to allow them to carry on the excellent service they give to elderly and sick people in our communities.</p></speech>

This person was approved for services on 20 May 2019 and is currently on the HSE waiting list.  A response from a HSE official to the inquiry I submitted stated that cases are being approved as hours become available on the basis of clinical need and that there is hopefully not too much longer to wait.</p><p>There is a lengthy waiting list in north Cork for home help hours.

The HSE welcomed the increase, stating that it will greatly assist dealing with year-to-year rising demands on the healthcare system.  However, we are not looking after our most vulnerable people in society: the elderly and the disabled.  The HSE has suspended home help in spite of more than 6,000 people waiting to access such support.  The elderly and the disabled want to stay at home, close to their friends and family.  This is bad management by the Government and the HSE.  It is taxpayers' money.  It makes sense to let citizens stay at home and be cared for.  Home care works.  Who is accountable?

I acknowledge that that has happened to some degree.  I wish to briefly outline a case in County Roscommon.  Two years ago, Youth Work Ireland was awarded a tender to provide targeted youth services in County Roscommon.  It did a very good job, setting up groups in Castlerea, Ballaghaderreen, Roscommon and other parts of the county, as well as in east Galway.  Up to 800 people avail of these services.  It was very inclusive, taking in refugees based in Ballaghaderreen, people who were attending CAMHS programmes and other children from various backgrounds.  It really had a very positive effect.  In March 2019 it was announced that the tender for County Roscommon was up for reapplication, with a deadline of 5 April.  To cut a long story short, Youth Service Ireland did not get the project.  We have now been told that the service is gone for the summer and will be back under a new provider in September.  The young people are very disappointed that they will have no service for the summer.  They will very much miss it.  Yesterday, they protested at a meeting of the Galway and Roscommon Education and Training Board in Athenry.  The service was of great benefit to them psychologically.  I am a reasonable person.  I ask that the Taoiseach and his officials speak to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, to see whether the service can be reinstated for the summer.</p></speech>

Project Ireland 2040 committed to the building of a motorway between Limerick and Foynes.  I have been informed by the mid-west road design office of Limerick City and County Council that the planning application for this project will go to An Bord Plean&aacute;la at the end of June.  The scheme encompasses the Adare bypass, which is critically required for the people of County Limerick and the south-west region, including areas such as County Kerry.

This is a desperately tragic case.  The family was falsely told that the child had a fatal foetal abnormality.  The couple claim that their child would be with them today, were it not for the actions of the hospital.  They state that it was an illegal abortion and that the medical practitioners who signed off on the abortion never examined or met the mother in advance of the abortion.  If that is the case, it is contrary to the law brought in by the Government and it is illegal.  The family state that their calls for an independent investigation have been ignored by the Government and that they have had no real input into the terms of reference of the internal review which the Government is planning.  They are shocked by allegations that the medical professionals signing off on the abortions have a commercial interest in the companies that produced the fatally insufficient test.  This week, the bereaved family were shocked to hear that the State Claims Agency will indemnify the private company that carried out the fatally insufficient tests.  They are furious with the Taoiseach for stating in the D&aacute;il that this is a confidential issue.  They believe he is seeking to sweep this illegal abortion under the carpet.

As all Members know, many aspects of the Act have not been implemented.  It was introduced to ensure that every child assessed with a special educational need would have a personal education plan.  To be fair, at the time the National Council for Special Education published guidelines and a phased implementation plan.  However, the relevant sections have not been enacted.  When will it be implemented?  As I discussed with the Taoiseach, if there is a need for a review - which I believe there is and the Taoiseach also intimated there is - when is it likely to take place?  There are so many children, parents, families and teachers who need a personal education plan for the young children in their care.</p></speech>

As Deputy O'Loughlin and I discussed, the EPSEN Act has been commenced in part but not in full.  Many of the areas that have not been commenced are now a little out of date, given that the legislation is more than 15 years old.  As I understand it, it is the intention of the Minister to review that.  I will ask him to correspond with the Deputy and give her a more up-to-date response.</p></speech>

Farmers do not want the factory hierarchies to get the funding when it becomes available to the farmers.</p></speech>

The Deputy may also be aware that some of the farmer organisations have arranged their own consultation, but they will be consulted with in the near future, as soon as the regulation that has been forwarded down to the Commission has been addressed by the Department.  The regulation includes some conditions which must be considered before any further steps are taken.</p></speech>

HIQA requires that an ambulance respond to a life-threatening incident within seven minutes and 59 seconds.  In the area of south Mayo it is physically impossible for an ambulance to get from Castlebar, the nearest base, to Ballinrobe and surrounding areas.  There has been an ongoing campaign for a permanent, fully staffed ambulance base in Ballinrobe to service the south Mayo area.  Will the Taoiseach give a commitment that he will endeavour to get this organised and delivered without delay?</p></speech>

First, we had a debate yesterday about Northern Ireland, one of the very rare debates we have in this House on Northern Ireland.  It is unfortunate the Taoiseach could not attend.  I am sure there was a very good reason he could not.  A Minister of State attended.  We need to be clear on the Taoiseach's assessment now.  I would be interested in his personal assessment, having talked to the T&aacute;naiste, of the prospects for restoring the devolved institutions in Northern Ireland.  Is there anything we as a House can do to assist the process?  It is critical to have progress on this matter.  One of the comments I made in my contribution yesterday - I have made it repeatedly since I first made it well over 12 months ago at the James Connolly memorial lecture I gave - was to call now for us to prepare a new all-Ireland forum.  I would be interested to know whether the Taoiseach has had a chance to reflect upon this idea.  I think there is now a consensus in the House that we need to think about the future relationship between the North and the South and the future of this island.  Is it time we embarked upon this?</p>  <p>  My second question concerns the ongoing trauma we see in Britain, with contenders for the position of leader of the Conservative Party and future Prime Minister now making ever wilder promises about either conducting new negotiations for a new deal with the European Union or, more likely, a hard exit from the European Union on 31 October.  I will ask the Taoiseach a direct question.  Since the latter tragic likelihood is becoming more of a potential reality, is he satisfied that Ireland, particularly Irish businesses, will be prepared for a hard UK exit from the EU on 31 October?</p></speech>

He fell in April, but a military junta is viciously repressing a popular movement of ordinary people demanding democracy.  Just in the past week we have seen a massacre in which up to 100 people were killed, bringing the overall death toll to many hundreds more.  It is worth saying that while the official line of countries such as the US is to support a transition to civilian rule, key allies of the United States, such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, are all essentially backing the regime in its vicious persecution of this popular movement for democracy.</p><p>What is the European Union doing about this?  I point in particular to the Khartoum Process and the need for us to call for the Union to suspend that.  Essentially, the Khartoum regime behind this vicious repression and persecution is being given money by the EU to control migration out of that country, leading in particular to incredible suffering and persecution for Eritreans and Ethiopians.  They are treated in an unbelievably vicious way by this regime.  Will the Taoiseach indicate what he is doing in talking to our EU colleagues and if he would support action by sanction, such as suspending the Khartoum Process?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-06-12a.305" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019061200024#W00200"><p>Our party has long advocated that those who espouse the view that Ireland should be united need to come together and start to plan that process.  We have done that in many different guises over the years.  More than a decade ago we tabled a motion in the House relating to the preparation of a Green Paper on Irish unity.  Our former leader, Deputy Gerry Adams, and I have engaged with all the different parties in the past two years on the need for a sub-committee of the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement to deal with Irish unity.  That has been blocked at this point.  Whatever the vehicle, whether it is a Green Paper, a sub-committee or a new Ireland forum, as suggested by Deputy Howlin, it is a secondary point.  We need to start to come together to plan what a new and united Ireland would look like, including how all the traditions can be respected, accommodated and cherished in that new Ireland and what we need to do to convince others of the merits of that.  I would welcome the views of the Taoiseach on the matter at this point.</p>  <p>  I also raise the role of the Government with respect to the standoff over Rockall.  We know Scotland is subject to the Common Fisheries Policy and that the policy allows Irish fishing vessels to fish around Rockall.  We know quota are allocated through the EU to Irish fishermen in that region annually.  It is baffling how the Scottish authorities have taken us to this position, as there are now serious threats and risks that our vessels, which are currently fishing in those waters, will be boarded by Scottish authorities, with boats and gear impounded and individuals arrested.  Calls have been made for a council to be appointed and located in Scotland.  There is also a need to escalate this diplomatically.  Has the Taoiseach raised this with the Scottish First Minister and was he aware of the matter at the time of their meeting last month?  Has the Taoiseach spoken to her since, and if he has not, does he intend to speak to her?  The fishermen deserve no less than that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-06-12a.306" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1224" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019061200024#W00300"><p>When the Taoiseach took office two years ago, he told the House he would conduct a thorough review of the staffing and structure of the Department of the Taoiseach.  Based on the information provided, it seems there have been no significant changes to the structure and staffing.  Will he indicate if that is correct?  The number of major issues having to be dealt with by this division is exceptionally high, although far from unprecedented if we consider points over the years when it dealt with matters relating to the peace process, UN Security Council membership and EU negotiations.</p>  <p>  With regard to Northern Ireland, I previously raised the need to return to a more active policy of engagement with groups other than the major parties and the British Government.  The most effective activity was never about media events or gestures but ongoing contact about everyday matters.  There are still meetings but the level of ongoing engagement with civic society in Northern Ireland is well below what we have seen in the past.  Has the Taoiseach reviewed the area and does he have proposals for increasing this activity?  The most important action is to work the Good Friday Agreement as for the past number of years, the three strands have not been worked.  The Executive and the Assembly should never have been collapsed over the heating scheme and the first recourse can never be the sidelining of important institutions such as those.</p>  <p>  With regard to Brexit, the best outcome now would be if something happened in London to cause the withdrawal agreement to be passed.  What that may be is as unclear today as it was last March.  If it does happen, we will face into immediate negotiations concerning future arrangements on this island.  According to the withdrawal agreement, we will be required to make good faith proposals to London or London would otherwise have the right to opt out of its obligations.  Given that we were clearly not ready for Brexit on 31 March, I ask, similar to Deputy Howlin, what steps are being taken for us to be ready to meet the requirements of either a deal or no deal Brexit on 31 October.  We clearly were not ready on 31 March.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-06-12a.307" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019061200024#W00400"><p>I thank the Deputies for their questions.  As the House will be aware, talks concerning Northern Ireland are under way in Belfast.  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade is leading the Government's presence in those talks and we are in regular contact.  It is fair to say he is more optimistic than before about the prospects of an agreement and he sees it is very positive that these are multi-party talks involving all the major parties and not just the Democratic Unionist Party and Sinn F&eacute;in.  He believes it is a helpful dynamic and I agree with the assessment.</p>  <p>  We are all very aware that we are operating in a difficult environment with ongoing uncertainty about Brexit and with a new British Prime Minister to be elected in only a few weeks.  That is a difficult environment in which to try to secure agreement, and there seems to be major gaps between the main parties, particularly on issues such as the Irish language, sustainability of a new Executive, marriage equality and other matters with which Members will be very familiar.</p>  <p>  The suggestion of a new Ireland forum is good but timing is very important.  We are again in a particular environment with grave uncertainty around Brexit and we do not know who will be the new British Prime Minister or what the next British Government will look like.  We do not know if the talks in Northern Ireland will be successful.  It would be best to have the Good Friday Agreement institutions functioning before we move ahead with something like a new Ireland forum.  If we went ahead with some sort of forum on future relationships, we would have to assess the willingness of unionists to participate, as well as people who consider themselves neither unionist nor nationalist.  A new Ireland forum that does not include the 1 million people who are unionists in Northern Ireland and who are British or one that does not include the many people in Northern Ireland who consider themselves both British and Irish but neither nationalist nor unionist would be much diminished.</p></speech>

Perhaps we agree on the matter.  I will take a look when I get the chance.</p>  <p>  Deputy Martin asked about the preparedness of business and the Government for Brexit.  The Government is, and will be, prepared.  Most businesses will be prepared as well but, inevitably, some businesses will not be prepared.  I repeat my call from the past to encourage businesses to engage in preparedness for Brexit.  Many businesses are prepared but some are taking the view that it will be all right on the night, there will be another extension or there will be a deal.  They should not operate on that basis but instead prepare for a no-deal scenario.  There is still time to do so and I encourage all businesses and organisations that have dealings with the United Kingdom to do that exactly.  We must be realistic and we can only be so prepared for Brexit, particularly if it is going to be a no-deal and hard Brexit.  In that scenario, it will be a case of damage limitation and we can only be so prepared for a scenario that could be very grave for our country.</p>  <p>  I have followed developments in the Sudan in the news but the issue has not featured in any discussions at European Council level.  It is likely it was discussed at Foreign Affairs Council level so I will ask for a note for Deputy Boyd Barrett on what is happening at European level in that regard.</p>  <p>  I spoke about Rockall earlier in the Chamber and yesterday as well.  I do not want to repeat what I said earlier.  I was not aware of this matter at the time of my most recent meeting with Scottish First Minister Sturgeon.  I understand that at official level it was decided not to escalate the matter to our level.  In retrospect that was probably an incorrect call but it is not particularly relevant now.</p><p>Most of the discussions had been conducted at official level but there had been discussions also between the T&aacute;naiste and his counterpart.  Since the Scottish announcement last week there had been very close contacts at Government to Government level.  It was discussed at the Cabinet meeting here on Tuesday and also by the Scottish Government at its meeting on Tuesday.  We agreed some common lines to take, that is, as the First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said yesterday, to resolve this issue amicably by discussion and not to escalate it.  We have made a decision that it should not be escalated, rather that it should be de-escalated and that we should try to resolve this amicably by discussions at official level at this stage.</p> <p> In terms of staffing, I do not have the exact numbers in front of me but there have been staffing changes within the Department.  For example, the Brexit unit has been established and expanded.  There is a group on justice in particular within the Department that is monitoring the implementation of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.  We had a Cabinet sub-committee on that only yesterday and officials in my Department are co-ordinating and examining the implementation of those justice reforms, which are happening at a satisfactory pace.</p> <p> There is also the establishment of the national security advisory council, and the new national security co-ordinator has now been appointed and took up office only a few days ago.</p></speech>

The division assists the work of Cabinet committees B, E and G and the associated senior officials' groups.  Cabinet committee B covers social policy and public services, including education, children, equality and social inclusion, the Irish language, arts and culture, and continued improvements and reform of public services.  Cabinet committee E deals with issues relating to health, including the delivery of health service reforms, and Cabinet committee G provides political oversight of developments relating to justice and equality issues, including implementation of the Government&rsquo;s programme of reform in the areas of justice and policing.</p>  <p>  A policing reform implementation programme office has been established within the division as I mentioned earlier.  This office will drive the implementation of the policing reform plan entitled A Policing Service for the Future, which was approved and published by Government in December last year.</p>  <p>  The division also assists the work of the Civil Service Management Board, which oversees implementation of the Civil Service renewal plan.  It has departmental oversight of the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, advances the Dublin north-east inner city initiative, including through the programme office, programme implementation board, and the oversight group, and it assists the delivery of Our Public Service 2020 through the membership of the public service leadership board and public service management group.</p>  <p>  In addition, the division incorporates the programme for Government office, which monitors and reports on the implementation of the commitments contained in the programme for Government across all Departments.  The third annual progress report was approved by Government in May 2019.  The division also provides me with briefing and speech material on social policy and public service reform issues and participates in the relevant interdepartmental committees and other groups.</p></reply>

I want to ask two specific questions.  First, regarding the Freedom of Information, FOI, Act, as the Taoiseach knows, the restoration of the full impact of the Freedom of Information Act was a core part of the programme of reforms we implemented in the previous Government.  It is a very important part of the suite of reform measures.  There have been recent court decisions that in many people's views have eroded the impact of freedom of information.  The Taoiseach may not have had an opportunity yet to look at this, but is there a review ongoing of the current FOI Act with a view to ensuring that the full strength of it that we wanted when we restored it fully will be maintained, even if that means further amending it now?</p>  <p>  As the Taoiseach knows, I have taken an interest in the issue of policing reform over a very long time.  I met members of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland and I had a disagreement with the recommendation of the majority of the commission on one issue, that is, to re-establish a management group within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na again around the Commissioner.  I have raised this with the Taoiseach.  I know he does not have a closed mind in regard to it but I believe this is a fundamental issue.  We are in grave danger of making the same mistakes as were made in the past if we do not have an external group at that core management level.</p></speech>

This confirms yet again that the only form of defence the Government has is to attack the Opposition for the Government's own failures.  That is an approach which has long stopped being listened to by the public.  The extent to which the Taoiseach and his Ministers co-ordinated message points for attacking everyone and accepting zero responsibility for anything was striking.  It seems accountability is for the little people and not for those in office.</p>  <p>  We all know that by far the most expensive policy demand of any party in recent times has been one made by the Taoiseach, which is tax cuts weighted towards higher earners.  He has used his party conferences twice to call for &euro;3 billion in one single tax promise.  There is a &euro;3 billion commitment on broadband, notwithstanding the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's opposition who said it did not represent value for money and was way above the original estimate.</p>  <p>  There is the &euro;2 billion, and now likely to exceed &euro;2 billion, cost of the national children's hospital, which will go way above the original estimate.  There are also all the promises made in the past month to six weeks.  The Taoiseach literally threw the kitchen sink at the local and European elections in terms of expenditure commitments and promises, yet he still insists, as he did yesterday and today, that the problem is the Opposition seeking, for example, better conditions to stop the haemorrhaging of the Defence Forces or honest health budgets.  Equally, the Opposition is to blame for the Government's chronic failure to deliver projects within budget.  Given the scale of what the Fiscal Advisory Council has said and what the Minister for Finance said recently, is it still the Taoiseach's belief that &euro;3 billion in cuts to the tax base should be prioritised in the next two years?</p></speech>

They went through horrible detail to outline the trauma, the stigma and the adverse mental health effects those children are suffering, and will suffer for many years into the future, as a result of the State's failure to provide secure, affordable housing for them.  Has this division considered its failure of children in that regard?  It is a form of neglect that amounts to abuse of children.</p>  <p>  On a similar note, I would like the Taoiseach to comment on another aspect of the State caring for children, on which I tabled questions recently, which is that the national children's hospital, as well as the scandals of overruns and so on, will have a private clinic.  This massively over cost national children's hospital, paid for with public money, will have two-tier health.  We will have the public health and then what one can get if one can afford to pay for private health.  Does the Taoiseach believe it is acceptable to have two-tier health in the new national children's hospital?</p></speech>

On the Freedom of Information Act, I am not familiar with the particular court decisions.  If my reading of it was correct, some of them may even be on appeal so it might not be resolved as yet.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, as the line Minister, has responsibility for the Freedom of Information Act rather than me.</p><p>If the Deputy wishes to expand on his concerns later or offline I will be happy to hear them and his perspective, acknowledging his experience as the Minister who restored the Freedom of Information Act, which had previously been gutted by others. </p> <p> The Cabinet committee on justice met in recent days.  Good progress has been made on the policing and community safety Bill.  The legislation is the vehicle to implement the structural reforms proposed by the O'Toole commission in its report.  That involves strengthening GSOC, for example - which I think everyone supports - and turning it into a Garda ombudsman commission.  It also contains proposals that were made to establish a Garda board and to also establish a new policing community safety oversight commission,  PCSOC.  As I said to everyone at that committee meeting yesterday, the important thing for me is the objective and the outcome.  If that means departing from some of the recommendations made by the O'Toole commission for good reason, my mind is open to that.  The House will have an opportunity to debate that when the legislation comes in.  It was intended to replace a rather cumbersome structure involving an inspectorate, an authority and GSOC with a new, more streamlined structure.  However, it could be argued that the new structure is just as cumbersome, as it involves a board, PCSOC and some other bodies.</p> <p> On the report which Deputy M&iacute;che&aacute;l Martin presumably read in a newspaper or online, I assure him that it is not accurate as is so often the case when it comes to leaks and gossip.  The Government's first response to the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, report which was published earlier this week is to listen to it, listen to criticism, to heed the advice and respond to it.  I recall 12 or 13 years ago, when the Deputy opposite was a member of Government, that the European Commission issued stark warnings about spending increasing too quickly - it was increasing at twice the rate it is now - and our over-reliance on stamp duty.  The Government's response then was to ignore it, to attack the European Commission and criticise anyone who questioned its economic policy.  I will not make the same mistake as Taoiseach, which is why we are listening to what IFAC said and we will take its criticisms on board.  There are many reasons to believe that the economy and public finances are being well managed.  There are more people at work than ever before; unemployment is at a 14 year low; incomes are rising; the minimum wage has increased by 25% in the past couple of years; according to the CSO, living standards are improving, child poverty, deprivation and poverty are falling; the budget is in surplus for the first time since 2006; and the national debt is falling, where it had quadrupled under a previous administration.  The European Commission stated that we are compliant with fiscal rules and the rating agencies all give us a AAA rating.  It is important to say that IFAC's criticism was not about our tax policy and the rather modest reductions in income tax and the USC last year at all.  In fact, today the ESRI recommended that we do exactly what I proposed, which is to index tax credits and bands.  I never said that would be done over two years but over the course of a full Government.  I encourage people to read the ESRI's recommendations published today.</p></speech>

That would cost more than what I proposed in my policy.  The ESRI recommends what I proposed and IFAC did not criticise my proposals on tax.  IFAC criticised the Government on spending, which increased by approximately 6% last year, when we should have kept it down to 4% or 5%.  This is where the Opposition has been hypocritical in its response to the IFAC report because it constantly demands additional spending, more than we have allowed for.  In its budgetary policy, Sinn F&eacute;in wants to spend more, have a bigger deficit and finance it all through borrowing.  What would IFAC say about that?  Every week, Fianna F&aacute;il demands additional spending.  The Deputy is right.  This week it is on the Defence Forces, but it does not have a particular interest in or regard for the Defence Forces, as it will be another group next week and another again the week after.  It is entirely reasonable for me to call out the Opposition in this regard.  If IFAC has concerns about the Government increasing spending too rapidly, one can imagine the concerns it would have if the Fianna F&aacute;il was in government and implemented its policies, namely to spend even more and faster, just as it did when last in government.</p></speech>

It has units dealing with economic policy, economic infrastructure, regulation, and climate change, and digital issues. </p>  <p>  My Department also has a dedicated unit on Brexit preparedness and contingency planning.  This unit, working closely with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, which has lead responsibility in this area, focuses on cross-Government co-ordination, planning and programme management, as well as communications on Brexit preparedness.  It works closely with the economic division, and has a current staffing complement of ten.</p>  <p>  The economic division includes officials with a range of relevant economic qualifications, including specialist staff recruited as part of the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service, IGEES, as well as at least five staff with either PhD or Masters qualifications in economic or other relevant policy disciplines, as well as others with extensive experience dealing with economic and related policy issues.</p>  <p>  The division assists the work of two Cabinet committees and associated senior officials groups.</p>  <p>  Cabinet Committee A deals with issues relating to the economy, labour market, competitiveness, productivity, rural development, digital economy and pensions.</p>  <p>  Cabinet Committee D works to ensure a co-ordinated approach to the delivery and ongoing development of policy across the areas of infrastructure investment and delivery, housing, and climate action.</p>  <p> The division also leads Ireland's participation in the annual European Semester; prepares the annual national risk assessment, which provides an opportunity to identify and consider strategic risks on a structured basis - the 2019 draft national risk assessment was recently published for consultation; and liaises with the Central Statistics Office.</p>  <p>  The division also leads the Future Jobs Ireland initiative in partnership with the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation.  This aims to ensure we are well placed to meet future challenges facing the economy with a focus on quality, sustainable jobs and making sure Ireland is geared to secure the new jobs and new wealth of the future.</p>  <p>  It focuses on innovation and technological change, improving SME productivity, developing skills and talent, increasing participation in the labour force and assisting the transition to a low-carbon economy.</p>  <p>  A unit within the division works with the Minister of State with responsibility for data protection to ensure a cross-Government approach to data protection and broader digital issues.  It provides the secretariat to the interdepartmental committee on data issues and to the Government data forum.</p>  <p>  It is also currently leading, in collaboration with other relevant Departments, the development of a new overarching national digital strategy to enable Ireland to maximise the societal and economic benefits from digitalisation.</p>  <p>  The division also provides me with briefing and speech material on economic and related policy issues.</p>  <p>  Given its role, the division works closely with colleagues in the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, and with colleagues in other Departments, which have lead responsibility for specific policy areas.</p></reply>

The Taoiseach attacked the Opposition without discernment, I notice.  Everything good is done by the Government and everything bad by the Opposition.  I will take no lectures from the Taoiseach on economic management.  Mine was the only party that opposed and voted against the ruinous bank guarantee that led us into incredible difficulties, which were borne by the people of Ireland for such a long time.  I know a record of economic good management accrues to my party and I take credit for that for my party.  We established the IGEES, which was an idea that I had, to get the best graduates and to deploy them across all Departments, so they would have the capacity for proper economic evaluation across government.  We championed the reform of the budgetary process.</p><p>The Taoiseach needs to be more discerning in his general criticisms.</p> <p> Real criticisms are being levelled at the Government, which the Taoiseach needs to take seriously and not only by lip service.  He has given significant promises for tax reductions in the context of the real demand for service improvements because of the incapacity of the State for the bones of a decade to invest in service improvements on the scale required.  This means we must prioritise.  Does the Taoiseach accept that we need to prioritise in the short term the improvement of public services to deal with demographic issues and deficiencies in public services over the coming times in areas like housing, social care and childcare as opposed to any commitment to tax reductions?  Is that not the right and prudent way to go?</p></speech>

Fianna F&aacute;il has been highly responsible, as the Minister for Finance has confirmed.  The Taoiseach might take note of that and have the generosity of spirit to acknowledge it because there would not have been a Government or an Oireachtas otherwise.  We would have an election every year if such an approach were not taken based on policy.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach is not being honest or truthful on the budgetary framework.  The bottom line is that the Taoiseach cannot square the circle in terms of what is available to spend and the promises that he has made.  The bottom line is that housing and health are in dire straits.  There is no question about that.  They will need additional supports.</p>  <p>  The fact of the matter is that it was the Taoiseach who made the tax pledge of &euro;3 billion more than a year ago because he thought there would be a general election last year.  Let us make no mistake about it.  It was the Taoiseach who made promises in advance of the local elections, not anyone in the Opposition.  The Taoiseach said, without even consulting in advance, that he would spend &euro;3 billion despite the fact that the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform said it was madness.  Essentially, that is what he said.  He did not use that language but anyone can read through the memorandum.  It is a damning indictment of the Taoiseach's stewardship of these issues.  The Secretary General said the circle cannot be squared.</p>  <p>  The national development plan is becoming a fiction.  The Secretary General said the Government would need &euro;345 million for the children's hospital in the next two years and a further &euro;1 billion for the broadband plan.  The circle cannot be squared.  We need some honesty in terms of the budgetary framework.  Is it not the case that the Government cannot produce the hundreds of millions of euro that would be required to go anywhere near the Taoiseach's tax pledge, made more than a year ago, and still meet the housing and homelessness crisis as well as the health crisis?</p></speech>

The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council representatives said - I am on the committee - that if the Government is going to do that, then it must find extra sources of revenue.  Those of us in People Before Profit are unique in that in every single budget submission we have put forward proposals for substantial extra revenue that could be raised by looking at closing tax loopholes that benefit the corporations, increasing employers' PRSI, as well as introducing wealth taxes and taxes on property speculation.  We know vast sums of money are being made in that sector.</p>  <p>  I want to ask the Taoiseach about affordable housing.  We have a situation in the country now where people who are working in reasonably well-paid jobs do not have a prayer of being able to buy a house.  Often this applies to couples.  Cuckoo funds are swooping in and buying built-to-rent blocks.  They are pushing out any prospect of people who are working on reasonable earnings ever being able to own a home.  These are people who in the past would have got mortgages.  Instead, they are living at home with their parents in overcrowded conditions.  This is rampant throughout the country.  This is because the Rebuilding Ireland home loan mortgage scheme is not properly funded, the Government has not delivered affordable housing, and the Government is allowing cuckoo funds essentially to control the construction market and everything that is built.  Thus there is no affordable housing for people who are working hard and paying their taxes.  They are seeking a reasonable expectation of being able to put a roof over their head, either rented or purchased, but the Government is failing in that regard.  Do we not need extra resources going in?  Do we not need the State to provide affordable housing or to provide extra resources to the Rebuilding Ireland mortgage scheme?</p></speech>

I specifically mentioned Fianna F&aacute;il and Sinn F&eacute;in but not the Labour Party, which I acknowledge has a good record in Government in terms of managing the public finances.  This was the case not only under the stewardship of Deputy Howlin but under that of Ruair&iacute; Quinn and the rainbow coalition Government too.  The Labour Party has been less keen to demand extra spending than other Opposition parties.  I specifically mentioned Sinn F&eacute;in, whose policy is to spend more, run a bigger deficit and do it through borrowing.  That is absolutely reckless.  I called out Fianna F&aacute;il for the weekly demands for additional spending in different areas.  That is ongoing and we will see if that continues over the next five weeks.</p>  <p>  I have made proposals when it comes to tax policy.  Essentially, I have proposed the equivalent of indexation.  Incomes rise every year.  If we do not increase the tax bands and tax credits in line with that-----</p></speech>

A total of &euro;500 million out of &euro;3 billion fiscal space is approximately 20%.  I was asked whether I would prioritise public services and infrastructure over tax reductions.  Yes, I absolutely would.  A tax package of approximately &euro;500 million per year from a fiscal space of &euro;3 billion represents a 4:1 split in favour of public services and infrastructure over tax reduction.  In fact, it is a little to the left of what the Labour Party and Fine Gael Government did.  We had greater tax packages in the last two budgets than we have had in the past or as I propose for the future.</p></speech>

We have done both in the past three budgets and I make no apologies for that whatsoever.  We have reduced the USC to take more low-paid people out of that net altogether and ensure that all people pay less.  We have also raised the bar at which people pay the highest rate of income tax.  I believe people pay that rate too soon in Ireland.  In other countries this does not apply to people earning &euro;35,000 or &euro;40,000 per year.  The average salary now in Ireland for someone working full-time is &euro;47,000 per year.  In most countries such people do not pay a marginal rate of 40% or 50%.  They only pay that when they earn far more.  People on average incomes in Ireland get a pay increase or an increment and do some overtime but lose more than half of that in income tax.  That is unfair.</p></speech>

Income tax and USC reductions have been worth approximately &euro;1,500 per year to the average household.  That was a good thing to do.  It might not be a vast amount of money, but for a large number of people it is the equivalent of a monthly mortgage repayment, a month's childcare or a month's rent.  That would not have happened otherwise.  The average household would be that much worse off had it not been for the tax packages in the past three budgets.</p></speech>

They are not designated as such under an affordable scheme, but they are affordable.

It is time sensitive, given the roll-out of the new childcare scheme.</p>  <p>  I will provide some context.  I am speaking on behalf of the Carlow Regional Youth Service, CRYS, which provides a great service in Carlow town.  Carlow is like most commuter towns and has a population of 20,000 or 25,000 people.  Like most towns throughout the country, it also faces challenges.  There are very good and middle of the road parts of the town, but there are other parts that can be challenging.  This is where the CRYS plays a leading role, in that it ensures that children in difficult areas have futures.</p>  <p>  The new childcare scheme is being rolled out on 11 October.  While it is welcome in general, it is missing a key element.  Childcare is meant to look after kids, in particular vulnerable children.  In Carlow town, the CRYS looks after 59 vulnerable children.  They are vulnerable in different ways.  For example, there could be drug related or other issues that have a knock-on effect.  These kids need to be given the same opportunity as everyone else, including us in our time, to progress from primary level education to second and third level education.  If the new scheme is implemented as presented, however, such kids will miss out on that opportunity.  Its roll-out is concerned with job activation.  While that is welcome, the heart of the programme overlooks vulnerable children.  I am sure that Carlow town is like other towns in that it has many such children.  They need to be given the same opportunity as everyone else.</p>  <p>  Will the Minister re-examine the scheme's format?  She is engaged in an ongoing review.  Unfortunately, the people involved in the CRYS are disappointed about not being asked to make a contribution to that review.  They would have played a large part.  Maybe other organisations of a similar status were asked to make contributions.  Before the Minister makes a final decision, will she engage with the CRYS to determine how the issues can be resolved?  It would be unfortunate if vulnerable children were not given the same opportunity as other kids.  The CRYS looks after 59 kids from difficult sectors of society.  They need to be looked after and given an opportunity to move to second and third level education.  If they are not, then they may go the way of other kids from difficult backgrounds.</p>  <p>  The scheme in general is welcome and a great deal of extra money has been invested in childcare in recent years.  The Minister deserves to be complimented in that regard and on her work, but there is an anomaly in the system that is due to be rolled out in October.  If it is not addressed now, the scheme currently operating in Carlow town will have to be closed at the end of July and the kids in question will lose out on a valuable future.  Will the Minister address these points in her reply?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-06-12a.358" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" time="14:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019061200029#GG00400"><p>Let me address the issue of the national childcare scheme, on which the Deputy focused.  When introduced, the scheme will represent a major landmark for all children and families, especially lower income families and lone parents.  It will be accessible to all families, not just those working or studying full time.  The new scheme will replace the existing targeted childcare schemes with a single, streamlined and user-friendly one.  It entails a fundamental shift away from subsidies grounded in medical card and social protection entitlements towards a comprehensive and progressive system of universal and income-based subsidies.  By making this shift and tangibly reducing the cost of quality childcare for thousands of families across Ireland, the scheme intends to improve children's outcomes, support their lifelong learning, make work pay and reduce child poverty.  It is also designed to have a positive impact on gender equality in terms of labour market participation.</p>  <p>  Under the current targeted schemes, many families with low income levels are able to access subsidised childcare because they are either in low-paid employment or are rotating between short periods of employment, unemployment and training.  The national childcare scheme will change this.  In terms of the income-based subsidies awarded under the scheme, parents who are working or studying or who meet certain other conditions will qualify for an enhanced hours subsidy up to a maximum of 40 hours per week.  The definitions of "work" and "study" will be set out in regulations made under the Childcare Support Act 2018 and will be comprehensive, covering differing types of work and study arrangements, such as part-time, week on-week off, and zero-hour contract arrangements.  The legislation will also provide for so-called bridging periods when a parent is moving between work and study.  Where a parent is not engaging in work or study, the child will still be eligible for the standard hours subsidy of 15 hours per week.  These 15 hours will wrap around school and preschool provisions.  This means that, when the child is in school or preschool, no subsidy will be payable during term time.</p>  <p>  This approach reflects the policy objectives of encouraging labour market activation and reducing child poverty and persistent poverty traps.  It is consistent not only with the evidence of the strong benefits of early learning and care for young children, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds, but with the evidence that these benefits are in most cases realised with part-time participation.  For older children, it recognises that, during term time, child development needs will be met through school and preschool while still providing part-time early learning and care and school-age childcare outside of those times.</p>  <p>  I emphasise that families with high levels of need who require childcare for child welfare, child protection or family support reasons may be referred for childcare support by a specified so-called sponsor body.</p><p>If such a referral is made, the family will automatically qualify for a subsidy for the number of hours considered appropriate by the sponsor without having to satisfy the scheme's eligibility, income or enhanced hours requirements.  I hear the significant issues the Deputy is raising and I share his concerns.  This is the reason I commissioned an independent sustainability review last year.  I think the Deputy referred to the review, which analyses a number of services in highly disadvantaged communities to explore any potential financial sustainability issues and the potential impact of the work-study rules within the national childcare scheme.  I expect to receive that analysis, which will inform any necessary refinements of the national childcare scheme, shortly.  In the interim, arrangements are in place to ensure no one loses out.</p></speech>

I reiterate that I firmly accept and appreciate the work that is being done.  I acknowledge that the new scheme that is coming in will be very beneficial.  The Minister's reply referred to a question I asked approximately ten days ago.  I initially raised this matter a month ago.  The Minister is missing the point I am making about the vulnerable children in this sector.  I welcome anything that will reduce the cost of childcare, which has been too expensive in this country for far too long.  We have been playing catch-up in the childcare sector for a number of years.  Anything that is introduced to try to improve the sector is very welcome.  It is important to point out that we need to get people back to work.  I agree that the only way to secure people's future is by getting them back to work.  A number of people who come from difficult or vulnerable sectors may never work.  Their parents and grandparents never worked, unfortunately.  If we do not look after the kids in such families, they will never work.  We do not want to have cases in which historical issues are repeated time and again.  I am highlighting this issue for that reason.  The Minister mentioned that support is available when issues arise.  Referrals for special subsidisation can be made.  I am open to correction on my understanding that this support may be in name only.  I believe only one social worker is available in this sector to deal with any issues that arise.  Although there may be a list of areas to which kids or families may be referred when extra issues are involved, the reality is that the necessary supports to deal with such cases and ensure children have an opportunity to move forward are not available.  I might be repeating myself when I say it is essential that every child in this country has the same educational opportunity.  Every child should be able to progress from primary to secondary level and from secondary to third level, rather than being left behind as others were in the past.  I ask the Minister to provide more substance on the issue I am trying to highlight today.  Where can we deal with the issue of the anomaly in the system I have described?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-06-12a.361" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" time="14:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019061200030#HH00300"><p>I have tried to outline the overall objectives of the national childcare scheme, which shares many of the objectives of the schemes that have supported the Carlow youth service in the past.  I have indicated that some things will change in light of the underlying policy objectives that support the national childcare scheme.  Those objectives have been debated fully.  The second major point I would like to make in response to the Deputy is that I appreciate his concern that some of the changes in this service will have a negative impact on the financial sustainability of subsidised supports for young people and children.  I think that is what the Deputy is saying.  Of course I am open to that point.  I am considering it.  My understanding is that during April and May of this year, the Carlow County Childcare Committee gathered data on the potential impact of the national childcare scheme on early learning and care and school-age services in County Carlow.  Information was sought from seven community services, four family resource-type services and three stand-alone school-age services.  Departmental officials will meet some of those involved in the Carlow pilot impact study on Thursday, 13 June to learn more about their work and their findings.  When those officials feed into our work, we will have a deeper understanding of what is going on with the shift in financial support for these children, as described by the Deputy, and we will seek to find a way to move forward to ensure the service is sustainable.  I think the first step in this regard will involve meeting the officials to hear at first hand about the findings of the work that is being presented and moving forward from there.  We will take those steps and see where we are then.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, for being in the Chamber and for his engagement on this issue over the past week.  As the Minister of State is aware, on 31 May last, which was the Friday of the June bank holiday weekend, temporary and agency staff who are currently employed at Belmullet District Hospital were notified by text message that their contracts would not be renewed when they expired.  Three of the contracts in question were due to expire within two weeks of that date.  Some of these staff have been working in Belmullet for many years.  Many of them have been based there for more than two years.  They started off as agency staff before being given temporary HSE contracts.  Some of them were recruited earlier this year because of the level of demand for services at Belmullet District Hospital.  That very fact gives the lie to the claim by senior HSE management that this facility is overstaffed.</p>  <p>  All of the staff at Belmullet District Hospital and the adjoining &Aacute;ras Deirbhle centre have given selfless service over the years.  They have put patients and their families first.  Since Belmullet District Hospital and &Aacute;ras Deirbhle opened, they have had a tradition of putting patients' interests first.  The care and attention provided at these centres is respected and supported within the community, as shown by the attendance of hundreds of people at a public meeting on Monday night that was organised by our colleague, Senator Conway-Walsh, to show support for the staff in question.  Since 31 May, the temporary staff have been told they will be redeployed within the HSE network, but that is not very simple.  As Belmullet and Erris are quite far away from other HSE facilities, such as Ballina District Hospital, St. Fionnan's unit in Achill and the McBride unit in Westport, some staff may face 100-mile round-trips to do their jobs at such locations.  Staff who are not particularly well paid cannot be asked to take on additional fuel costs.  What if staff members do not have access to transport?  As the Minister of State knows, public transport is not an option in rural areas.  The agency staff continue to be in limbo despite the service, care and attention they have given.  They do not know where they will stand in terms of their employment prospects this time next week.</p>  <p>  When I challenged HSE management on the impact of these staff reductions on bed numbers, they said the situation is under review.  They also said the current number of beds is sufficient, but that is not true.  Any analysis will show that the demand for beds in Belmullet is bigger than the number of beds currently being used.  GPs do not have the right to access Belmullet District Hospital.  Last weekend, this resulted in a patient having to be admitted into an acute bed at Mayo University Hospital even though four beds were available in Belmullet.  That is happening all the time.  One of the things being cited by HSE management is that the overrun of approximately &euro;5 million in older people's services has to be paid for.  Why are the people of Belmullet and Erris having to pay for that?  What is the overrun in the acute bed budget because of the inability to use community hospitals like Belmullet District Hospital to their maximum potential?  Respite beds are not being made available in Belmullet even though funds were raised for those beds locally.  This was done with care and attention by families that want to use respite.</p>  <p>  I would like to emphasise the geography of this issue.  Those who want to avail of respite services will not want their loved ones to be two or three hours away from them.  They will want respite in the community.  The concept and the model here involves care in the community.  Asking people to go so far away for basic care cannot be allowed.  There is a great deal of potential in this complex.  Physiotherapy is not being provided.  X-ray services are erratic.  The staff have established a committee from Belmullet District Hospital and &Aacute;ras Deirbhle with a local action committee and local representatives, including myself; the Minister, Deputy Ring; Senators Conway-Walsh and Swanick; and local GPs.  We want to work with the Minister of State on a plan for the development of the facilities in the locality.</p><p>The Minister of State has committed to visiting the hospital, but when is that going to happen?  Will the Minister give a commitment about the working conditions of the affected staff at Belmullet hospital, who do not know where they are going to be working next?  Will he ask the HSE to freeze any changes until the Minister of State has the chance to visit the unit?  Will he ask HSE management to engage with us properly in developing Belmullet Community Hospital?</p></speech>

I thank the Deputy for raising the issue.  It provides me with an opportunity to update the House on this matter.</p>  <p>  Social care services, including home care, day care, and short stay residential care, are all important components in enabling people to remain living at home and participating in their communities.  They also provide valuable supports to carers.  This Government is committed to supporting people to live in dignity and independence in their homes and communities for as long as possible.  Where this is not feasible, the health service supports access to quality long-term residential care where this is appropriate, and we will continue to develop and improve health services in all regions of the country to ensure quality and patient safety.</p>  <p>  There is an obvious need to provide high-quality and flexible services that not only best meet the needs of individual clients but also reduce pressures elsewhere on the wider health system, such as acute hospitals or on long-term residential care.  As of 30 April 2019, there were a total of 1,943 short stay public beds, which include step-up care, step-down care, intermediate care, rehab and respite care, which are used in a flexible manner to meet local needs at any given time.  The Health Service Executive has operational responsibility for the delivery of health and social services, including those at facilities such as Belmullet Community Hospital.  The district hospital in Belmullet and &Aacute;ras Deirbhle, Belmullet provide, and will continue to provide, very important services to the people of north Mayo.  I am advised that the HSE has been examining a number of measures which are aimed at bringing its expenditure on health services for older people across Community Healthcare West back into line with their allocated budget.</p>  <p>  As part of this process the HSE has been examining the usage of beds in Belmullet Community Hospital and has established that, on average, just 12 short-stay beds are in use at any given time to support acute discharges.  This is significantly fewer than the number of beds that it is currently staffing.  For this reason, the HSE has notified a number of agency staff that their services will no longer be required.  The HSE head of social care services in community healthcare organisation, CHO, 2 has informed the Department that when the contracts of employment for three temporary staff in Belmullet come to an end in the coming weeks, they will be offered redeployment opportunities in other community nursing units.  The HSE has a clear responsibility to deliver services within allocated budgets while ensuring that the highest standard of care continues to be provided to all patients in a safe and secure environment.  This includes any decision on prioritising resources and the impact any decision has on the integrity of the services provided.</p>  <p>  The primary focus has to be on patients.  Quality care and patient safety come first, and all patients should receive the same high standard of quality-assured care.  It is essential to ensure that resources are appropriately channelled and that the changing needs of older people are adequately addressed.  In light of the important role played by the district hospital and &Aacute;ras Deirbhle in the delivery of care, the HSE will keep the situation under review over the summer months and will reconsider the position during the autumn in preparation for the busier winter period.</p></speech>

The HSE has stated to me that there are 18 support acute discharge beds and two additional short-stay beds in the hospital.  There is demand for more beds, and if GPs were allowed to admit patients, there would be further demand.  I gave the Minister the example where, with four beds free in the hospital, somebody was forced to travel to Castlebar.</p>  <p>  The staff are going to be redeployed many miles away and will not get any recognition or compensation for that.  There is also the question of the development of facilities.  The Minister has a policy paper relating to community and district hospitals.  We often refer to Belmullet as a step-down facility for Mayo University Hospital, but we need to step up the services on offer, which would take the pressure off Mayo University Hospital which has been under inordinate pressure along with the regional hospital in Galway for the past 12 to 18 months.  If we are to take the pressure off the two central hospitals, we will have to use Belmullet, Ballina and Swinford to their potential instead of cutting Peter to pay Paul.  The HSE is spending extra money on acute beds when there are beds empty in Belmullet.</p>  <p>  Will the Minister of State challenge HSE management on the figure it gave of 12 beds, because it gave us a figure of 20?  Will the Minister be visiting the hospital?  If so, when will he do so?  I ask the Minister of State to walk in the shoes of the staff who are affected, who have given extraordinary service only to find out by text message on a Friday of a bank holiday weekend that their jobs are about to go.  The agency staff are still in complete limbo and those on temporary contracts are going to be forced to travel 40 or 50 miles a day to work.  That is completely unfair to people who give everything to their job.</p></speech>

I will be happy to discuss the reply with Members to get to the bottom of it.  There are two sides to this story and I do not want to play judge and jury but I want to have all the facts in my possession.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Ring, has invited me to go to the hospital and I am happy to do that.  My ambition is to get up there before the end of the month, or on 1 July or 2 July at the latest.  I will meet patients and their families, who are the most important people there.  I will meet public representatives and will hear the views of staff.  I assure the Deputy that there is no question of downgrading services and no question about the future of this facility, which is playing a vital role in the provision of services for the elderly.  It is in a very remote rural area and I am very familiar with such areas.  There is a need for facilities to stand alone and I guarantee that, as long as I am Minister of State, I will not oversee the downgrading of any facility for older people, and that includes Belmullet.  However, I also have to support the HSE in any measures it takes to bring about efficiencies and ensure there is no waste.  If the HSE tells me that beds that are staffed are lying idle, I would not support that either.  I will not put the needs of staff above that by supporting empty beds with staff alongside them.  I am told that is the situation but I want to see it for myself.</p>  <p>  I accept that we need to upgrade the use of the facility so that it can take pressure off the acute facilities, and if we have to put more people in there, I will work with the Deputy to achieve that.  However, I will not stand over empty beds, as it were.  I have given my colleague, the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Ring, a cast-iron assurance that there will be no downgrading of services and I give a similar assurance to Deputy Calleary.  I will work with the Deputy to utilise this wonderful facility to its maximum in the future.</p></speech>

Irish fishing vessels have fished unhindered in these waters for many decades, and did so prior to our membership of the European Union.  This country has never recognised the UK's claim to the waters off Rockall.  While the UK has claimed sovereignty, it has never sought to claim fishing rights or gas or oil deposits in the area.</p>  <p>  I am very concerned by the Taoiseach's response in the House today.  He said that while we are members of the European Union, we have a right to fish there but that, post Brexit, things may change.  That is a very serious statement and it weakens our case to continue fishing there post Brexit.</p><p>I seek clarity on that.  The other point I want to make is that it has been suggested that other parties were aware of discussions taking place at ministerial and official level over the past two years.  I am sure other parties will speak for themselves but my party has never been aware of these discussions.  I am disappointed that the Government could not have made us aware.  The Minister wanted meetings with the Opposition when <i>voisinage</i>was an issue.  Both Ministers will have to convene a meeting of the spokespersons and brief us fully.</p></speech>

This issue is highly topical and the Ministers should have made themselves available to the D&aacute;il and should have known that this would come up.  The issue of Rockall has been contentious for many years.  The Government has said that it is surprised it is coming up but we see from statements made that the Scottish Government has been raising it for a long time.  How can the Government be surprised that it is coming up when it has known that it is an issue?  It has kept this issue secret from everybody.  Perhaps it is surprised that it has been made public.  That could be the only thing the Government is surprised about.  I am also very concerned about the Taoiseach's statement today in which he said that he accepts that Rockall is part of the UK exclusive economic zone.  If that is the case, what is the issue?  Does he accept that?  Will the Minister of State provide clarification on that because it is vitally important?</p></speech>

Some fishermen have decided not to take the risk of fishing the waters off Rockall, which they have always done.  These actions are putting their livelihoods and income streams at jeopardy.  Other fishermen have decided to fish and are currently doing so because it is allowed under the EU Common Fisheries Policy.  They have done so for years and it has never been an issue.  It is absolutely shocking that they learnt last Friday, at the same time as ourselves, that a dispute has been ongoing for months about which they were never informed.</p>  <p>  It is shocking that last month, when the T&aacute;naiste, the Minister responsible for fishing and officials knew about this, the Taoiseach sat down with the Scottish First Minister and did not raise a peep about this stand-off.  I asked the Taoiseach this morning whether he would lift up the phone and talk to the Scottish First Minister.  He said no.  He is making it very clear that this is going to be dealt with at official level.  We need, first and foremost, to defend the rights of Irish fishermen in all instances.  There are serious questions being asked.  Will a counsel be appointed in Scotland to deal with any legal cases?  Will all income streams that potentially will be lost be recovered?  What types of support will the Irish Government provide?  What support will be given by the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority if attempts are made to board vessels and to arrest our fishermen?</p></speech>

It is disgraceful that this has been going on for two years.  I have been the fisheries spokesperson for my party since I first came in here in 2002 and not once was I informed that this was going on or of the problems that exist.  I am not really surprised.  Successive Governments have behaved disgracefully with regard to the fleets fishing off our coasts.  They were sold out in 1972.  The overwhelming majority of fishermen and fisherwomen have been neglected and abandoned by the Government and the State.  I really admire Iceland and the Faroe Islands for how they defended their fishing rights and their fishermen and fisherwomen.  They were prepared to physically resist any attempts to encroach on their rights.  Scotland's actions are putting down a marker.  It has to do with a lot more than fishing.  This House will stand fully behind the Government if it is prepared to stand by our fishermen and fisherwomen and to protect their rights because it is our rights we are fighting for.</p></speech>

He cannot be here today because he is in Japan on official business.  He has asked me to take this Topical Issue debate for him and to extend his apologies.  He will be happy to provide more clarity to the Members opposite when he is back in the House.  In the meantime, he has asked me to give this reply on his behalf.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s position is that there is no basis for excluding Irish fishing vessels from the Rockall waters as they are legitimately pursuing EU fishing opportunities and have done so unhindered for decades.  Deputies will be aware that the T&aacute;naiste recently received a formal letter of notice from the Scottish Cabinet Secretary for Culture, Tourism and External Affairs, Ms Fiona Hyslop, stating that Scotland would deploy vessels in the Rockall area to take enforcement action against Irish vessels found fishing within 12 miles of Rockall from last weekend onwards.</p>  <p>  We do not accept that there is any justification for enforcement action against Irish vessels fishing legitimately in these waters.  The United Kingdom claims sovereignty over Rockall and thus a 12-mile territorial sea around it.  The United Kingdom first made its claim of sovereignty over Rockall in 1955 and sought to incorporate it as part of the UK in its domestic law by virtue of the Island of Rockall Act 1972.  The Irish Government has never sought to claim sovereignty over Rockall.  Its position has been and remains that it does not accept the UK&rsquo;s claim to sovereignty over Rockall, which it regards as forming part of the UK&rsquo;s exclusive economic zone and, accordingly, part of European Union waters under the Common Fisheries Policy, to which the principle of equal access for the vessels of all EU member states applies.  Irish vessels have operated unhindered in the Rockall zone for many decades fishing haddock, squid and other species.  </p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy Creed, met representatives of the Irish fishing sector on Friday last to inform them of the letter from the Scottish authorities.  He also confirmed that Ireland&rsquo;s position with regard to Rockall had not changed.  The industry representatives explained that Ireland&rsquo;s main fisheries in the Rockall area are for haddock and squid and both fisheries are of substantial economic importance to our fishing fleet based in Greencastle, Killybegs, Castletownbere and other ports around the coast.  I know that the industry was appreciative of that engagement but was also extremely concerned at the possibility that unjustified enforcement action might be taken against it.  </p>  <p>  We have built a strong and positive relationship with Scotland, to our mutual benefit, over many years.  The Minister hopes we can use that close relationship to find a way to resolve these matters and to remove the threat of enforcement action against Irish vessels.  Dialogue is continuing between the Irish and Scottish Governments and there have been close contacts at official level over recent days.  It has now been agreed that a process of intensified engagement will take place, led by senior officials from both Administrations.  We are hopeful that on this basis the latest difficulties can be de-escalated.  </p></speech>

We want to be helpful and to fight this with a united front.  I am extremely worried following the Taoiseach's scripted response today.  Reading from his script he said that things will change following Brexit.  He also said - listen to this - "One thing that is often not fully appreciated is that Irish fishermen take a lot of fish [35% of all the fish we take] out of UK waters."  What about all of those who take fish out of Irish waters?  This is a form of defeatism from the Taoiseach.  He and his Ministers should strengthen their resolve.  We want to continue fishing those waters as we always have, even after Brexit.  We cannot accept the ceding of our rights to the UK.  This is not only about Rockall but about fishing in UK waters post Brexit.</p></speech>

This Government and former Governments have been guilty of letting this issue slide, letting it sit and doing nothing about it because we have both been members of the European Union and it therefore did not matter.  Now it has come into sharp focus again because of the likelihood of the UK withdrawing from the European Union, which is causing this dispute to raise its head again.  Regardless of what the European Union has had to say on the matter, it has been criminal of successive Governments, including this one, to refuse to deal with this issue.  It is a real problem, which is now coming home to roost.  The Government will have to deal with and to live with it.  The Government should be making sure that our rights are asserted and that our fishermen will be able to continue fishing in this area regardless of what happens in respect of Brexit.</p></speech>

As representatives of our respective communities, we have an entitlement to be able to brief fishing organisations and prepare a plan, legally if necessary, to challenge this illegal act by Scotland.  I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, to take that to Minister Creed, to ensure that is the case.  The legal aspect of it can be fought under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea to determine whether that or otherwise is the case.  There is a need for dialogue and for us to be briefed properly.  We should not find out on the "News at One" on a Friday that this act has taken place and has been going on for two years without us knowing anything about it.</p></speech>

This needs to be resolved quickly because it is impacting fishermen now.  God forbid, as we heard from the Scottish Minister that they will enforce the procedures.  This means boarding a vessel, directing it to port, the powers to arrest individuals and to place sanctions such as impounding the vessel including its gear and the fish on board.  That is how drastic this is.  These multimillion euro ships being tied up at port could seriously impact the owner of the vessel and the families of the fishermen on board.  It needs to be resolved.</p>  <p>  I do not understand why the Taoiseach is refusing - even quietly or privately - to lift up the phone to his counterpart in Scotland and to raise this issue.  Many years ago Paddy Harte stood up in this Chamber and said he represented the interests of Rockall because it was a part of his constituency.  The Minister of State said we never claimed ownership of it.  If he looks at the records going back, he will see that we never accepted the jurisdiction of Rockall because we believed it was part of our jurisdiction at that time.</p></speech>

Professor John Sodeau stated this week that air pollution in my home town of Enniscorthy has reached an extremely dangerous level.  There have been 12 breaches of Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, safety limits since Christmas.  Some of these have reached ten times the EU safe limits.  Asthma sufferers living in Enniscorthy, New Ross and Gorey have been warned to stay indoors during these times.  That is totally unacceptable.</p>  <p>  People with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD, asthma and other lung problems cannot get the supports they need.  Yet, here is a simple solution to help those people by giving them safe air to breathe.  Some 80% of the population is covered by the smoky coal ban but 20% is not.  Why are those 20% of the people being treated differently from the rest of the nation?  For the other 80% the ban has existed in some places for almost 30 years.  However, the Government has taken fright because I understand one coal importer has threatened legal action.  I am sure there has not been a regulation in the history of the State that a Government sought to introduce where there was not a threat of some form or legal action.  For the Government to be seen to bow to that kind of legal pressure is only to invite further legal pressure on every other regulation the State proposes to introduce.</p>  <p>  I was always taught that the primary role of the State is to protect its people.  In this case the State is showing cowardice in the face of a legal threat and is not protecting the people.  More pertinently, it is not protecting the 20% who are forced to live in unsafe air conditions.  I do not like having to bring up negative things about my home town or other towns in my native county, but this is dangerous and unacceptable, and something needs to be done.</p></speech>

Ten times more people are killed by air pollution than by road accidents in the EU.  The UN has stated that the failure of governments across the world to ensure their citizens breathe clean air is a violation of the rights to life, health and well-being.  The Clean Air Alliance has claimed that four people in Ireland die every day from the effects of air pollution.  Some 1,150 premature deaths in Ireland are attributable to air pollution.</p>  <p>  Yesterday, the Minister advised that up to 6 June, there had been 98 breaches of the daily air pollution limits recorded in the State.  Sixty five of those were in Dublin, including four in Blanchardstown, two in the Phoenix Park and 12 in Ringsend.  There were also 11 in Enniscorthy.  There were even more in places like Davitt Road and other heavy industrialised areas.</p>  <p>  Air pollution is a major cause of premature death and disease, and is the single largest environmental health risk in Europe, causing approximately 400,000 premature deaths per year.  The report published in 2018, using data for 2015 indicates 1,150 premature deaths in Ireland.  Heart disease and stroke are the commonest reasons for premature death attributable to air pollution.  Air pollution leads to reduced lung function, respiratory infections and aggravated asthma, particularly in children.  The current rental crisis is adding to the asthma crisis because of mould and bacteria in poor rental accommodation.  Recent evidence suggests the central nervous system is also affected.</p>  <p>  What does the Government propose to do about it?  I do not want a 340 or 640-item list of things it plans to do out to 2040.  I want to see action in the here and now that relieves people, in particular children, who are suffering.  Air pollution and climate change are intertwined.  Several air pollutants are also climate forcers, which have a potential impact on climate and global warming in the short term.  Air pollution and climate change should be tackled jointly using policies and measures that have been developed through an integrated approach.</p>  <p>  I am concerned that the Government is all talk and almost no action in tackling what it is killing Irish people, including children.</p></speech>

Undoubtedly Ireland faces challenges regarding ambient air pollution, which is pollution at particular places at particular times in respect of particular substances.  The most serious problem we have is with particulate matter, particularly in smaller towns such as Enniscorthy, as adverted to by Deputy Browne.</p>  <p>  Both my predecessors gave a commitment to extend the smoky coal ban, as it is known, to the remaining parts of the country.  A number of coal firms indicated that they would legally challenge this decision by the two former Ministers and not only challenge the extension of the ban but also the existing ban.</p><p>I am not in any way taking fright in respect of this.  I have taken careful counsel from the Attorney General.  His advice is that I need to take heed of this challenge and that what is occurring could jeopardise not only the extension but also the ban already in place.  I am taking care to consult the Attorney General so we can bring forward robust measures to deal with this.</p> <p> As the Deputy knows, the nub of the issue is that the existing bans include smoky coal but exclude wood and peat.  In the evaluation of particulate matter, which is the core pollutant we are concerned about, there is little or no difference between those two types of products.  Therefore, we need to consider how to deal with this proposal.  I am fully committed to having a clean air strategy and developing robust proposals to deal with this.</p> <p> On the second issue raised by Deputy Burton, namely, breaches concerning particulate matter, this is a matter of significant concern.  This year, there have been two trans-boundary air pollution events that affected our air quality.  Pollutants from other countries were carried into Ireland.  There was one event in February and a more significant one over the Easter weekend.  These events have contributed to numerous breaches at several of the stations.  However, our background level of pollutants is too high.  This is underscored by the fact that I am extending, through the EPA, the air-quality monitoring network.  We need to improve our performance.</p> <p> We have significant commitments on all the key pollutants: sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, non-methane volatile organic compounds, ammonia and particulate matter.  We will meet four of the targets we have set for 2020.  Ammonia remains a problem and we need to address it.  Challenges will be faced in the other areas as economic activity grows.  We have currently out for consultation a national air pollution control programme.  This is to identify the measures and programmes that will deliver on the reduction targets.</p> <p> It is not true that no action is being taken in respect of this.  Besides considering the issue of a ban on particular fuels, we are taking consistent and determined action to improve the position on pollutants coming from the transport and home heating sectors.  I refer to very significant reductions in emissions standards for motor vehicles, the promotion of electric vehicles, the promotion of retrofitting and improvement of heating systems.  The climate action plan will represent a significant stepping up of ambition in these areas.  I accept the Deputy's point that we have a problem.  I am determined to find a way to bring about an effective improvement in respect of particulate matter from home heating fuels.  I am working with the Attorney General to find a solution.</p></speech>

It has been stated by the professor that these comprise the most dangerous forms of air pollution because their microscopic size allows them to enter the bloodstream and get trapped in the lungs, resulting in respiratory and cardiac issues.  We are also aware that these particles can be carcinogenic.  They result in up to 1,500 deaths per year nationally.  How many deaths are in the 20% of towns not covered by the State's smoky coal ban?  The importers say that if the Government extends the ban to the final 20%, they will take legal action against the whole lot.  Their motivation is money and nothing else.  It is pure greed.  It is a threat to the health of the State and people.  The primary role of the Minister is to protect the people of the country, not bow to the kind of pressure in question.</p>  <p>  A question must be asked about how serious the importers are.  Why have they not taken legal action in the past 30 years?  Surely if it were financially viable for them to threaten the State with action in the High Court, European Court of Justice or other court, they would do so.  What the coal importers are threatening is despicable.  I am not referring to all of them but to one or two.  For the State to bow in the face of the threats is unacceptable and outrageous.  The Minister is treating 20% of the population as second-class citizens in terms of their health.  It is a most serious issue.</p></speech>

We know what will work in towns like Enniscorthy.  Smoky coal should be banned.  In addition, trees, hedges and ivy should be planted.  All the European and UK research, which is very advanced, has shown that all of these, even in very polluted locations in towns and cities, have a massive improving effect on air quality.  The amount of disease caused by dirty air should be mapped out.  The Minister should state the steps we are taking to end this.</p>  <p>  The HSE is well over budget, as we know.  The Government has lost control of the budget of the HSE.  Why not act to have clean air in this country and reduce the incidence of all the diseases and conditions that dirty air is causing in adults and children?</p>  <p>  The Government should pledge to go green.  We should green our towns and villages and grow back our hedgerows.  The latter are being ripped out all over the country under the Government's agricultural policy.  We know the steps we can take to alter this.  They are not incredibly expensive at all.  In fact, over a period of five to seven years, I have no doubt that they would save the State a considerable amount.  One should think back to Ms Mary Harney and the ban on smoky coal in Dublin.  That was a single action.  I urge the current Minister to have courage and take on the coal firms, which are polluting so many towns.  One has only to stand on the hill outside Enniscorthy on a bad day to see the pall of smoke sitting over the town.  That should not be in this day and age.  Maybe the Minister should just visit the town himself.</p></speech>

It is not just smoky coal because it is also peat and wood.  I fully acknowledge that scientific evidence has strengthened concern over air pollution from particulate matter, in particular.  The House would not thank me if I came forward with regulations that collapsed and were not robust.  The Deputies would regard it as prudent for me to seek to have proposals that are robust and stand up to legal challenge.  I would not be doing any service to the people of Enniscorthy or anywhere else if I did not do that.  It is with this in mind that I am taking care to ensure that what I do is robust and effective.</p>  <p>  We have made significant progress on air quality.  We will meet the targets to reduce sulphur dioxide by 65%, nitrogen oxide by 49%, non-methane volatile organic compounds by 25%, and particulate matter by 18%.  We will meet the targets set but I fully recognise that we have to do a lot better and introduce measures for the ambitions we have for the next decade.</p></speech>

I wish my party had not been compelled to introduce today's motion on the Defence Forces.  I would much prefer if there were no retention crisis.  I wish men and women were not leaving the Defence Forces in their droves, <i>en masse</i>, heading for the exit doors as quickly as they can.</p><p>I wish the measures the Minister of State and the Government have belatedly introduced to stem the flood were not the abject failures they have been.  I wish morale among our serving men and women was sky high and not on the floor.  I wish our naval vessels had enough staff so they could go out to sea and stop the huge quantities of drugs being trafficked into the country.  I wish pilots and highly skilled personnel in our Air Corps were not leaving faster than we can count.  I wish our Army personnel did not have to wake up at all hours of the morning and drive hundreds of miles to get to work because of the disastrous reorganisation and removal of the fourth western brigade and the displacement of many personnel in the midlands and west of the country.  Commuters in perpetuity is all this has created.</p> <p> I wish I was not receiving messages daily from desperate families of Defence Forces members stating how worried they are about the bills that are coming through the door which they cannot pay and are not going away, the threatened evictions and the devastating impact all this has on their mental health and well-being.  I wish no Defence Forces families were dependent on social welfare payments for supports.  I wish the men and women of &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann and our Reserve Defence Force were treated with the respect and dignity they deserve and given decent pay and proper working conditions.  It is 2019 and the Defence Forces is at breaking point.</p> <p> Of course, none of this is news to the Minister of State.  We implored him to take decisive action before these problems blew out of control.  It is a real shame he did not heed our warnings.  We warned him in May of last year that we could not recruit our way out of this retention crisis and that a credible retention policy was required.  The Minister of State told me on that occasion that there was no full-blown retention crisis in the Defence Forces and that everything would be all right.  He was like the ostrich with his head in the sand, hoping everything would sort itself out.  It has not.</p> <p> I raised the retention crisis again in November and the Minister of State again assured me he was confident that recruitment would get us to the White Paper target of 9,500 serving members.  Since then, we are further away from that target.  I ask the Minister of State not to pretend any longer that this is a problem on which he has a grip.  He could not be accused of misleading the House because no one here would believe him.  His ineptitude, disinterest and inability to resolve this is clear for us all to see.  The Minister of State is the silent lamb at the Cabinet table.</p> <p> We know the crisis we are in.  The fact is that 3,200 personnel left the Defence Forces between 2014 and 2018, many of whom were highly skilled and well trained at great expense to the State.  A total of 82% of those were premature voluntary retirements.  There were 327 discharges in the first five months of 2019, including 71 in May.  Of that 71, 14 were recruits.  Eighty-six were discharged in April.  This is an unprecedented, tsunami-like exodus under the watch of the Minister of State.  Turnover is at 9% overall and 14% for the Naval Service, a figure that the Chief of Staff has said is crippling as we are now struggling to fill key leadership positions and overseas missions are at risk.  This is also having a knock-on impact as members must double and treble-job so many areas of the Defence Forces can just manage.  They are at breaking point.</p> <p> It is beyond time the Minister of State actually listened to the concerns of the men and women of our Defence Forces because right now they are serving on their goodwill, devout loyalty and dedication to the Irish State.  These are the people who go out in the snow and clear the roads so the country does not come to a standstill in bad weather and so garda&iacute;, ambulances and the fire service can attend the scenes of emergencies.  Members of the Defence Forces stood in fields and slept in ditches last week so the visit of the US President passed off without a hitch, during which time garda&iacute; earned many multiples of the earnings of Defence Forces members, despite standing beside each other in the wind and rain in the service of the State.  These members are not even getting minimum wage when the duty allowance is calculated for the work they do.  Does that sound fair to Deputy Kehoe as the Minister of State at the Department of Defence?</p> <p> The Taoiseach says he represents the people who get up early in the morning.  The Defence Forces have not gone to bed.  What do they get?  Does the Minister of State highlight the fact that our Defence Forces are disintegrating at home when he is swanning around the world and using them as a prop such as he did during his visit to New York when he was trying to secure a place on the UN Security Council?  The members of the Defence Forces feel demoralised by those international actions when they are being treated with such disrespect at home.  I suspect the Minister of State does not highlight that fact abroad.</p> <p> The Minister of State should not take my word for it.  He should listen to the concerns of the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association, PDFORRA, the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers, RACO, and the wives and partners of Defence Forces members, some of whom are here today and who have been tireless in highlighting these problems for years now.  The Minister of State should look at the University of Limerick climate survey where members of the Defence Forces have told of the chaos across the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps.  He should listen to Cathal Berry who left the Defence Forces after a stellar career because he felt he could not just stand by and watch helplessly as it all fell apart around him.  If the Minister of State does not want to listen to any of them, he should listen to his own Chief of Staff, Vice Admiral Mark Mellett, who, in an unprecedented move for someone in his position, felt the need to intervene in the Public Service Pay Commission and make a personal plea for his staff to be treated with the respect and dignity they deserve.</p> <p> Of course, the entire Public Service Pay Commission process has serious question marks over it.  This was supposed to be an independent process.  On 3 October, the Minister of State told me a joint submission had gone from his Department and the Defence Forces military management to the pay commission, but he then had to correct the record on 17 January this year, again in oral response to a question, to reveal that the submission had not in fact gone to the pay commission but was being held by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  This is deeply troubling.  There has been a clear contamination, dilution and butchering of the recommendations from military management.  The entire process and independence of the commission has been compromised as a result.  The leaked snippets I have seen are miserly, Scrooge-like increases in allowances that will be insufficient to stem the flow.  In fact, they will prompt an unprecedented exodus from the Defence Forces, an Armageddon scenario whereby many decent, hard-working men and women are forced to the cliff edge.  It is not an exaggeration to say the future of the Defence Forces is at stake here.</p> <p> The obvious move to rectify this situation is staring the Minister of State in the face: the restoration and increase of military allowances to pre-financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, levels as was in the submission from military management.  The Minister of State and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, says we cannot afford such measures.  I say to the Minister of State we cannot afford not to have Defence Forces.  I say to the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, that he is penny wise and pound foolish.  Prudent Paschal is now Dangerous Donohoe.  He revealed his true colours yesterday when he tried to blame the men and women of the Defence Forces - literally the worst paid public sector workers - for his own failure to manage public expenditure properly.  Fianna F&aacute;il did not write the report of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, which outlined the Minister's mismanagement of the public finances.  He needs to be reminded that it was not the Defence Forces that overspent by &euro;2 billion on the national children's hospital, he did.  It was not the Defence Forces who lost &euro;3 billion on a national broadband network the State will not even own, it was him.  It was not the Defence Forces that blew the health budget or lost control of agency spending year on year.  It was not the Defence Forces that proposed a &euro;3 billion tax cut in a reckless electioneering exercise.  This was a shameful attack by a clearly rattled Minister who tried to use the lowest paid in the public sector as a political pawn to attack Fianna F&aacute;il.  He should be ashamed and embarrassed.  He repays the unwavering loyalty and absolute commitment of the Defence Forces with the exploitation of the worst paid workers in the public sector.</p> <p> However, the increase in allowances can be managed within Vote 36.  Military management calculated that the allowances can be done at a cost of less than &euro;30 million per year, which is less than the amount the Minister returns to the Exchequer every year as he outlined in a reply to a parliamentary question I asked.</p> <p> Today's motion also includes a number of other cost-neutral measures which would go a long way to securing the future of the Defence Forces.  We need a review of the Permanent Defence Force and the creation of an independent pay review body, as exists in the UK.  We are calling for much-needed military expertise in the Department of Defence with greater military management input into spending and decision-making.  We are calling for a specific retention policy so we keep our highly skilled people and stop losing vital corporate knowledge.  Introducing a superannuation pension scheme for post-2013 entrants would also ensure personnel would not feel the need to walk away to ensure they have a pension.  There is also the working time directive.  We need a root-and-branch review of defence policy, the Defence Forces and the Department of Defence.  We should be immensely proud of the work the Defence Forces do and their peacekeeping duties abroad.  We should honour their commitment and dedication with loyalty.  The Minister of State should stop disrespecting them, get his head out of the sand, stand up and fight for our serving men and women, and show them a shred of the loyalty they show us every single day.</p></speech>

It is not news to the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, that he is not flavour of the month with the Defence Forces and has not been for quite some time.  Instead of leading his Department, he is being led.  He has consistently failed to display a vision for the Defence Forces.  The Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, is the Minister for Defence, but he has given all duties in that regard to the Minister of State.  However, the Taoiseach has no problem paying lip service to the Defence Forces, hopping in and out of Army helicopters or flanking himself with armed officers when there is a good photo op and it helps with the spin unit he likes to progress.  How bad does it need to get before the Minister of State and the Government do something to rectify the crisis in the Defence Forces?</p><p>The damage that has been caused to the Defence Forces by the Government and its predecessor will take the best part of ten years to fix and reverse, as it is so widespread.  The loss of the corporate knowledge held by highly skilled trained personnel who have left the Defence Forces <i>en masse </i>cannot be replaced overnight.  In fact, it will take years to so do.  That means that the Defence Forces are struggling to maintain basic duties, man our naval ships and fly our aeroplanes, very basic tasks that our citizens assume are being carried out.  The Representative Association of Commissioned Officers, RACO, the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association, PDFORRA, the Reserve Defence Force Representative Association, RDFRA, and the wives and partners of members of the Defence Forces have been telling the Government the same story consistently for years.  In the first four months of this year, 256 personnel walked away from our Defence Forces because they had no other choice.  The Minister of State has been in his brief for long enough to understand that these people cannot simply be replaced.  It takes years to grow the corporate knowledge and military skills to the level we require.</p><p>When the Minister of State is asked about the Government's retention policy, he reverts to talking about recruitment simply because it does not have one.  Recruitment and retention go hand in hand, but one does not replace the other.  They are distinct and separate policies.  There is very little point in taking people in one door and having them walk out another just as fast, but that is what is happening.  We are losing recruits who cannot stand to stay in the organisation for more than a year or two because the pay and conditions are so poor.  As Deputy Jack Chambers stated, almost 3,500 members left the Defence Forces in four years, which is a staggering number for the Minister of State to mull over.  His Department handed back almost &euro;27 million, but he never explained how that can happen.  Surely, that money should be redirected to retention policies.  </p><p>I wish to briefly touch on the Reserve Defence Force.  I spent 13 years growing up in that organisation and that has stood to me.  The Government has destroyed the organisation.  The Minister of State asked me for ideas and solutions three years ago when I was Fianna F&aacute;il spokesperson on defence.  I offered them to him, but none were acted upon.  Other Members also offered solutions to the Government but it has acted on none of them.  The organisation is on its knees.  It is upsetting to think that it may never recover.  The Minister of State has presided over that decline.</p></speech>

They often come to my office seeking help with homelessness and rent, fuel and child poverty.  I recently met a number of Defence Forces families who are struggling to meet the costs of paying for their children to sit leaving certificate and junior certificate examinations.  That is very sad.  I have been in touch with Sarah Walsh of the Wives and Partners of the Defence Forces, WPDF, many times since the group was established in November 2016.  I welcome her and her colleague, Sharon Dunne, to the Public Gallery.  In her words, the Defence Forces are suffering from political neglect and institutional indifference.  The members of the WPDF deserve a lot of credit for highlighting the enormous personal sacrifices made by men and women serving in the Defence Forces and their families, such as the impact on family life of the prolonged periods spent away from home, the daily struggles experienced by families as a result of the paltry wages which leave them unable to meet their basic needs, and issues with training exercises and overseas missions.</p>  <p>  I recently held a public meeting in regard to the Defence Forces in Newbridge and another in Portarlington.  I welcomed the opportunity to hear first-hand experiences from parents and partners of those working with the Defence Forces.  Frustration, anger and helplessness were expressed by the vast majority of those in attendance.  It made for very sobering listening.  One word completely absent from the meetings was "hope".  I have rarely attended or hosted a public meeting where there was no hope.  People spoke of their pride in several generations of their family having served, but stated they would not recommend or support a decision by their son or daughter to join the Defence Forces.  </p>  <p>  The mental health issues, increased stress and low morale being experienced by our soldiers, sailors and aircrew are of significant concern.  This morning, I heard about a class of aircraft technicians who have been sitting in Baldonnel with no one to train them.   Some of them started first year three years ago and are still in first year because there is nobody to train them.  Many do not turn up in the mornings and one cannot blame them for that.</p>  <p>  Retired Army Commandant Cathal Berry sent me an adjudication report from September 2010 regarding the Army Ranger Wing.  It was forced into arbitration in 2010.  There was a breakthrough on an allowance, but it has still not been implemented nine years later.  Today, the Taoiseach stated that he wishes to send the Army Ranger Wing to Mali, which is obviously a high-risk mission.  The Minister of State and the Taoiseach are asking a lot of those soldiers in light of money having been owed to them for more than nine years.</p></speech>

It is clear that there is a significant issue in our Defence Forces, with morale being particularly low, as evidenced by the reduction of numbers.  Retention is a big issue.  The amendment tabled by the Government is appalling.  It clearly identifies the challenges faced in regard to recruitment and retention in the Defence Forces, but nowhere in the amendment does the Government deal with the specific issues causing the retention problem.  It is not just about the numbers in the Defence Forces; the capacity of the Defence Forces is being undermined.  Technical personnel in the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps are being adversely affected.  The Government did not address the issue of the removal of the supplementary pension.  We have not dealt with issues around restoring defence allowance.  These are the core issues affecting members of the Defence Forces, but they are not addressed in the Government's amendment to the motion.</p>  <p>  We need the Minister of State to act as a champion for the Defence Forces, not just a manager.  We need him to go to the Cabinet and bang the table.  The members of the Defence Forces, who are held in high regard by the public, are being let down by the Government.  The Minister of State has an opportunity to champion their cause.  That is what needs to come from this debate.</p></speech>

One story of particular significance related to overtime pay.  Some sections got &euro;40 per hour, while others only got &euro;20.  This situation is much like that in the health service: the Government is relying on the goodwill of professionals in order to avoid its duty of care to personnel.  The Government is confident that these people will not neglect their duty and is capitalising on that and, in my opinion, taking advantage of them.  This morning, I spoke to a member of the Reserve Defence Force from west Cork who is currently on duty.  He confirmed that in his normal job he takes home approximately &euro;600 after tax for working eight hours a day.  A working week in the force will see him bring home &euro;250 based on a 15-hour day.  Such differences cannot be justified.  My colleagues spoke of morale being at an all-time low.  Is it any wonder that is so, given the situation outlined by that member?  Of significance is the fact that that example pertains to a reservist.  What is to be said for members of the Permanent Defence Force?  What initiative is there to ensure we have fully functioning Defence Forces?  What initiative is there to attract new recruits?  What sense of purpose or place can be derived from a working environment such as this?  Many members of the Defence Forces are decorated personnel.  I ask the Minister of State to, please, treat them accordingly.</p></speech>

and substitute the following:&ldquo;recognises:<blockquote>&mdash; that the Irish people shares its great pride in our Defence Forces and the contribution made by the Permanent Defence Forces (PDF) and the Reserve Defence Forces (RDF);<br /><br />&mdash; Ireland&rsquo;s long and well respected history of participating in overseas missions under United Nations (UN) mandates and acknowledges that the Defence Forces have played a vital role as peacekeepers all over the world, in Europe, Africa and the Middle East in UN and UN-mandated peace support missions and, today, some 673 members of the PDF are serving overseas in various parts of the world;<br /><br />&mdash; those members of the Defence Forces who have made the ultimate sacrifice in the service of the State, including those on overseas peacekeeping missions;<br /><br />&mdash; the dedication and professionalism of the Defence Forces;<br /><br />&mdash; the ongoing implementation of the Government&rsquo;s White Paper on Defence; and<br /><br />&mdash; the challenges that are faced in relation to recruitment and retention in the Defence Forces;</blockquote>notes:<blockquote>&mdash; that the Department of Defence has civil and military branches, consistent with its constitutional and statutory mandate;<br /><br />&mdash; that the Secretary General heads the civil element while the Chief of Staff heads the military element of the Department of Defence;<br /><br />&mdash; that both civil and military elements provide supports to the Minister for Defence, and that the Chief of Staff has direct and independent access to the Minister for the provision of military advice;<br /><br />&mdash; that ultimately command and management of the Defence Forces is by the Minister for Defence, on behalf of the Government, ensuring appropriate oversight of defence and of the Defence Forces;<br /><br />&mdash; the importance of the White Paper on Defence, which was prepared by joint civil and military steering and working groups, in providing a defence policy in keeping with Ireland&rsquo;s defence requirements for the period to 2025 and comprehending a developmental and strategic approach to defence provision, including the ongoing modernisation of defence equipment;<br /><br />&mdash; that the finalisation of the White Paper in June 2015 included, at the arrangement of the Minister for Defence, D&aacute;il statements which provided members with an opportunity for final inputs and that, furthermore, there has been engagement with the relevant Oireachtas Joint Committee on any or all aspects of the White Paper as might be desired by Committee members;<br /><br />&mdash; that a key feature of the White Paper is the provision for future-proofing of policy and capabilities through a new process of fixed cycle defence reviews with a Strategic Defence Review to commence in early 2021, while a White Paper Update commenced last year and is being overseen by a joint civil-military steering group;<br /><br />&mdash; that the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the Defence Forces capability is evidenced through a 2019 provision for gross expenditure of some &euro;1,007 million, an increase of &euro;60 million or 6.4 per cent over 2018, while the capital allocation has increased to &euro;106 million, an increase of 38 per cent on the 2018 allocation;<br /><br />&mdash; that a significant portion of the Defence budget is delegated to the Chief of Staff, to facilitate the exercise of his functions;<br /><br />&mdash; that all major investment decisions are made via joint civil-military work and approved through a joint, co-chaired, civil-military forum and that this collaborative civil-military approach operates successfully within the Department of Defence;<br /><br />&mdash; that this investment will see the replacement and upgrade of significant equipment platforms over the life-time of the White Paper, including an upgrade of the Army&rsquo;s fleet of armoured personnel carriers (APCs), enhancement of the capabilities of the Army Ranger Wing, replacement of the Air Corps&rsquo; Cessna fleet, CASA Maritime Patrol Aircraft and the Naval Service&rsquo;s flagship L&Eacute; Eithne;<br /><br />&mdash; that there is a sustained programme of investment in barracks infrastructure to improve accommodation and other facilities across the country;<br /><br />&mdash; the range of actions in place for the development of Defence Forces human resources, training, education, family friendly and a range of other supports;<br /><br />&mdash; the development of flexible and adaptive military capabilities as a pragmatic approach to dealing with future uncertainty and the roles assigned, and that capability commitments outlined in the White Paper include maintenance of a PDF establishment of at least 9,500 personnel;<br /><br />&mdash; that specific shortages in specialist areas are being addressed and that work is underway aimed at addressing these particular challenges;<br /><br />&mdash; the efforts to accelerate the rate of recruitment to the RDF within means and resources;<br /><br />&mdash; that in relation to the Working Time Directive, legislation is currently being considered by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and civil-military work is underway to achieve a graduated solution which respects the unique operational requirements of a military force; and<br /><br />&mdash; that membership of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU) by Defence Forces representative associations, as recommended in a recent review of the Defence Forces C&amp;amp;A Scheme, is now under consideration, and that the discussion with ICTU is considering feasibility, taking account of the need to recognise the prohibition on the right to strike, the tasks that Government may require the Defence Forces to undertake, and the necessity that command and control arrangements and military discipline are un-impinged; and</blockquote>further notes that:<blockquote>&mdash; the focus of pay increases under the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 has been those on lower pay and that by the end of the current Agreement, the pay scales of all public servants (including members of the Defence Forces), earning under &euro;70,000 per annum, will be restored to pre-Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest levels;<br /><br />&mdash; public sector pay policy is determined centrally by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, having regard to public sector pay agreements, and that independent sectoral pay determination bodies, such as one for the Defence Forces, is not consistent with this approach;<br /><br />&mdash; public service pension provisions are laid down in statute and apply across the public service; and<br /><br />&mdash; the Public Service Pay Commission has examined recruitment and retention issues in the defence sector and that its report will be considered by Government and form the basis of engagement with parties to the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020.</blockquote></blockquote><p>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on defence matters.  This motion has given the Government and the House a valuable opportunity to recognise the range and quality of outputs from the defence sector.  It also gives me an opportunity to outline what we are achieving in defence and ongoing efforts to address the current recruitment and retention challenges.  Let me be very clear that I have no difficulty in acknowledging that we face some HR challenges.</p></speech>

Both civil and military elements provide supports to me, as Minister of State, in the management of defence.  I wish to make it clear that the Chief of Staff, the general staff and the generals commanding the various brigades and formations all have direct and independent access to me and can and do provide whatever advice they wish to provide directly to me.  I listen to and respect all the advice, whether civil or military.  Like all Ministers responsible to this House, the way in which I use this advice rests with me and I must balance it with a wider governmental and policy perspective.</p>  <p>  A further dimension which distinguishes defence is its international footprint.  Currently some 673 members of the Irish Defence Forces are deployed overseas on peace support operations.  These missions arise and are sustained by policy work led by my Department and the contribution of the individual members of the Defence Forces who serve overseas, often on difficult and dangerous missions.  I have proposed in the counter-motion that the House again acknowledge the ultimate sacrifice made by members of the Defence Forces in the service of their country overseas.</p>  <p>  Regarding White Paper implementation, a total of 95 separate projects are to be completed over a ten-year period.  This is being managed by a joint civil-military team.  Every project is led jointly by senior civil and military personnel working together.  I am pleased to report that, to date, 42 projects have been initiated and 14 have closed, with others expected to close shortly.  These are all sizeable projects in their own right and cover the very issues which are of concern, including human resources, equipment, barracks development and much more.</p>  <p>  As for funding for defence, the White Paper emphasises the Government's commitment to necessary resourcing of defence into the future.  It highlights the connectivity between defence provision and the proper functioning of civil society.  The two defence Votes, Vote 35 - Army Pensions and Vote 36 - Defence, provide in 2019 for gross expenditure of just over &euro;1 billion, an increase of &euro;60 million, or 6.4%, over 2018 expenditure.</p>  <p>  I wish to draw attention to the fact that the motion includes a false claim that there was an underspend of over &euro;92 million on defence from 2014 to 2018.  The true position is that underspends, where they arose, largely due to reduced strength levels, have primarily been redirected elsewhere into the defence Votes, for example for equipment procurement via Vote 36 or to meet shortfalls in the Army Pensions Vote.  These reallocations have been the subject of approval by this House year on year.  The suggestion that any underspend could be allocated to increasing the pay of members of the Permanent Defence Force is simply incorrect.</p></speech>

The group meets almost monthly to progress equipment procurement and infrastructural development priorities.</p>  <p>  I recognise fully the importance of our Defence Forces personnel and have pursued, and will continue to pursue, an unrelenting approach to ensure that the Defence Forces have the means to provide the capabilities required by Government.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to reaching a strength of 9,500 personnel and recognises that achieving this strength is a key challenge for the Defence Forces.  The difference between the strength target of 9,500 and the actual strength has widened since 2012.  There are two primary dimensions to this: first, departures and turnover of personnel and, second, recruitment.</p>  <p>  The majority of personnel, around 80%, depart prior to the mandatory retirement age for a variety of reasons at a time of their own choosing.  The nature of military service requirements leads to a higher level of turnover compared to civilian organisations.  The turnover level in 2018 was 8.1% but this was for all departures and includes trainees.  The highest turnover since 2002, 8.6%, was seen in 2012.  This turnover is not out of line with other military organisations internationally, some of which have higher turnover levels.</p>  <p>  It is important to remember, however, that the current challenges, particularly in the Air Corps, in filling certain posts arise due to very specific circumstances.  As with many other areas of the public service, challenges in the recruitment and retention of personnel have arisen in a buoyant economy, with many personnel or potential personnel, including pilots, air traffic control staff and Naval Service technicians, having scarce and highly marketable skills.  Significant work is under way by civil and military personnel of my Department aimed at addressing these challenges.</p>  <p>  Similar to other areas in the public service, the pay of the Permanent Defence Force was reduced during the financial crisis.  I recognise the personal impact this had on all public servants, including members of the Defence Forces.  The reduction in pay was on a graduated basis, with increased rates of deductions for those on higher earnings.  These are being unwound in a fair and sustainable manner.  Meanwhile, the Public Service Pay Commission has examined recruitment and retention issues in the defence sector and the Government will decide the approach to this.</p>  <p>  The Defence Forces representative associations' membership of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions was considered in a recent review of the Defence Forces conciliation and arbitration scheme.  There appear to be different views among the associations and perhaps many of their members.  I reassure Deputies that the discussion with ICTU is considering feasibility, taking into account that members of the Defence Forces do not have the right to strike, the tasks that Government may require the Defence Forces to undertake and the necessity that command and control arrangements and military discipline are not impinged.</p>  <p>  I have addressed many of the calls made in the Opposition motion and, in presenting this counter-motion, I have clarified some of the misunderstandings and inaccuracies.  My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, will pick up on some of the other aspects of the motion.  I acknowledge there are challenges facing the Defence Forces and there is no quick fix to most of these issues.  However, my priority as Minister of State remains the safe conduct of operations and training by personnel and to maintain our focus on the White Paper.  The White Paper is a settled policy and the Government will not be diverted by any other agenda.  I look forward to listening to the rest of the debate.</p>  <p>  Deputy Jack Chambers raised a number of issues and I have just 40 seconds to address one of them.  He spoke about the high numbers of Defence Forces personnel on the working family payment.</p><p>In total, between the Defence Forces and my Department, 124 people are in receipt of the working family payment.</p></speech>

If the Deputy wanted to find out the figure, he should have tabled a parliamentary question to the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.

I welcome the opportunity to speak to the motion and I send the apologies of Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh, who wanted to be here.  Sinn F&eacute;in supports the thrust of the motion but our amendment seeks to strengthen it in some respects, in particular by requiring the Government to bring forward legislation to provide for the implementation of the working time directive within six months.  Sinn F&eacute;in has also produced legislation that would give effect to collective bargaining rights for the members of the Defence Forces.  We are also calling for the full implementation of the D&aacute;il motion on Lariam, which called for Lariam to be prescribed as the anti-malarial drug as a last resort.  A recent reply to a parliamentary question indicates that Lariam is still being prescribed to members of the Defence Forces in Mali as a matter of course.</p>  <p>  As it stands, the Defence Forces have been locked out of public sector pay talks and are prohibited from taking industrial action by legislation.  Their voices and concerns have been taken from them, which raises major concerns.  I listened to the Minister of State's remarks and although he covered many topics, there was no mention of the welfare or well-being of our Defence Forces personnel or their families, particularly their partners.</p></speech>

This is a very important matter.  The welfare of personnel and their families affects the morale of every serving member but this goes further, as we must not forget members who have retired or who were discharged on medical grounds.  I can delve into this a little deeper.  In our amendment we call for the restoration of military allowances to the levels seen before the financial emergency measures in the public interest legislation, especially as the Minister of State indicated there was no underspend between 2014 and 2018.  However, on 24 May 2017, he told the Seanad that money was returned and not reallocated.  We can debate the matter afterwards if he wishes.</p>  <p>  I do not have to go through all the different parts of our amendment but I will outline why the amendment should be supported.  The Defence Forces have been without an in-house psychiatrist since May 2018 due to a failure to replace a retiring clinician.  The clinician had been employed on a temporary basis since 2011 but apparently not enough has been done to work out the position.  We have been left with unavoidable burnout, serious concerns for governance and the ability to manage risk and ensure the well-being of personnel.  A recent survey illustrates the mental health difficulties in the Defence Forces that have led to increased levels of stress and very low morale among Permanent Defence Force personnel.</p>  <p>  An interesting survey was conducted by the University of Limerick in 2017.  Members of the Defence Forces described an organisation that was in crisis, coping with poor pay, declining training standards and even more people seeking to leave.  In an unprecedented piece of research, 600 serving personnel spoke anonymously in focus groups to researchers from the university.  The research was commissioned by the Defence Forces and the findings make grim reading.  One person stated that living quarters for young recruits are best described as "Hotel Rwanda".  They are not my words but the words in the research.  In the survey there was almost unanimous agreement across all ranks and age profiles that the Defence Forces, comprising the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps, are at risk.  Some officers in the Air Corps were told how they were kept awake at night because of concerns about whether work carried out on an aircraft left them safe to fly because so many experienced personnel had left the service.  Others have said that naval personnel on Mediterranean Sea rescue missions returned traumatised and applied for leave.  Some chaplains said they had given up encouraging people to stay in the uniform.</p>  <p>  I have spoken to a number of members within the Defence Forces and they have all heard how we are taking stuff into account and everything is under consideration.  They asked me to convey to the Minister of State that they are fed up of words and they want action.  These again are not my words but the words of the people I represent in my area.  The 2017 report indicates that personnel describe how they and their colleagues almost routinely hide signs of stress.  Instead of going to the medical services provided, these personnel sought credit union loans for private mental health treatment because they would suffer if people in the Defence Forces knew they had mental health issues.  I am well aware of people who were probably never even examined after serving in the Lebanon many years ago and who are now suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.  A television documentary not too long ago documented the homeless ex-members of the Defence Forces.  That is a sad reflection on those Defence Forces in our country.</p>  <p>  I mentioned that the Defence Forces have been without an in-house psychiatrist since 2018 and the post still has not been filled.  There does not appear to be any progress in any part of this.  I again stress the very worrying aspect of mental health well-being, as I have been informed that it is now at an all-time low in the forces.  I have also been informed that we are not just talking about the 8,500 serving members but also their immediate families.  The direct hit from this problem could affect up to 20,000 people.  I have been told that child, food and housing poverty is rife in the Defence Forces because of low wages.  Childcare is too expensive for members on duty, either on exercise or at sea, and most of them have no family support because their barracks or bases are not close to their families.  I completely understand the anger and concern of these members.  Serving members have said to me that we are living in 2019 and not 1960.</p>  <p>  My latest figures indicate more than 70 men and women are sleeping on our ships because they cannot afford to rent privately.  We also have reports of people sleeping in cars.  I am aware of that because I stood on picket lines on the far side of the naval base at Haulbowline, where I saw serving members driving out of the base late at night or early in the morning while their buddies parked at the side of the road because they did not have the price of the diesel or petrol to drive back to Wexford or wherever they live.  It is a poor reflection on the Defence Forces.</p>  <p>  These are the experiences of the people we represent.  Another member is quoted as saying the Defence Forces is becoming unfit for purpose through no fault of its own but rather because of the Department of Defence and the Minister of State representing the members.  This is not a personal attack on him, as I am only relaying what I have been told.  There is a bigger picture than just figures and money; there is a human impact.  I have spoken to many people who are currently in the Defence Forces but who feel their hands are tied behind their back.  They want to be proud of the country they serve and the uniforms they wear.  Nevertheless, they feel the Government has let them down and lost pride in its Defence Forces.  Why should these people carry such a heavy burden when they try to do their best and provide for their families and partners?  It is like shovelling snow while it is still snowing because they just cannot get to the end of it.  It is a genuine concern.  These people do not want to walk away from the Defence Forces and they want to work in a job of which they can be proud.  All they want is to be listened to, so let us hear their voices.</p><p>If things were right, they would not have to strike.  I have seen at first hand a young married couple with two young children, and the man is broken.  He does his best to work but he cannot afford to provide for his family.</p> <p> I refer again to the mental health issues, which I discussed with the Minister of State in a Topical Issue debate, and touched on earlier.  Is it not a sad reflection on us when members of any element of our Defence Forces who want to work in it and have pride in the uniform are tongue tied when they come back from overseas duties and cannot ask for help because they could be victimised?  If somebody comes back from overseas duty and mentions anything to do with mental health issues, the possibility of him or her getting a second trip overseas and the ability to earn more money is highly unlikely because the minute any mental illness is mentioned, he or she will not be permitted to hold a gun with live ammunition.  That will curtail any chances they have of going on any overseas duty, peacekeeping or otherwise.</p> <p> I refer to the way people have been silenced and mistreated on the issue of Lariam, which is crazy.  I will relate a true story, which was a reflection on what is happening in the country.  I was leaving Dublin some time last year on a coach heading for Cork.  I spoke to a young fellow who was in training.  He was very excited about it and spoke of the training they were getting at the time.  They were building up to the final day before they could start using live rounds.  He said they were all sitting inside in the mess palling around when one fellow perked up and said he was looking forward to the first day using live ammunition because he was "going to kill every single one of you".  The first reaction of the other people was horror and then shock, and they had to report him regardless of whether he was serious.</p> <p> There are major implications in terms of mental health issues in the Defence Forces.  I ask the Minister of State to take an empathetic view and treat all these people as human and give them the respect and the voice they need.  I ask all Members to support our amendment because we want to strengthen the motion.  Whatever is put to the House this evening, let us strengthen it.  Let us start doing the right thing for the Defence Forces, the country and the members' wives, partners and children.</p></speech>

There is significant pride in the Defence Forces among the public and its members.  One of the items that features prominently in museums up and down the country is the blue hats from peacekeeping missions.  I refer to the many peacekeeping missions members have been on and how well the Defence Forces represented Ireland and how well regarded they are internationally, which rightly is a source of significant pride.  It is also a source of significant pride for the members of the Defence Forces and for their families.  I have the honour of representing a constituency which is home to many members of the Defence Forces between Haulbowline and Collins Barracks from where many friends of mine were proud to pass out in recent years.</p>  <p>  There is major frustration among members.  Many of the people I grew up with spent a few years in the Defence Forces and then felt they had reached a dead end and that they could not go on.  It was not possible on the income they were on and it was not worth the effort they had expended.  They did not feel they were being properly respected.  I refer to people who, on the one hand, could serve their country internationally or be inspected by the likes of the Minister of State or senior officers and then within weeks be before me or somebody else in a clinic trying to figure out how they would pay the bills and keep the roof over their heads.  That is the reality for many of them.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State has instanced previously that the numbers on working family payment might be small.  The numbers may be small but it is a very real challenge.  I have met at least one of those people.  According to the Defence Forces representative organisations, approximately 1,700 Defence Force personnel could be eligible for the working family payment, which equates to 20% of the force.  The Minister of State said there has been a turnover of approximately 3,500 in four years.  That is significant and reflects the fact that people are frustrated.</p>  <p>  In many respects these members are an easy target, both for Government and, frankly, elements of the media.  Some of the comments Ivan Yates made are a disgrace but that is a matter for another day.  They are an easy target for the Government because of the legislation that governs them, which ensures they are locked out.  They do not have that voice.  They rely on retired servicemen and women, their families and those organisations that have done a fantastic job.  The legislation that governs them has restricted them.  They are an easy target and their voices have not been heard by the Minister of State.</p>  <p>  The leaks from the report of the Public Sector Pay Commission are not encouraging.  It is two years in the making.  Opposition spokespersons should be briefed on it.  We need to go much further than what the leaks are indicating.  People deserve much more.  A key element of our amendment is to seek the implementation of the working time directive within a six-month period.</p>  <p>  These people have served their country with great pride.  They are the source of great pride among their families and their communities but they are frustrated and angry.  Many of them want to remain in the Defence Forces but they do not see a future for themselves and their families because of the current position.  It is up to the Minister of State, the Defence Forces and the Department to fix that to ensure that the many good people who have left the Defence Forces in recent times are retained.</p></speech>

The party supports the motion and I hope Deputy Chambers will recognise our amendment as a genuine attempt to strengthen it.  Our amendment aims to bring what is recognised at the start of the original motion and turn them into actions, particularly in the area of mental health.  The original motion recognises the results of recent surveys of members who are experiencing mental health difficulties, increased stress and low morale.</p>  <p>  It is 13 months since the in-house physician in the Defence Forces retired and a replacement has not been appointed.  Our amendment calls for the establishment of a dedicated body within the Permanent Defence Force to monitor and mediate the long-term care needs - physical, mental and material - of current and former members, in particular those who have returned from service abroad.  We seek a commitment by the Government to fast-track the recruitment of psychiatrists to safeguard the mental health of current and former members of the Defence Forces.  We also seek an urgent review of conditions for female personnel within the Defence Forces to explain past recruitment failures and a recommitment to increasing gender balance in the Defence Forces.</p>  <p>  This Government is now into its fourth year and it is a shocking indictment of it that no progress has been made on improving and investing in our Defence Forces.  A constituent wrote to me this week who said that the ever-increasing crisis in our Defence Forces has worsened in the past year.  No one can disagree with that view.</p>  <p>  The practical measures we have been calling for during this time regarding the implementation of the working time directive, affiliation with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, increases in pay, vital allowances and proper investment in barracks, equipment, facilities and amenities have all fallen on deaf ears.</p>  <p>  The Government is uncaring about the plight of our Defence Forces personnel.  I do not refer to the Minister of State personally but I believe the Defence Forces are held in low regard by the Cabinet generally.  As Labour Party Members have stated numerous times in the House, many serving members are on shockingly low wages.  Last year, it emerged that 1,760 Defence Forces members are on the working family payment but I acknowledge the Minister's challenge regarding that figure and will re-check it.  Even if his figures are correct, and I suspect they are, given that he checked them, it is far too many.  Nobody in our Defence Forces should be on the working family payment.</p>  <p>  A greater gender balance is needed within our Defence Forces.  Currently, there are just 596 women among a total of 8,847 personnel.</p><p>Shockingly, just 33 women have joined and remained in the Defence Forces in the past four years.  This is unacceptable and it highlights the general problems with regard to retention within the force.  Both men and women are leaving for better-paid positions in the private sector, with better conditions.  Members of the Defence Forces are the lowest-paid workers in the public service and this must change.  The conditions of work are unacceptable also.  </p> <p> Members of the Defence Forces have been on call for 72 hours at a time, which is a practice outside the scope of the working time directive.  Other defence forces in Europe, such as those in Sweden and Germany, have adapted their practices to meet the requirements of the working time directive.  As an example, the hours worked by officers are assessed over a three-month period and if they have exceeded the weekly 48-hour limit, they get compensatory time off at the end of the three months.  It is not unreasonable to expect our own Defence Forces to be treated the same.  The unorthodox nature of Defence Forces work does not make it incompatible to adhere to the working time directive.  There is no excuse in hiding behind the nature of the work.  It is dishonest.  </p> <p> Real political will is required to support our Defence Forces and implement the working time directive.  The Labour Party fully supports the need for a proper and robust retention policy for the Defence Forces.  The Government has ploughed money into recruitment drives but they are worth very little if we are losing members prematurely at the other end.  Members of RACO told the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Defence two weeks ago that more than 3,200 members have left the forces from 2014 to 2018.  Some 82% of these are being classed as early voluntary retirements.  These are members who are choosing to leave.  In real terms, we had a net loss of 120 members from our Defence Forces in 2018 when the figures are matched against new recruits.  Our Permanent Defence Force can no longer remain a bucket with a hole in it but with 87% of the Defence Forces earning below the average public sector wage, there is no sign that this exodus will halt any time soon.  As the general secretary of RACO, Commandant Conor King noted, &ldquo;The Defence Forces is currently surviving on the goodwill [and loyalty] of its personnel, that willingness to go over and above the call of duty to achieve the mission or complete the task&rdquo;.  This is admirable but it is grossly unfair and is unsustainable.  </p> <p> The Government is not meeting its own promise to keep Defence Forces personnel above 9,500 and recent figures indicate that numbers are less than 8,500.  With more members leaving than are being recruited, the Government will be moving further away from its own promised target rather than closing the gap.  </p> <p> Our hope is that this motion will be passed as amended by ourselves and others.  We know the unfortunate history of Opposition motions which are passed in this D&aacute;il.  They disappear into a black hole, never again to see the light of day.  That cannot happen with this motion; the Minister of State cannot let it happen.  He cannot leave our Defence Forces to wither and die on the vine through the Government&rsquo;s inaction.  That, however, is exactly what is happening.  </p> <p> What will be the legacy of this Government on defence?  It will be a force that is diminished, demoralised and disrespected.  It will be a force that has been ground to its knees with so many of its members in receipt of the working family payment.  I respect the Minister of State challenging the figure of 1,700 who are in receipt of that payment but no amount of spin can deny these facts.  </p> <p> The motion is a call to action across all levels of the Defence Forces.  Through the lack of any meaningful action, we have members struggling with their mental health and high levels of stress.  We need to get the basics right.  Fix the pay and conditions and put in place, as a matter of urgency, proper supports for the mental, physical and emotional health of our Defence Force members.  </p> <p> In the opening section of his amendment, the Minister of State recognises everything we all recognise in our Defence Forces, that is, the efforts they put in, their commitment to the cause and so on.  Everyone in this House agrees on that but what happens after that?  Members of the Defence Forces hear the Minister of State and Members saying that but then realise the circumstances they are in and the major gap between the rhetoric of what Members and the Government say in here about how the Defence Forces are respected as a body and the way in which they are treated.  That gap must be filled.  If I were a Minister coming into the House, I would acknowledge the points in these motions and the amendments and I would address how we will try to deal with them one by one.  I would not acknowledge and note all the things that I could dig up to note in an alternative motion &ndash; the Minister of State should address the things that are wrong.  He would get greater respect from the people in here and from the Defence Forces themselves if he acknowledged all the things that are wrong and if he said he would get them right and if he gave a timeline for how they would be worked on, one by one.  </p></speech>

There is a crisis of pay, of conditions and of morale in the Defence Forces.  Some 84% of Defence Force personnel earn less than the national average annual earnings.  According to recent reports, 50 personnel were sleeping on ships at Haulbowline.  Could they afford the rents which private landlords were charging down the road?  It seems not.  Did the Department provide an accommodation block for them nearby?  No, it did not.  There is talk that one might be provided, although I suspect personnel will have to wait for that for some time.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State has made play of his challenge to figures that were quoted relating to the number of Defence Force personnel who draw down working family payment because their wages are so low.  I suspect one reason why that figure has reduced is because people have thrown over the job.  They could not afford to stay in the job and were forced to walk away from the service.  Neither have they been replaced.  Nearly three people each day walked away from the Defence Forces during April.  </p>  <p>  The Public Service Pay Commission has made a recommendation.  The Minister of State is aware of its details, as are his Cabinet colleagues.  The Minister of State has not revealed the details of the recommendation to the D&aacute;il.  He and the Government are keeping their cards very close to their chests on this one.  According to press reports, there is a nervousness around Cabinet about the reaction of Defence Forces personnel to these proposals as they stand.  Maybe we will find out the recommendations next week and the Government's remarks on them.  It is the key issue exercising the minds of Defence Forces personnel this week.</p>  <p>  It is rumoured that the Public Service Pay Commission has recommended the restoration of at least some military allowances but the devil will be in the detail.</p><p>Are they to be restored to pre-Haddington Road agreement rates or are they to be restored to the rates in place before the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, legislation?  This is an important point.  Pre-Haddington Road rates go back to 2013 while pre-FEMPI rates go back to 2009.  They should be restored to pre-FEMPI rates dating from before 2009.</p> <p> Is the recommendation for the restoration of some or all allowances?  It should not be for only some allowances but for all allowances because many of the allowances are by no means a king's ransom.  Let us consider the military service allowance and the patrol duty allowance.  If the patrol duty allowance was to be increased by 10%, what would it be?  It would be a little over &euro;5 per day.  After tax, what would that be?  It would be &euro;3 per day.  The figure for the military service allowance would be similar or perhaps even lower.  In any case it is there or thereabouts.  All allowances should be restored to the pre-2009 level.</p> <p> Even if that were done, it would still be inadequate.  The Minister of State knows that, I know it and the House knows it.  This is because the cost of living has increased.  In some respects it has skyrocketed over the course of the past ten years.  This includes the cost of transport for Defence Forces personnel who have to travel long distances to get to work.  In some cases this is because their division has been moved halfway across the country.  The cost of accommodation has skyrocketed.  This has forced personnel to sleep on board the ships in Haulbowline, not to mention the number of people in the services, for which the Minister of State is responsible, who are sleeping on couches or sleeping in cars tonight because they cannot afford more than that.</p> <p> We need restoration of all allowances to pre-2009 levels.  On top of that, there needs to be a significant increase in the rates pay for Defence Forces personnel.  That is the only way in which justice can be delivered for the personnel.  That is the only way the Minister of State can avert the crisis of three people walking away every day.</p> <p> The respect and loyalty protest organised in Cork some weeks back was big.  I attended it.  I expected it to be big but I had not expected it to be as big as it was.  If the Government and the Minister of State do not deliver justice, what size will the respect and loyalty protest be in Galway on 10 August?  I suspect it will be bigger again.</p> <p> The question of associate membership of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions for PDFORRA and RACO has been raised.  That would be a step forward and welcomed by this side of the House, but it would still be less than full trade union membership.  Full trade union membership would allow for the right to strike.  This right has been won by defence forces personnel in other countries.  We would not be the first country in the world to do it and we would not be breaking new ground.  I strongly suspect that if the Minister of State does not move on the issues of pay, conditions and the crisis in morale in the system, then the demand for full trade union rights, including the right to strike, will emerge from the ranks in the period ahead.</p></speech>

There are major issues in the Defence Forces over morale, pay, conditions and retention of personnel.  For far too long the Defence Forces have been forgotten in the public service debate because of their special status.  I consider personnel in the Army and the other Defence Forces to be working class like any other worker.  There would be outrage if any other set of workers, especially those in the public sector, were treated the way they have been treated, especially in the past five or six years.  Some of the conditions they have had to endure have been despicable.</p>  <p>  It is good that the Defence Forces are marching.  Families of the Defence Forces are highlighting the issue.  Deputies are highlighting the issues that the Defence Forces are enduring.  It will be interesting.  People will look at what the Public Service Pay Commission says.  The leaks to date suggest the commission does not go far enough.  One recommendation on which we are all likely to agree is that PDFORRA and RACO will be affiliated to ICTU.  Members of the Defence Forces should have union representation.  Sometimes the issue is that union status is not recognised by the State, preventing them from undertaking collective bargaining for their comrades.  It is important that we have this discussion.  I hope the Public Service Pay Commission will recommend better pay and conditions for those in our Defence Forces.</p></speech>

There is definitely a crisis with pay, wages and conditions within the Defence Forces.  This applies to all aspects of the Defence Forces, including the Army, Naval Service and the Air Corps.  The problem is across the board.  This is a retrograde step and something that needs to be addressed.</p>  <p>  We had a discussion earlier today.  One thing struck me as I listened to the debate on the motion.  We had a discussion about Rockall and the inability of the Naval Service to go there or the lack of willingness of the Government to send the Naval Service there to protect Irish fishermen.  Perhaps it is because the Naval Service cannot actually put any ships to sea because it does not have crew for the ships.  In December, two naval ships could not go to sea because there was no crew for them.  This, in turn, was because of the crisis of staffing within our services.  The pay and conditions that staff have to live with within the Naval Service and the Army have been well highlighted within the House.</p>  <p>  It is interesting to note the response of the Minister of State to the motion.  In one breath he said that there were issues and problems within the service.  However, he went on to say that the turnover level in 2018 was 8.1% but that the figure was for all departures, including trainees.  He said the highest turnover since 2002 was seen in 2012, when the figure was 8.6%.  The Minister of State said this turnover level was not out of line with other military organisations internationally, some of which had higher levels.  The reasoning holds that there must be no problem.  The reality is that there is a problem because the Army cannot keep sufficient numbers and the Naval Service cannot keep sufficient numbers to put ships to sea.  There is a problem across the board and it needs to be addressed.</p>  <p>  How much of this is feeding into the European militarisation agenda that this Government wants to pursue?  The Government seems to be prepared to allow the pay and conditions to deteriorate significantly for our Army and Naval Service personnel.  Then, at some point, the Government will restore them but will insist the restoration will have to be part of the overall military agenda taking place throughout the European Union.  Is that the price we are going to have to pay to ensure our Naval Service and Army personnel are paid properly?  I do not think that price would be worth it.  I do not think our Army personnel would agree with that either.</p></speech>

It highlights how the work, pay and conditions of our Defence Forces have been deteriorating over the years.  We have been warning about this long-standing crisis but it has not improved.</p>  <p>  Our Defence Forces are among the few State organisations that have a track record of which we can be proud.  Sadly, the esteem in which we hold them does not translate into remuneration and work conditions.  The remuneration and work conditions do not suggest that the State actually respects or values the work of our personnel.  According to Central Statistics Office figures, those in the Defence Forces are the lowest paid workers in the public service.  I do not understand why that is the case.  At times they work punishingly long hours in unenviable conditions but they get little in return.</p><p>Deputy Clare Daly highlighted recently that a member of the Defence Forces, who had just returned from deployment in Operation Sophia, worked a 12-hour day at sea, seven days a week, with two or three 24-hour duties thrown in.  He worked approximately 80 hours a week for an extra &euro;125 on top of his basic salary of &euro;435 per week.  That is a total of &euro;560 for a 40-hour week with 40 hours overtime.  It is little wonder that we hear about 50 sailors sleeping on ships in their time off because they cannot afford rents in Cork due to the housing crisis.  Some 85% of our Defence Forces earn less than the average industrial wage, and it seems they do not have much to look forward to from the Public Service Pay Commission, as leaks have suggested that the average soldier could be looking at a 1% pay increase.  As the Minister of State is well aware, turnover inside the organisation is at unsustainable levels, with many experienced and highly trained members leaving on a regular basis.  This is happening while millions of euro are being spent on equipment and this expenditure is set to increase further in the coming years as a result of us joining in participation in permanent structured co-operation, PESCO, which Fianna F&aacute;il unfortunately signed up to as well.</p> <p> The crisis in retention and recruitment has more than just pay at its root.  There have been reports of civilians in the Department of Defence treating the general staff of the Defence Forces with contempt.  There is also a lack of moral justification for some recent deployments, such as Operation Sophia and the operation on the Golan Heights, for example.  In the Golan Heights, our Defence Forces have sat and watched the Israeli Defence Forces give air and artillery support to al-Qaeda forces in Syria, which have caused untold chaos in the region.  They also repeatedly say that the Golan Heights will never be returned, which was the point of that UN mission originally.  The Minister of State has acknowledged that our role in the Mediterranean was, in its latest form, a military mission, and was no longer about search and rescue but about sending desperate people back to the places from which they desperately wanted to escape.  Now we are sending 14 additional Defence Forces personnel to Mali to give support to the French in their neocolonial war to protect uranium, oil, and gold interests in the region.  These are under threat from groups coming down from fighting in the north of the continent and recruiting among the desperately poor in the northern Sahel region.  If we really cared about peace in this region, we would stop extracting revenue from it by being a tax haven for extractive global corporations and we would oppose western intervention wars that are really the source of the Mali conflict.  Likewise, we also would stop Shannon from being used as a US military base to create untold destruction in other countries, which does not make any sense at all.</p> <p> I heard the Minister of State's opening statement.  I also heard the Taoiseach today when he was replying to Deputy Healy and I do not accept their arguments.  They say there is only so much money to go around and while that is true, I am not so old - though God knows I am older than most people in here - that I do not remember when the Minister's party was regarded as the one most prudent with money.  The Taoiseach talked today about the necessity to be prudent with money.  However, this is the same Government that has stood over the national children's hospital.  I have argued in here on eight occasions that the Government could save itself a minimum of half a billion euro by going back to the drawing board, renegotiating the contract and changing the form of contract.  The Government does not even know where it is going to end up at the moment or how much it is going to cost because the contract is wrong.  It is wrong and the Government has the option of redoing it.  The Government is wasting all that money but it does not want to give members of the Defence Forces a proper wage.  It does not make any sense, and it does not add up.  I am not even talking about the &euro;3 billion for broadband or what is going on in NAMA.  No-one wants to know about NAMA, but it has cost this State about &euro;20 billion.  Everyone says that it will go away in time and that it is history now but the amount of money that has been wasted by the Government is frightening.  We are expecting the Defence Forces to work for less than the rest of us.  How many people who work for the State in this country are getting as little as members of the Defence Forces?  The Minister of State can defend what the Government is doing until the cows come home but no-one is explaining to me why members of the Defence Forces are paid less than everybody else.  It does not make any sense.  We all say we are proud of them, that we all think they do wonderful work and are a great credit to the country and then we pay them the least.  Where is the explanation for that, because I still am not hearing it?</p></speech>

There is clearly a massive disconnect between the Government's view that it is doing everything it can to support our armed forces and the statements made by senior Army personnel that morale is on the floor.  Any of us worth our salt, the Minister of State included as he must be in touch with them and their families in his area, know that morale is on the floor and even below that.  There are serious questions to be asked here in respect of the capacity of the State as an employer.  We see the clear inability of the State to either recruit or retain staff in key public service role positions right across the board.  There is an abject failure here.  I support the measures called for in this motion, particularly the restoration of the military allowance to pre-financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, levels, especially in view of the underspend from 2014 to 2018.  I also support the restoration of the supplementary pension for post-2013 entrants and the need to conduct a review of the PDF organisation to provide for a training and overseas establishment, thereby bringing PDF personnel numbers up to 10,500 across all ranks and formations and services.  It is simply intolerable that we ask so much of these brave men and women and give them so little.  The use of pious platitudes, that is, praising them and saying we admire, respect and are proud of them, does not put bread and butter on the table by any manner or means.  It is unbelievable that they have to go community welfare officers, CWOs, and receive income supplements.  I welcomed the visit of President Trump to Ireland recently and he was entitled to be treated with respect when he came.  During that visit, members of the Defence Forces were on duty alongside members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but were getting paid much less money than were the members of the Garda, with worse conditions.  We are operating a system of apartheid towards our soldiers here.  I have a young man sitting his leaving certificate at the moment who is mad to get into the into the armed forces, and I am trying to talk him out of it.  How is he going to sustain a family?  How is he going to get a mortgage, build a house, and so on?  The Minister of State should hang his head in shame.</p>  <p>  I salute our overseas forces and their bravery in the work they have done with the United Nations over the years.  However, I totally oppose sending the rangers to Mali with the French forces.  The Minister should consider having them here with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, given the savagery and thuggery that is going on here in Dublin at present.  We are starved for garda&iacute; in the country, because of all the special units up here in Dublin trying to deal with that.  The Minister of State should have the Defence Forces supporting the role of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and should look after our own.  We should keep our nose out of other international issues.  We are supposed to be a neutral country but we are far from it with the way we are behaving.  I definitely support this motion here this evening and hope the Government will be shamed into supporting our proud Army personnel. </p></speech>

For a 24-hour shift, members of the Defence Forces received an additional &euro;20 per day, after tax, as part of the aid-to-the-civil-power allowance, while at the same time, members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which supplied security for the President, earned between &euro;1,000 and &euro;1,500 for that visit.  In addition, the Defence Forces personnel had to sleep in hangars in Shannon Airport or in tents in Doonbeg, while members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na were put up in bed and breakfasts and other reasonable accommodation.  This is an illustration of the disparity in pay and conditions between these two groups, which also existed during the Pope's visit last year.  Is it any wonder that the morale and sustainability of our Defence Forces are now hanging in the balance?  By ignoring the issues of pay and conditions and allowing the problems to build up and fester, a crisis resolution is now required.  Going through the normal channels, such as the Public Services Pay Commission, is not going to solve this crisis.</p><p>PDFORRA and RACO are frustrated, as illustrated by the comments of Commandant Berry when he retired recently.  He stated that the Defence Forces were being dismantled, demoralised, humiliated and suffocated by this Government and were suffering a sense of betrayal by it, and still the Minister of State seems to think that a turnover of 9% is not out of keeping with other elements of the public service.  To lose 9% year on year is to lose the expertise and corporate knowledge of experienced members of the Defence Forces.  Continuity in the Defence Forces and in its members' expertise is important.<br/><br/> Members of the Defence Forces are suffering from food poverty, income poverty, fuel poverty and child poverty.  Members of defence forces in other jurisdictions are offered many perks - accommodation, third level education while in the defence forces and after leaving, and health services - but no such services and supports are available in Ireland.  The Minister of State should think on that.</p></speech>

It is evident that the work of our Defence Forces is neither respected nor valued.  Our recruitment and retention emergency is systemically embedded in the Defence Forces.  In the three-year period from 2015 to 2017, 1,902 personnel left the Permanent Defence Force.  In the three-year period from 2010 to 2012, 1,903 personnel left it while 2,282 left in the three-year period from 2001 to 2003.</p>  <p>  The response to the ongoing crisis in retention has resulted in an unmitigated policy failure.  The Minister of State asserts that the issues surrounding staff turnover are down to the unique and demanding nature of military life without once accepting that this Government is effectively guaranteeing that it is far more demanding than necessary.  The families and, in particular, spouses of Permanent Defence Force members have lost all faith in the willingness or capacity of the Government to increase pay and address the issues around conditions.  Many are unable to survive financially, which is contributing to the mass exodus from the forces across the board.</p>  <p>  As I understand the situation, the recruitment and retention crisis is directly responsible for ensuring that, at a minimum, each soldier, sailor and air crew member conducts two 24-hour security duty shifts each week along with a further 16 hours of routine duties.  This amounts to an average 64-hour working week on very low rates of pay.  This has to change, especially in light of the fact that the Government is committed to increasing defence spending, including more than &euro;250 million on a ship replacement programme and a capital budget of &euro;416 million for the 2018 to 2021 period.</p>  <p>  I call on the Minister of State to ensure that this issue is addressed once and for all.  It has dragged on.  Permanent Defence Force members' spouses and families came to Leinster House just to ask for fair pay and conditions.  They were forced to demonstrate.  What is happening is wrong and members deserve respect and at least a fair wage for the great work that they do.</p></speech>

I am shocked by the Government's amendment.  It betrays an unbelievable arrogance and shows that the Government is out of touch with the situation that has developed within the Permanent Defence Force.</p><p>During the course of the recent local elections, this issue was raised regularly with candidates on the doorstep.  It is certainly a concern among the wider public and, of course, members of the Defence Forces themselves.  It is clear that the Government policy in respect of the Defence Forces that commenced in 2012 with their reorganisation and the closure of barracks has led to a serious crisis within the service.  Those of us who warned that the policy would create such difficulties were not taken seriously.  Indeed, we were laughed at and not listened to.  Unfortunately, what we warned against has happened.</p><p>One of the closures was of Kickham Barracks in Clonmel.  Seven years later, and even though we have been promised various projects, a stone has not even been placed on another stone.  A query is now being raised about whether the overruns in the national children's hospital and national broadband plans could create difficulties for these projects.</p><p>The situation within the Permanent Defence Force is very serious.  There have been significant reductions in numbers, pay, allowances, pensions and conditions of service.  There is undoubtedly low morale, and studies have shown serious levels of anxiety, stress and mental health difficulties among serving personnel.  The figures tell the story.  On 1 March this year, there were 210 fewer serving personnel than on 1 March last year.  Some 3,200 personnel left the Permanent Defence Force between 2014 and 2018.  In the first four months of this year, there were 256 discharges.  Due to staff shortages, ships have been unable to go to sea and aircraft have been unable to fly.  This is a picture of a service that is not fit for purpose due to the deliberate actions and policies of the Government.</p><p>This morning, the Taoiseach told the House <i>ad nauseam</i>about public service pay and how he could do nothing about pay, conditions and allowances.  We have been hearing that line for a number of years.  As I pointed out to the Taoiseach, however, the facts of the matter are that the Government gave significant increases to garda&iacute; and nurses in recent times outside the public service pay agreement.  In respect of garda&iacute;, there was a &euro;4,000 per year increase in the form of rent allowance and other concessions.  There was a package worth &euro;50 million in respect of nurses.  Due to the crisis in attracting nurses to the service and retaining them there, the Government was forced to back down and it made significant concessions.  Clearly, there is precedent for improving the pay and conditions of members of the Defence Forces, and they should be improved.  That more than 80% of members have pay that is less than the average public servant's pay is unacceptable and unsustainable and will completely undermine the Permanent Defence Force unless the issue is addressed urgently.</p><p>As Minister for Defence, the Taoiseach is responsible to the D&aacute;il and the public for the situation in the Defence Forces.</p><p>I call on him, as a matter of immediate political will, to restore Defence Forces pay and allowances to pre-2008 and pre-FEMPI levels sooner rather than later.</p></speech>

In many instances, they have had to step into the breach to provide vital services when industrial action was being taken elsewhere.  None of us knows the extent of the challenges that Brexit will bring to security on this island.  The Defence Forces must be on hand in such circumstances to protect our citizens and our democracy.  Like many people, I heard retired Commandant Cathal Berry saying on the radio that a soldier who does a 24-hour duty on a Saturday will take home approximately &euro;1 an hour.  He pointed out that this level of pay would not even cover the cost of the petrol used to go on duty.  Such an intolerable situation cannot be allowed to continue.  The mileage clocked up by Defence Forces personnel from three barracks to provide duty cover in Dublin, which is equivalent to travelling around the world 18 times a year, is equally unsustainable.  The current movement of Defence Forces personnel from Custume Barracks in Athlone to do duties in Dublin is completely unsustainable in the medium term.  We need to look again at how we organise our Defence Forces, particularly in light of the threat of Brexit.  When the Minister of State is responding, I ask to address a specific issue that has been brought to my attention and the attention of communities across the midlands.  There is a concern that the departure of many experienced staff from the Defence Forces, and the Air Corps in particular, will have an impact on the lifesaving air ambulance service that operates out of Custume Barracks in Athlone and provides a vital service across the midlands and the west.  If we do not act quickly to address these issues, our Defence Forces will face permanent and irreversible damage.</p></speech>

I thank Deputy Jack Chambers for his tremendous work in this area.  Members of the Defence Forces give loyal and determined service to this country.  Irish people have great respect for their commitment.  I believe the Defence Forces deserve the best supports they can be given.  The number of people serving in the Defence Forces has been allowed to fall below 9,000.  Morale among members is on the floor.  There is a major issue with pay and conditions.  Many members of the Defence Forces feel they have been abandoned.  My Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues have spoken about the unacceptable conditions under which Defence Forces personnel must operate.  I want to be associated with the remarks they have made in defence of such personnel.  One of the specific failings in the Defence Forces is the lack of a permanent psychiatrist.  Many reports have referred to the poor pay and conditions in the Defence Forces.  The level of pay on offer is a clear difficulty in attracting a psychiatrist.  I understand the pay grade of the position is at lieutenant colonel level, which attracts approximately half of the salary that a psychiatrist position in the HSE would attract.  If one is advertising for a position and offering just half of the salary being offered by the HSE, one cannot be surprised when one receives no applications.  The members of the Defence Forces are under significant mental strain in the normal course of their duties.  They operate in strenuous circumstances and often in dangerous environments.  Post-traumatic stress disorder, which is common among soldiers, is treatable but requires early intervention.  The availability of a psychiatrist to assist soldiers at the earliest point is of critical importance.  A research document, Workplace Climate in the Defence Forces, identified the significant stress and strain under which soldiers are operating.  The current low staffing levels place an additional strain on the members of the Defence Forces.  When will the Defence Forces be shown the proper respect they deserve?</p></speech>

They are highly regarded and respected by the Irish public for the role they play in the security of this State.  However, they continue to be undervalued when it comes to pay and working conditions.  This Government remains reluctant to face up to the scale and impact of the issues facing members of the Defence Forces and their families.  It is obvious that pay and conditions are contributing significantly to the personnel recruitment and retention issues in our Naval Service, Air Corps and Army.  These issues must be addressed as a matter of urgency.  I understand there has been a 30% turnover of staff in the past three years, or 10% year on year.  Poor pay and conditions are also making a major contribution to the fact that many families of Defence Forces members depend on family income supplement to make ends meet.  I come from a military barracks town and have met members of the Defence Forces and their families in Kilkenny.  The situation on the ground is dire for those at the lower end of the pay scale.</p>  <p>  In an effort to be constructive in the short amount of time available to me, I would like to suggest that the Minister of State should investigate the possibility of advancing alternative solutions to address the recruitment and retention crisis.  An increase in the availability of higher education opportunities and third level places to all members of the Defence Forces would be a start.  I acknowledge there is already a strong tradition when it comes to promoting higher education within the Defence Forces.  We must do more to incentivise and increase the availability of educational opportunities to all members of the Defence Forces.  Accommodation is a major issue because between 35% and 40% of the take-home pay of members of the Defence Forces can be spent on rent.  Many other countries offer free accommodation to members of their defence forces.  This is a huge incentive because it leaves soldiers, pilots and naval personnel with more money in their pockets at the end of the month.  It is time for the Government to wake up to the situation that has happened.  The Minister of State is in denial about is happening with personnel on the ground.  As I have said, I come from a military barracks town.  I know at first hand what families have to put up with because of the pay and conditions of Defence Forces personnel.  I ask the Minister of State to do something for these people and these families.</p></speech>

Corrective action is required immediately to restore the confidence of Army, Navy and Air Corps personnel, especially those in the lower ranks.  Our Naval Service forces and ships are based at Haulbowline near Cobh in my constituency of Cork East.  Many Army exercises are carried out at the range at Kilworth Camp, which is also in my constituency.  We must not forget the former Fitzgerald Camp in Fermoy.  The town of Fermoy and the surrounding areas continue to have a strong connection with the Defence Forces.  The comments we have been hearing during this debate are reflective of the mood of the public in Cork East.  I am not here to bash the Minister of State but we cannot allow the role of many members of the Defence Forces to be affected when jobseekers' restrictions kick in.  In other words, some members of the Defence Forces would be better off in receipt of jobseeker's allowance.  The Minister of State gave the House some figures earlier with regard to various payments and so on.  I am hearing that in some cases, people join the Army because they cannot qualify for jobseeker's payments.  I am concerned about the future security of this country.  During President Trump's visit to Ireland last week and the Papal visit last year, we almost got a blow-by-blow account of the operation of our Defence Forces over the national airwaves.  This can be attributed to the frustration of ex-members of the Defence Forces and the spouses of current members, who have been campaigning tirelessly for some time.  The Minister of State must seek to fix the pay and conditions of military personnel with immediate effect.  It is said that one should look after one's own first.  The Government is prepared to give an open chequebook to fund the European defence mechanism through PESCO at the expense of our own Defence Forces.  I ask the Minister of State to resolve the matter.</p></speech>

I compliment my colleague, Deputy Jack Chambers, who has worked tirelessly on this issue since he was appointed as Fianna F&aacute;il's spokesperson on defence.  The type of pressure he has been exerting in this case is needed.  We must review FEMPI.  We must establish a pay commission to address the damaging 2012 restructuring programme and restore the three-brigade structure.  We must honour the working time directive, which the Government is not implementing.  We must examine the present structure of the Department of Defence to enhance the input and discretion of military management in decisions on defence spending.  The turnover rate in the Permanent Defence Force is 9% and in the Naval Service is 14%.  The Minister of State knows this is not sustainable.  It is most worrying.  We need to realise that this is no ordinary case.  Not very many years have passed since members of our Defence Forces died while ensuring members of the public were kept safe in this country.</p><p>They have also died abroad in the line of duty.  We owe it to the people in the Army and their families, who cannot speak out or protest, to resolve the situation as quickly as possible.  When there is a crisis with bad weather or back-up is needed for firefighting services, we cannot forget that the Army is there.  This is not an ordinary situation and we need to act on it as quickly as possible.  I do not blame the Minister alone.  The responsibility lies clearly with the Taoiseach and he needs to take responsibility and support Army personnel.</p></speech>

They closed Columb Barracks in Mullingar and are still unable to confirm their future use or what, if any, community projects will be facilitated when the Land Development Agency takes over.  The previous Government decided to abolish the fourth western brigade and downgrade Custume Barracks in Athlone.  At the time, a firm commitment was given, in writing and on the floor of this House, that its strength would be maintained at 1,100 personnel.  Today, there are 700 people attached to Custume Barracks.  Why is there a mass exodus of personnel from our Army?  It is because of the pay and conditions.  The disparity in pay and conditions of our front-line services was illustrated by the recent visit of the Holy Father, Pope Francis and, even more recently, by the visit of President Trump when people were paid &euro;20 for an additional 24-hour shift.  Soldiers from Athlone are being sent to man four different locations and there is a deliberate attempt to make Athlone look like an expensive barracks because the Government wants to downgrade it further.  There is a worry in Athlone over the long-term viability of the barracks and this anxiety needs to be addressed.</p>  <p>  Some 300 personnel have been waiting almost a decade for their tech-3 payment to be paid.  When will it be paid?  The Minister has repeatedly promised that it will be paid but, despite the Department returning money to the Exchequer, these people are still awaiting their payment.  The Minister and his colleagues should hold their heads in shame for the manner in which they have treated the Defence Forces and the way they have refused to take on board the genuine concern of the people in the forces.  They should take their heads out of the sand as there is a serious problem here that needs to be addressed and they are failing to address it.</p></speech>

I say this not because the Defence Forces training centre is on the Curragh Camp in the heart of my constituency, or because Kildare South has the largest postal vote in the country.  It is because many of my friends from school had parents in the Defence Forces and I will not be lectured by anybody on the other side of the House on this issue.  I was aware of every member of the local GAA club who was a serving member of the Defence Forces and I remember the huge regard in which they were held.  As I grew up, some of my friends went into the Army apprenticeship school and some joined the Air Corps or the navy.  Our biggest concerns were that they would be sent abroad on a tour of duty and would miss a championship match.  As they got older, got married and had children, I saw the strain on them and their families when they were sent on a tour of duty and I acknowledge the difficulty for wives and partners of serving members in this regard.</p>  <p>  I hate the fact that our Defence Forces have low morale at the moment and feel they are not as valued as they should be.  I work very hard, with the Minister, Deputy Kehoe, and others in Government to put that right because our Defence Forces matter.  This problem manifests itself in recruitment and retention and we are determined to put it right.  I will continue to use my position as a Government Deputy in this area.  I am well aware of the strain when the forces do not have the full complement of personnel, when training and tours of duty mean the onus falls on all the other members.  I am not surprised, however, that we have recruitment and retention issues.  The level and quality of training for the Defence Forces mean their members are highly sought after and, at a time of full employment, the private sector is screaming out for the talents and skills they have, in the areas of logistics, discipline etc.  We will continue to work to improve conditions to make sure that we can compete with the private sector.</p>  <p>  We need to address a number of areas.  We need formal affiliation for our personnel and their representatives, such as PDFORRA, with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and I commend the Minister and his officials on their work in this area, much of which has been done behind the scenes.  I hope to see the fruits of that in the very near future.  A working group was established to make progress on the working time directive and this has happened, without getting big headlines.  It is not easy to deal with staffing and HR issues in the Defence Forces because of the unique role they have in our society.  I hope the Public Service Pay Commission makes progress in the near future and that we will see movement on the outstanding adjudication awards for the Army ranger wing, allowances for chefs, technicians' pay, account holders' allowances and rations of recruits and apprentices.  I understand that PDFORRA has taken an action around the retrospective nature of this but we should see movement on it.  I have spoken with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe.  Let us get it paid from now.  The action can take care of itself but we could start paying it straight away and I would love that to happen.</p>  <p>  I am acutely aware of the challenges in the area of public sector pay.  We have a broad public sector pay agreement but some people on the other side seem to have forgotten that.  In the confidence and supply agreement, Fianna F&aacute;il signed up to the public sector pay agreement.  Its finance spokesperson, Deputy Michael McGrath, agrees that it is the right approach but the Members present want to undermine that now.  I was part of the negotiations for the confidence and supply agreement and not once was the pay of the Defence Forces raised.  One could say that Fianna F&aacute;il is playing politics with this issue.</p></speech>

Its members are playing games and trying to position themselves to take credit for something on which they have been quiet in the past.  I have huge regard for people in the forces, including people in my constituency, and I will continue to work with the Minister and colleagues to make sure we bring about the changes that are needed to put the Defence Forces back in the proud position in which they should be.  I hate the fact that their frustration has risen to this point and I will to ensure the men and women of &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann see improvements in their circumstances, given the crucial role they play in our society.</p></speech>

Many of us have witnessed at first hand the important work the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service undertake, both at home and overseas.  It is important to recognise the excellent work of the Reserve Defence Force in supporting the Permanent Defence Force.  This is led by the Minister with responsibility for defence and his Department.</p>  <p>  The counter-motion seeks to give a more balanced presentation of the facts.  The Minister, Deputy Kehoe, has already mentioned the increased levels of funding for defence he has successfully secured and, in accordance with the National Development 2018-2027 and Project Ireland 2040, the capital allocation for Vote 36 - defence has been increased to &euro;106 million for 2019, an increase of &euro;29 million or 38% on the 2018 allocation.  The national development plan provides for a total of &euro;541 million over the period from 2018 to 2022.  This substantial increase in funding supports a programme of sustained equipment replacement and infrastructural development across the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service, as identified and prioritised in a White Paper.  This investment will see the replacement and upgrade of significant equipment platforms over the lifetime of the White Paper, including an upgrade of the Army's fleet of armoured personnel carriers, enhancement of the capabilities of the Army ranger wing and replacement of the Air Corps' Cessna fleet and the CASA maritime patrol aircraft.</p><p>The decision to acquire a large new multi-role vessel to replace <i>L&Eacute; Eithne</i>will provide a new enhanced set of capabilities across a wide range of roles.  In addition, I am pleased to note the sustained programme of investment in barracks infrastructure to improve accommodation and other facilities across the country.  <br/><br/>Regarding the issue of pay, as the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, has outlined, the Public Service Pay Commission examined recruitment and retention issues in the defence sector and the Government will decide on its approach to this.  The focus of pay increases under the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 has rightly been on those on lower pay.  The agreement provides for increases in pay ranging from 6.2% to 7.4%.  Increases due under the agreement to date have been paid to Permanent Defence Force personnel and further increases in pay are scheduled for later this year and next year.  By the end of the current agreement, the pay scales of all public servants, including members of the Defence Forces, earning under &euro;70,000 per annum will be restored to pre-FEMPI levels.  The restoration of the 5% reduction to allowances under FEMPI is also scheduled under the agreement.  <br/><br/>The motion calls for the establishment of a permanent and independent Defence Forces pay body.  In Ireland, pay policy is determined centrally by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform having regard to public sector pay agreements.  The Government established the independent Public Service Pay Commission to advise it on public service pay.  I can confirm that there are no plans to institute separate pay bodies.<br/><br/>The position in respect of the working time directive is that legislation is currently being considered by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  This will remove the blanket exemption previously understood to apply to military personnel.  Work is under way to achieve a graduated solution that respects the unique operational requirements of a military force in the understanding that the directive provides for the exemption of certain military activities.  I am aware of, and welcome, the fact that a joint civil-military approach is being taken and that there is deep engagement with the representative associations on the directive.  <br/><br/>This Government will continue to address the challenges facing the Defence Forces and looks forward to the publication of the pay commission's report, which will form the basis of further discussions with relevant parties to the public service stability agreement.</p></speech>

The first comment I will make in the short time I have is that it was a fundamental mistake not to have a senior Minister at the table.  The idea of the Taoiseach double-jobbing, that is to say having line Ministries as well as the functions of the Taoiseach, is bad practice.  I saw it happen under a Fianna F&aacute;il Government many years ago, before I came into this House.  It was bad practice then and it is bad practice now.  No matter how worthy a Minister of State is - and I have been both a Minister and a Minister of State - it is not the same as a line Minister fighting his or her corner at the Cabinet table.  When the referee is fighting one of the corners, it makes the job more difficult.  That issue should, and can, be addressed.  There should be a Cabinet Minister with responsibility for defence at the table.  That is no reflection on the personalities involved; it is a reflection on the structures.  I do not mean that one Cabinet Minister cannot have two Departments, as the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform has, but only that it should be a line Minister rather than the referee in the game, an Taoiseach, who does so.</p>  <p>  Everyone on all sides of the House agrees there is a problem.  We seem to have gotten ourselves into a tangle with all of the structures we have put in place such that, when a clear problem arises, we are not able to work our way through the fog.  When a crisis then arises, as happened in respect of the nurses and other disputes, a way we were told was not there is suddenly found to be there.  A lot of damage is, however, done in the interim.  </p>  <p>  The proposal here is quite simple: restore the allowances.  Many of these allowances were abolished during the downturn in the economy.  At that time savings had to be made, but times and circumstances have changed.  The economy is competitive and much more buoyant, which puts pressure on the public service.  The Government should have the will and find the way.  It seems that in dealing with all of the problems we face, all we do is go into endless processes.  We need an end to this crisis.</p></speech>

The decline over recent years left the force with just 8,847 personnel at the end of March, which is some 653 members below the current agreed strength.  I would like to specifically focus on the pay and conditions of our soldiers.  Pay and conditions are now so poor that young people are quitting as quickly as they can after training.  To quote one member, &quot;DF [the Defence Forces] has been turned into a JobBridge&quot;.  Living quarters for young recruits are shocking and the buildings used are not fit for purpose.  In fact, recruits say they are expected to live in Third World conditions.  Instead of going to the medical service provided, soldiers are going to credit unions for loans for private mental health treatment because they would suffer if the Defence Forces knew they had problems.</p><p>It is truly shocking to hear the stories shared in testimony from a focus group included in a report within the Defence Forces called &quot;Workplace Climate in the Defence Forces&quot;.  The authors of the report have recommended better pay and have advised senior officers to face up to the problems exposed by the research.  A number of privates spoke of struggling to survive, often depending on their parents.  One quote included in the report was:</p><blockquote>I can&rsquo;t get a mortgage.  Some members are even on Family Income Supplement.  We would be better off on the dole as we would have no bills</blockquote><p>Another soldier said:</p><blockquote>People are sleeping in cars.  Two people in Athlone couldn&rsquo;t afford to pay to stay in the barracks or commute home so they stayed in their cars at the weekends</blockquote><p>Another said: &quot;I have to live with my parents along with my wife and kids&quot;.  </p><p>There is clear evidence that there is a need for serious change and this change must be initiated by the Government.  The overall health of our Defence Forces, which is a major arm of our State security, reflects poorly on us as a State.  Our Defence Forces have had an excellent reputation worldwide for generations.  It is unacceptable for the Government to allow morale to reach such a low ebb .  Action is required to restore our Defence Forces to where they should be.</p></speech>

I thank my colleague, Deputy Jack Chambers, and my other colleagues in Fianna F&aacute;il for tabling this important motion.  Fundamentally it shows up a lack of respect on the part of Government for the Defence Forces.  That is what people feel and that is what is biting people about this particular issue.  The lack of sympathy and empathy from the Government is not shared by the general population.  I was contacted by a constituent this morning.  He was in a public house last night and said that this issue was the talk of the place.  He said people are annoyed about this issue, first, because of their sympathy for the plights of individual members of the Defence Forces and, second and most important, because of the honour the Defence Forces have brought to this country throughout our history.  We are an independent, sovereign, neutral country and that neutrality has allowed our Defence Forces to prosper and to gain an unbelievably proud reputation for fairness, even-handedness, and efficiency around the world.</p>  <p>  The Government has shown a distinct lack of respect for the Defence Forces, as exemplified by the lack of a Cabinet Minister for defence other than the Taoiseach, which Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and others have pointed out.  The attitude towards the Defence Forces seems to be, "I do not care".  People are discharging themselves at unprecedented levels.  Numbers are down.  This must be the only area of the public sector in which numbers are down.  There are issues with equipment and missions are difficult to accomplish.  All of this is happening at a time soldiers, sailors, and other members of the Defence Forces are being sought out to provide help in difficult situations all over the world, as they have done in the past.  </p>  <p>  It is worth recalling that members of the Defence Forces have given their lives for this country and for the projects, peacekeeping, and peace enforcement in which they have been involved over the years.  This is a difficult job and it is made all the more difficult by the financial and material circumstances in which the Government has left our soldiers.  I believe there is a certain amount of embarrassment on the Government side of the House.  I appeal to the Government to seriously examine this issue and to think of these soldiers and of the good they do on behalf of this country around the world.</p></speech>

I will certainly examine the amendments in a very open way.  We all have to work together and to collaborate on defence policy.</p><p>The Minister of State's statement was rounded off with one major denial, &quot;some HR challenges&quot;, which was the understatement of the day.  It is so out of line with reality.  In his submission to the Department, the Chief of Staff stated there is a serious retention challenge, a mass exodus, with 3,200 Defence Forces members purchasing their discharge last year. and the Minister of State talks about &quot;some HR challenges&quot;.  Has he read the Defence Forces climate survey?  It stated that the Defence Forces are being turned into JobBridge.  There will be a major safety issue in the Air Corps.  Living quarters for young recruits have been described as Hotel Rwanda and yet the Minister of State refers to &quot;some HR challenges&quot;.<br/><br/>Defence Forces members say they cannot get mortgages.  Some are even on family income supplement and claim they would be better off on the dole as they would have no bills.  People are sleeping in cars.  Two people in Athlone could not afford to pay to stay in the barracks or commute home so they stayed in their cars at weekends.  That is the legacy of the Minister of State.  The one thread of consistency in recent years is his position in the Department of Defence.  As I said earlier, he has been the empty suit and the silent lamb at the Cabinet table, saying nothing and staying where he is.  He has said very little to acknowledge the serious recruitment and retention crisis today.<br/><br/>I quote from one of the members of the Wives and Partners of the Defence Forces:</p><blockquote>I&rsquo;m writing looking at the single bed that I share with my eight-year-old daughter and the blow up Peppa Pig bed our toddler sleeps in.<br /><br />My husband sleeps on the couch as there is no room for him.  This is our home, a box room in my in-laws two bedroom house.<br /><br />Living on someone else&rsquo;s floor is not easy...<br /><br />I cry because I miss him so much &amp;amp; I worry about him overseas...<br /><br />We just want to be a normal family doing normal things but we will never afford a home on these awful wages.</blockquote><p>Today I want to ensure that her tears do not fall upon deaf ears.  There are countless stories like this one and all the Minister of State says is that there are some HR challenges.  What planet is he living on? <br/><br/>I want the members of our Defence Forces to enjoy the same living standards as many members of the public service.  The great contradiction in public pay policy was demonstrated by the members of the Defence Forces standing side by side with their front-line public service colleagues in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The miserly Scrooge-like duty allowance presided over by the Minister of State is a national disgrace.  We need to move the Defence Forces back from the cliff edge.  We cannot have continual crisis management and a dysfunctional cycle of turnover.  That is why the Minister of State should support the motion and should use his voice at the Cabinet table.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-06-12a.470" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="17:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019061200047#ZZ00500"><p>I move:</p><blockquote>That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann resolves that sections 2 to 4, 6 to 12, 14 and 17 of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 (No. 39 of 1998) shall continue in operation for the period beginning on the 30th June 2019 and ending on the 29th June 2020.</blockquote><p>The House will be aware that the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 was enacted in the wake of the barbaric murder by the Real IRA of 29 innocent people at Omagh in August 1998.  That atrocity demanded this response from the State as a necessary and wholly proportionate measure to defend the desire of the vast majority on this island to live in peace.  Section 18 of the 1998 Act provides that sections 2 to 4, inclusive, 6 to 12, inclusive, 14 and 17 must be renewed by the Oireachtas at least annually if they are to remain in force.  These robust provisions of the criminal law play an important part in enabling the Garda authorities to face down the threat from terrorism.</p><p>Prior to moving any motion for renewal, the Act requires that I lay before the House a report on the operation of the provisions.  The report covers the period from 1 June 2018 to 31 May 2019 and was laid before the House on 10 June 2019.  It includes information provided by the Garda Commissioner on the use of the provisions in question over the past 12 months and a table setting out reported usage figures for each of the years since the Act came into operation.</p><p>I will not take up the limited time available by going through in detail each of the relevant sections of the Act.  The report I have provided to the House gives details of the various sections and the offences and other arrangements provided for.  However, I bring to the attention of the House that in May of this year the Supreme Court upheld an appeal by the State on the constitutionality of section 9(1)(b) of the Act.  This subsection provides for an offence of withholding information which might be of material assistance in securing the apprehension, prosecution or conviction of another person for a serious offence.  The Supreme Court&rsquo;s finding with regard to the constitutionality of the provision is welcomed.</p><p>The report I laid before the House sets out a brief assessment of the security situation.  However, there are clear constraints on the detail of what is and can be reported to ensure there is no danger of prejudice to the investigation or prosecution of crime or the security of the State.</p><p>A number of the provisions - sections 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12 and 17 - have not been utilised during the reporting period.  That a provision is not used in a particular year does not mean it is redundant.  We need to take a balanced approach to this.  The Garda assessment is that there remains a real and persistent threat from republican paramilitary groups on this island, the so-called dissidents.  We know these groups vehemently oppose peace and democracy, and regrettably they remain wedded to brutality and criminality.  These groups have spent 20 years trying to destroy the Good Friday Agreement and all it stands for.  Their callous disregard for democracy, the rule of law and human life is all too clearly demonstrated with their continuing attempts to murder and maim PSNI officers, most recently in the vicious placing of a device under a PSNI officer&rsquo;s car.  Of course, we can never forget the callous and appalling murder of Lyra McKee in Derry last April.  These people are ruthless, reckless and cowardly.  Their actions will only strengthen our resolve to redouble our efforts to build a truly peaceful future for the people of Northern Ireland.  I am determined that they will not succeed.  I am sure everyone in this House shares my determination.</p><p>Of course, many provisions of the Offences Against the State Acts could have application to the international terrorist threat.  While, thankfully, Ireland has been spared the kinds of jihadist-type attacks we have seen in other European countries, targeting innocent people going about their daily lives, such attacks are a stark reminder of the vulnerability of all open democracies to this ongoing threat.  Ireland is not immune.  Our security authorities are alive to the potential threat we face and continue to work closely with their international counterparts in identifying and responding to that threat.  I would also point out it is a small number of people in Ireland whose religious extremism and activities give a cause for concern.  They are not characteristic of our Muslim community, who are peaceful and law abiding.</p><p>I pay a particular tribute to the women and men of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who continue to work tirelessly to preserve life and to counter all threats from terrorism.  I pay a tribute also to the men and women of the police and security services in Northern Ireland.  I acknowledge the work over many years of the chief constable of the PSNI, George Hamilton, and I wish him well in his forthcoming retirement.  I thank him for his service.  I acknowledge the work of everyone in the PSNI with whom the Garda works closely every day to enhance the safety of all communities on this island.</p><p>The report notes the clear view of the Garda authorities that the Act continues to be an important tool in ongoing efforts in the fight against terrorism.  The Garda authorities have stated that the provisions of the Act are used regularly and this is evident from the report laid before the House.</p><p>I appreciate that some Members of the House are concerned about the role of the Special Criminal Court in the criminal justice system.  One of the most important traits of a democratic society is a justice system that operates free from interference by anyone seeking wrongfully to influence outcomes.  Our criminal justice system depends not only on judges and lawyers but also on the participation of citizens, whether as witnesses or jurors.  This latter role is central to our idea of a trial by a jury of one&rsquo;s peers.  We all agree that trial by jury must be preserved to the greatest extent possible.  However, none of us can be blind to the threat posed to the criminal justice process by individuals, terrorist groups and organised criminal groups who seek to subvert the system through the intimidation of citizens.  We cannot allow that to happen.  We are obliged to make the hard decision that sometimes, in certain limited circumstances, a trial by jury is simply not possible.</p><p> To those who assert that the Special Criminal Court is contrary to fundamental rights, I respectfully disagree.  The court operates without a jury for sound reason, but trials there involve not one but three judges.  Anyone tried in that court has the full range of procedural protections available to him or her, including the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court.  We all look forward to the day when the Special Criminal Court is no longer needed, but regrettably we are not there yet.  In the circumstances, I must conclude that these provisions continue to be required and that they should remain in operation for a further 12 months.</p> <p> I turn to section 8 of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009.  It refers to four serious, organised crime offences that are set out in Part 7 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006.  Section 8 of the 2009 Act makes these offences scheduled offences for the purposes of Part V of the Offences Against the State Act 1939, that is, trials for these offences are to be heard in the Special Criminal Court subject to the power of the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, to direct that the offences be tried in the ordinary courts.  Of course, we greatly value trial by jury and we must protect it, but we cannot ignore the threat posed to the criminal justice process by criminal gangs.  The purpose of this provision is to guard against the possibility of interference with jury trial by ruthless criminal gangs operating across society.  I will not delay the House repeating the detail of what is set out in the report on this section.  The report covers the period from 1 June 2018 to 31 May 2019 and was laid before the House on 10 June 2019.  It includes information provided by the Garda Commissioner on the use, over the past 12 months, of the provisions in question and details of the offences in question.</p> <p> Although the provision has been in place since 2009, and while there have been arrests under the relevant offences, it was more recently that we saw convictions in respect of relevant offences being secured in cases before the Special Criminal Court.  This highlights the considered approach of the DPP in using her discretion to direct that cases be tried in the ordinary courts where it is possible to do so.</p> <p> Nobody in this House could be in any doubt about the pernicious nature of the activities of serious organised criminals in this State.  They have no regard for the damage they cause in communities.  They prey on the weak and vulnerable.  They have no respect for life, as evidenced from the three murders committed in the space of a week recently in Dublin.  Murders committed in broad daylight in residential areas say a lot about the kinds of people we are dealing with.  Their ever-increasing depravity was demonstrated recently by the willingness to attempt to commit murder in a busy supermarket.  They have nothing but disdain for the rule of law.  They have no hesitation whatsoever in the use of extreme violence and murder in pursuit of their aims.</p> <p> The views of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are set out clearly in the report.  This provision will be required for some time to come.  As Minister, I must have full regard for the views of the Garda authorities, and I do.  In that regard, I acknowledge the work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in tackling organised crime.  It continues to make significant seizures of drugs and firearms and continues to prevent further loss of life. </p> <p> I reiterate that the Special Criminal Court should be preserved to the greatest extent possible.  However, we cannot ignore the threat posed to the criminal process by individuals, terrorist groups and organised criminal groups who seek to intimidate jurors or potential jurors.  I reject any accusations that the court has operated with bias.  Its judges have performed courageous public service in presiding without fear or favour over the prosecution of some of the most dangerous terrorists and ruthless criminals in the State.  The court continues to be a necessary and important part of the State&rsquo;s criminal justice architecture.</p> <p> On the basis of the information set out in the report, and on the advice of the Garda authorities, I propose that the House approve the continued operation of the relevant provisions of the two Acts for a further 12 months commencing on 30 June 2019.</p></speech>

This is the fourth occasion on which I have had the opportunity to speak on these motions.  Fianna F&aacute;il will support them.  The reason is the information laid before the House and our knowledge of what is happening in the real world in respect of terrorist offences.  We know from the report and other sources of knowledge that there is, unfortunately, a domestic threat in this country from dissident republican groups.  They want to impose their political views on the people of this island through the use of violence.  We have seen that recently through the murder of Lyra McKee, as the Minister stated.  We have also seen it through the increased threat posed to the officers of the PSNI by members of dissident republican groups.  We know from information provided by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which is outlined in the report, that the Garda believes these provisions are necessary and important in enabling it to fight against the serious dissident groups that need to be defeated.  The people of this country need to be defended against them, particularly given that the groups do not recognise at all the democratic wish of the people expressed in the Good Friday Agreement referendum in 1998.</p>  <p>  The report also mentions the international threat.  There is unquestionably an international threat from terrorism, which is precipitated by events outside this island.  It is important to make two points in this respect.  First, we are fortunate in this country that we have a Muslim population living on this island who are peaceful and want to ensure they have a peaceful life for themselves and their families.  We have been fortunate in that we do not have the type of radicalisation of members of the Islamic community seen in the United Kingdom, France and other European countries.  That is to be welcomed.  I am sure there are reasons for it that can be explained from our history.  Part of the reason is the welcome people from different faiths receive when they come to this country.  It is unquestionably the case that there is an international threat, however.  Even if there were not, we would still be justified in extending these 12 provisions because of the domestic threat here.</p>  <p>  The second motion deals with section 8 of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009.  That Act provided for the creation of a number of new offences in respect of what is known as gangland crime.  It provides that those offences should be scheduled offences that may be determined by the Special Criminal Court.  Fianna F&aacute;il will also support that motion.  If there is a vote, we will support it tomorrow.</p>  <p>  The Minister stated that some Members are concerned about the role of the Special Criminal Court in the criminal justice system; I am not.  The court comes within our constitutional system.  Article 38.3.1&deg; of the Constitution states special courts may be established by law for the trial of offences where the ordinary courts are inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice.  It is very easy to adopt a purist view in respect of this and say we should only every have trial of offences by jury of one&rsquo;s peers but we do not live in a pure world.  That was recognised in back in 1937 when the Constitution was enacted.  The facts of what we have seen happening on the ground in Ireland for very many years confirm, unfortunately, that there is a need for the Special Criminal Court.  When one considers the gangland violence in Dublin and throughout the country, one realises there are those in the drugs business who are prepared to kill people in order to convenience themselves and preserve their wealth.  They would certainly kill people to preserve their liberty and prevent themselves from going to jail.  We have seen in the past that they have murdered journalists who have been sticking their nose into their drugs trade.  If it were the case that we did not have a Special Criminal Court or if there were no option for the DPP to pursue prosecution before the Special Criminal Court, we would have juries that would have to make determinations on serious trials of gangland individuals.  It is beyond question that those serious gangland criminals would seek to intimidate, threaten and perhaps even kill members of a jury.</p><p>If that happened, what consequence would it have for the next time they were prosecuted for the offence?  It is not tenable to adopt a purist view and argue there should never be a prosecution unless by a jury.  We must live in the real world.  We saw what happened in Limerick a number of years ago where it was impossible for a jury to be empanelled in respect of a serious murder charge because of intimidation of people in the local community.  Although it may be the case in a pure world that we would have no Special Criminal Court, we are perfectly entitled to one in the constitutional world in which we live.</p> <p> The Minister has set out the views of the Garda authorities in the report, and that the Garda Commissioner has informed him that this legislation is proving to be an effective tool in tackling organised criminal groups involved in a range of the most serious criminal activities.  It is the Garda Commissioner's view that the provisions of section 8 of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009 are aimed to target such criminal behaviour and assist greatly in the investigations of the activities being planned and committed by organised crime gangs operating in this jurisdiction.  We do not have to accept that blindly just because the Garda Commissioner said it but it is important information to assist Members in making their decision on whether a Special Criminal Court is required.</p> <p> If the Special Criminal Court is such a dangerous and unfair forum, I challenge Members to point to a miscarriage of justice there recently.  I cannot think of one but perhaps others are able to.  The reason for the Special Criminal Court is to protect jurors.  They are constituents, the same as anyone else.  Any one of our constituents could be selected to serve on a jury.  We have an obligation to try to protect them and we should not expose them to the risk of violence or intimidation if they are required to deal with serious trials of gangland criminals.  We need to introduce some reality into this, rather than purism, and for the reasons I have given, Fianna F&aacute;il will support both motions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-06-12a.474" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1287" speakername="Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire" time="18:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019061200049#BBB00200"><p>The prevalence and viciousness of gang-related violence in this State is one of the greatest challenges we face as a society.  Frankly, not remotely enough is being done to come to terms with it.  It has become a living nightmare for the communities that have to live with this.  People have become terrorised and they have lost hope that it will come to an end.  A climate of fear, violence, intimidation, drug-running and other forms of criminality accompanies such gangsterism.  There has been a devastating impact on communities.</p><p>There have been six gang-related murders so far this year, with three in one week, and several more have been foiled by the work of garda&iacute;.  There were 77 homicides last year.  There were 185 arrests made for possession of a firearm in 2018 and 89 people charged with discharging a firearm.  Between 2016 and 2017, 22 people died in gang-related killings.  The response from Government has been totally inadequate.  It is still the case that the majority of Garda stations are either at or below the strength they were at in 2014.  Dublin has lost 512 garda&iacute; since 2009.  Until recent reactions brought about by serious crime, some of the stations that had experienced reductions in garda&iacute; were Coolock and Drogheda.  Since 2011, Coolock station has lost 14 full-time garda&iacute; while the local anti-drugs unit lost 13 of its 32 personnel.  This problem has gone on and on and this violence continues to spiral out of control.  As it goes on, more people will die, more families will be bereaved, and communities will continue to live in fear.</p><p>That is not only my assessment.  The Garda representative organisations - the Garda Representative Association, GRA, and the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors, AGSI - have repeatedly stated that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is decades behind other police forces in terms of numbers, equipment, training and resources.  Privately, GRA members have expressed the view that the Government has been complacent about the increase in gang-related crime.  I was astonished recently at the decision not to take on the full complement of Garda recruits this year.  If this is repeated next year, I question whether the Minister will reach his target of 15,000 sworn members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na by 2021.  In any event, this is far too modest entirely.  We should aim for in excess of 16,000 garda&iacute;.  </p><p>There was an embargo on overtime for garda&iacute; for the final four months of last year, which placed significant restrictions on the ability of sergeants and superintendents to put in place the kinds of operations they wanted.  There has been a 40% reduction in community policing in recent times.  Community policing is a key link between communities and garda&iacute; and a means to give garda&iacute; information and intelligence about what is happening in those communities.  This State has one of the lowest police-to-population ratios in Europe with 278 garda&iacute; per 100,000 citizens, 40 fewer than the EU average.  </p><p>I recognise that front-line members of an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are doing all within their power to confront this problem.  I note the actions and ongoing successes of the Criminal Assets Bureau in recent days and that countless operations by garda&iacute; have prevented crimes and killings and I pay tribute to them for that.  However, the Government is not putting in place the resources they need.  According to Seamus Boland of the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau, it is targeting in the region of 20 groups at any one time.  Some of these groups, such as the gangs in Dublin, could have hundreds of people linked to them.  That is the scale of the challenge. </p><p>Last year, I called for &quot;a comprehensive review of the emergency legislation in advance of its renewal next year&quot;, following a similar call the previous year, which would focus on how to modernise the criminal justice system to make it responsive to the needs of Ireland in 2018.  That has not happened.  Sinn F&eacute;in believes new legislation is needed to repeal the outdated emergency Acts currently in place and replace them with strengthened and improved legislation providing for new courts to deal with these particular cases.  Garda&iacute; and the courts are facing 21st century challenges with early 20th century legislation.  The current, outdated criminal justice system does not act as a deterrent to organised crime; it is, in fact, exploited by organised criminals.  </p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in recognises that there are certain criminal cases which are more difficult to prosecute given the nature of organised crime today.  The opportunity for well-organised and well-funded criminal enterprises to influence juries, tamper with evidence or intimidate witnesses is greater than in the vast majority of criminal cases.  We should always support, defend and promote the judicial norms of the right to a jury trial and only in special circumstances should we consider deviating from this to protect the judicial process.  Hearings at the family court are currently held <i>in camera </i>while the drug treatment court is a specialised court operating within the legal system.  Specialisation of courts can make sense.  Sinn F&eacute;in, therefore, does not oppose special courts and court procedures to deal with the specific circumstances of violent, organised criminal gangs that present serious threats to the security of the State and communities when the ordinary courts are prevented from securing the effective administration of justice.  The manner in which we try cases involving serious crime is not adequate and we need to offer greater protections to jurors and witnesses to ensure greater success in putting these criminals away.</p><p>The kind of legislative change required has been debated, some of which has been considered by bodies such as the Law Reform Commission, LRC.  For example, we believe there is a need to create a specific offence of jury tampering.  We also believe there is a need to increase penalties for intimidation of jurors under section 41 of the Criminal Justice Act 1999.  There are undoubtedly circumstances where it will be appropriate, necessary and proportionate to provide for anonymisation of juries and witnesses.  The Government rightly provided for this recently for witnesses in the Domestic Violence Act 2018.  Why has it never considered that for serious and organised crime?  It can surely be provided for, and is surely necessary, in those circumstances.  This can be done via screens in courtrooms or, in particular circumstances, via remote location of jurors with video link to courtroom.  </p><p>We should take all steps necessary to ensure the safety of jurors and witnesses, but the Government has not even considered these matters.  Such legislation could have an in-built independent reviewer of legislation to ensure its effectiveness and to ensure that it is rights-proofed.  The Commission on the Future of Policing has recommended just that. </p><p>We also need, outside of the legislative framework, to get more serious about tackling serious and organised crime in this State.  I urge the Minister to ensure the full implementation of Garda Inspectorate recommendations on serious crime and the Commission on the Future of Policing proposals on tackling crime.  One of those is a recommendation Sinn F&eacute;in made last year.  We called for an annual national threat assessment because the current approach of reports and threat assessments by the national security committee is <i>ad hoc</i>and unstructured.</p><p>This could be put on a more secure periodic basis.  The commission called for a strategic threat assessment centre and co-ordinator.  The detail of this proposal needs to be outlined in greater detail.  The Minister and I may differ on that detail, but I am glad that our views were heard by the commission.</p> <p> We need to speed up the process of civilianisation to free up garda&iacute; from office work and get them onto the street and on patrol.  We need proper sentencing guidelines such that people receive sentences fit for their crimes.  That is a matter that Sinn Fein has prioritised and on which it has made progress with the Judicial Council Bill 2017.  We have made a significant contribution to the area of policing and justice in this term.  We need garda&iacute; to be properly in touch with the demands of communities and accountable to them.  Public meetings hosted by joint policing committee community forums should influence local policing plans.  The Garda should prioritise what the community says works, such as having more garda&iacute; on foot patrol and bicycles and more juvenile liaison officers.  We call on the Garda to continue and enhance activities focused on disrupting illegal drug supply chains and eliminating the proceeds of drug-related crimes.  We need an aggressive pursuit of major drug traffickers, ensuring that the bigger players are caught, tried and receive appropriate sentences.  </p> <p> The motions relate to the Special Criminal Court and, in particular, the provisions under the 1998 and 2009 Acts relating to same.  The court was established under the Offences against the State Act during the Second World War.  Its current incarnation dates from 1972.  The reality is that the Offences Against the State Acts and the Special Criminal Court are ineffective relics of a conflict era, which have failed to deal with the new threats posed by organised crime.  It operates under the standard operating procedure of non-jury trials.  We should protect the right to a jury trial and implement the protections I outlined to ensure a fair trial and to ensure that the guilty can be convicted.  It is not sensible to perpetuate a situation whereby we are relying on an annual renewal of outdated emergency legislation.  We are using 20th century tools for what is a very different challenge in the 21st century.</p> <p> I have addressed the policing and legislative responses to organised crime, but there is also a need for a policy response.  The Minister recently appealed to young people to "drop the bling" and, referring to criminal gangs, stated, "They&rsquo;re all losers".  However well meaning, he somewhat missed the point.  People are attracted to criminality and gangs, whether serious or petty, because of a lack of alternatives, poverty and a lack of opportunity, not because of bling.  That does not deny people's agency or take away their responsibility for their choices, but we need investment in communities.  Crime can thrive where the State neglects communities, and it cannot be tackled by policing or legislation alone.  We need targeted and substantial investment in community development, education and employment, particularly in areas where organised crime gangs are recruiting members and where their malign influence is having a devastating effect on social cohesion.</p> <p> I again call for the Minister to take on the job of reviewing the legislation to ensure it is up to date, modern and fit for the challenges we face and to make certain that the response to organised crime is stepped up drastically.  We will engage enthusiastically with him and play our role to ensure that organised crime is given no quarter and that we have an effective policing, legislative and policy response to shut down this threat.</p></speech>

There is a difference between a matter that is to be determined by law, such as the number of county councils under Article 28A, and one to be determined in accordance with law.  The latter phrase denotes a certain basic standard of decision-making.  For example, a determination based on the toss of a coin could never be one made in accordance with law.</p><p>Previously, the scheduling of offences to the Offences Against the State Act 1939 was carried out by the Government.  Having regard to the fact that it meets and acts as a collective body, the role of the Minister for Justice and Equality in policing and the reporting relationship with the Garda Commissioner, it is reasonable to infer that a reasonable volume of information is available to it when making these decisions.  It is noteworthy that the Government filed affidavits as to its knowledge and its means of knowledge when its decisions were challenged in the case of Kavanagh <i>v. </i>the governor of Mountjoy Prison in 2001.  The courts clearly afforded the Government a reasonable margin of discretion in its decision, although it was careful not to exclude the possibility of a successful challenge.</p><p>In the 1998 and 2009 Acts, however, the Oireachtas arrogated to itself the determination as to the adequacy of the courts to administer justice.  It is stated in the body of the Acts that the ordinary courts are inadequate in these cases.  The Oireachtas then delegated to the two Houses the decision to be taken annually as to whether the courts remain inadequate.  In the absence of such decisions, the offences continue in existence but cease to be scheduled offences.  If a Kavanagh-style challenge were mounted today, what would an affidavit filed on behalf of the Houses of the Oireachtas contain as to their state of knowledge about any of these things?  These two determinations amount to what would in US practice be called legislative findings.  We are not used to them here, but the preambles to the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts provide examples whereby, &quot;a serious disturbance in the economy and a decline in the economic circumstances of the State have occurred, which threaten the well-being of the community; and whereas as a consequence a serious deterioration in the revenues of the State has occurred and there are significant and increasing Exchequer commitments in respect of public service pensions&quot;.  However, legislators could make those FEMPI findings simply by virtue of information officially provided to them under statute, including, for example, the quarterly Exchequer returns.  There is no comparable body of information provided to Oireachtas Members as to the adequacy of the criminal courts or the risk of corruption or intimidation of juries.</p><p>In the Abbeylara case, all the judges expressly recognised that Members of both Houses are entitled to make inquiries and to be informed through their committees in aid of the legislative power.  In this matter, the Oireachtas and, every year since, the two Houses, make findings which disturb the constitutional equilibrium.  They sit and debate in public, as do the committees.  We know what they have considered and, as such, we know what they have neglected to consider.  The record will show not that they arrived at the wrong conclusion on the evidence, but, rather, that they have had no evidence at all.  The adequacy of the ordinary courts to administer justice has never been debated by a committee or on the floor of either House.  The statutory report furnished by the Minister to both Houses recites the number of times each offence has been prosecuted, arrests made and so on, but it states nothing, good, bad or indifferent, as to the adequacy of the ordinary courts to administer justice.</p><p>It is fair to say that the report is detailed.  However, what is relevant is what is not included in it.  It refers to section 14 of the Act as providing that the offences created by it are to be scheduled offences for the purposes of the Offences Against the State Act 1939, and that scheduled offences are triable before the non-jury Special Criminal Court.  It goes on to state that section 14, which deals with scheduled offences under the Act, was utilised on 36 occasions last year.  It does not make reference to the fact that section 14 of the Act declares that &quot;the ordinary courts are inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice and the preservation of public peace and order&quot; in respect of each of those offences.  The Houses are being invited to renew that declaration on foot of a report that does not refer to the terms of the declaration expressly or by implication and which contains no information or opinion as to the adequacy of the ordinary jury courts.</p><p>The more solid and substantial evidential basis we require for renewal is one that expressly recognises and addresses the core question of whether jury courts are inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice and the preservation of public peace and order.  In the absence of evidence, how can the Houses arrive at a decision in accordance with law that section 14 of the 1998 Act should be continued?</p><p>If it is the case that the decision was not just on its merits wrong and grounded on inadequate evidence, but rather taken without reference to any evidence at all, it is not too hard to argue that the determination is not made in accordance with law as Article 38 of the Constitution requires and that it is vulnerable to legal challenge by a future defendant before the Special Criminal Court.  This is not a case in which a court would refuse on separation of powers grounds to second-guess a parliamentary opinion; it is, rather, a case in which a court might very well say that if the Houses of the Oireachtas insist on retaining for themselves the power to make decisions on these matters, they must take the basic step of informing themselves about the matters on which they are to decide.</p> <p> We propose two amendments to the motions.  The second amendment was ruled out of order as being equivalent to a direct negative to the motion.  The first amendment resolves that sections 2 to 4, inclusive, 6 to 12, inclusive, and 17 of the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 should continue in operation for the period beginning 30 June 2019 and ending 29 June 2020.  However, the amendment resolves that section 14 of that Act should not continue in operation.  The effect would be that all these offences would be continued but would be prosecuted in the ordinary way before the ordinary courts.  The reason given for declining to resolve that section 14 should continue in operation is "for want of any or any adequate information being presented to [the D&aacute;il], by way of a report under section 18 of that Act or otherwise, in order to enable the D&aacute;il to make an informed finding as to the inadequacy of the ordinary courts to secure the effective administration of justice and the preservation of public peace and order in relation to the offences".</p></speech>

These measures represent a serious attack on some key basic democratic principles.  The right to trial by jury, the right to silence and the right to call witnesses in a trial are all impinged.  There is also a lengthening of the time a person can be detained after arrest, a shift in the burden of proof, and the provision that the mere opinion of a Garda be treated as evidence.  The Socialist Party and Solidarity oppose these so-called emergency measures.  We have opposed them since their inception in 1998 and we will vote against their continued extension this year.</p>  <p>  These measures were introduced after the Omagh bombing in 1998.  The bombing was an atrocity.  Widespread shock and revulsion was felt by people on both sides of the Border, in all communities, and internationally.  The shock of the bombing and people's desire to see an end to such bombings were cynically exploited by the political establishment to erode democratic rights.  This legislation was significant, yet it was rushed through the D&aacute;il in less than 24 hours.  Incredibly, the text of the Bill was only made available to Deputies hours before it was voted on, giving no time to consider and tease out its implications.  This tradition has continued this year with the Government choosing not to give a report to the D&aacute;il, as it is meant to do, at least to give a formal reason these emergency measures should be continued.  At the time this legislation was rushed through, the House was told it was a necessary evil.  The then Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, described the measures as draconian, and the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform described the Act as harsh.</p>  <p>  We were led to believe in 1998 that this attack on democratic rights would be a temporary measure.  Each year, however, we have been told that this harsh and draconian law is still needed due to the current threats, whether sectarian paramilitaries, criminal gangs or international terrorism.  Governments, including members of Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il, the Labour Party and the Green Party and some Independents, have signed off on this for the past 20 years.  We welcome the conversion of the Labour Party this year and we will support its amendment seeking to prevent at least the extension of some of these measures.</p>  <p>  The history of the Troubles is one in which the British state brought in measures such as internment and Diplock courts.  The Irish State also brought in repressive measures.  None of these measures ended the conflict.  Paramilitary ceasefires were not brought about by repressive legislation.  What pushed back the conflict was the opposition to sectarian conflict in working-class communities, both Catholic and Protestant.  This prevented an escalation of the conflict and a descent into all-out sectarian war.  Draconian legislation is not the answer; in fact, it is counterproductive.  Terrorism and crime are fuelled by a number of factors.  Poverty, injustice, anger against discrimination and racism, outrage against imperialist wars, and alienation from the political establishment can all be exploited to recruit young people and direct them down the reactionary and dead-end road of terrorism or crime.  People should not trust this capitalist establishment with these laws.</p>  <p>  Attacks on democratic rights that have been brought in under the guise of combating terrorism or serious crime have been continually used as a weapon to clamp down on people's right to protest and against social movements.  An example of this is graphically seen today in Hong Kong, where there is an attempt to bring in a repressive law on extradition.  This would legalise the Chinese dictatorship's abductions of political dissidents in Hong Kong.  This is being met with mass resistance, with 1 million people taking to the streets of Hong Kong last Sunday.  The regime is now attempting to use brutal repression to cut across this movement.  Today 50,000 students closed roads and blocked parliament from debating the new legislation.  Police launched tear gas and rubber bullets.  At least two people have suffered serious head wounds from rubber bullets.  There are indications that a strike led by the teachers' union is commencing in response.  In order to put an end to this new law and to defend democratic rights, this strike can and should now spread.  The Socialist Party and Solidarity stand with workers and young people against this repressive law and for full democratic rights in Hong Kong and China.  It is essential that this movement spreads into China and is linked in with the workers' movement.</p>  <p>  We stand against the repression taking place on the streets of Hong Kong and, in the same spirit and the same tradition, we stand against the repressive legislation put forward by the Minister and the Government for renewal in this D&aacute;il.</p></speech>

He said such a review "should focus on how to modernise the criminal justice system to make it responsive to the needs of Ireland in 2017".  No review was ever conducted.  We have seen little serious reform of our criminal justice system in the lifetime of this Government.  Instead, the Government has wasted its time with the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act  2017 and the Bill the Minister of State, Deputy Moran, introduced.  The retention of the Special Criminal Court means we will continue to be selective in how we recognise and apply human rights.  We are into very dangerous territory when such selectivity is applied to rights that should be universal.  Everyone should have the right to a trial by jury of his or her peers.  Instead we have in Ireland a bizarre and deeply unjust situation whereby the DPP gets to decide how courts will try certain offences and whether certain offences should be tried by a jury.  These laws are counterproductive and have a radicalising effect.  Gangland crime and terrorism derive from deep structural inequalities in society, and successive Governments have failed absolutely to deal with these inequalities.</p>  <p>  In November last year, the UN special rapporteur on counterterrorism, Fionnuala N&iacute; Aol&aacute;in, said the Special Criminal Court is operating a permanent emergency and that people do not even notice any more that exceptional powers have become the norm.  We are normalising what is at best a selective approach to the recognition and application of human rights.  The Special Criminal Court was initially established to deal with terrorism but its jurisdiction has expanded to include serious crime.  This exploitation of emergency power functions is in the same manner as disaster capitalism, the so-called shock doctrine.  The special rapporteur was particularly critical of this slippage or mission creep of the court and compared it to the aftermath of 9/11, when there was a proliferation of counterterrorism norms and practices across the world, spawning de facto and permanent emergencies in national practice.  She said, "The island of Ireland, more so than many parts of the world, has experienced emergency law, emergency practice, and the seepage of the exceptional into the ordinary system in ways that has not served the rule of law nor the protection of human rights well."</p></speech>
