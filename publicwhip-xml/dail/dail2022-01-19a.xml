Others have met violent deaths going to work, coming home, in daylight and in dark.  The outpouring of grief and anger across the land is a powerful expression of solidarity with the Murphy family who now face the unimaginable heartbreak of coming to terms with life without Ashling.  The streams of stories, personal experiences and traumatic narratives that flood our airwaves are stark testimony that male violence against women, harassment of women and degradation of women are endemic, pervasive and ever-present in Irish life.  We now stand at a crossroads and there is a choice to be made.  We must choose action - united, persistent action, to end the violence, the threat of violence, the fear of violence that blights the lives of women and girls.  We must make that choice and we must mean it.</p>  <p>  The roots of sexism and misogyny run deep.  The Ireland of religious dogma, that defined women as men's property, that excluded women from the world of work, that relegated us as objects and confined us to domestic chores, that confined and exploited the poor and vulnerable in laundries and mother and baby homes and that stole babies from the arms of their mothers, that Ireland defined and disfigured the lives of generations of women; our grandmothers, our mothers.  Much has changed.  The face of misogyny has changed but it has not gone away.  Today's Ireland, our place, our daughters' Ireland, is ugly and dangerous still, whether it is the unsolicited sexual photos, the online stalking and abuse and harassment in shops, in nightclubs, on the bus, on bicycles, at work or at college.  It is the intimidation of lewd commentary and catcalling.  It is the never-ending mansplaining.  It is the gaslighting and the coercive control.  It is rape.</p> <p>All of this and more is the circuitry of misogyny, a culture that enables violence against women and then looks the other way.  Hundreds of women have met the ultimate brutality of this toxic culture.  The fear of random attack is terrifying but for many women, the terror is at home and the most dangerous person their intimate partner.  Yet, every year, women and their children are turned away from refuges because there are no places for them.  We have to be honest.  While women suffer, the State penny-pinches and, as the words of lip service ring in their ears, vital services struggle to survive.</p> <p> The murder of Ashling Murphy must mark a turning point.  Leaders must lead.  We need now to stand up and be counted.  The public appetite for action now matches the scale of male violence that women face every day.  This is our chance to turn the tide.  This a rare moment for change.  The safety, dignity and lives of women demand political action and unity.  A meeting of political leaders must now be convened urgently.  We need to unite in agreeing on and driving immediate and long-term action to eliminate violence against women.  I ask the Taoiseach to convene this meeting as Head of Government.</p> <p> This is a heartbreaking time, but hearts and lives have been repeatedly broken and each time, once the initial grief cools, the political system goes back to business as usual.  This cannot happen again.  </p></speech>

Aonta&iacute;m leis an Leas-Cheann Comhairle chun &aacute;r gcomhbhr&oacute;n a dh&eacute;anamh le muintir U&iacute; Mhurch&uacute; as b&aacute;s Ashling.  N&iacute;l aon amhras ach go bhfuil an t&iacute;r go l&eacute;ir an-bhuartha ar fad maidir leis an m&eacute;id at&aacute; tarlaithe.  T&aacute; tuiscint againn go l&eacute;ir le hathair, m&aacute;thair agus le teaghlach uilig U&iacute; Mhurch&uacute; ag an am seo.  In the first instance, I join with the Leas-Cheann Comhairle in expressing my profound sympathy once again to the family of Ashling Murphy, her parents Raymond and Kathleen, sister Amy, brother Cathal, boyfriend Ryan, her wider family and the entire community for the violent and horrible manner of her death.  She was taken from an entire community and was someone who gave so much to that community.  As a national school teacher, she personified the essence of national school teaching in this country that, as I have said previously, is the bedrock upon which much has been built in our society down through the decades.  She encapsulated a lot in her love of music and sport but, above all, what one was left with yesterday was a sense of the extraordinary embeddedness of the Murphy family, and of Ashling, in the wider community, which was there in all forms and facets.  This horrible crime tore at the heart of that value of community and family.  I wanted to say that.</p>  <p>  I agree with the Deputy that this is a watershed in our society's approach to the undermining of women and violence towards women.  There can be no tolerance for that.  The Minister for Justice has been working on a national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  That will be completed in early March.  I can say to the Deputy that the Minister for Justice will, as a result of that, lead the policy area on this matter but will also be responsible for the provision of services.  This is so there will be, as the Deputy and others have articulated previously, a coherent, single key leadership role within the Cabinet in this area, which will then be accountable to the Cabinet committee, chaired by me, in respect of making sure there will be delivery on all aspects of that strategy and existing policies.</p>  <p>  I will convene a meeting of leaders.  I think that is a good idea.  I believe that statements on this matter from all leaders will be articulated later in the House.   </p> <p>I will say openly that this should be a cross-party Oireachtas approach mirroring what society wants to do.  In that context, men need to listen more and hear women more on this and related issues.</p> <p> The Deputy is correct that Ashling is not the first woman to have been murdered violently in this manner.  We need to eliminate this from our society, as well as all aspects of the undermining of women in a misogynistic way or in any other form.  That takes a multifaceted approach embracing prevention, protection, security and education.  In short, it needs a sea change in culture, not just legislation and initiatives, to eliminate this.</p></speech>

We all send our sympathies and condolences to the Murphy family at this awful time.  There are not words really to describe the trauma and grief that family and, as the Taoiseach said, the entire community is experiencing.  An ocean of tears has been shed for Ashling and the hundreds of women who have lost their lies in a violent manner.</p>  <p>  The systemic nature of male violence towards women has now been identified and called out in a powerful way and so it falls to us as legislators, elected representatives and political leaders to lead the way.  That is the expectation of us.</p>  <p>  I share and endorse the Taoiseach's position that we need an all-of-Oireachtas approach to this.  This is not a moment for party politics or division, but for unity.  It is my strong belief that it is imperative that the Taoiseach, as Head of Government, is at the wheel and leads on this matter.  The danger is that when the shock lessens, the initial grief subsides, the headlines have been written, the cameras go away and that poor family is left with the awfulness of their loss, the real test will be what we do in here. </p>  <p>  We need an all-of-society and whole-of-community response to this complex issue.  We cannot legislate misogyny away but we will never see an end to this endemic violence unless we get our act together and are clear that we mean business.  That initial meeting of all political leaders should be the beginning of our collective journey and endeavour.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-01-19a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="14:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022011900005#C00300"><p>I agree with what the Deputy has said.  Delivery and the maintaining of momentum on this will be key.  The week before Ashling's murder, I met the Minister for Justice and, separately, the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, looking ahead.  We focused on the issue and on the issue that others have raised in this House about having a focal point and a lead Department.  The sector outside, that is, the people advocating on behalf of women, had been looking for this as well.</p>  <p>  That issue has been resolved in terms of the Department of Justice leading on all aspects of this and having a chain of accountability to the Taoiseach's office and to a Cabinet subcommittee and working with the Oireachtas through either a specific committee or the relevant Oireachtas committee to make sure there are timelines to get things done.  The proposed hate crime legislation is important and Coco's Law has been important.  Supporting a Victim's Journey and the No Excuses campaign are important initiatives that have been undertaken.</p> <p>A comprehensive, co-ordinated approach is required and, above all, delivery is required on all fronts.  The centrepiece of this strategy, as I said, is prevention, protection, prosecution and the co-ordination of policies.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-01-19a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1610" speakername="Alan Kelly" time="14:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022011900006#D00200"><p>On behalf of the Labour Party, I extend sympathies to the family of Ashling Murphy, her boyfriend, Ryan, her family, community, colleagues, friends and pupils.  I think of them a lot.  It is a terrible tragedy that has deeply touched us all, across the country, and it demands a serious and collective response from all of us in this House.  I welcome the question-and-answer session just beforehand and I agree totally.  The word "watershed" is often used in this House for many different things.  Sometimes the word is misplaced and sometimes those sentiments are not followed up on.  We are all guilty of that.  This, however, must be a watershed moment when it comes to violence against women.  It simply must be.</p>  <p>  Collectively, we are all leaders.  Everyone who has been elected to this House is a leader.  We must address violence against women in this country, which has ended so many lives.  I was taken by a piece broadcast on "Prime Time" last night, which went back 60 years.  It contained many reminders of cases that might have been forgotten.  It was shocking.  Whatever we collectively have to do, we must do.  The new special committee on gender equality that my colleague, Deputy Bacik, will be chairing will have an important role in helping us all to deal with domestic, sexual and gender-based violence in Ireland.</p>  <p>  I want to ask the Taoiseach another question relating to the leaving certificate.  I ask it in an honest way.  We in the Labour Party have asked it before.  Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, our education spokesperson, has been asking the question since July.  Thousands of students are waiting for an answer from the Government as to whether the leaving certificate will go ahead as normal or whether there will be a hybrid leaving certificate, which we have been proposing since July.  Those students need an answer.  We absolutely believe in a hybrid leaving certificate.  Those students have gone through a difficult two years and have lost much time despite the best efforts of teachers, schools etc.  Some 10,000 people, the majority of whom are students, have signed a petition.  There are students outside today.  We know two thirds of the students' union secondary representatives who were surveyed favoured the hybrid model.  I accept it cannot be a carbon copy of what happened last year.  I accept there are additional difficulties.  However, a move to the hybrid model is absolutely necessary.  The stress these students are under at the moment is enormous.  I have spoken to many of them across the country and in my own constituency.  With oral, mock and practical examinations coming up, we need a quick decision.  I hope we are coming into a different phase of the pandemic.  Perhaps we are moving out of it, although we do not know that because the pandemic has been full of surprises.  I commend the Minister for Education because she got the decision right last year and the year before that.  I ask, on behalf of all of these students who deserve a fair chance like others, that the leaving certificate will be a hybrid again this year.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-01-19a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="14:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022011900006#D00300"><p>I thank the Deputy for his question and his earlier remarks.  We will work together on the issue of gender-based violence and violence against women.</p>  <p>  On the question of the leaving certificate, we fully accept the challenges and we know that the education and learning experience of many students has been disrupted this year.  All of the planning for the 2022 examinations was guided, above all, by the prevailing public health advice with regard to the well-being of students.  Significant adjustments have already been made to this year's leaving certificate to allow for that disruption that has been experienced by students.  Adjustments to the assessment arrangements for the 2022 leaving certificate examinations were announced in August 2021.  They were designed to take account of the disruption to learning experienced by students in the early part of 2021 and to make allowance for some possible further disruption in the 2021-22 school year.</p> <p>They allow for greater choice for students while retaining the familiar overall structure of the exam.  The Department of Education and State Examinations Commission, SEC, have sought to make as much information as possible on examinations available to students as early as possible.  That is why the adjustments were communicated in the summer of last year.</p> <p> Last month, it was announced that the oral and practical examinations will take place outside of school time over the first week of the school Easter holidays.  The SEC aims to minimise disruption to teaching and learning by taking that initiative.  These were all pre-emptive moves that were taken conscious of disruption that had already happened.</p> <p> The Minister and Department continue to engage with the partners and stakeholders.  A meeting of the advisory group on planning for State examinations, which involves the student unions and patrons, is taking place tomorrow.  That is an important forum for the Minister and all the stakeholders involved, namely, students, parents, teachers, school leaders, the SEC, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, and higher education bodies.</p> <p> The Deputy made an important point when he said the leaving certificate examination cannot be a carbon copy of last year.  There are challenges with the hybrid model in year three.  We will all be aware that in the previous two years, the Minister with responsibility for higher education, Deputy Harris, in engagement with the third level sector, managed to squeeze many extra places.  That happened for two years in succession.  The capacity of the third level sector to provide that equivalent number of places this year may not be as high, and that is to put it charitably.  That creates an additional challenge.  We know hybrid models can create grade inflation.  There are, therefore, challenges with the hybrid model that have to be assessed.  I need to put that out there.  The Minister and Department will engage with all the representative groupings in a meeting of the advisory group tomorrow.  I accept the need for clarity as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

I rarely come in here and say something like that.  The mental health of the students is paramount.  I know there are issues with regard to third level.  Those who have gone into third level this year and last year have performed quite well after what they have had to go through, which is great.  This year's students, however, lost three months in fifth year.  They have suffered an awful lot again this year.  That is not fair and fairness should be the medium by which we decide this.</p>  <p>  I believe the leaving certificate and its role will change dramatically in the coming years.  We all know that.  This year will possibly and hopefully be the last year.  It has to be a hybrid system.  I know there are challenges given the situation with the junior certificate but there are definitely ways in which that can be dealt with.</p>  <p>  I understand the advisory group is coming together tomorrow.  As a follow-up, if the Taoiseach is not going to give an answer on whether a hybrid model will be offered, will he at least propose some date by which a decision will be made for the thousands of people who are watching and all the students who will look back on this on social media?  Will it be next week, for instance?</p></speech>

I understand, however, the need for clarity and certainty for the students in terms of understandable worry, anxiety and stress levels.  That is absolutely clear.  The Minister is also clear on that front.  I am not in a position to give the Deputy a date or timeline for this particular process to be brought to a conclusion.  I ask him to accept our sincerity in understanding the need for providing certainty and clarity as quickly as we possibly can.</p>  <p>  We do not want to compound the situation for students either.  With the qualifications framework, there are pathways for students, from further education and apprenticeships right through to third level education.  There is a danger with three years in a row, in that by not perhaps having the same capacity as we have managed to extract from third level in the previous two years, we could create other issues that may cause stress and anxiety students.  All that has to go into the mix in terms of assessment.  It is fair to point out that these are real issues facing students.</p></speech>

I think all of us females in this country, if we are honest, have at some stage our lives experienced a mix of harassment, abuse, sexual threats, aggression and misogyny.  Some people have experienced it much more than others, such as the 244 women who have died at the hands of misogynist violence in this country.</p>  <p>  It is a universal experience.  We need now to own up to the universality of the oppression of women.  It does not just stem from a country like Ireland.  It is universal.  The UN figures on violence against women and on the killing of women right across the globe are extraordinary.  It comes from a system that oppresses one gender in favour of the other.  It does so to use their labour - their place in the home still remains in our Constitution by the way - and their image and abuse of their image to make lots and lots of money through very violent, sexualised porn.  For that reason, it is very important that the Taoiseach gives a commitment to changing the sex education regime for young boys and girls.  Four years ago, the Bill that we tabled on objective sex education passed Second Stage.  It is still sitting on Committee Stage.  The key issue in that Bill is that it has to be non-ethos based.  Some 92% of our schools are run by the Catholic Church and that church, we believe, is incapable of delivering the non-ethos-based sex education that is required.</p>  <p>  The Istanbul Convention, which we signed up to, calls from one refuge place for domestic violence sufferers per 10,000 of the population.  Currently, Dublin should have 135 refuge places, but it has 29.  Cork, the Taoiseach&rsquo;s own city, should have 54, but it has six.  We are providing 29% of the Istanbul target.  Those are two things that the Taoiseach could move on immediately.  I heard him say that the Minister will take responsibility and that there will be cross-party co-operation.  However, there are two immediate and urgent issues that we need to change.  That is the provision of services for domestic violence and to move from a budget of &euro;30 million given to Tusla to deal with this issue, against a budget of &euro;88 million which was given to the greyhound and horse industry last year.  It is appalling that the lives of women are less valued than the cruelty administered to dogs and horses.</p>  <p>  I want to ask the Taoiseach how we can trust a Government which last year accepted a commissioned report and the mother and baby homes when people are protesting outside today saying that there is not enough redress for them and that they do not accept that the truth in that report reflects their experience.  Yet, we are sitting in front of a Government which accepted that lock, stock and barrel.  Again, it has let down a cohort of women who are victims of the legacy of systemic violence and abuse.  I have two questions.  How can we trust the Taoiseach?  What will he do immediately about the budgets for refuge and sex education, which are utter changes in this country that are required?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-01-19a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022011900008#F00300"><p>First, I agree wholeheartedly with the overarching principle that the Deputy has articulated on the need to eliminate all forms of violence against women and to create the policies and the mechanisms for the delivery of those policies to achieve that.  As I said, the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, has been working, to be fair, over the last 12 months on an overarching national strategy for domestic violence, sexual violence and gender-based violence more generally.  That should be completed by early March.  In addition to that, the Minister will be taking the lead role not just in policy but in the provision of services.  That includes the allocation of funding for more refuge places.  Better than that will be a more focused, stand-alone provision, which will not necessarily be through the existing system for the provision of centres but rather a more focused departmental-led approach.</p> <p>That will get things done much faster in terms of provision.  I assure the Deputy that it will not be an issue of capital resources when providing additional places and centres, or the ongoing wraparound services that will be required for children in such circumstances.</p> <p> On relationships and sexuality education, I believe and agree that it should not be ethos-based - that is without question - and that a national curriculum should be implemented irrespective of the patronage of a school.  However, a legislative approach alone is not adequate at all because the more important issue is that relationships and sexuality education requires capacity supports in schools for those who teach and provide the curriculum.  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment has been engaged for quite some time in a fundamental review of the junior certificate syllabus on relationships and sexuality.  That is coming to a conclusion.  I met the Minister for Education a fortnight ago, ahead of this year's programme, and asked that we accelerate consideration of the senior cycle.</p> <p> When I say "capacity", I am also referring to the teacher training college level.  There should be modules on relationships and sexuality as a core part of the overall curriculum in our teacher training colleges.  That is particularly important in those years.  I also put forward the idea that there should perhaps be a post of responsibility in every school and that this person would have the authority and responsibility to deliver the programme throughout the school.  There would have to be very comprehensive in-service programmes for teachers in primary and second level schools because that is where there have been challenges.  I was involved in the original introduction of relationships and sexuality education in 1998, 1999 and 2000 and have monitored, watched and evaluated how it has progressed.  With all curriculum change, the most fundamental prerequisite is comprehensive investment in teachers through continuing professional development as well as the original education through teacher training colleges.</p></speech>

The fundamental thing the Bill we introduced four years ago would have done was remove the barrier of ethos in the delivery of the curriculum.  The Government is going to have to address that because 92% of our national schools are run according to a Catholic ethos and it is up to the schools to refuse to implement objective sex education if it flies in the face of their ethos.  Will the Taoiseach please address that in his next answer?</p>  <p>  The matter of refuge places is hugely important.  We have been campaigning for refuge places in Carlow and D&uacute;n Laoghaire and I am sure other Deputies have been campaigning locally as well.  Nine counties have no refuges.  It is outrageous that 42% of the Istanbul Convention is not being implemented by this country.  The Government must address that immediately, without going through the rigours of setting up special committees.  It should give the funding to Tusla to provide the places, keep hostels open, stop closing them and create new ones where they are required.  Some 3,000 victims of sexual abuse at a minimum - I do not have the exact figure in front of me - were left outside of supports during the Covid pandemic because of the dearth of spaces.  That has to be addressed immediately, not at some vague time in the future.  I ask the Taoiseach to take both those points on board.</p></speech>

We have had three Departments, namely, those responsible for housing, children and justice, in this system and that is not optimal.  The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage has largely provided for the refuge places to be developed through the new capital assistance scheme, CAS, and so on.  Too much has depended on groups coming to the Government or authorities saying they want to set something up.  An audit has taken place.  Basically, from the centre out we should now be designing what a modern refuge centre should be all about, including proper, high-quality facilities.  We need to design that and do it and that is what we intend to do with regard to refuges.  That would speed this up in some areas.  The system works in some areas because of local activism but it cannot just depend on local activism.  Some counties have very little provision at the moment.  Deputy Murnane O'Connor has been on to me about Carlow, as have others.</p> <p>That is an example and an illustration.  We need to do that better.<br/><br/>I agree that there is a need to change legislation in respect of relationships and sexuality, but I have to stress it has to be an overarching package that involves the curriculum-----</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-01-19a.31" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1603" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="14:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022011900010#H00500"><p>I too wish to be associated with the expressions of sympathy to the Murphy family on the senseless murder of Ashling Murphy.  I support the cross-party and cross-group approach to the issue of violence against women.</p><p>I will raise a separate issue with the Taoiseach.  The Northern and Western Regional Assembly has just published a report on regional vacancy and dereliction, which shows that 44,905 residential and commercial properties are empty in the five Connacht counties and the three Border counties of Donegal, Cavan and Monaghan.  This is one third higher than Ireland's total national annual housing requirement of 33,000 homes.  There are whole streets in our towns and villages that have not had a football kicked on them in a generation.  Some 40% of the vacant homes in this country are in these eight counties.  Many of them are vacant family homes close to schools and services and also have 1,000 Mbps broadband outside their doors.</p><p>The housing crisis is not just about a lack of houses.  It is also about our failure to have empty homes occupied by families, especially those in our towns and villages.  The fact is that if these homes were occupied, it would have an immediate dividend to the State, rural Ireland and homeless families.  I have been making this point for some years.  Thankfully, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, and the Government have taken on board my suggestions.  A whole section of the new Housing for All strategy is focused on how we can bring families back into empty houses throughout our country.  However, that strategy was published last September and we still await its implementation.</p><p>To take County Roscommon as an example, we have a perverse situation in that we have a vacancy rate of 14% and 4,090 empty homes in the county but just 18 homes for rent and 230 for sale, according to <i>daft.ie</i>.  Local auctioneers have waiting lists of people looking to buy or rent family homes.  In east Galway, where demand for housing is considerably higher, many of our villages do not have access to any wastewater treatment facilities.  In fact, in a number of instances, raw sewage is running through the streets.</p><p>There needs to be a strategic approach to addressing this problem, rather than trying to dump responsibility back on councils, which have not been able to utilise the repair and leasing scheme to bring vacant properties in need of repair back into use for social housing or repair the 3,900 local authority houses that remain empty throughout our country.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-01-19a.32" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="14:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022011900010#H00600"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  I welcome the report from the Northern and Western Regional Assembly on vacancy and dereliction based on its analysis of the region.  I did not realise Deputy Naughten had written a chapter in the Housing for All strategy but he is correct about the section that deals with the issue of vacant houses.  There is a particular need, through a towns first policy, to get vacant or derelict houses back in play and to reconstruct them and enable their reconstruction.  There are a number of ways in which we can do that.  We can tax vacant properties to incentivise people to get them developed.  We can create incentives, which we will, to help people to move towards refurbishing or bringing a house back into use as a home and residential property, which is the desired outcome, as well as creating activity within a town and village.</p>  <p>  The study concentrates on towns and villages throughout the north west.  I would like to engage with the Deputy to go through it in greater detail in terms of the models used and so on and to identify those houses and see, on a more micro level, whether we can get some of these issues dealt with on the ground.</p> <p>There has been a range of schemes prior to Housing for All - the repair-and-lease scheme being one - that do not seem to have got the desired return or output.</p> <p> The interesting news I heard just before I came into the House was that in 2021 there were 30,724 commencement notices.  There is significant evidence of the construction sector really picking up.  We had two lockdowns in 2020 and 2021 that affected construction output, but there has been such a significant bounceback that we have had 30,724 commencements.  That augurs well.  It is the highest number for quite a long time.  That is part of the approach.</p> <p> In terms of the rejuvenation of the regions - the north-west being one - we need a targeted, focused policy in terms of enabling vacant houses that have been described in this report to be brought back into use for families or for people generally who are either on the housing list or who are in search of affordable housing.  There is a range of measures in Housing for All that can enable us to do that.</p> <p> In terms of local authority and social housing, since this Government came into office, 5,500 social homes have been brought back into use over 18 months.  These would be the typical local authority voids and that is through dedicated funding.  Some 1,500 void homes are to be remediated and brought back into use this year.  Those are important measures to counter the level of vacancy that has been described in the report.  Local authorities will have a significant role to play in this.</p></speech>

Despite the publication of the Housing for All pathway to maximise the efficient use of our existing housing stock last September, the Government passed the reforms to the nursing home fair deal scheme without addressing the treble tax on nursing home residents who wish to rent out their former family homes.  Our towns, villages and rural areas will benefit from this plan but there is a need to follow through with the necessary actions, especially in the west, the north west and the Border counties where there are such very high vacancy rates.</p></speech>

There have been issues - these have been argued to and fro - in terms of protecting people and safeguarding the rights of those who may be in nursing homes.  That said, the overarching priority now is housing and the provision of all available units for the purposes of housing.  Work is on the way to resolve that issue.</p></speech>

I want another debate, notwithstanding that there already are two debates, about the bail laws, free legal aid and the lack of tagging.  Foot-dragging on all these issues has been going on in the Department of Justice and on the part of successive Governments with which the Taoiseach has been involved.  I respect the premise that people are innocent until proven guilty, but too many individuals are availing of and making money out of the free legal aid system.</p></speech>

There are two different groups.  Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n is in the same group as Deputy Shanahan, not Deputy Mattie McGrath, so a member of the group cannot speak a second time.  I beg Deputy Shanahan's pardon but I lost concentration for a moment.  I call Deputy Pringle.  Does the Deputy wish to raise an issue related to the Order of Business?</p></speech>

On the Order of Business for this week, I know it happened prior to the announcement of business, but the Attorney General announced on Monday that he would not recommend the publication of the Brandon report, the full publication of which has been supported by the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and the relevant Minister.  We need to schedule a debate on this matter because it is vitally important that the report be published.  I ask that my request be considered.</p></speech>

That speaks to the terrible and consistent failure to provide adequate mental health services and supports for young people.</p> <p>I have asked at the Business Committee that the Government would facilitate as a matter of urgency a debate on youth mental health services which are, quite frankly, a scandal.  There are cases I am dealing with at the moment where the mothers of children are similarly afraid that their children's lives are in danger because of the lack of supports being provided for them.  This is a matter of urgency and I would like a commitment from the Government that it will facilitate an urgent debate on youth mental health services.</p></speech>

I do not think we can change the order this week.  As the Deputy knows, there is a wider issue of legacy.  There was also the commemoration of the Teebane massacre last week and the relatives there are looking for closure, with no one brought to justice there.  The issue of "Person K" clearly requires focus of attention.  Therefore, I do not have an issue with a debate but I think we have to be even-handed in terms of the legacy issues because there have been a lot of terrible atrocities carried out and people have had no closure in respect of them at all.  I will leave it to the Business Committee to work out the arrangements for such a debate.</p>  <p>  In response to Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, has already said he is willing to come before the Oireachtas Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence.</p></speech>

Many Members in the House would like to examine those issues but would rather do it in a detailed way.  Maybe the relevant committee could take up that challenge in the first instance.  Again, we have a fairly packed agenda this week and it may not be possible to include that this week.</p>  <p>  Similarly, on Deputy Pringle's point, we can have a debate in regard to the Brandon report as soon as it can be arranged and scheduled but I do not think it will be possible this week.</p>  <p>  In response to Deputy Boyd Barrett, I understand the Business Committee has already agreed, or the Government has agreed, to the taking of a youth mental health debate next week.  That is very important and I share the Deputy&rsquo;s concerns.  Therefore, that would be one we should all commit to doing next week.  The Chief Whip has informed me that the Business Committee has already raised this issue.  That should be facilitated and we will then see if we can accommodate the other requests that people have made.</p></speech>

I want to return to the Police Ombudsman's report into Operation Greenwich, which my colleague has just raised.  We have known for a long time that collusion between the British state and loyalist death squads was rife.  Indeed, it was a central component of Britain's dirty war in Ireland, a concerted campaign of murder that targeted the nationalist community, its leaders, its human rights lawyers and Sinn F&eacute;in members and elected representatives.  As the Taoiseach knows, the 19 killings and two attempted murders that this report deals with raise the most serious of questions yet the publication of this report so far was met by silence from both the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  I am bothered with this.  I would like to know when we will hear a full and complete response from the Taoiseach and the Government, and also if the Taoiseach has made contact with the British Prime Minister in light of this report.</p></speech>

We know about it, and there have been various investigations and inquiries.  The panoply of intelligence operations in Northern Ireland, not just in loyalism but also in its relationship and engagement with republican paramilitaries, has been well-documented.  Operation Kenova is ongoing.  Many people lost their lives as a result of that level of activity and engagement by security forces with all paramilitaries.  It is a murky and sordid narrative of collusion that resulted in the unlawful murder of many people.  It is unacceptable.</p></speech>

This is something we called for in May 2020.  I want to give the Taoiseach an opportunity to outline exactly what it will involve and who will qualify for it.  There seems to be quite a bit of confusion out there.  For instance, will community home help workers, family carers and those who work in pharmacies qualify?  Broadly speaking, we all agree that they should.  I ask the Taoiseach to clarify that.  The T&aacute;naiste previously suggested on numerous occasions that people in the wider civil and public service, like those in the Department of Social Protection, should also benefit.  Is that suggestion off the table?  Is the Taoiseach ruling out providing anything to transport workers, postal workers, garda&iacute;, members of the Defence Forces, etc.?  Will the Taoiseach urge the private sector to come along the road with the Government and do something similar for its workers as well, particularly for those in retail?</p></speech>

They have faced many challenges and have risen to the task, especially in our health services among those caring for patients on the front line.  There have been a number of waves since the original one, namely, the Alpha wave, the Delta wave and now the Omicron wave.  Time and again, front-line services have been put under enormous pressure.  We have given detailed consideration to them and earlier today the Government approved a package of measures to recognise these efforts.  A public holiday will be held on 18 March next in recognition of the efforts of the general public and of all workers during the Covid-19 pandemic and in remembrance of those who lost their lives.</p></speech>

As one of the other Deputies mentioned, there are immediate things that can happen and that need to happen.  A report at the end of last year from the Rape Crisis Network Ireland stated that in some instances survivors of sexual violence have to wait over a year before they can get counselling and those wraparound supports.  While the strategy is fundamental, it will not help those victims in the short term.  Someone who experienced sexual violence last week or who will experience it next week will not have the services and supports they require now.

Many times in this Chamber and in the convention centre, the Taoiseach correctly described them as having been treated shoddily and shabbily by their former employer.  Debenhams took advantage of the pandemic to walk off and leave its workers high and dry.</p>  <p>They waged an heroic struggle which ended after more than 400 days with an agreement that they would be able to access a training fund of &euro;3 million.  Incredibly, to this day not a single cent has been paid out of that training fund.  The workers are faced with extensive red tape, with a very restrictive interpretation being applied by SOLAS to the rules around the disbursement of the fund.  For example, a worker who wanted to do an online course and to buy an appropriate office chair rather than using a kitchen chair was told that a letter was required and money could not be paid out in advance.  I ask the Taoiseach to instruct a Minister to meet the shop stewards.  Will he intervene to make sure that the money is paid out so that workers get what they are owed, even if it is less than they deserve?</p></speech>

The tender suggests a reduction of the helicopter bases from four to three and that the applicant companies can propose their own base configurations.  This is creating extraordinary unease in the south east in respect of capability in the maritime space and our ability to transfer cardiac patients from University Hospital Waterford during the 129 hours per week when our catheterisation lab is closed.  Members of the regional group along with Independent Senators in the Upper House have placed a motion to the Order Paper.  Will the Taoiseach make space next week on the Order of Business for a debate on the shortcomings of this contract?  Allowing this ten-year contract tender to proceed as presently described could significantly damage the capability of this critical service over the next decade.</p></speech>

They are our future and our hope for the future.  We should allow them to have a hybrid exam because of the amount of time they missed last year and this year, not to mention the uncertainty around returning to education, being educated, the conditions in which they are learning and the lack of investment in education.

Ms Keegan points out that it is almost 41 years since the terrible Stardust fire in Artane, Dublin, in which 48 young people died and 214 were injured.  The Attorney General announced on 25 September 2019 that the inquest must go ahead as this was in the public interest.  The Department of Justice leased the RDS in Ballsbridge for one year for the Stardust inquest and has spent nearly &euro;2 million out of a fund of &euro;8 million on renting and fitting out the RDS.  On 13 October 2021, the families of the Stardust victims and their legal team were advised by the coroner that after February, the lease expires.</p> <p>These families are really upset.  No venue has been tied down to continue the Stardust inquest from February onwards.  Can the Taoiseach give the House reassurance that he will intervene and expedite this urgent matter that is causing great distress to the families and that he will meet them about this?  </p></speech>

It is a tricky business when, in itself, Government spending can drive inflation.  The measures in the budget and targeted social welfare changes will help.  The announcement of a &euro;100 payment to assist fuel inflation was very welcome.  As we more further into January, will the Taoiseach outline when the Government will bring forward that legislation and when the payment might be made?</p></speech>

One of our roles as legislators is to ensure that the laws we have provide effective protection.  The Minister for Justice has spoken in the past of making strangulation a stand-alone offence.  Strangulation is a common and often fatal feature of domestic violence.  Similarly, the Law Reform Commission has recommended making stalking a stand-alone offence.  That is something that the Minister for Justice has said that she is open to and exploring.  When will we see legislation on these two areas brought to the House in order that the legislation on the Statute Book can contribute to the protection of women and to the sea change that we need and that the Taoiseach called for this morning?</p></speech>

Again, I will engage with the Minister for Justice.  These are issues that might be pursued through the relevant Oireachtas committee in some detail because they are very important issues in respect of that wider debate.  We should have a wide-ranging legislative provision to ensure there are no escape routes or hiding places for people who engage in such violence.</p></speech>

Ireland has the fifth largest number of billionaires in the world relative to its population.  The world's ten richest men more than doubled their fortunes from $700 billion to $1.5 trillion.  At the same time, the poorest workers and families in society have seen a drop in income.  Those ten men now have six times more wealth than the poorest 3.1 billion people.  Imagine, if we had a fair taxation system, what our health service, education and social welfare systems would look like.  We could invest in climate change measures without hitting families and workers hardest.  Has the Government any plans to introduce a genuine wealth tax?</p></speech>

The Oxfam report claims that the wealth of Ireland's nine billionaires has increased by &euro;18 billion to &euro;49 billion since the start of the pandemic.  The report admits that as Oxfam does not have data on individual wealth holdings, it makes estimates.  It starts by making estimates of aggregate wealth based on measures like GDP, stock market values and national savings.  These measures are very unlikely to produce reliable figures on wealth for Ireland.  GDP is not a reliable indicator of income let alone wealth in Ireland.  Neither is the price of, say, Ryanair stock, listed on the Irish stock market.  Oxfam would then assume that the wealth is distributed in a particular way across the population.  That is simply an assumption as it does not have comprehensive data on wealth distribution.  Using this approach, for example, Oxfam claims that 18,350 people in Ireland worth $5 million and above.  It concludes that a flat 1.5% wealth tax on this cohort of wealth, above $5 million, would raise &euro;4 billion.  I am not sure if we can have any confidence in that figure, to be honest.</p> <p>I point to an analysis of wealth taken by the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, in 2016 which found that if the French wealth tax system was replicated in Ireland, the yield would only be &euro;22 million.</p></speech>

Healthcare workers, front-line workers including hospice staff, cleaners, porters, clinical staff and private nursing home staff are all to be included.  I believe student nurses are also to be considered for a <i>pro rata</i>payment.  Will the Taoiseach clarify what the situation is for private care providers such as, for example, somebody working for Home Instead or one of those types of providers?  Will these people also be considered for this payment if they have been seconded or were working on behalf of the HSE?</p></speech>

I want to ask the Taoiseach about a matter I have been raising here on a very regular basis over the years, namely, derelict housing and the opportunities there to bring thousands and thousands of housing units back into use in a relatively short period.  I am asking that renewed focus be put on putting in place the proper conditions and incentives to ensure first-time buyers can avail of these properties and to ensure people who are currently hoarding these properties make them available on the market to first-time buyers.  The financial supports should be there for first-time buyers to do up these properties because as the Taoiseach is aware, the cost of materials and labour is incredibly high at the moment.  We all know these properties are there.  They are all over the place in all our communities.  We are in the middle of a housing crisis and the slowness with which these properties are being renovated is not acceptable.  More needs to be done.</p></speech>

It was raised earlier as well but Deputy Griffin has had a consistent interest in this.  It is the intention of the Government to introduce a vacant property tax next year.  The Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act 2021 introduced by the Minister for Finance has enabled Revenue to collect certain information on vacant properties in the local property tax, LPT, return forms submitted by residential property owners last month in respect of the new LPT valuation period 2022-25.  Those returns are currently being analysed by Revenue and included information on the quantity, locations and characteristics of long-term vacant properties as of 1 November 2021.  The Minister will receive the results of Revenue's analysis of this information early this year.  That analysis, together with other available sources of information will be used by the Minister and his officials to inform the optimum design of a vacant property tax.  It will be important in designing that tax to achieve and appropriate balance between placing enough pressure on vacant home owners to allow the measure to actually work as an incentive and ensuring any such tax does not arbitrarily or excessively penalise homeowners in a discriminatory way.</p></speech>

It has been horrific for us all.  On the subject of women's refuges, County Carlow has no women's refuge.  It is one of nine counties that does not have a women's refuge.  The review paused during Covid but reactivated in September 2020 and was expected to be finished in April 2021 but we have had no word on that review.  I ask the Taoiseach to get the review done so the likes of Carlow and other counties that do not have a women's refuge can have that addressed.  We are sending people to Waterford and Kilkenny.  It is just unacceptable.  It is important that we now show the women of the country who come to us that we are there to support them.</p></speech>

It has been stated by the Minister for Finance that there will be no change to the Exchequer as a result of the post-2013 houses coming on stream and the new scheme in general.  Would it be possible for the Taoiseach to confirm whether that means the extra money will be retained for self-funding by local authorities?

Mick Ryan, an Irish citizens and United Nations humanitarian worker was killed in the Ethiopian Airlines ET 302 crash on 10 March 2019.  His family are seeking justice in the US for his death.  Mick Clifford reported on this in last Saturday's edition of the <i>Irish Examiner</i>.  In December last year, Naoise Ryan, his widow, who is from Cork, along with the other victims' families, filed a motion in a US court arguing the US Government violated their rights under the Crime Victims' Rights Act through a process that allowed Boeing to escape criminal prosecution.  I believe Ms Ryan has made contact with the Taoiseach's office.

It provided door-to-door transport for people in wheelchairs and with severe mobility issues.  He did respond to me in a letter but to be honest the letter did not offer any comfort in terms of the need for the service to replace its buses.  It does not have the buses it now needs and the &euro;50,000 it needs due to its inability to raise funds during Covid.

The sector is in deep crisis at present.  We must ensure the group has a chance to come together again.  The Minister also needs to explain the reasons why the main recommendations the working group made were ignored.  One of the recommendations was the phasing out of peat up to 2030.

With the Ministers involved, we will work on that to follow it through.</p>  <p>  On the LPT, my understanding is that local authorities would be able to retain the surplus but I can get further clarification for Deputy Hourigan on that.</p>  <p>  On Deputy Sherlock's question, I have met Ms Ryan and have been engaged on an ongoing basis.  I have written to President Biden in respect of this.  Most recently, I have asked our embassy in Washington to take up the most recent phase of this campaign for justice.  I have a great belief in Irish people who work in the UN World Food Programme and in other programmes.  To me, it is the ultimate manifestation of our values.  It is awful that Mr. Ryan lost his life in the circumstances that he did and we must always do everything we can to support people and their families in situations like this.</p>  <p>  I will follow up on the matter raised by Deputy Boyd Barrett again to see what we can do before the deadline he mentioned for that service.</p>  <p>  On Deputy Nolan's question, my focus now, with the other Ministers, is to get something moving on this.

It works with the Office of the Government Chief Whip on issues that arise at the Business Committee and the Committee on Standing Orders and D&aacute;il Reform, including D&aacute;il reform proposals and amendments to Standing Orders.  The unit supports the Office of the Government Chief Whip in the implementation of the Government's legislation programme.  In addition, the unit assists the office of the leader of the Green Party in work relating to Cabinet, Cabinet committees and oversight of the implementation of the programme for Government.  In carrying out these duties, it provides detailed information on upcoming matters in the D&aacute;il and Seanad, highlights any new Oireachtas reform issues and provides assistance in engaging with the new processes arising from D&aacute;il reform.  The unit is staffed by three and a half whole-time equivalent staff, one principal officer, one and a half higher executive officer posts and one clerical officer.</p></reply>

There was a commitment in the programme for Government to have a referendum on housing but nothing is happening on these things.  There are consequences for real human beings as a result of the Government's failure to do something on this.</p>  <p>  On dozens of occasion, I have raised the plight of tenants in St. Helen's Court, D&uacute;n Laoghaire, a multi-unit apartment complex bought by two successive vulture funds.  Tenants who have lived there for years and years, who always paid their rent, are decent working people and never did a thing wrong will be in court in the first week of February, when the vulture fund will get an enforcement order to throw them out because legally it is allowed do so.  The vulture fund does not need the accommodation for family members.  It is not a so-called mom-and-pop landlord.  The fund has no reason to throw these tenants out other than to increase its profits and the value of that property.  By the way, 12 of the units in that property have now been sitting empty for two years, fully refurbished, not rented out to people and not leased to the council, but the vulture fund will not rent them to the tenants it is going to evict.</p>  <p>  The lawyer we got to represent the tenants in court said that there was no argument against this injustice but if the right to housing was enshrined in the Constitution, that lawyer would have a legal argument to protect these tenants, who have done nothing wrong, against a cruelly unjust eviction.  When will the Government address these kinds of unjust evictions and put the right to housing into the Constitution? </p></speech>

A special hotline was set up for people to report illegal gatherings.  Some 3,000 people were fined for attending social gatherings that broke the law, while another 700 were fined for organising those events.  Last summer, a group of young people socialising on South William Street were batoned simply for the crime of enjoying an outdoor summer.</p>  <p>  Instead of a visit by the Garda, the champagne party in the Department of Foreign Affairs in June 2020 got a visit from the Minister, Deputy Coveney.  He admits to visiting the office at 11.10 p.m., after the champagne had been popped.  He seems to be claiming that after opening the champagne and taking the picture they all went back to work late into the night.  Does the Taoiseach seriously expect people to believe that story?  Does he think the Garda should investigate this party or are Covid fines only for the little people?  Does he have confidence in an in-house investigation by a hand-selected civil servant or does he instead agree that the Minister should come before the House to answer questions on this matter? </p></speech>

Why then is the Government still entertaining the idea of a normal leaving certificate examination this summer?  To do so would fly in the face of the wishes of the large majority of sixth-year students, who made their views very clear in the Irish Second-Level Students Union, ISSU, poll.  Anyone who has been in touch with these students will know that real mental health pressures are bearing down.  The Government should not compound them by taking a clumsy approach to this issue.  Nor should the Government force these young people to compete against each other for a limited number of college places.  That is wrong.  It is doubly wrong in a pandemic year and it is wrong at a time when our society has a shortage of nurses, teachers, doctors and apprentices - I could go on.  The State should invest heavily in third level education to ensure that a college place is provided for all and end the rat race of the CAO system.  Will the Taoiseach listen to these young people or will he pretend to listen and then drive on with an unwanted, traditional leaving certificate?</p></speech>

I will ask about the lack of places for women and children seeking refuge from violence.  While presenting to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice last November, Mary McDermott from Safe Ireland stated:</p> <blockquote> 	Ireland's domestic violence response infrastructure, and in particular its accommodation infrastructure, is critically deficient.  These deficiencies place women and children at very real risk of grievous trauma, injury or fatality. </blockquote>  <p>Between March and August 2020 alone, there were 1,351 unmet requests for refuge.  It is completely and utterly unacceptable that women and children who need somewhere safe to stay have been turned away.  Will funding be urgently provided to ensure there are enough refuge places for women and children seeking somewhere safe away from violence?</p></speech>

As the Taoiseach knows, Mr. O'Halloran has been in China for more than 1,000 days at this stage.  He has spent another Christmas in China and is being held against his will.  He is the only Irish citizen ever to be subject to a Chinese exit ban, which has been implemented upon him even though he is not accused of any wrongdoing.  There is no complaint, allegation, charge or suspicion against Richard O'Halloran.  He is fully co-operating with the Chinese state on this matter.  He has a wife and four children in Ireland, who have suffered enormously from stress related to this.</p>  <p>  I understand that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, has not been directly involved in this for a long period, as is the case for the Taoiseach.  I also understand, from information I received today, that the European Commission has not been asked by the Government to help with this case as of yet.  It is incredible that we would, as a country, leave a citizen in this situation.  Maybe the country is not defending its citizen for economic or bigger reasons but I urge the Taoiseach to take this issue into his own hands and, diplomatically, try to achieve the freedom of Richard O'Halloran in order that he can go back to his family.  </p></speech>

There has been state-to-state engagement on this at all levels.  People at all levels of this State have communicated with their counterparts at all levels of the Chinese Government.  Unprecedented measures have been taken by the Government, through the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in respect of commitments given by this State regarding this issue.  I do not want to say anything more than that.  It is not true to say that this has not been attended to but, and the Deputy may not want to accept advice, there is a way of proceeding with this.  It is extremely frustrating and agonising for the family.  It is terrible that they have been without their father and husband for so long.</p> <p>We have worked on this, particularly the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and his officials, to get the best outcome.  I will leave it at that for the moment.  The Deputy might talk to the Minister who might brief him on the measures taken to date to secure Richard O'Halloran's return to Ireland.</p> <p> Deputy Boyd Barrett raised the right to housing.  The Government supports a right to housing constitutional amendment.  I am not clear yet as to whether an amendment of that kind would deal with the issues in St. Helen's Court.  Just because a senior counsel advances that argument, that does not necessarily mean it is the case.  There are specific issues, which the Deputy has highlighted, that need to be addressed now in terms of the tenants involved.</p> <p> There are issues in terms of protecting tenants in various situations from unacceptable activities.  In addition, having units vacant for so long is unacceptable in the current housing situation.  We want to deal with that through a number of measures, particularly the vacant property tax.  Across the board, from zoning to vacancy, we want to bring in a system that penalises vacancy and incentivises occupancy and protecting people.  One of the first tasks of the new housing commission is to work on a constitutional referendum on the right to housing.</p></speech>

We agreed on the importance of ongoing North-South co-operation and communication in this area.</p>  <p>  In November, I spoke by phone with the deputy First Minister as part of a series of calls with the Northern Ireland party leaders to discuss the ongoing talks on the Northern Ireland protocol.  I also spoke with the First Minister and deputy First Minister in Belfast on 8 October, when we all attended and addressed a conference on climate action, and again at the beginning of November at the COP26 leaders' summit in Glasgow.</p>  <p>  During my visit to Belfast, I also separately had meetings with the leaders of the five main political parties, including the deputy First Minister.  During these meetings, the main topics for discussion were the Northern Ireland protocol, legacy issues and the stability of the institutions.  I also briefly spoke with First Minister Paul Givan at the Ireland-New Zealand rugby test match in October.</p>  <p>  Regarding the North-South Ministerial Council, NSMC, plenary, it was decided by the NSMC at its last plenary meeting, which was hosted by the Irish Government in July, that the next plenary will be hosted by the Northern Ireland Executive.  We await a proposal from the Executive on the date and arrangements for that meeting.  Usually, this would have taken place in December and it is disappointing that it is yet to be scheduled.</p></reply>

He will appreciate that it is a brief update.  That is no fault of his or anyone in the Government.  That is the striking issue here.  North-south relations are not operating at their optimum due to a political decision by a certain party in Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  I note that the last telephone conversation call was in the area of dealing with Covid-19, where back and forth discussion needs to be increased in the coming weeks as we look to loosen restrictions and possibly moving away from the wave of the current variant.  Will the Taoiseach address the efforts being made between the chief medical officers and health Ministers, North and South, to maintain that important level of engagement on vaccination numbers, restrictions and hospital capacity, which has been a huge concern, particularly in Northern Ireland?</p>  <p>  I echo the Taoiseach's disappointment that the meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council has not taken place.  Now that we are into an electoral cycle in Northern Ireland, from our vantage point it is important to keep pushing the door and not allow certain political actors to derail the important North-South engagements in every area.</p></speech>

Meanwhile, Brexit and, in particular, the Northern Ireland protocol remain issues of concern to the First Minister and deputy First Minister, albeit from different perspectives.  Business, though, can clearly see the benefits of the protocol.  It is interesting to note that recent statistics show cross-Border trade between the Republic and Northern Ireland continues to grow.</p>  <p>  Negotiations have resumed on the implementation of the protocol between the UK and the EU.  David Frost has resigned and the British foreign secretary, Liz Truss, has taken over the negotiations from the UK side.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, has since met with Liz Truss but she has stated the UK could still trigger Article 16 if necessary.  What is the Taoiseach's sense at this stage of how the negotiations are going in relation to the protocol?  Has there been a change of approach by the UK side to the negotiations with the appointment of Liz Truss?  It seems the issue concerning the supply of medicines to Northern Ireland has been resolved by the European Commission.  Does the Taoiseach believe that all sides, including the parties in Northern Ireland, are ready to cut a deal on the issue and resolve this problem well before the Assembly elections in May?</p></speech>

A message needs to be clearly and repeatedly given to the British Government concerning its proposal to introduce an amnesty for murderers, be they members of the state forces or of paramilitary organisations, some who masqueraded as republicans and others who masqueraded as loyalists.</p> <p>Under no circumstances should such persons be given an amnesty for committing heinous crimes that, in many instances, included murder.  It is very important for that message to be repeated to the British Government.</p> <p> As the Taoiseach knows, it is approaching half a century since some of those crimes were carried out.  Next December will mark the 50th anniversary of the murder of two teenagers in Belturbet, County Cavan, by a bomb that was brought across the Border from County Fermanagh.  Nobody has ever been brought to justice for that.  In two years my own constituency will mark the desperate atrocities that happened in Dublin and Monaghan in May 1974 and still nobody has been brought to justice.  There has been a complete lack of recognition by the British Government over the years of the need to give full co-operation and conduct full and thorough investigations into those desperate atrocities.  People have campaigned for decades to get the truth and they want to see the truth established.  We all know that every day that goes by means it will be more difficult.  Particular emphasis needs to be put on the need to get progress with regard to legacy issues.</p></speech>

I want to give credit where it is due.  When I asked the Taoiseach to do that, he gave his time and effort and he listened respectfully and engaged very well with those victims.  I appreciate that greatly.</p>  <p>  On the ombudsman's report on the RUC handling of paramilitary attacks by the UDA and UVF, it is important that the Government focuses on that issue.  When a state kills a citizen or is involved in collusive behaviour, as is reported in this ombudsman report, in the killing of the citizens of that state, it is unbelievably shocking.  The Taoiseach mentioned Teebane.  I want the victims and survivors of the Teebane affair to have justice and a proper investigation and for full knowledge and truth to be brought to them.  It is also important to realise that when republicans were involved in these actions, they were pursued fully by the state.  Republicans spent 100,000 years, cumulatively, imprisoned during the Troubles for the actions they took.  On the other side, the British military side, in most cases there were no investigations at all, there were no convictions and people were not held to account.  That is why it is important that this Government raises the matter with the British.  We must also raise it in an international forum, even with the UN, to make sure that the British state is held to account for the wrongs it has done.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-01-19a.175" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1478" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="16:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022011900020#S00300"><p>Last night, I was privileged to speak at a meeting marking the 50th anniversary of Bloody Sunday.  It was attended by hundreds and hundreds of people from this country, including many young people wanting to learn about the history of Bloody Sunday.  The meeting was addressed by Kate Nash of the Bloody Sunday families, people from the Black Lives Matter movement and people from the Hillsborough disaster campaign.  The message at that meeting was resounding.  After a long struggle at least to deconstruct the disgusting narrative that tried to blame, if you like, the victims of Bloody Sunday for what happened that day, as eventually happened with the Saville inquiry, there still has not been real accountability for the military commanders and political leaders who the families hold responsible for the massacre, the murder, by the British state that took place 50 years ago.  The families are still seeking that justice, accountability and truth about the political culpability of the people who ordered that massacre and the senior military figures, not just the foot soldiers, who were responsible for that massacre.</p>  <p>  As we approach the anniversary, I ask the Taoiseach whether he agrees that we still need justice and accountability for Bloody Sunday.  As we approach the half century anniversary, what is the Government going to do to try finally to get justice and accountability for the Bloody Sunday families?</p></speech>

Deputy Richmond raised the issue of the North-South Ministerial Council.  I agree with him.  He also spoke about the need for co-ordination of the vaccination programme and around the whole Covid issue.  I wish to make clear that such co-ordination is continuing between our Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Tony Holohan, and his counterpart in the North, Dr. Michael McBride.  There is also co-ordination between the health services, which are sharing experiences and trying to keep their processes relatively parallel.  That is not always at an optimal level and the North may take measures ahead of us.</p>  <p>  Deputy Haughey raised the issue of the latest state of play in respect of the protocol discussions in the context of the retirement of Lord Frost.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, has met with the Secretary of State, Liz Truss MP, and Commissioner &Scaron;efčovič has also had meetings with her.  Suffice to say there is good engagement and goodwill on both sides, the European Union and the British Government, to get this resolved.  Timelines are challenging in respect of elections in the North and so forth.  It is extremely important that we get an agreed resolution.  The most recent meeting between the UK foreign secretary and Commissioner &Scaron;efčovič was useful.  Those discussions will continue with a view to bringing about a resolution.  The European Union has been very committed to this and has been open in terms of endeavouring to get it resolved.</p>  <p>  The matter of cross-Border trade and the patterns of trade that have developed since Brexit are interesting.  It is interesting that aspects of the Northern Ireland economy have done well as a result of the operation of the protocol.  That needs to be put on the record.  Continued access to the Single Market is critical for businesses and enterprises and for jobs in Northern Ireland.  No one is arguing for that access to end anytime soon, from what I can tell from the engagement I have had with all of the Northern parties.  It is at a delicate stage.  It is important to keep faith in the process.</p>  <p>  In response to Deputy Smith's point, which others have also raised, there is no question of the Irish Government supporting an amnesty in any shape or form.  We do not agree with the British Government's proposals in respect of legacy.  We believe it is wrong because such a step would give everybody who has committed murder, including state forces, paramilitaries and whoever, an amnesty.  That would be totally unacceptable.  It would be a betrayal of the victims of all violence.  I take on board what the Deputy said about the upcoming 50th anniversary of Belturbet and the other attacks in Dublin and Monaghan.  I accept his point that for many victims, there is not yet any sense of closure or of answers in terms of who did what.</p>  <p>  Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n mentioned that we met the victims of the Glennane gang.  I accept the point that there is an extra onus on the state but that does not excuse what happened on Bloody Friday or at Kingsmill.  I was watching, the week before last, the episode of "Reeling in the Years" dealing with 1974.  It was shocking.  The Birmingham bombs and the Guildford Four featured.  The caption on the footage made it clear that no one has ever been brought to justice for committing that atrocity.  For the victims of that atrocity, that hurts to this day.  We need to acknowledge that too in respect of what happened in a whole range of situations during those very dark years.  Many people feel that they are being forgotten about or the loss of their loved ones is being completely forgotten about and there is no balance in terms of how we approach that.  I believe that the British Government has dragged its feet too long on legacy issues.  Agreement was reached ten years ago between the two Governments.  We believe that British soldiers should be brought to justice for atrocities such as Bloody Sunday, Ballymurphy and others.  As I said earlier, state forces were involved with all paramilitaries.  Operation Kenova is revealing a lot too, according to what I have read in various reports in the media and so on, about the operation of intelligence operatives in the North during a prolonged period of time.</p> <p>It seems to me that the people who do not want closure the most or do not want a light shone on this are all those who were engaged in the killing.  I get the sense that it is almost unspoken.  I have been dealing with legacy for a long time.  I can go back to the Eames-Bradley report.  I was sceptical then that those who pulled the triggers and planted the bombs would ever come forward and tell an unvarnished truth about what happened, and that has not happened - they have never come forward.  The result is that a lot of families have never got answers as to why their loved ones were killed.  That is an issue.  In any event, we are all agreed in this House that we are against the legacy proposals of the British Government and the idea of an amnesty.  Clarity and transparency need to be brought to what happened.</p></speech>

The evidence also tells us that this abuse is worse again for women in environments that are heavily reliant on power structures.  In its statement in December, the Women of Honour group described the Government's proposals for a review as shocking.  Has the Taoiseach discussed the Women of Honour group's statement with his coalition partners?  The women have stated that the Minister does not appear to appreciate the seriousness of the issues and concerns they have raised.  These are concerns based on their lived experiences surrounding dignity in the workplace, bullying, harassment, discrimination, assault, sexual harassment and sexual assault.  This simply is not acceptable.</p>  <p>  In their engagements with the Minister, the women have called on the Government to bring about real change and shape the Defence Forces for the 21st century by delivering a full investigation, with a comprehensive independent report, into past and ongoing events.  Instead, the Minister has proposed a process that is not independent, has no investigative powers and cannot compel perpetrators who refuse to participate.</p>  <p>  If we are truly committing to a zero tolerance policy on violence, abuse, coercion and harassment against women and girls, then we have a moral responsibility to use all the powers at our disposal to ensure that those who protect us and others are, in fact, protected themselves.  If the Taoiseach has not discussed the matter with his Government partners, will he commit to do so at the earliest opportunity?  The women are due to meet the Minister again tomorrow afternoon.</p></speech>

In Ireland right now, more than 9,000 people are homeless and at least 90,000 homes are vacant.  That is a conservative estimate as the census put the figure for empty homes at more than 180,000.  That figure excludes holiday homes and homes that were empty on the night of the census.  It relates to homes that were empty during multiple inspections over three months.</p>  <p>  In addition, some 22,000 residential buildings are derelict.  Ireland has one of the highest rates of vacancy in the world.  This would be scandalous at any time but in the middle of a housing crisis, with escalating rents and house prices that people cannot afford going up month after month and year after year, this is completely unacceptable.  Will the Government urgently introduce a tax on vacant buildings to bring them back into use, not next year or some time in the future, but now?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-01-19a.184" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1478" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="16:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022011900021#T00800"><p>For many years, People Before Profit has called for a wealth tax to try to redistribute wealth in what is one of the richest countries in the world where wealth has increased exponentially year after year, including during the pandemic.  We now have the ironic situation that today, 100 of the richest people in the world have sent a begging letter to the political leaders of the world asking if the leaders will please tax them more because they are not being taxed enough, and to introduce wealth taxes.  Even the billionaires see the gross inequality and pleaded with political leaders at Davos to tax them more.  However, the Government resisted and tried to rubbish what Oxfam said this week.</p>  <p>  For the Taoiseach's information or that of the officials who wrote his earlier response, the Central Bank quarterly report every single year spells out the amount of personal, financial and household wealth in this country and shows increases in that wealth in exactly the same proportions that Oxfam is outlining.  The Department of Finance did a study, and the Taoiseach is right to say there are no studies, although there should be, which I think is deliberate, of the distribution of that wealth.  The Department of Finance did a distribution study in 2017, however, which showed the richest 10% in this country have 53% of that wealth whereas the poorest 50% have less than 2% of the wealth.  If we are going to address inequality and have the money for housing, health and education, surely we could impose a little bit of additional tax on the super-wealthy millionaires and billionaires.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-01-19a.185" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1628" speakername="Paul Murphy" time="16:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022011900021#T00900"><p>One of the many scandals of Covid-19 in this country has been how our pupils, teachers and schools have been treated.  One of the latest episodes is that right across the country today and for the last couple of weeks, people are attempting to teach and learn in temperatures of 8&deg;C, 9&deg;C and 10&deg;C.  This is almost impossible to do in those circumstances.  The reason is that the Government failed to act on our repeated requests in the Workplace Ventilation (Covid-19) Bill 2021, which was passed more than a month ago, and failed to invest in buying and installing HEPA filters in schools.  Instead, many private fundraising efforts are taking place in schools across the country to get the HEPA filters, which will mean they will not have to leave the windows open as wide for as long in the course of the day.</p>  <p>  Today, a number of reports from different schools seemed to suggest the HSE helpline for principals was refusing to record positive cases from antigen tests.  The HSE said it needed a PCR test when it is not possible for those under the age of 39 to get a PCR test today anywhere in the country.  Will the Taoiseach intervene to resolve this issue?  Will he ensure the Department of Education buys and distributes HEPA filters and all educators, special needs assistants, SNA, etc., have access to FFP2 or N95 masks for free, just as we do in the Oireachtas?</p></speech>

In the first instance, the Minister for Defence, Deputy Coveney, has been dealing and having engagements with the Women of Honour representative group.  As Deputy Clarke said, I understand there will be further engagement shortly.  Regarding the issues the Deputy raised, it would seem that on the face of the evidence and what has been put forward, there could in some instances be a case for criminal investigations in terms of the abuse that took place.  To have a statutory or investigative inquiry that is outside of the normal processes of criminal investigation could potentially undermine such investigations.  That said, I am open to engaging with the group.  I want to see what transpires with the Minister and the group first.  My understanding is that things were progressing for a while.  The Government is prepared to continue the engagement.</p> <p>If there are certain desired outcomes, which I think there are, people who commit abuse should be followed up on.  The Deputy was talking about the investigative powers and the compelling of people to give evidence, which takes it out of the hands - if there was wrongdoing - of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and any processes that it would engage in.  That is something we would need to assess.</p> <p> On Deputy O&rsquo;Callahan&rsquo;s point, I dealt earlier with some of the cases he raised regarding vacant properties and dereliction.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohue, through the local property tax, LTP, review is doing some valuable work in collecting information on vacant properties, with a view to designing a proper vacant property tax.  The Government is committed to a vacant property tax.  That is important in our view.  We have to get it right.  We have to design it right.  We have to get a far better understanding of the vacant properties out there, the types of such properties and so on.  Through the LPT process, which is extremely comprehensive, the Minister for Finance will be in a position to make recommendations in that respect.</p> <p> Meanwhile, on the social housing side, 5,500 units have brought back since this Government came to office.  We provided additional money, beginning with the July stimulus of 2020, to get thousands of void houses in local authority ownership back in operation.  In 2022, a further 1,500 voids will be brought back into operation as a result of funding that has been provided by Minister of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien.  It is important that this continues, because we do not want to necessary vacancies.  There are other issues we are looking at also, for example, nursing home legislation, to see if we can free up more units are vacant because people have gone into nursing homes.  All efforts will be made to deal with the vacancy issue.  As I said earlier, there has been a 40% year-on-year increase in commencements for housing.  This is good news, especially in the context of the momentum that has gone into house building since the last lockdown in the first half of 2021.  The latter hit construction somewhat, but we are now at 30,724 commencements.</p> <p> On Deputy Boyd Barrett&rsquo;s points, I was not rubbishing any report.  It is important that we analyse reports and raise issues relating to them.  It is also important that we go through reports with the authors and work issues out.  It is not deliberate that there is no comprehensive data on wealth distribution.  Again, there are questions around the figures.  That is all I am saying.  Let us park that for a moment.

Significant resources have been provided to schools, from PPE right the way through to funding for expenditure, to allow them to deal with the Covid-19 challenge.  My view is that schools have coped well.  There have clearly been challenges, not least in terms of the most recent wave caused by Omicron, which has affected so many people.  I do not accept the charges the Deputy made.  The issue relating to antigen tests has been fixed and resolved by the HSE.</p></speech>

At the start of her career and at the start of the new year, Ashling was in the prime of her life and was looking forward to the time ahead.  But, as we all know, this talented and beautiful young woman never made it home.  On behalf of everyone in the Government and everyone in this House, I wish to convey my profound sympathy and sorrow again to Ashling's family, her partner, her friends, her colleagues, her pupils and to the wider community in which she played such an active part.  As a society, we have learned something of Ashling's life over the past week, a life which was evidently so rich and full of accomplishments.  We may feel that we got to know this talented and gifted young teacher and musician a little.  The tragedy of course is that we will never learn what else Ashling would have achieved and how many more lives she would have enriched.  The grief Ashling&rsquo;s family is feeling is indescribable.  Ashling's entire community is bereft.  I am so sorry that this happened to the Murphy family and that this dark moment in Ireland's history has taken this vivacious and creative young woman from them.  May Ashling rest in peace.</p>  <p>  This shocking crime has left the entire country devastated and it has given rise to legitimate questions about whether we are doing enough to prevent violence against women.  One week on from Ashling's murder, it is important and appropriate that the House meets to discuss what needs to be done.  A lot of work has already been undertaken and more is under way.  However, everyone in this House has a perspective and an input to make.  I assure Deputies that the Government is open to all constructive suggestions as to how Ireland can eradicate violence against women and ensure that everything possible is done to prevent a crime of this nature from happening again.</p>  <p>  Our primary and necessary response to Ashling&rsquo;s death is clear.  We want and we need a zero-tolerance approach to violence against women.  This will require all of us, as a society, to commit to lasting change.  Deputies will be aware that, led by the Department of Justice, we have been working on a new whole-of-government strategy to combat domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  Work on this project has been under way for the past 12 months and it is approaching conclusion.  The fundamental goal of this strategy echoes so much of what has been asked for in recent days: zero tolerance in respect of violence against women.  Implementation of the strategy will be driven by the Minister for Justice.  Her Department will assume responsibility for services for victims of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, in addition to policy responsibility.  A detailed plan for how this will work is in preparation and will be brought Government for decision.  The Cabinet Committee on Social Affairs and Equality, which I chair, will be fully utilised to bring a dedicated focus to domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, with oversight from my Department.</p>  <p>  Let there be no doubt that the full support of the Office of An Taoiseach will be given to this priority area and it will play a key role in ensuring that all Departments deliver on their commitments.  The new strategy recognises that this is a problem that can only be solved by all of society and the Government working together.  It is not simply a criminal justice issue.  The new strategy will be structured around four pillars, namely, prevention, protection, prosecution and co-ordinated policies.  The strategy has been developed in partnership with those involved in protecting and supporting women to ensure that it is targeted, comprehensive and effective in achieving all of the goals set out.</p> <p>To help ensure its focus is where it really needs to be, in the coming weeks the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, will be inviting feedback through a targeted public consultation process on the final draft of the strategy.  The finalised strategy is expected to be brought to Government in early March.</p> <p> The discussion today about what our next steps need to be is critically important, but I also want to inform Deputies and the public of important work that is ongoing in this area.  We continue to drive forward the Government&rsquo;s plan to support victims and vulnerable witnesses in sexual violence cases through our plan, Supporting a Victim&rsquo;s Journey.  The plan is being implemented so that victims of a crime can come forward safe in the knowledge that the system will support them.  Its implementation is instrumental in ensuring we have a criminal justice system that works for vulnerable victims at every stage of their journey.  It is a system that supports vulnerable victims and empowers them to report offences, knowing they will be supported, informed and treated respectfully throughout the criminal justice process.  That is what we are striving for and working towards.</p> <p> There have also been some important legislative advancements in this area in recent years.  The commencement of the Domestic Violence Act 2018 on 1 January 2019 created a number of significant improvements, including the offence of coercive control.  It recognises in law the devastating impact that emotional abuse can have on those it is inflicted upon.  The enactment of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 introduced a statutory definition of consent to a sexual act.  The Minister for Justice also prioritised the enactment of Coco&rsquo;s Law, which outlawed image-based sexual abuse, and in February last year she signed an order bringing this important new law into force.  As well as outlawing image-based sexual abuse, Coco&rsquo;s Law broadened the existing offence of harassment and increased the maximum penalty for harassment from seven years to ten years, in order to reflect the harm caused by the most serious forms of harassment.  The proposed hate crime legislation will create new, specific hate-aggravated offences for crimes motivated by prejudice against certain characteristics.  The new offences will carry tougher sentences than ordinary forms of crime, and gender will be one of those characteristics.</p> <p> Education and awareness raising have also played an important part in the Government&rsquo;s fight against sexual and gender-based violence and that will continue with the new strategy.  Over the past number of years, the Department of Justice has been working to raise awareness generally about how we, as a society, need to stop excusing unacceptable behaviour.  For example, the No Excuses campaign highlighted this determination to challenge people and the culture, prejudice and values that allow any form of sexual harassment or sexual violence.  Education is key and this education needs to start from the earliest years on.  Using appropriate material, it should encompass subjects such as healthy relationships, gender equality, respect and an understanding of consent.  It needs to continue throughout the education and learning experience and into the workplace.</p> <p> Preventing abusive behaviour will require the eradication of certain social and cultural attitudes held by many men, which contribute to women feeling unsafe.  To be frank, we need a sea change in culture and attitude in our society.  As men, we need to listen to women and hear what they are saying.  Misogyny is simply unacceptable and it needs to be eliminated from our society.  We all know there is no single solution to ending domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  Tackling it requires a multifaceted approach with genuine engagement and partnership.  We need sufficient supports and services available throughout the country, appropriate legislation, an effective policing response and the culture shift within our society that I referenced earlier.  I assure the House that this Government is working to achieve these goals and our focus is fixed.</p> <p> This Government also understands that resources are fundamental to tackling this issue.  As we have demonstrated in budget 2022, and as we will continue to demonstrate, this effort will be appropriately resourced.  It is important to note that knowledge and information are essential to developing effective policies to prevent and combat sexual violence and important work is under way in that regard.  The SAVI report, which was commissioned by the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre and first published in 2002, was an important and groundbreaking piece of research.  Some 20 years on, it is important that we get up-to-date information and best-in-class research.  The Government has engaged the CSO to develop and deliver a significant new national survey on the prevalence of sexual violence in Ireland.  It will look in detail at the experience of sexual violence and abuse for both women and men in Ireland and we will also be open to other ideas on how we ensure we are working from and with best-in-class research.  It is important that we have a solid evidence base to guide us in developing policies and legislation.</p> <p> Ashling&rsquo;s death has shocked our nation.  We have spent much of the past week questioning ourselves, our friends and wider society.  Mainly, we are questioning our attitudes towards women.  Are we doing anything to help?  Are we doing enough to help?  Are we part of the problem?  How can we be part of the solution?  Zero tolerance of violence against women is the goal.  It is a necessary and fundamental objective of a safe and mature democracy and it must be the target for our Republic.  By continuing to work together I am confident we can get there.  The appalling and tragic death of Ashling Murphy has touched everyone.  It has galvanised our national determination to bring about change in this area.  We can and must do it.  Enough is enough.</p></speech>

We all stand in solidarity with Ashling&rsquo;s family, including Ray, Kathleen, Cathal and Amy, her boyfriend Ryan, and her community.  I offer my deepest condolences to them.  May Ashling rest in peace.  The many strands of her cruelly short life were brought together yesterday in a funeral that was distinctly Irish.  There was wonderful music that reminded us of her talent, as well as the support of the communities of Mountbolus, Blueball and Tullamore, the pupils from her school in Durrow, her camogie teammates and so many others.</p>  <p>  I was struck in particular by a collection of photographs of Ashling.  Photographs are a snapshot in time but they offer us a window into someone's life.  There were photographs of happy occasions and of generations of her family and communities coming together and sitting around the same table, singing, dancing and playing music together.  This is something we all know and cherish.  There were Snapchat posts of Ashling and her friends on nights out and photographs of them travelling and discovering the world for themselves.  What we saw in those photos we see in our own lives.  They are moments that are so familiar to all of us.  Perhaps that is why Ashling&rsquo;s death has struck a chord with so many of us.  In Ashling, we see our sisters, our daughters and our mothers.  In her family, we see our own, and as women, we see ourselves.  We can all put ourselves in Ashling's position and in her shoes.  While we might not be runners we all put ourselves in a position where we are out walking or taking exercise and for something like this to happen is shocking.</p>  <p>  I have struggled this week, as have many others, with a mixture of emotions.  I have felt shock, disbelief, anger, upset and determination.  I am not alone in this House when I say I cried many times this week, not just for Ashling but for others, such as Urantsetseg Tserendorj, Jastine Valdez, Ana Kriegel, Nadine Lott, and so many others.  These are names we know and others that are not familiar to us.  This is why we stand in solidarity and anger, but also in quiet determination that we must all work together to achieve a shared goal of zero tolerance of violence and abuse against women.</p>  <p>  I have prioritised this issue since becoming Minister for Justice but I am well aware that much more needs to be done.  The solutions will not come from legislation alone, nor can we tackle domestic, sexual and gender-based violence simply by treating it as a criminal justice issue.  What is required is societal and cultural change.  We have failed, quite simply, if we allow ourselves to get to a situation where some men develop such unhealthy attitudes towards women that it leads them to commit these types of crimes and end up in the criminal justice system.  As the Taoiseach said, I am leading the development of the third national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  We have been working on this strategy for over a year and we listened to those in the sector and those who work on the front line.</p> <p>I am so grateful for their work, support and contributions.  We have listened to victims and survivors.</p> <p> I will receive input from across Government from the Departments of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Social Protection, Transport and so on.  There will also be input from our State agencies.  The strategy will be underpinned by clear actions, timelines for reform and robust accountability mechanisms and it will be resourced as it should be.  It will be built on four pillars, namely, prevention, protection, prosecution and policy co-ordination.  The goal is very clear: zero tolerance of violence and abuse against women.</p> <p> To prevent violence against and abuse of women, we must eradicate the societal and cultural attitudes which make women feel unsafe.  We can only do so by changing our cultural attitudes in order to ensure that we are not all bystanders and that we do not look the other way but, rather, call out inappropriate behaviour when and everywhere we see it in the workplace, the dressing room, the pub, the golf club or in a WhatsApp group.</p> <p> We also have to face up to and tackle the appalling effect easy access to pornography is having on boys.  Pornography is not new, but how it is accessed, how accessible it has become and the fact it has become even more violent is having such a detrimental and damaging impact on young men and women.  We must intervene early to teach our sons appropriate lessons, from primary school up to every level of our education, and we must focus on healthy relationships, gender equality and consent.</p> <p> The Government will help lead conversations in this regard in to bring about a better understanding among men.  My Department will soon launch a national campaign on consent.  I know that so many men have been thinking deeply about this over the past week.  I have seen so much commentary on social media and elsewhere.  We cannot do this without men.  We need them to stand with us.  We need to make this change and make sure this moment counts.</p> <p> For victims, coming forward to report what is happening to them is often the hardest decision.  There is a responsibility on all of us to protect victims when they look for our help by ensuring that there is a refuge space, if that is what they need, by supporting more women to live safely in their own homes, if that is their choice, by reassuring victims that they will be treated with dignity and respect by the criminal justice system and through Supporting a Victim&rsquo;s Journey, my plan to help victims and vulnerable witnesses in sexual violence cases.  We are making progress.</p> <p> While this is not simply a criminal justice issue, as Minister for Justice, I want to be clear.  I will do whatever it takes to make sure that perpetrators are investigated, prosecuted and face the full rigours of the law, that the punishment matches the crime, that the Garda will have the resources and technology it needs and that our laws are adequate and strong enough to bring abusers to justice.  I acknowledge the dedicated work by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in its investigation into Ashling&rsquo;s murder.  I know that the Garda is determined to bring her killer to justice, as is the position with every case.</p> <p> This year I will introduce legislation to strengthen the law in a number of areas.  The new Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (powers) Bill 2021 will provide a clear and transparent statutory basis for the existing powers of search, arrest and detention.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (digital recording) Bill 2021 will provide for the use of the necessary modern technology in the investigation of serious crime.  This will help with domestic and sexual violence.  Before Easter, I will publish a Bill that will include new criminal offences for stalking and non-fatal strangulation.  The act of stalking is already covered by existing law, but I will propose the following changes to make the law even clearer and stronger.  We will explicitly reference stalking as a criminal offence.  I will make it clear that stalking includes watching or following a person, even if the person does not know that he or she is being watched or followed.  I will also make it clear that impersonating the victim and then contacting a third person is illegal.  I will update the law to ensure that it covers all forms of communication.  I will also consider introducing a provision to allow a victim, in a very serious case, to apply to the court for an order to prevent an alleged perpetrator from contacting him or her before the trial.  I especially want to thank Eve McDowell and Una Ring who have campaigned tirelessly for this, and Senator Lisa Chambers who has worked hard on this issue in the Seanad.</p> <p> While choking and strangulation are already illegal, creating a new offence will encourage victims to come forward and report what has happened to them.  It has been shown that this crime can be an indication of future lethal violence and, in particular, is a risk factor in the context of homicides of women in their own homes.  As the Taoiseach mentioned, I will publish a new criminal justice (hate crime) Bill that will introduce new specific aggravated offences with enhanced penalties for crimes motivated by prejudice against certain characteristics, including gender.</p> <p> Before the end of September, I will publish a new sexual offences Bill that will introduce important changes, one of which includes the extension of victim anonymity to further categories of victims.  I will also repeal provisions for sentences to be delivered in public.  This legislation will introduce legal representation for victims.</p> <p> I will also seek to enact the Sex Offenders (Amendment) Bill 2021 within the coming months in order to strengthen the management and monitoring of sex offenders in the community.  Within weeks, I will sign the order to bring into operation legislation that provides for preliminary trial hearings.  This will significantly improve the trial process for victims of sexual offences.  I will bring forward more legislation and policy, if needed.</p> <p> I accept what those working on the front line have told us, namely, that the services the Government and the State are too diffuse and need to be streamlined.  Victims should always have easy access and should always understand the supports and resources available to them.  We are taking action to make change.</p> <p> Following consultation with the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, it is intended that the responsibility for policy and service provision for domestic, sexual and gender-based violence will be combined under the Minister for Justice.  Work is under way on how this will be structured.  I will announce further details in the coming weeks.  I thank the dedicated staff of Tusla who continue to focus on supporting efforts in this area.  As the Taoiseach outlined, there will be oversight from the Department of the Taoiseach to make sure that everything we do is delivered.</p> <p> I cannot stand here today and say "Never again".  Unfortunately, I cannot say that no woman will suffer at the hands of a man tonight.  None of us can.  What we can do is commit to Ashling and so many other women and we can commit to each other that we will dedicate ourselves to the long and difficult path of change.  We all know the pain, upset and story only too well.  Let us all hold on to the determination and solidarity that exists among us this week and come together in a common cause, on behalf of Ashling and so many other women, to demand zero tolerance of any kind of violence against or abuse of women.</p></speech>

Ba bhean eile &iacute; ar t&oacute;gadh i gc&aacute;s uaf&aacute;sach &iacute;.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a hanam d&iacute;lis.  Over the past week, many words have been used to describe how the women of Ireland feel following Ashling's horrific murder, including "frightened", "angry", "worn out" and "tired".  All of these things are true.  We are again overwhelmed by the violation, pain and loss caused by the epidemic of male violence that blights our lives every single day.  Generations of Irish women have been forced to live alongside this abuse, behind closed doors at home and in public spaces.</p>  <p>  Physical violence and emotional coercive control represent the shared experience of far too many women.  All week, we have listened to women share their stories; women who have been subjected to violence, harassment or abuse at the hands of men.  The vast majority of these cases were never reported or officially recorded.  In that respect, we are still dealing with an unmeasured, if not unspoken, crisis.</p>  <p>  The fact is that violence against and emotional abuse of women are systemic.  Yes, women are afraid, not of our surroundings or the time of the day or night, but of violent and abusive men.  These men target us in our own homes, on the street, in our workplaces, on the bus and in the pub.  Women are afraid because our lives may be on the line.  Hundreds of women in Ireland have died violently.  Hundreds of lives have been cut short in the most devastating way.  Last Wednesday, Ashling Murphy, sadly, was added to that toll.  Ashling, a young woman of 23, was attacked by a man while out for a run in broad daylight in a public space.  She was in a public space and, yet, violence still found her.  This is why women and girls have been afraid forever.</p>  <p>  The truth is that women have the right to be safe, no matter what we are doing or where we are.  We have the right to be safe on the bus after work or on a night out partying.  We have a right to be safe in the shopping centre or walking home having spent the night with friends.  We have the right to be safe working out in the gym and in our workplaces and homes.</p> <p>How and where we choose to live our lives or spend our time or how we decide to dress is irrelevant, the length of our skirt or how we wear a top is not an invitation to grope us, women having fun in a nightclub is not a signal to rape us, walking or jogging alone is not a green light to murder us, and yet the warped and twisted logic of misogyny conjures up this notion that a woman is asking for it.  Asking for what exactly - to have our lives shattered, to be traumatised, to die?  What we are asking for and, indeed, what we demand is that men stop inflicting awful violence on us.</p> <p> Over the past seven days, I have heard contributions to the discussion that focused on what women might do to stay safe.  Ideas range from new apps to the provision of cans of Mace to every woman in the country.  This misses the point completely because women do everything they can to stay safe.  Most of us have our mental checklist - the car keys between the fingers, pretending we are on the phone when we think we are being followed, changing our route home, taking self-defence classes.  Women do all of these things and more and yet horrible violence finds us.  Why?  Because the problem is not the behaviour in decisions of women.  The problem is violent and abusive men.  Nobody ever said, by the way, that it is all men but it is certainly far too many.</p> <p> The truth is that violence against women, including coercive control, is demonstrably a male problem - a problem that men must be central to solving.  Men must acknowledge the problem and play their part in changing things, and that means speaking out against the systemic culture of misogyny and sexism that has dogged women for generations.  It means becoming allies of women in creating real change and raising all of our sons to be better and to view and treat all women as their equals.</p> <p> This terrible moment must spark real change in our society but we cannot do it without a Government that is truly committed to ending violence against women.  Service providers tell us that they struggle to cope due to cuts in funding and at the very least we should ensure that every rape crisis centre has enough funding to answer every call.</p> <p> There are things that Government can do today to make things better.  The first is to commit to fully implement, resource and support the third strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence when it is published in March.  We in Sinn F&eacute;in have also called for the establishment of a unit in the Department of the Taoiseach to co-ordinate the decision-making, policy and legislation that is currently, as has been conceded, so fragmented across Departments and Government agencies.  The role of this unit would be to co-ordinate and ensure that Departments deliver on their responsibilities under the national strategy.</p> <p> We also need better data on gender-based crime and we need the sexual violence survey to be fast-tracked.  We need the full implementation of the domestic homicide review to be prioritised.  Hundreds of women have been killed in their own homes - that place that should be our sanctuary.</p> <p> In the area of domestic violence, the Government must face up to the crisis in refuge provision.  Ireland has only one third of the refuge places we are obliged to provide for under the Istanbul Convention and nine counties have no refuge place at all.  The Government must publish the Tusla review of emergency accommodation that is on the Minister's desk and follow up with the investment needed to dramatically increase refuge places, including the wrap-around services such as counselling and childcare.</p> <p> I would also urge Government parties to support Sinn F&eacute;in's domestic violence paid leave Bill, which is due before the Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth next week.  This is robust legislation modelled on existing employment rights and reflects provisions already in place in public and private organisations, such as NUI Galway, Vodafone and Danske Bank.</p> <p> Women and girls are rightly sick of politicians promising change but never following through.  Is anois an t-am do cheannaireacht agus do ghn&iacute;omh.  N&iacute; leor deora agus &oacute;m&oacute;s.  Teasta&iacute;onn gn&iacute;omh pr&aacute;inneach anois chun deireadh a chur le for&eacute;igean in aghaidh na mban.  We cannot mourn and then allow violence against women to slip off the agenda once again.  We cannot wait until another woman lies dead leaving behind a heartbroken family.  To make the words "Enough is enough" real, to show we mean it, change must flow like a river.  Women are fed up and worn out but, make no mistake, women are also fired up, determined and resolute.</p> <p> We stand here today in remembrance of every woman violently killed.  These women challenge those in power.  They challenge all of us to act.  Their message is "Forget me not and act".  Remembering what we have lost must help to save what we cannot abide to lose again; another mother, another sister, another daughter, another friend, another woman.  Their lives cannot become footnotes on a page or statistics in a report.  Their lives mattered and their deaths matter too.</p> <p> At this moment, here in this place a line must be drawn in the sand in order that today, I hope, would be remembered as the day when the D&aacute;il finally came together to end violence against women to build a better future for a new generation.  We cannot wait another day to make this happen.  The women of Ireland have waited long enough and have paid far too heavy a price.</p></speech>

I would like to acknowledge the incredible groundswell of support and solidarity that has been shown to the family, as well as the huge show of support that was there for the family at the funeral yesterday.</p>  <p>  For far too long, harassment, violence and fear have impacted on the lives of women across this country.  They have a right to be safe on our streets and in our homes, and yet too often they are not.</p>  <p>  What happened to Ashling was horrendous and yet it is only the most recent in a long line of such incidents.  In Laois-Offaly alone, for example, 28 years ago Imelda Keenan, a Mountmellick woman, went missing.  She has not been found.  No one has been brought to justice for it.  Fiona Pender, last seen in Tullamore, went missing in 1996.  Her parents are dead now.  Her mother, Josie, spent the remainder of her life trying to find and get information on her and did not.  Once again, despite the best efforts of the Garda and the community, no one has been held accountable.  Marie Kilmartin, a young woman living in Portlaoise, was found buried in a bog hole in a drain in Mountmellick three decades ago.  Over 244 women in Ireland have died violently since 1996.  Women are subjected to misogyny, abuse, coercive control and harassment every single day and it must stop.  Men must play their part in doing that.  We need to change attitudes.  We need to change behaviours.  We need to ensure that violence against women and against girls is put to an end.</p>  <p>  We need services that allow women to reach out whenever they are victims of domestic violence or other coercive methods.  Nine counties, as has been said already, do not have a women's refuge centre.  Laois and Offaly are two of those counties.  I raised this over 20 years ago, as did others.  Women and children in these two counties are being sent to refuges far away from their families, from their doctors and from their support groups and services.  That has a huge impact.  I have dealt with many of those families.  Other Members in this House probably have as well over the years.  I appeal to the Taoiseach that we need a women's refuge in Laois and we need one in Offaly.  That must happen.  Society needs to see that we, as legislators and parliamentarians, are taking this issue seriously.  The time for talking is over and the time for action is now.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-01-19a.209" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1513" speakername="Pauline Tully" time="17:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022011900026#Y00100"><p>What has become very clear since the horrific murder of Ashling Murphy last week is that practically every woman has a story to tell.  Women have been speaking out bravely on the radio during the past week and have been recounting incidents of abuse, assault, rape, being groped, degraded or followed.  The list goes on.  This is women of all ages and all backgrounds.  Disturbingly, some girls who were still in school recounted incidents of inappropriate touching or behaviour within the school community.  Most of these instances go unreported.  Tragically, since 1996, some 244 women, and many more before that date, are not here to tell their stories.  The vast majority of them were killed by someone known to them, and in many cases by their current or former partner.  Every time I hear about another woman being killed in her own home or out on the street like Ashling, it makes me sad for her and her family, but it also makes me really angry that some men feel that they can do what they want, when they want and to whom they want and often without repercussion.</p>  <p>  Radical change is needed across a number of areas, including the Garda's approach to reports of domestic violence and the ludicrous sentences that many perpetrators of violence against women receive, because if it is not dealt with it gives the message that women's lives do not matter.  Sex education in schools must encompass healthy relationships and the meaning of consent and mutual respect.  Proper funding of domestic refuges is critical.  More than 800 women were turned away from refuges last year.  There are nine counties without refuges, including the two I represent, namely, Cavan and Monaghan.  The refuges provide an excellent service but they do so on a shoestring.  We are not living up to our commitments under the Istanbul Convention.  We need one Minister to deal with this issue.  I welcome the strategy, but if it is not properly resourced and funded, it is not worth the paper it is written on.  Change was enacted very quickly after the horrific murder of Veronica Guerin.  The same needs to happen now.</p></speech>

I begin by expressing my heartfelt sympathies and condolences to Ashling Murphy's family, her partner and friends, and to her community, the school she worked in and all of those who knew her.  There has been an immense outpouring of grief nationally at the loss of such a wonderful young woman, with tens of thousands of people attending vigils in Ireland and abroad.  Her killing has also generated an immense outpouring not only of grief but of anger at the extent to which all women are subjected to violence or to fear of violence.  It has reminded us of so many other horrific killings of women in this country.  This Thursday marks one year since the violent attack on Urantsetseg Tserendorj not far from here at the International Financial Services Centre, IFSC.  Our thoughts are with her family and friends as we approach that anniversary, and with the families and friends of other women and girls killed so horrifically whose names have been spoken in this Chamber, including Ana Kri&eacute;gel and Jastine Valdez.</p>  <p>  Ashling's killing reminds us that, as Women's Aid has reported, 244 women have died violently since 1996, 152 of them killed in their own homes.  It has also served to remind us of the extent to which all women and girls are daily subjected to harassment, abuse, violence and assault by men.  In recent days we have had an outpouring of women's experiences and stories being recounted.  What is perhaps most surprising for me and many of us in this Chamber is the extent to which our good male colleagues have often been unaware of the extent to which we experience everyday sexism and microaggressions.  While such violence is only perpetrated by a small number of men, the fear of violence is experienced by all women.  All of us who have grown up and live in this culture have become so accustomed to changing our behaviour, assessing risk on a daily basis and modifying our movements all the time because of this fear that we simply do not question it any more.  It has become something that is unconscious.  We all check ourselves every day.  Other colleagues have spoken of the mental checklist we do everywhere we go.  We ask if it is safe to walk or cycle down this street, to get into this taxi, to jog in this park or along this canal.  This daily checking and the constant need to engage in risk monitoring is instilled in us from an early age.  It has taken a horrific killing like that of Ashling Murphy last week to remind us that it is not acceptable that we have put up with this for so long and that we are seeing our teenage daughters also take on this unconscious risk monitoring and fear.  I am a mother of teenage daughters.  It is simply not acceptable that women and girls in society continue to experience this fear and to engage in this constant checking and risk monitoring.</p>  <p>  This must be a watershed moment.  Many have said that, but we are seeing a growing realisation among men and boys of the need to step up to challenge sexism and the culture in which misogyny and sexism is tolerated and in which men and boys continue to engage in public places in sexist or misogynistic jeering, catcalling, harassment or groping of women and girls.  A study today shows that teenage girls have all but stopped cycling in Ireland largely because of a fear of harassment.  It is time to engage in a radical culture shift, to adopt a policy of zero tolerance against violence against women and misogyny in all its forms.  We know that gender inequality is the common strand which we see worldwide.</p>  <p>  In my role as chairperson of the Special Committee on Gender Equality established by the Oireachtas just before Christmas, I will be working with colleagues on a cross-party basis to ensure the implementation of important recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly.  The assembly made 45 recommendations to tackle gender inequality, five of which refer specifically to domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  Here is what we need to do to build on those recommendations urgently.  First, we need a Cabinet Minister, and I am pleased the Minister for Justice is going to take the lead in co-ordinating and implementing all strategies to prevent and counter violence against women.  The Minister must urgently publish the promised strategy on gender-based violence.  I know she has committed to doing so.  She must also expedite the publication of the data we so badly need to build on the sexual abuse and violence in Ireland, SAVI, data from 2002.  In parallel with that, we must also see the rolling out a public awareness campaign focused on prevention and education for children in all schools through the relationships and sexuality education, RSE, programme &ndash; with no opt-outs for schools, whatever their ethos.  We also need a parallel public awareness programme for adults to challenge misogyny and sexism in all its forms.</p>  <p>  In addition to that, we need to see the implementation of the criminal justice reforms recommended in the O'Malley report and committed to by the Department of Justice in Supporting a Victim's Journey.  Two issues that jump out from the O'Malley report are the fragmentation of services for victims across the country and the lack of a voice for victims in the courtroom.  We need to see really serious work on that in the coming months and ensure there is legislation to increase the level of representation for the victim in the courtroom and that addresses the real fragmentation of services and the inadequate supports in particular for victims of domestic violence and the lack of sheltered provision.  We know we still fall short of the requirements in the Istanbul Convention.</p>  <p>  We need a fundamental change of emphasis to address not only the flaws in the criminal justice system, to build on the positive changes we have made such as Coco's Law and the introduction of the offence of coercive control and the definition of consent.  We need legislation to tackle the existing gaps in the system but, in particular, we need to focus on the education and the cultural change.  We need to recognise that given the gender imbalance in this House, where less than a quarter of us are women, that we must ask male colleagues to be aware of the unconscious bias that persists through our system and the chilling effect on women and girls of sexism, misogyny, mansplaining, sexist comments, exclusion and the other microaggressions that far too many women and girls continue to endure day in and day out.  It falls to all of us, women and men, in this House and beyond, to take a stand against sexism and to take responsibility for ensuring that ours is a safe and equal country for all women and girls in which we stand up to sexism and misogyny in all its forms.</p></speech>

The taking of a young life, a life that was so full of vitality and promise, has brought shock, revulsion and a great deal of reflection in Ireland, and through that, a necessary reckoning with the reality behind this appalling murder.  We must call that for what it is: men's violence against women.</p>  <p>  According to a European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights survey, one in three women have experienced psychological violence by a current or former partner.  Some 12% of Irish women and girls over the age of 15 have experienced stalking and more than 200 women have died violently in Ireland in the past two decades.</p> <p>More than those statistics, we all know the stories.  Every man in this Chamber will have heard from a female friend, from a colleague or from a family member about individual incidents of abuse, harassment and violence that those women have experienced from men.  Too often, we men can sympathise or even empathise, but our action goes no further than that.  This can no longer be a burden for women alone to carry.  It should never have been their fight alone in the first place.  As men, we have to recognise our role in this - in calling out the threatening behaviours, in making clear what is and is not acceptable behaviour any more and in banishing misogyny from public life.  It is time for us, as men, to step up.</p> <p> The Government is acting on the need for substantial and radical change in how we address domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  As part of the programme for Government, we recognised the epidemic of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  We also recognised the fragmented nature of the State's responses and commissioned an audit of how the Government could better respond to these needs.  Since coming into office, we have prioritised responding to domestic violence, particularly in the context of Covid.  I wish to acknowledge the huge efforts by Tusla in responding quickly and effectively to the Covid restrictions as part of its response to domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, DSGBV, and the protection of children.  My Department has increased funding for domestic violence services and we will shortly be introducing a statutory entitlement to paid leave for victims of domestic violence.  This paid leave provision will be brought forward within the work-life balance directive Bill to allow it to be passed as quickly as possible.</p> <p> Since the formation of this Government, I have worked intensively with the Minister, Deputy McEntee, and her Department on the audit of the Government&rsquo;s response to domestic, sexual, and gender-based violence and how the results of that audit fit with the third national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  As a result of those discussions and in response to the audit, we have agreed that the Department of Justice will be the lead Department with responsibility for responding to domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, and responsibility for policy, accommodation and services also will sit within the Department of Justice.  In the immediate term, Tusla will continue to have responsibility for accommodation and services while the new administrative arrangements are put in place.</p> <p> Within my own Department, I am particularly conscious of the impact of domestic violence on children.  In the course of this work with providers in the area of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, it is clear to Tusla that in addition to adult victims, there is now an increased need for a specialist child protection focus in domestic violence cases.  As part of the resource allocation for Tusla in 2022, using additional resources I secured for the agency in this year's budget, Tusla will allocate domestic violence and abuse support practitioners to each of the six new Tusla regions.  These will be provided at the point where child protection referrals are received.  Tusla has noted an increase in child protection concerns related to domestic violence and this initiative will enable child protection duty teams to further enhance the response to child protection and welfare referrals to Tusla where domestic violence is a concern.  While retaining this permanently within Tusla's child protection service, Tusla, as an agency of my Department, will now work closely with the Department of Justice to ensure a smooth transition of all other domestic, sexual and gender-based violence services.</p> <p> Many have referred to the tragic killing of Ashling Murphy as a watershed moment in Ireland for violence against women but it will only be a watershed moment if we choose it to be.  All of us, but in particular men in Ireland, have to be clear that this is the moment we will no longer tolerate threats, harassment, misogyny in public life or violence against women in this country.  This is the moment when we stand up and when we speak up and say enough is enough.</p></speech>

The phone rings.  I shake off the sleep and answer.  A man's voice, violent and determined: &ldquo;We know where you are.  You need to back off the lines.  We will get you.&rdquo;  My voice catches in my throat.  I cannot breathe.  I say nothing.  &ldquo;Are you hearing me?  We will get you.&rdquo;  Then silence.  Just me, on my own, and the darkness.  Safety robbed, security violated.  Should I wake my children?  Are we safe?  Will the guards take a phone call seriously?</p>  <p>  Not all men but all women will identify with the feelings that come following these encounters.  Not all men but all women will know them well because they are not rare.  Not all men but all women grow up knowing we are not safe.  Not all men but all women will learn to text their friends when we arrive home safely because, for us, it is not a given that we will.  Not all men but all women know the feeling that creeps up your back when you hear steps behind you and you have to check.  Not all men but all women stay away from the darkness between street lights, sprinting from one bright spot to the next, hoping to be okay.  Not all men but all women look for the parking space with CCTV cameras facing them, knowing that unlocking and locking and getting into their cars is one of the most vulnerable actions.  Not all men but all women take the long way back - no shortcuts or alleyways.  Not all men but all women know to keep their keys between their fingers, ready to defend ourselves.  This is the fight of our lives and it is exhausting.  Not all men but all women watched Ashling Murphy&rsquo;s story play out and felt, &ldquo;There is no reason that, one day, it might not be me on the news.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  We need men to help us through this pandemic of violence against women and girls.  Now is not the time for cynicism or hopelessness.  There is a political possibility here, and we can move forward in a way that makes us a global leader.  Let us look at how we try rape and sexual assault in this country.  Let us look at the hoops women have to jump through to get justice for assault.  Let us look at creating a clear message to all men that protecting women will be celebrated and that violence against them will not be tolerated at any cost.  While my colleagues work to bring forth legislation that will severely penalise abusive and threatening behaviour, we cannot do nothing.  This is the fight of our lives.</p>  <p>  Programmes like in Seas Suas in NUI Galway can make a real difference if funded at third level.  At its core, it is an empathy and bystander intervention and well-being training programme.  Students have already said they have used the skills developed in the programme to effectively intervene in crisis situations.  Can we get rid of the shadows that support male violence by literally increasing visibility with LED lights?  I know I would feel safer.  Can the Department with responsibility for sport introduce a condition on funding allocated to sports clubs whereby they must work to increase the awareness and protection of women in clubs and communities?</p>  <p>  We need to tackle the abusive online culture that has developed.  It cannot just be seen as part of modern political life.  I need to wind back the clock to last week.  I was on &ldquo;The Tonight Show&rdquo;, speaking about Ashling Murphy, and I was told on Twitter that I needed to shut up, while another tweet said they wanted to punch me, although they used far more abusive language.  Only yesterday, after speaking on Radio 1 about being threatened by a man in my office, I was told that I love an old yarn, that I make up stories and that I am a rat.  What makes matters worse is that, for some women, they fear that they are seen to be weak or whinging if they speak up, so we say nothing and the abuse continues.  The simple fact is that changing a toxic culture is not easy.</p>  <p>  Can I ask everyone here to look into their own lives, their own sphere?  Are you contributing to or condoning an anti-female sentiment, and if the answer is yes, are you willing to change?  Have you seen tweets about their female colleagues?  Have you intervened?  Have you seen distasteful jokes on WhatsApp groups and said nothing?  We need you to say something.  Whenever you see it, call it out.  There is an opportunity in every moment.  Please help us.  Because it is not all men but it is all women.  It will require great humility, courage and strategy but I believe the change is possible.</p></speech>

It stuck in my mind what we chanted: &quot;No matter what we are or where we go, 'Yes' means 'Yes' and 'No' means 'No'&quot;.  That was 40 years ago, give or take.  I have been on to too many protests, I have been marching too many times and we have worn out too much shoe leather.  We know what the issues are and we should not still have to be on the streets and be highlighting the epidemic of violence against women.  We should not have to keep telling our stories.  We are sick and tired of telling our stories.  We are sick and tired of taking that which happened to us and putting it into the public sphere.  We nearly have to beg for allies, for politicians to listen and for men to understand.  We are fed up with it.  I have noticed in the last week that not only are women angry but they are fed up.  I talked to my mother and we are fed up at this stage.  We are fit to say that is enough is enough but we know we have said that too many times before.</p><p>The tragic killing of Ashling Murphy has sparked a national debate.  From Belfast to Ballincollig and everywhere in between we have seen women and men gather together and silently reflect on the loss of Ashling, on all women who have been lost to violence and on the fact that many of us experience a real fear on a daily basis.  I like to run.  I am not very good at it and I cannot run very far or fast but I like to run.  When I go out I am always careful because I try, as a woman approaching 50 years of age, to not &ldquo;bring it on myself&rdquo;.  Imagine that is what I do before I leave the house.  I have spoken to my husband about this and it comes as a revelation to good and decent men but I check myself before I go and think about what I am doing to &ldquo;bring this on myself&rdquo;.  That should not happen and that is not personal to me but that is every women before they go out.  We think about what we are wearing, where we are going, who will be there, how we are getting there and how we will get home.  We ask ourselves these questions all of the time and carry out that little mental checklist: who will be there, will it be safe, is anyone coming home in the taxi with me and if I could persuade my husband to stay up and drive into town to bring me home.  I am not afraid of the dark.  I am grown woman, not a child, but I am afraid of being in the dark on my own or with someone behind me.  That is not acceptable.</p><p>The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, is right.  We have to call it out when we see it and that means all of us.  For most of my adult life I have worked in areas that are dominated by men, including the trade union movement and politics.  I have been subjected to sustained and crippling sexual harassment in a previous job and when I raised concerns my boss told me that I was tougher than the men in that workplace and he asked me what I was going on about.  To my shame, I did not say anything.  I took it on the chin and I smiled because I thought that both of us were in on the joke, me and the boss, but it was not funny.  I should have called it out and we should always, always call it out.  To the good, decent men in the Oireachtas, I ask how many of them can honestly say they have never witnessed sexual harassment, that they have never been present when a sexist or misogynistic joke has been told.  How many of you spoke up?  The most important question is will you speak up now.  When you hear the joke or sentiment or when you see one of your colleagues or someone from another political party being degraded will you speak out, will you call it out for what it is and stand up?  We must stand up and acknowledge that violence against women happens because of the culture that is created by people who do not call it out.</p><p>We received an email yesterday that was circulated to all Deputies and I was struck by one line in it.  It said:</p> <blockquote> 	Preventing men&rsquo;s violence against women starts with creating a zero-tolerance culture towards misogyny and sexism that creates the context in which gender-based violence occurs. </blockquote>  <p>That is why we have to call it out.  I have written to the Ceann Comhairle to ask that we undertake bystander intervention training in these Houses.  That is important and we should be doing that.  I hope the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission will accede to that request.</p><p>A lot of what will be discussed today will be triggering for women.  The Women&rsquo;s Aid helpline is there at 1800 341 900.  Women&rsquo;s Aid is 50% funded by charity.  It does brilliant work but it has to raise 50% of its funding.  Every shilling that it raises represents time spent raising money when it should be helping women.  We need to reflect on that.</p></speech>

The vigils held across Ireland for Ashling were also for every victim of gender-based violence, for the 244 women who have died violently since our records began and the 18 children killed with their mothers, for the thousands of women who are raped and sexually assaulted, and for the women and children who have had to flee their violent homes.  We have all seen the scenes of the vigils with women and girls crying and hugging and quiet moments acknowledging common experiences.  There was anger and fear, but also hope; a hope for change.  This is a defining moment; this is the week that the people of Ireland, and in particular the women and girls, have said &ldquo;No more&rdquo;.  Generations of Irish women have had to endure misogyny.  Culturally, perpetrators are protected and victims are blamed.  Coercion and street harassment are dismissed.  That is not to mind the legacy of mother and baby homes and repeated health scandals.  No more.  This time, we will not and we cannot allow violence against women to continue.</p>  <p>  As legislators, we have a responsibility to do more than merely express our sadness.  We must direct State resources to dismantle the culture that underpins violence against women.  Most disgracefully, the necessary actions are known but successive Governments have continually failed to provide the range of measures necessary.  I have repeatedly asked for very clear and targeted interventions on gender-based violence, actions Government could and should have taken long ago.  Today I am asking again that it address these points to help prevent violence and to respond adequately to the national outpouring of anger, solidarity and calls for change.</p>  <p>  First, there is a pressing need for more domestic violence refuge spaces.  The Istanbul Convention standard is one refuge space per 10,000 people but Ireland provides one space per 10,000 women, leaving us with 50% less capacity, including very little infrastructure for male victims.  Instead of ensuring we meet the international benchmark, every time I ask the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth about it he refers to a clause in the convention that allows for fewer refuge spaces.  This is not acceptable any more.  Every day we do not meet our commitments under the convention we put more women and children at risk.  It would cost &euro;33 million to provide the additional spaces.  In a budget of billions, it is a relatively small amount to ensure lasting support for victims and survivors of domestic violence.</p>  <p>  Second, we need a drastic overhaul of how our justice system understands and responds to sexual assault and violence.  There is a significant under-reporting of these crimes and their detection rates are the lowest for any category recorded; just 10%.  There must be reforms in how policing and the courts system engage with victims.  I welcome the recent reforms in this area, such as pre-trial hearings.  Sexual violence and rape crisis support organisations have also outlined the further necessary changes for immediate implementation.</p>  <p>  Third, there is an urgent need for education on consent, sexual violence, coercion and other types of assault, including online crimes.  In November, the Government delayed the progress of the Social Democrats Bill on relationships and sex education.  All students should have access to information to help them develop respectful social and sexual relationships.  I am calling on the Government to overturn that ridiculous decision.  We need proper sex education to contribute to a cultural change in how women and girls are viewed and treated and we need it now.</p>  <p>  The past week has been a defining moment for gender-based violence in Ireland and the Government must match the resolve of every community.  We need to hear what reason the Government can give the people of Ireland to believe anything will be different for women and girls?  What concrete policies with tangible outcomes is the Government presenting today?</p></speech>

Social media platforms ignited with a simple phrase, "She was just going for a run".  In reminded me of the everyday acts that other women in this country were carrying out as they were murdered at the hands of men.  She was just walking home from work.  She had just returned from a night out.  She was just in her home on Christmas Eve.  There are no words that can make this okay for Ashling Murphy or for those who knew and loved her.  There are no words that can make this right for any woman who has experienced the scourge of gender-based violence in public or in private, in her home or on the street.  It requires political action, as has already been discussed, which is catered for in the Istanbul Convention and the UN's Safe Cities and Safe Public Spaces for Women and Girls global initiative but which remains unfulfilled on Government and local authority desks.</p>  <p>  It would be remiss of me not to speak today about the responsibility of men to end men's violence against women.  There is an onus on men to end this scourge.  I want to speak to the lies that we, as men, tell ourselves so that we may be absolved of blame for, or complicity in, the toxic masculine culture that many of us were formed by.  In 2014, Tom Meagher wrote about the monster myth following the murder of his wife Jill in Australia in 2012.  Tom Meagher challenged men to break their silence on the root societal causes of male violence against women and to no longer perpetuate a monster myth that merely places blame on evil individuals as if they operate outside the boundaries of the society in which they were formed.  Last week, following the tragic murder of Ashling Murphy, we saw Tom's words enacted once again by men attempting to "other" Ashling's killer, as if he operated outside the full spectrum of men's violence against women.  There was talk of a "violent monster" who must be caught.  Emphasis was placed on the nationality of a suspect because that allowed us to separate or "other" the killer from the everyday.  Once again, #NotAllMen came to the fore, as if that hashtag alone did not cause harm to any woman who has had to look over her shoulder in fear of a man who may approach.  </p>  <p>  To end men's violence against women we must accept that perpetrators of gender-based violence are socialised by the sexism and masculinity that typify their everyday relations and, in turn, institutionalise sexism in our culture.  It is crucial that while not all men commit violence, it is almost always a man that is the perpetrator.  Men's violence against women is a spectrum.  It starts with what many see as harmless banter or sexist jokes and ends with women afraid and hurt in relationships, with random attacks and harassment of women on the street and with women being killed.  Men's violence against women is a spectrum but to truly confront this violence, men must not only call it out but also understand that spectrum and the excuses we make to absolve ourselves from that culture.  Ashling Murphy was killed by a man, albeit one who committed a monstrous act.  Women all over this country are being attacked in their homes.  Men must act to break the cycle, challenge it wherever it may be formed, root it out at its source and commit ourselves to never replicating it.</p></speech>

Ashling Murphy could have lived in any community in this country.  She could have been our daughter, sister or friend.  The sad reality is that as women, we have grown up expecting to be on guard or feel vulnerable doing simple day-to-day tasks, whether that is walking alone at night, going for a run, waiting for a taxi or bus or sometimes just being in the presence of a man who makes us feel uncomfortable.  That is the key point in all of this.  Why should a woman feel less safe doing things a man would not even think twice about?  Why should women have to live with an acceptable level of fear in their everyday lives?</p>  <p>  Societal change is necessary.  We need to educate boys from a young age on how their behaviour can contribute to the genuine fears and worries that women face.  As legislators we must play our part and, in consultation with the various women's groups, look at what we can do to stop violence against women in every permutation in which it presents itself.  I am pleased to have made changes in the Department of Social Protection that will ensure women can have immediate access to rent supplement in cases where they leave home as a result of domestic violence.  When we talk about zero tolerance for violence against women, we must mean it.  It must be reflected in the sentences that are handed down to perpetrators.  I hope the increased awareness of violence against women that this awful crime has brought about can be used to make positive, lasting changes so that future generations of women do not feel the heavy burden of the fear of being attacked for no other reason than their gender.</p>  <p>  Finally, my thoughts and prayers are with Ashling Murphy's family and friends at this exceptionally difficult time and with the families of all of the murdered women who have gone before her.</p></speech>

Physical wounds will heal eventually, albeit leaving nasty permanent scars, but psychological wounds remain open, sore and exposed.  More often than not, the right balm to soothe the psychic wound cannot be found and it continues to ooze throughout a person's life, manifesting in multifaceted anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorders.  The scale of the damage inflicted varies from one victim to the next, depending on the level of depravity.</p><p>For Ashling's grieving family and her boyfriend Ryan, today's statements are only words.  An irreplaceable light has been extinguished in their lives.  Meanwhile, a spotlight has been shone on this House, not just to sympathise but to act and to deliver.  As I said last week, this unspeakable tragedy simply must be a catalyst for change.  As the Ceann Comhairle knows, I have never been afraid of challenging the <i>status quo</i>, as a woman and for women, even if it meant starting uncomfortable conversations or debates.  On occasion, I have been made fun of because of my outspoken views, whether they be on the status of women within the Catholic Church or, more recently, on challenging society's attitudes towards gender equality.  There have been points throughout my political career when I have been accused by men, both inside and outside this House, of not understanding matters of equality and I have been mansplained to about gender equality.  Like many women, I have been forced to bite my tongue for fear of being judged too shrill but that stops today.  The reality is that part of the exercise of implementing some of the changes which have been correctly and admirably put forward here today is not just about listening to what women need and want; it is also about ensuring that women are present at decision-making tables right across society.</p><p>While it is true that some men might be able to understand the issues facing women, there is not one man among us who will physically feel the same shame, guilt, anxiety or sheer worthlessness that we are made to feel at times.  I know what it is like to say &quot;No&quot; but for it to fall on deaf ears.  I know what it is like to be made to feel inferior.  I know what it is like to feel like prey.  We are the hunted, conditioned for decades to change our route home, to text when safely home or in the taxi, to not walk alone in the dark and to dress appropriately so as not to attract unwanted attention.  This has to stop.  Women did not create this culture and it therefore follows that the onus should not fall on women alone to solve it.  It falls to each and every one of us in this House and not just those of us who have been shouting the loudest; not just those of us who still believe there are some misogynistic articles in our Constitution which must be amended; not those of us who have repeatedly called for our family court system to be upgraded and for our criminal justice system to be improved, as well as having more robust legislation around sentencing; not just those of us who demanded that this House establish a special Oireachtas committee on gender equality; not just those of us who worked to support Safe Ireland and Airbnb to provide emergency refuge spaces to women escaping instances of domestic violence at the height of the pandemic; and not just those of us who regularly participate around meeting tables or speaking chambers with men, men and more men.  We know full well what being in a minority is like, to wear that invisible brooch of inequality every single day.  I do not just understand the concept of inequality and discrimination; I live it every single day, along with every other woman in this House.</p> <p>Make no mistake; I am seething.  I am not prepared to sit on my hands and listen to words.  As a female public representative, I can call for increased action but as a woman, I am demanding it.  There is too much at stake.  We have reached a tipping point.  It is long past time.</p></speech>

It has to be called out.  Any of those men who were unwise enough to have their little feelings hurt in the context of the debate last week can just take a hike or spend that time thinking about how they can make the women in their community feel safer today and every day.</p>  <p>  I want to take a moment to put on the record of the House a few names that should be remembered this month: Joyce Quinn, Miriam O'Donohue, Mandy Smyth, Gr&aacute;inne Dillon, Jean Scanlon, Marie Bridgeman, Dolores McCrea, Amy Farrell, Rebecca Kinsella, Marioara Rostas, Anne Corcoran, Loredana Pricajan, Breda Waters, Veronica Vollrath, Rudo Mawere, Jane Braidwood, Jasmine McMonagle, Elżbieta Piotrowska, Urantsetseg Tserendorj, Sharon Bennett and Ashling Murphy.  Those are the names of 21 women we know of who lost their lives needlessly and at the hands of a man during the month of January in the past 27 years.  Reading about each of these women over the past few days, it was again clear that it does not matter what your job is, what precautions you take, what time you are out at, how bright it is or if you are in your own home.  By simply existing, women's lives are at risk from men whom they know and men whom they do not know.  They are at risk of being strangled to death or being stabbed not once but numerous times, often with a bread knife and in their own home.  From my reading, those were the two most common ways of taking a woman's life that kept appearing across the years for those 21 women.</p>  <p>  In my reading, I came across a piece by a person referred to only as "Ita" called "The Killing Fields of Ireland" in response to femicide that year.  She wrote "And women of all ages die at the hands of men they have known, the hands of men who have fathered their children and men they have shared drinks with in the pub."  That piece was written in December 1997, a quarter of a century ago, yet here we stand in 2022 having the same conversation, experiencing the same atrocities, losing more lives.  Nothing seems to have changed.</p>  <p>  I have a deep concern that, as we move out of the Covid period, when front-line services tell us that attacks at home are more frequent and severe, we will hear more about this issue in the coming years.  Women continue to pay for being women with their lives, most often at the hands of those whom they know.  Women pay for being a woman in lots of other ways - financially, physically, culturally and through daily fear, one which is low grade but constant and ever present.  When we speak up, as we so often do, on many aspects of our lives, it is often dismissed, consciously or unconsciously, as "Ah, the women".  Well, no more.  The reality that this House has to face is that this must change entirely.</p></speech>

Ashling's beautiful, talented life was viciously taken from her around this time last week.  Her death has left a devastating void in the lives of her family, boyfriend, friends and work colleagues and the little boys and girls in first class in Durrow National School.  Ashling's death has also stopped the nation in its tracks.  It has led to a national debate across kitchen tables and living rooms and it is happening this evening in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  I listened carefully to the last few courageous contributions by female Members articulating something that happens daily in their lives.  It is a story that is often brushed aside and not listened to but it has been very much listened to this evening, I hope.</p>  <p>  The shrine outside D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann features some very saddening and thought-provoking slogans.  I have seen the slogan #NotAllMen but I saw a sign with the words, "Not All Men But All Women".  I stopped and looked at it.  It caught my attention for a while.  Yes, most men are good men but there are some horrible men and many men who stand by silently.  The real eye-opener for me in the past week has been the many conversations I have had with my mother, sisters and female friends.  There are probably 2% or 3% of places where I do not feel safe.  I will walk the streets of Dublin tonight to get some fresh air in my lungs after leaving the D&aacute;il.  There are probably only a few alleyways that I would not go down but I feel quite safe.  It is quite the reverse for women.  There are probably 2% or 3% of places in the city where they feel safe.  That is perverse.  It is wrong that women feel like that every night.  My wife told me recently that she drives the roads with the car doors locked.  I thought this bizarre until she told me the reasons she does so.  She said she would not drive into car parks.  I would drive anywhere or walk most places.  That is how most men live.  Without wishing to take from Ashling Murphy's death, it has been hugely eye-opening for a lot of young men in Ireland to hear these experiences over the past week.</p>  <p>  These cannot just be words in the D&aacute;il.  We have heard many strong statements this evening but they have to be backed up with actions and resources.  I hope the new intake of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the coming weeks can play its part.  The message, "Not all men but all women", must be front and centre of this debate and our guiding light as we move forward.</p>  <p>  I will conclude by mentioning short sentencing and early release from prison.  We need to have a good look at our judicial and penal systems in Ireland.  It is a kick in the face for victims and their families to see murderers and rapists walking the streets eight or nine years after the event.  There have been cases in recent days which I will not mention.  There are depraved cases where people get eight or nine-year sentences.  That is wrong.  Part of what we do going forward must be to ensure that people who engage in rotten, depraved crimes will pay for them.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a hanam d&iacute;lis.</p></speech>

Lots of words have been spoken since her horrific murder last Wednesday, words of anger, compassion, love and deep sadness.  There are not really the right words to properly convey how deeply Ashling's murder has affected us all and shaken the whole nation.  However, I would like to share some words written by Orla Muldoon, a professor of psychology, in <i>The Irish Times</i>last Friday.  She wrote:</p> <blockquote> 	Disproportionately, year on year, the pattern is clear nationally and internationally.  Men kill women, men assault women, men harass women.  Not all men, not even many men.  But it is nearly always men, not women, who kill women. </blockquote>  <p>Ministers and Deputies have spoken of how many people have shared their stories and experiences over the past week, whether jeering, street harassment, exposure, groping and much more serious incidents of coercive control, assault and rape.  All, without exception, were at the hands of men.  Everyone is looking for change and for the systemic violence perpetrated by men against women to stop.</p><p>Before coming to the House today, I spoke to a friend whose sister was murdered five years ago by her partner to get a family perspective.  It struck me how important it is that when a woman in a situation of domestic violence reaches out for help, that such help is there.  It might be a moment where the woman gets the courage to say she does think the situation she is in is good.  If help is not forthcoming at that time, it is a moment missed.  It is important, therefore, that resources are available and people are sufficiently trained and know how to handle that situation.  As we know, women often get to a stage where they do not believe they are in such a bad situation.  When they make that brave move they need to be sure that someone has their back.</p><p>While I did not want my contribution to include a whole bunch of statistics, I do want to mention that the World Health Organization estimates that one in three women, which equates to 736 million women, is subjected to physical or sexual violence by a partner or sexual violence by a non-partner in her lifetime.  That figure has remained largely unchanged in the past decade.  We need to ensure that everything we have seen, with the vigils in the past week and all the words spoken here this evening, results in change and is a catalyst for change.  A point that has been raised, and I welcome that it will be addressed, is that this issue does not fall to one specific Department but comes under many different areas.  Some areas fall within the Department of Children, while others are for the Department of Justice.  A joined-up approach is imperative.</p><p>I have been struck by many of the contributions.  However, we need to ensure that this discussion results in action.</p> <p> I also raise one of the recommendations the Citizens' Assembly on gender equality made for a programme relating to sexual education, relationships, the role of consent and how important that is and recognising what is, what constitutes a good and healthy relationship and gender power dynamics within relationships.  It is imperative we roll out that programme.  It was an excellent recommendation from that assembly and we need to see it rolled out at primary and secondary school level in an age-appropriate way.  There cannot be any more excuses.  Those in schools cannot feel uncomfortable.  We need to provide resources and ensure it happens.  We also need an updated sexual abuse and violence in Ireland report.</p> <p> This has been referenced by other Deputies, but nine counties, including Carlow in my constituency, do not have women's refuges.  As previous speakers indicated, we do not have the required bed space.  I also echo the calls by the National Women's Council of Ireland with regard to compiling comprehensive data on the number of women suffering violence at the hands of men.  It is crucial that we get this data together.  I am always struck in these debates by our history in relation to women.  Since the foundation of the State, we have not had a good history in this regard, in particular with the Magdalen laundries and mother and baby institutions.  We cannot keep repeating mistakes and continuously have debates here during which we declare that we are shocked and outraged.  We as legislators have the power to make really progressive change.  It is not going to happen overnight and the response must be multifaceted.  From what I heard earlier and this evening, however, the political will seems to exist across the board.  We should really take that now and ensure there is action and not just words.</p></speech>

UN statistics show that one in three women worldwide experiences some sort of sexual or physical violence.  In line with the statistics here, it is mostly by an intimate partner.  Fewer than 40% of women who experience violence seek help of any sort and 42% of women experience intimate partner violence and report an injury as a consequence of that violence.  Those are the parameters in which we are having this debate.</p><p>Tomorrow is the anniversary of Urantsetseg Tserendorj.  I hope I have pronounced that noble woman's name right.  She was a migrant worker from Mongolia who lost her life on her way home from her work as a cleaner in a bank.  She was a mother of two.  It is worth mentioning her name here.</p><p>I also went into the matter this morning but I again refer to the details around the lack of space in refuges and also the housing crisis itself.  There are many forms of violence against women.  The lack of housing and homelessness are also forms of state violence against women.  Indeed, something like 40% of women who are in homeless accommodation have suffered physical abuse.  If that is a global figure and the global picture, we must ask ourselves why is it happening.  This is rooted in the system of profit, the system that for generations and hundreds of years has insisted on and set the demarcation in society that women stay at home and breed children, rear them, do all the caring work relating to them and ensure that they are socialised, fed and ready to become the next generation of workers.  That is what for thousands of years has put women in the dark and ensure they are not recognised as unique human beings.  I quote a journalist named Fiona Vera-Gray in <i>The Guardian</i>who says:</p> <blockquote> 	We are living in a world where women&rsquo;s humanity is constantly undermined.  Where what we look like is more important than what we do, and where what is done to us is more important than who we are.  Research on men&rsquo;s sexual aggression has shown that the denial of women&rsquo;s 'human uniqueness' is a driving factor for some men who commit [violent and] sexual offences. </blockquote>  <p>I really want to push the question of education and non-ethos-based sex education in our schools.  It must be of that nature, otherwise we are not going to rear a generation of men and boys, and indeed girls, who understand that uniqueness of human beings.</p><p>There is also the question of why it is that women's bodies, women's shapes and women's images are used to make vast amounts of money.  The pornographic industry is one of the most lucrative businesses on the planet.  There is a fact that was published recently which indicates that the traffic of those accessing porn on the Internet - and it must be said that pornography on the Internet involving women is increasingly more violent and deadly in certain circumstances - from on sites that stream it is more per month than the traffic relating to Netflix, Amazon and Twitter combined.  That is a startling statistic and it reflects so badly on the world we live in, which is a world that undermines women's humanity.  The question of culture is a big part of it here and non-consent of women is seem by some as titillating, as attractive, as a barrier to be overcome and as a challenge.  Coercion is often seen as being sexy and the brutality of that cannot be overstated.  Thus, we will not change the minds of men just by talking about it; we change their minds by starting with the root-and-branch causes of it.</p><p>I will finish on the role of this House.  We cannot exonerate the previous Government for its failure in this area.  It was mentioned in the newspapers this week, and I mentioned it several times in the previous D&aacute;il, but what has happened to second SAVI report?  The Minister's predecessor, Francis Fitzgerald MEP, replied to me in November 2017 when I asked her if she could lean on the then Taoiseach to spend the money to produce the second SAVI report.  She stated:</p> <blockquote> 	We need up-to-date macro information on sexual and domestic violence in this country.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />This matter was discussed at a Cabinet sub-committee last week. The initial scoping work has begun to determine how precisely it will be carried out. </blockquote>  <p>That was almost five years ago, and a new report is almost 20 years overdue.  How then do those on the Minister's side of the House explain the inadequacies in dealing with this problem if the Government cannot even produce a report?</p></speech>

The horrific events in Tullamore are a wake-up call to Irish society and the reaction must mark a watershed for change.  The death of Savita Halappanavar was a watershed moment but only because of a struggle for change that was then waged from below.  Does anyone seriously believe that Ireland's political establishment would have organised a repeal referendum were it not for the ferocious pressure they were put under to do so?  Similarly, does anyone really believe a political establishment that underfunds women's refuges, presides over the 999 calls scandal and has failed to produce a SAVI report for 20 years will tackle violence against women with sufficient determination unless it is compelled to do so?  For this reason, I add my voice to the call made by Reproductive rights, against Oppression Sexism and Austerity, ROSA, the socialist feminist organisation, for an emergency conference of women's groups, trade unions, student groups, LGBTQ groups and others to now launch a nationwide campaign against gender-based violence.  In conclusion, International Women's Day on 8 March should be turned into a day of massive protests on the streets of this country, including strikes, to say "No more; not one more death" and to put the Government under ferocious pressure on these issues.</p></speech>

We know an act of depravity has robbed us of one of our own; one reared in the best of Irish traditions by decent, solid people and communities who taught Ashling to love life and live it to the full, which she most definitely did, as should we all.  Initially in these statements and the debate later, we should remember Ashling for the women she was.  We should remember her and all those who grieve her terrible loss.  She was a musician, a teacher and a mentor.  We know she was kind, caring, generous and talented.</p> <p>She was a daughter, a sister, a girlfriend, a niece, cousin, friend, a colleague and a proud Offaly woman.  Today, in this Chamber, in addition to our remembrance of her, we have to take action.  After her funeral yesterday, today should be the first day of action for Ashling.</p> <p> We have to do what we can, insofar as we can, to ensure the likes of this may not happen again.  It must start with education.  I am a father of two boys and two girls.  I have a responsibility as a father but also now as a legislator to ensure young boys and men are better educated.  I have a responsibility to know that we must better protect young girls and women.  We, the elected members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, have to commit to ensure that we work day and night so that Ashling Murphy is never forgotten.  We have great pride in Offaly in saying that "the faithful never die".  Our footballers, hurlers and camogie teams have a never say die attitude.  It is incumbent on us to make sure that Ashling Murphy's legacy never dies.</p> <p> I do not have all the answers; nor does any individual in this Chamber.  I am no angel or saint but I know that politics cannot be the barrier to working together on these issues and on this matter.  We have a duty to set aside politics and respond to the calls of the people of Ireland.  In my lifetime, I have seen the deaths of Veronica Guerin and Savita Halappanavar precipitate change.  I have seen in the past week, as we all have, our country and its society crying out for Ashling Murphy's death to precipitate a change in men's attitudes and behaviour towards, about and to women.  Maybe then girls and women can freely walk the canal line in Tullamore, named Fiona's Way, or whatever beauty spot it is in any town or village, in whatever part of this beautiful countryside that is available to us all.  Maybe then women and girls can take a stroll, walk or jog like me - like a man - without any fear.  When that is the case and, hopefully, it will be, we will at least know that Ashling Murphy's death was the day that men got the message and the day that women got the equality they deserve, which to our shame unfortunately is long overdue.</p></speech>

I would like to take this opportunity to express my sincere condolences to Ashling's family and to her boyfriend, friends, colleagues and all who knew and loved her.  I hope that they take some solace from knowing that a nation stands behind them and that at vigils up and down the country people came together to share their heartbreak and anger.  Many people have talked about this as a watershed moment and I truly hope that is right because too many women have tragically died from violence.  This week, too many families had wounds reopened and too many communities, including my own in Lucan, relived the trauma of losing a woman to violence.</p>  <p>  There is a spectrum of misogyny and abuse towards women.  On one end of it, there is catcalling and lad banter, while on the other sits physical abuse, rape and murder.  We need to acknowledge that all these actions are connected and that both ends of that spectrum are fuelled by a lack of respect and misogynistic attitudes towards women and girls.  Violence against women finds its roots in the normalisation of actions and comments that objectify and disrespect women and girls every single day in our WhatsApp groups, locker rooms, media and politics.  It is on our streets and along our canals.  While the murder of a woman may be rare, it is not rare enough.  As has been said all too many times, it is not all men but it is all women.  Sadly, all women have a story to tell of feeling uncomfortable, demeaned, unsafe, scared, threatened and fearful.  The fact that all women can relate to these experiences tells us all we need to know about the culture of disrespect towards women and violence against them.</p>  <p>  We need action to change that in our homes, classrooms, workplaces, WhatsApp groups and among our friends and families.  We also need action at the top among our lawmakers and enforcers.  The Minister, Deputy McEntee, has today outlined new laws that will make stalking and choking stand-alone offences, in addition to the new third national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, which will be our most ambitious yet and will focus on prevention, protection, prosecution and policies.  It will have an overarching ambition to make sure that the punishment fits the crime because that is how we get zero tolerance.</p>  <p>  We should not know Ashling Murphy's name.  We should not now recognise her face because of media coverage, but we do.  She tragically joins a long and shameful list of women who have died violently at the hands of men.  We cannot let another year go by in which we look back at these women's lives and remember them only for how they died.  Let this be the year we remember the change they sparked in Irish society.  Let this be the year we all do better.</p></speech>

It was also an event that has highlighted the fear that exists among women in our society for their personal safety.  The shocking killing of Ashling Murphy has enabled and encouraged women to talk openly about that fear.  More important, it has forced society to listen to that fear.  I regret to say that it should not have required the brutal murder of Ashling Murphy in order for the very real fears of women to get a thorough and appropriate response.</p>  <p>  Before we start talking about advancing solutions, we have to identify the problem, which is that we continue to see in Ireland and elsewhere violence being perpetrated against women and women being fearful because of the threat of that violence.  We need to recognise that this is a problem that is not to be measured simply by the number of women who are killed or go missing each year.  It also has to be measured through other measurements.  It should be measured by the low-level assaults perpetrated on women by men, most of which go unreported; it should be measured by the violence within the home, most of which goes unreported; it should be measured by the creepy harassment that women have to put up with from men, which is never really something that men are exposed to; and it should be measured by the intimidatory control that can be exerted on women through the physical strength some men have.</p>  <p>  We also need to recognise that the violence perpetrated against women mostly happens when a man attacks a woman with whom he is in a relationship because he believes he should be able to assert control over that woman.  It also happens when men who encounter a woman they do not know believe that the use of intimidation or violence is acceptable in order to control or impose themselves on that woman.  Regrettably, some men, in Ireland and elsewhere, believe that women should be controlled and submissive to men and that violence is an acceptable way of achieving those aims.  That requires a change in culture and attitude on the part of Irishmen.</p>  <p>  We also need to acknowledge that while it is not just a legislative response that is required, a legislative and criminal justice response is appropriate.  A small group of men in Irish society believe that it is acceptable to exert and impose violence upon women.  If we are to deal with this legislatively, we need to start at a low level, where we come down very strongly on low-level harassment and low-level assaults and criminalise them to a greater extent than we have to date.</p></speech>

The whole country has been united in sorrow and anger over the past week.  That must mean something and it must count for something.  We have to remember, as has been stated, that Ashling is one of 244 women who have died violently since 1966 and we have to ask ourselves why, in 2022, there is so much left to do.  The truth is that we have not prioritised addressing violence against women.  We must do so in a serious way.</p>  <p>  I listened intently to the Minister's contribution.  I think she is genuine in her approach and in what she is setting out to do.  I am also encouraged regarding the reaction across the political divide.  I did not know what to expect coming in here.  I am encouraged that there is a willingness and openness to work together on this.  If there needs to be one legacy from Ashling, it should be that we do that and play our part.  Each of us has a part of play in terms of legislation and of making sure that the things women are asking us to change are changed here and now.</p>  <p>  I remember today all the lives cut short because of violence and domestic violence.  We often fail to remember the women who have suffered in our communities.  The data is important because the violence against and abuse of women is so hidden.  We know that only about 25% of women ever seek help and that so much of it goes unreported.  Again, we have to ask why.  The reason is that women do not feel that they will get the support they need.  From all these discussions, including today, there will be a huge increase in the number of women coming forward.  I encourage women to come forward to get support and help.  I ask the Minister to make sure that the resources are there for all those calls to be answered and for women to get the help they need in a meaningful way.</p>  <p>  We have asked for years for a Minister solely in charge and we all agree the way forward is a key leadership role in Cabinet.  Otherwise, things will not happen.  Everybody has been responsible and nobody has been responsible for many of the things that have happened and that should have been addressed before they happened.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge what Deputy Stanton did with regard to coercive control.  Deputy Bacik is here.  We worked on this matter together.  That was a good example of working on a cross-party basis in the Seanad with the Civic Engagement Group.  I do not want to start naming individuals because I know that I will leave somebody out, but Colette Kelleher comes to mind.  She is no longer in the Seanad.  I know, and Deputy Bacik will know, that when Deputy Stanton, as a Minister of State, was trying to bring that forward, he encountered blocks.  The Minister will meet with blocks in the Civil Service of people saying that it cannot be done or it cannot be done in a certain way.  The Minister has the collective mandate of all of us in this Chamber to get rid of those blocks and make sure that we make a difference.</p>  <p>  I want to remember Sandra Collins today and I want to appeal to people.  Sandra has not been seen since December 2000.  She is one of the missing women.  The Garda file on her case remains open.  The family accept that she is no longer with us; all they want is for her body to be returned.  I appeal again today for that to be happen.</p>  <p>  Regarding perpetrators of violence who are former partners and husbands, will the Minister please do something to make sure that children are not forced to meet such perpetrators?  There are too many judgments being made where it is known that there have been violent relationships and where the children of perpetrators of violence are made to go and meet those same people.</p>  <p>  There are many things we can do.  I feel encouraged by the commitments today.  We will work together, and it is our duty to do so.  Can we bring this matter back onto the floor of the House every two months, even for this year, in order to make sure that we measure the commitments made today in terms of strategy and other things?  We should continuously measure that these things are being done.  We cannot afford to just let this slide.</p></speech>

I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  I wish it was taking place under different circumstances.  I convey my heartfelt sympathies to the Murphy family, the school community in Durrow and the members of the wider Offaly community, all of whom have been traumatised by the horrendous events of recent days.</p><p>The 33rd D&aacute;il will always be remembered for being the pandemic Parliament.  Over time, however, we will be judged by how we address a different epidemic in this country, namely, that of violence against women.  That epidemic has persisted and there appears to be no vaccine.</p><p>I was struck by the images of Ashling's seven-year-old schoolchildren at the funeral yesterday.  A good way to memorialise and respect the memory of Ashling would be to ensure those children grow up in a different Ireland than the one we had last week and that they never have to experience intimidation, threats, assaults or fear for being a woman or a girl.  Ashling has done her bit in that regard.  It now falls to us to do our bit as well.</p><p>We should be addressing this issue from two directions: first, from a structural point of view; and, second, from a behavioural point of view.  From a structural point of view, I take the Minister's point that it is not exclusively a criminal justice issue, but it is a major factor and we need to reform our criminal justice system.  Our bail laws, one could argue, are a joke.  There are people who have been charged with serious crimes and are out on the street having paid &euro;200 bail, which is unacceptable.  A 20-year minimum sentence for murder does not cut it any more and does not have the deterrent value it used to have.  They get out after 14 years with six years suspended.  We need life for life.  It should be a 40-year minimum sentence for murder.  That is the appropriate deterrent that is required. </p><p>We need to fund our refuge system.  It is incredible that we still have counties that do not have women's refuges.  We also need more active and visible policing on our streets and in our communities.  We are blessed in this country that we have seasoned investigators who can retrospectively investigate crimes and prosecute the perpetrators, but would it not be so much better if we had more police who could proactively prevent and deter crimes from happening in the first place?</p><p>The behavioural piece is much more nuanced and difficult to sort.  How will we address it?  First, we have to accept and recognise that we have a problem and that we have a sizable minority of men in this country with unhealthy attitudes towards women.  I agree with some other contributors that we have to get in early and educate in the context of how appropriate behaviour is taught in primary and secondary schools.  As men, we have to call out and confront any inappropriate behaviours we see.  The standards we walk by are the standards we accept.</p><p>We have a lot of work to do to solve this problem.  The structural issues are the responsibility of the Minister and the Government but the behavioural issues are the responsibility of us all.  Changing culture is a massive undertaking and sometimes it is hard to know where to start.  It is appropriate that I finish with the words of a gentleman who is probably rarely quoted in this Chamber.  It is none other than Michael Jackson.  His words are fitting:</p> <blockquote> 	I'm starting with the man in the mirror<br /><br />I'm asking him to change his ways. </blockquote></speech>

People across Ireland and beyond were shocked, repulsed and, understandably, panicked by the senseless killing of a young, vibrant and talented woman.  Within hours, the shock turned to anger and the panic turned to fury.  The horror of what took place has led to demands that what happened to Ashling Murphy on that canal path must never be allowed to happen again.  It is impossible to disagree with such reactions.  Violence in any form is not acceptable.  Recent years in Ireland have seen an inexorable rise in violent crime.  Men, women and children have lost their lives in despicable circumstances, some of them killed by strangers and others by trusted family members.  In an ideal world, we would eradicate violence but, unfortunately, we do not live in an ideal world.  The safety of our fellow human beings can never be guaranteed, regardless of what laws and actions are put in place.  That does not mean there is nothing we can do to prevent a repeat of what happened to Ashling and the hundreds before her.  </p> <p> Violence of all types has been played out to such an extent on our TV screens in recent years that people have become almost immune to it.  Familiar actors on screens in our kitchens and living rooms carry out domestic, sexual and gender-based violence on a nightly basis.  Children and vulnerable adults are exposed to such an extent that they are no longer abhorred by it.  They watch it with their families.  Subconsciously, they begin to accept it as normal.  This is fuelled by the Internet and social media.  One would have to say that access to pornography for young kids is detrimental to the formation of a proper attitude.  With this combination, the formative minds of our young people are distorted and desensitised to violence and inappropriate standards of behaviour.  The first step that must be taken to address this is to educate our children that violence, cruelty, oppression and murder are not normal and will not be tolerated.  This education must start primarily in the home, in our schools, on our sports fields and in our youth activities.  Parents, teachers and mentors must strive to effectively instil the need for respect and equality in our children; respect and equality for all, regardless of gender, age, ethnic background, colour or creed.  This education should and must continue into our third level educational facilities.  It must then continue into our workplaces and social outlets.  Respect and responsibility must become a normal part of everyday life.  This can only happen if it starts from the bottom up and is taught from an early age.</p> <p> Women are not treated equally in many situations.  The inequality may be less blatant than it was in the past but it remains.  It remains ingrained in the mentality of many men and it remains a heavy burden for many women.  Similarly, it must be acknowledged that gender equality must apply across the board.  The stereotyping of both men and women must end.  The use of inappropriate behaviour by men must be called out.  Shallow condemnation of women, who are all too often accused of instigating the crimes carried out against them, belongs to a different era.</p> <p> From a judicial perspective, the public needs to know that justice will be done.  When a perpetrator of violence is brought to justice, the sentence handed down must be the sentence served.  Nothing less is tolerable.  This is just one of the ways in which the Government can bring about positive change.</p> <p> I welcome the fact that prior to this tragedy, the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, and the Government carried out many months of extensive work on legislation to address all forms of gender-based violence.  That legislation is due to come before this House shortly.  It is needed and demanded.  We must enact new, robust laws.  We must fully resource our enforcement agencies and implement the full rigours of the law.</p></speech>

I hope this debate and all that is being said here will result in action being taken.  It is very sad to see a woman who had contributed so much in her life having that life stolen from her when she could have contributed an awful lot more.  She was so loved, as we have seen on our television screens and across the media.</p>  <p>  The challenge is for us.  I have witnessed debates in this House that have taken place in similar circumstances, responding to outrageous, horrific acts.  I have seen little done after the debate has died down and the focus of the public has moved elsewhere.  I ask Members of this House to reflect on what they have said here today and to ensure that action follows.  Deputy Conway-Walsh is right that we need to ensure we come back to these debates again.</p>  <p>  I would like to know about the Grace case and the 47 others.  I would like to know about JoJo Dollard.  I would like to know what is happening to those people who burned down a lady's house with her in it.  I am talking about events in my own constituency.  Those are horrific acts and yet they go unpunished.  It gives licence to the next individual to do something else, something even worse.  As a society, we tend to tolerate it.  It seems as if we are numb to any sort of big reaction.  I am afraid the eyes of the country and the world are on us and if we do not do something to ensure that the existing laws are implemented, we are failing society.  How many times have we discussed children being abused?  How often have we discussed the elderly being abused in care homes and care settings?  How many times have different women from different parts of the country been raped and had their lives ruined?  We have seen the death of Shane O'Farrell, a matter I have raised in this House.  That brings grief to a mother, a sister and a family.  We cannot overlook that but what has happened is we have overlooked it.  The laws are there.  The agencies are there.  What are they doing with the current laws?  I have confidence that the Minister, Deputy McEntee, will bring us to a different level in exercising the law, implementing it and taking action.  It is on that we will be judged.</p></speech>

It was important to include an audit of Department actions on this issue in the programme for Government.  I know how seriously the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, and the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, took that work and I absolutely can see the benefit of a new direction.  However, in that context, I would like to draw attention to the many migrant women who have suffered gender-based violence or have been victims of femicide.  If we are to move to a more justice-based model on gender-based violence, we should make sure we do not lose the human rights aspect and focus.  Migrant women are over-represented in the statistics on femicide.  The State has been warned that the current initiatives around gender-based violence are failing to reach migrant women and that their immigration status can sometimes be used as a tool of control.  It can lock them into violent situations.  Any State strategy on this must recognise the particular vulnerability of migrant women if it is to succeed in stopping femicide and gender-based violence in Ireland.  Otherwise some women will continue to be left behind.</p>  <p>  I really want the experience of Urantsetseg Tserendorj to be mentioned on the Official Report of the D&aacute;il today.  She was a mother of two from my own constituency.  Tomorrow is the first anniversary of her life being taken from her.  She died a horrific death last year, just one month before Sarah Everard, whose name the whole world learned, died in London.</p> <p>Urantsetseg Tserendorj was a cleaner.  She was returning from work when she was stabbed in the International Financial Services Centre, IFSC.  Her family had to travel from Mongolia during a pandemic to say goodbye to her.  What her family has endured this year is really horrific.  That story is also part of our nation's understanding of gender-based violence.</p> <p> If we are to proceed now with a renewed commitment to this area, I ask for the following issues to be included and a particular focus placed on vulnerable women.  Migrant women must be central to any strategy as they are particularly vulnerable.  Migrant women have the right to be safe.  Sex workers need to be included in any strategy.  We cannot afford to continue with any ideas of good or bad victims of violence based on misogynistic ideas of morality around how women should behave or what is acceptable to us.  Sex workers have the right to be safe too.</p> <p> Women, girls and all minorities should be supported to reclaim their streets and freedoms.  It is simply not good enough that local authorities, public transport companies etc. expect women to curtail their freedoms and movements to protect themselves instead of providing adequate lighting and security and active and passive surveillance in order to ensure that public spaces, facilities, parks and transport are safe for everyone at all times.  We are not a minority; women are the public.  While I hope to have many more debates in this House on the issue of eradicating gender violence, I hope it is never again in the circumstances in which we find ourselves this week.</p></speech>

The most important thing we could do now as a community is to make sure that her family continue to be supported at this very difficult time.  The total and absolute devastation and what they had to face is just unbelievable.  Our support and that of the community is very important.  She was a wonderful person - a brilliant and caring teacher so obviously and clearly loved by all her family, friends and pupils.  One important thing I learned about is the hugely supportive community that is around her in Tullamore and in the Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann, GAA and camogie clubs.  That is really fantastic and I know it brought hope to that family and to the whole country.</p>  <p>  I listened to people like Orla O'Connor from the National Women's Council talk about zero tolerance for misogyny and sexism, support in schools for changes in programmes and so on, dealing with issues in third level, dealing with sporting organisations and, as my colleague said, creating safer public places by installing CCTV in walks which are not safe at times and having proper public lighting, more Garda patrols and better footpaths.  They are the small little things that communities can help with.</p>  <p>  I also wish to commend the Drogheda Dolls in my area, which organised a vigil, and Women's Aid, in particular.  There was huge support and acknowledgement publicly in Ardee, Dundalk, Drogheda and Bettystown of the devastation and concerns raised.</p>  <p>  I will say one very important thing, which I said in this Chamber last year during the debate on domestic violence.  Since 1996, 203 women and 16 children have died as a result of domestic violence.  Three of those women died in 2020.  That was in the Women's Aid annual report last year.  There were 290,000 visits to the Women's Aid website, which concerns an awful lot of people.  There were 24,800 contacts about emotional, physical and sexual abuse.  That was up 43% on the previous year.  There were 709 murder threats, 148 pregnant women abused and 28 miscarriages.  It is not good enough.  It is time for change.  This House will act collectively.</p></speech>

The Minister said Ashling Murphy's fatal assault must be the watershed moment.  I know the Government is determined to tackle this issue.  The Minister herself said she is taking action for change.</p>  <p>  According to Safe Ireland, when Ireland was at the height of its second level 5 lockdown, more than 2,180 women and 600 children received support from a dedicated domestic violence service.  This is an increase of 40%.  The lack of refuge places and transitional housing for women and children fleeing domestic violence must be urgently addressed.  In the 26 counties, nine have no refuge at all and as I said to the Taoiseach today, County Carlow is one of them.</p>  <p>  Let me highlight one case as an example of what is happening.  Last weekend, a woman and her children came for help.  She had to return to a violent situation because there was no emergency accommodation for her in Carlow.  She was forced to return to a violent situation.  She had no choice.</p>  <p>  Last November, I called for the urgent completion of the Tusla review of emergency accommodation nationwide.  It is vital now that we have joined up thinking across the different agencies and Departments to tackle the problem.  I was delighted to hear today that all parties are coming together to work on this.  We also need to look at local authority involvement.  There is no national strategy for them to deal with these issues.  There is no dedicated line to contact anyone and no support on evenings or weekends.  This is a national crisis that must be sorted and acted upon.</p>  <p>  I want to compliment Amber Women's Refuge in Kilkenny and Carlow Women's Aid, which although under-resourced provide vital services.  This issue needs more support now, however.  Your heart would break when a family comes to you and you actually cannot help them because of a lack of resources.</p>  <p>  Since last week, there have been conversations about women taking more self-defence classes and carrying pepper spray.  I even got one email from a man about guns.  The answer is not for women to bear the burden, however.  The answer is to make our places safe where they are not safe.  We must create them.  I join all the women who contacted me this week in calling for change - those who work with victims of violence, those who like myself have daughters and those who are victims.  If we are not that woman, we know her and see her.  We have to listen to her and save her.  Now must be the time.  We have had enough.  Enough is enough.  I thank the Minister.</p></speech>

Our hearts have been broken by the tragic murder of Ashling Murphy on this day last week.  It was most certainly the darkest week in my county of Offaly.  It was horrendous.  People are still shocked and appalled by what happened.</p>  <p>  Ashling was loved and respected in equal measure and her absence has opened a wound in the heart of the Murphy family and in the wider Offaly community.  The family have asked for privacy and the space to grieve in their own way at this difficult time and I intend to respect that request.  Our sorrow has been expressed.  Our tears have fallen and our prayers have been sent.</p>  <p>  Action has been committed to but now we must ensure that action happens.  We need much tougher laws to punish this sort of horrendous behaviour to keep people safe in society.  I believe we can achieve that by working together in a united way as politicians and legislators because that is what we now need to do urgently.</p>  <p>  While Ashling's family, her partner Ryan and her friends must now walk the path they have been forced onto through no wish or desire of their own, I can tell them that the communities of Tullamore and Kilcormac Killoughey, along with many other surrounding communities, will stand with them in this difficult time and continue to envelope them in their love and support.  When they call, we will be ready.</p>  <p>  Violence against women is a scourge in our society.  It has tormented women in every culture and pursued them like a dark shadow, determined to keep them in the hidden places of fear and control.  Despite this, there have always been those who are ready to fight back at the personal, cultural, institutional and political level.  That is a task which should and, indeed, as I said earlier, can unite us all.</p>  <p>  Our country and our political discourse will not benefit from demonising men or reducing women to passive spectators in their own fate.  Women have a powerful sense of their own agency and we need to make sure that this is appreciated and acted upon.  In more specific terms, I remain deeply frustrated by the fact that there is not a single domestic violence refuge in County Offaly.  I feel this is a gross betrayal of women and their families that must be urgently addressed.</p> <p>I will conclude by saying that we just cannot allow this situation to continue.  We need to address the issues and to move forward together in partnership and in collaboration, not in bitterness or in division.</p></speech>

Many of us here have spent the week learning about who Ashling Murphy was.  She was a young woman.  She was a teacher.  She was a musician.  She was a daughter, a sister, a friend and mentor to many, a young woman with her whole life ahead of her.  Ashling was known all over the country for a musical talent.  She toured Ireland and the UK with Comhaltas as a member of the prestigious National Folk Orchestra.  Indeed, she often crossed paths with my own daughters through their musical involvement in fleadhanna cheoil and for her love for the Irish music and dance.  They have known each other through the years.  I would like to pay tribute to the whole Comhaltas family, to the former Seanad&oacute;ir, Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, and to his bean ch&eacute;ile Una.  They were heartbroken at the news and they loved her.  My daughters have spoken this week of Ashling&rsquo;s talent, her passion and her love for Irish traditional music.  It is important that we pay tribute to her for the talented musician she was.  It is also important that we remember Ashling as a brilliant musician, not only as a victim of such an unthinkable murder.</p>  <p>  On my own behalf, as well as on behalf of my colleagues in the Rural Independent Group, our deepest condolences go out to her parents, Raymond and Kathleen, to her brother Cathal, to her sister and best friend Amy and to her boyfriend Ryan Casey.  Our hearts break for her family, for her many friends, for the community in which she lived in Ireland, for the traditional music and Comhaltas community, for camogie and GAA, for the students and teaching staff who worked with her in Durrow National School and for all who mourn her loss at this time.  A beautiful life gone far too soon.  As my daughter, M&aacute;ir&iacute;n, remarked during the week, there will be tunes in heaven upon Ashling&rsquo;s arrival.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a hanam uasal ceolmhar.  </p>  <p>  Ashling's most brutal end has shocked the nation and has had a profound impact on the entire country but on women in particular.  A beautiful young woman who had her life ended as she went for a run on a public path has left us all with a deep sense of shock.  This must be a watershed moment for violence against women.  It is just too horrific.  As I said, women and all citizens are entitled to live in safety.  It is time that we address the light-touch justice system that is leading to a society where women are afraid to walk down the street, are afraid to go for a run and are afraid to be alone.</p>  <p>  Far too often, we witness cases in our judicial system where violent crimes, such as common assault, in which those who are repeat offenders get bail numerous times.  They get free legal aid numerous times.  I raise the whole area of tagging.  It would be much easier to find these people with numerous records or criminal convictions if they were tagged.  It is a no-brainer but there is a huge resistance to it.  I hope that the Minister will break the resistance that seems to be present in the justice system.  Simply, people can get free legal aid numerous times.  I believe in two or three strikes and you are out.  I go by the premise of innocent until proven guilty and we must provide that.  However, where there are dozens and dozens of convictions, where there are umpteen instances of getting bail and where there are dozen crimes committed while on bail, it is shocking.  We must stamp this out of society, because it has no place in this country.  We must get real here.  There are problems and there are issues.  We must stand up and be counted and deal with the issues that are glaring in front of us.  </p></speech>

Like many men and women in this country, I have participated in vigils and have shown solidarity.  That is appropriate and it is the human thing to do.  However, in doing that we also have an extra duty as legislators and elected Members to ensure that we make Ireland safe, not just for women but for all of us.</p>  <p>  I am here tonight with just under two minutes.  In that time, I want to put focus on the number of times that we have stood here as women, and indeed my male colleagues, to give statements on violence against women.  There have been statements but little action.  I know that that Minister has taken a personal interest and I pay tribute to that.  However, the numbers speak for themselves in our failure.</p>  <p>  We are looking at Ashling Murphy's death as a watershed.   I come from the city where Manuela Riedo in 2007 at 17 years of age.  She had been barely a wet day in the country.  That was to be watershed.  That was ten years after task force on violence against women in 1997.  It was ten years afterwards and that was to be a watershed.  That followed on from Women's Aid in 1996, which put extraordinary pressure while on a shoestring budget on the Government at that time to produce this.  That was produced. </p>  <p>  In that time since 1996, the figures that are being used is that 244 women have lost their lives.  Indeed, as has been mentioned already, a year tomorrow will mark the death of a young woman from Mongolia.  I will not try to pronounce her name out of respect to the woman who was stabbed in the neck by a 14-year-old boy.  She subsequently died on 3 February 2021.  She deserves remembering, as do all other the faces since who have died.  There are at least seven, not to mention the women and children who have suffered extraordinary violence and injury.  </p>  <p>  We ask ourselves: what are we doing?  Where is the refuge report that was promised?  Where is the national strategy that was promised to be published before Christmas?  These are the specific questions that need to be asked.  It is no longer acceptable that we got an answer last October to say that is would be published in the next few weeks.  It has not been.</p>  <p>  I will come back in later on the other motion.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-01-19a.247" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1569" speakername="Joan Collins" time="18:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022011900036#JJ00500"><p>The loss of the life of a young woman, Ashling Murphy, has been met with a sense of shock, outrage and an outpouring of support and sympathy on a national level.  So it should be.  It appears that Ashling Murphy was killed in a random act of violence by a possibly deranged individual.  I want to express my solidarity and sympathy with the family, her partner and the community.</p>  <p>  I also want to raise the specific issues, even though I have only two minutes, of an attack three weeks ago on a young woman in Ballyfermot, in my constituency of Dublin South-Central.  This young woman was the victim of vicious assault by a group of young men.  This was no random act.  It was premeditated, planned and followed years of verbal abuse and harassment by this gang of thugs in the area.  She was travelling by bus from Liffey Valley to Ballyfermot, where it was reported that she was subjected to abuse by a man who was known to her and who was also on the bus.  It appears that he then called his so-called mates, who then waited for the bus while armed with sticks, bars and knives.  This man joined the group of men where they beat her up badly.  As a consequence of the vicious assault that followed, this woman may lose the sight in her right eye. </p>  <p>  Two individuals who have been arrested for this outrage have been released on bail and are free now in the community.  A number of questions have to be raised.  Why did this young woman and her family not report the years of abuse and harassment to the Garda?  Maybe they did, but the consequences ended up on 30 December 2021.  The answer to me is simple.  People do not think that these issues will be taken seriously by the Garda.  This issue needs to be addressed.  We have reports of 3,000 cancelled calls to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to domestic violence during the lockdown.  We need to change this culture.  People should feel confident in reporting abuse and harassment and should feel confident that it will be taken seriously and dealt with.  Changing the culture in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is crucial in that. </p></speech>

I want to extend my most sincere sympathy to her family, partner, friends and the wider community in Tullamore.</p>  <p>  Over the last few days, many women have huddled and spoken quietly to family and friends.  Many have walked silently, carrying lighted candles.  Others have scoured social media for any news.  This is because this tragic murder has burrowed its way into the marrow of our very bones.  We might ask, &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;  There have been so many other unspeakable attacks and killings of women in Ireland.  Why now?  I think that one of the answers to that question was clearly expressed by the hashtag, "She was just going for a run".  That is a simple, everyday thing that so many women do.  On with the runners and out the door.  However, women know that it is not that simple.  We look out and might think it is getting a bit close to dusk or that the area where I run under the trees is a bit dark.  I might decide to move over to the other side of the road where it is lit.  </p> <p>I might ring someone to come out with me because there is safety in numbers.  It goes on and on, with those kinds of thoughts just flitting through our minds.  They all boil down to one thing - what is the safest thing to do?  In truth, those thoughts are not always at the forefront of our minds but they are always there.  They are hardwired into our brains.  That is one of the reasons shock waves spread right across the country.  What happened to young, talented, beautiful Ashling Murphy can happen to any woman and we know it.  For the women terrorised in their own homes, the teenage girls who have stopped cycling to school because of the demeaning comments of passers-by, including teenage boys and adult males, and for all women, we in this House must ensure we have resourced strategies, implemented policies and appropriate legislation so women feel, and are, safe in Ireland.</p></speech>

Much has been said tonight so I will try to be concise in my response.  I thank many of my colleagues for sharing their experiences.  We are not talking about something that is happening to other people.  This is something we all go through and it is important to allow people to share their experience, so I thank colleagues for that.  I also thank them for their views on what we can collectively do next to try to deal with this issue and awful events like the murder of Ashling and other women, and the abuse of so many others.  We must ensure there is change and that we work together to bring about that change.  I have said many times that this is an issue we will look back on in years to come and ask ourselves how we let it go on and how we tolerated this type of violence and abuse for so long.  I really believe that.  As many have said this evening, no more.</p>  <p>  There are two things we have to look at in our approach.  Many colleagues have asked what we can do ourselves.  It is about each and every one of us taking collective responsibility and asking that question when we see misogyny or sexism, when there is a microaggression, as Deputy Bacik put it, and when we see abuse or even actual violence.  What do we do in that situation?  Do we turn the other way, excuse ourselves or call it out every time we see it?  I will certainly come away from today's debate asking myself how I, as an individual and a citizen, can play my part in making sure this ends, and I am sure everyone else will too.</p>  <p>  Second, as legislators we must ensure we come together as a Government and a D&aacute;il, working with our State agencies, Departments, the community and voluntary sector, victims and all our community to make sure the laws we have are robust.  As Deputy McGuinness pointed out, these laws must be strong and clear enough that they work as they are supposed to and we must also bring forward new laws and policies to deal with these issues.</p>  <p>  As Minister for Justice, I reaffirm my commitment to dealing with this in a number of ways.  Many have spoken about the fact that women do not come forward when they are attacked.  They do not think they will be listened to or supported and the criminal justice system does not welcome them.  The work I am doing on Supporting a Victim's Journey identifies 52 actions, some of which have already been implemented and others that are in train or towards which we are working, to ensure the criminal justice system is victim-focused.  That way, when those vulnerable persons come forward and take that difficult step, that support will be there.  Most important, from the very outset, members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the health service and others must be educated in working with, supporting and helping these people through their journey.</p>  <p>  It is also about making sure we are properly resourced.  We have a budget of &euro;2 billion for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na this year and will have additional recruits.  Some 120 garda&iacute; came out of Templemore this week and we are on track, thankfully, to have another 800 this year.  We need to make sure they have the resources to do their jobs and work within our communities.  We need them on the ground but they also need technology and strong laws to be able to carry out their work.</p>  <p>  As was mentioned, we must make sure our family justice system works.  Often, a criminal trial will happen at the same time as a civil trial around access to children and those involved do not discuss the cases or connect with each other.  We need to make sure that is addressed and the family structure in the courts is changed.  We are working on that with a new Bill but we also need to provide the ancillary supports that are so often needed to support vulnerable persons.  We need to ensure the resources and supports are there and make sure every person who needs access to a refuge can get it and that it is available to them.  I again commit, as will the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, to making sure every woman who needs a space will get one.  We are working on a new structure to deliver that as soon as possible and properly resource it.</p>  <p>  Bringing all of this together is our new national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  It is not the first strategy but builds on the previous two.  I acknowledged that a lot of work has been done in previous years by previous Ministers and D&aacute;ileanna, as well as community and voluntary sector organisations and individuals who have driven this.  We need to build on that work and make sure it is the best and most ambitious plan we have had to date.  That means making sure it has clear timelines and actions, that we know exactly who is to carry out those actions and that it is properly resourced.  I commit that when we publish this strategy, all those things will be set out very clearly.  There must also be clear oversight from the Department of the Taoiseach, the D&aacute;il, the Seanad, the Joint Committee on Justice and other committees, in order to make sure we carry out our role.</p>  <p>  As I have said, it is not just about the justice sector.  It is about so many other elements of our society.  It is about education in our schools, including primary school, secondary school, third level institutions and further education.</p>  <p>  This issue also applies to our homes.  I think of my almost nine-month-old son.  Like most people, I think about what he will look like when he gets older, what work he will do, whether he will have a girlfriend or boyfriend and whether he will get married or have children.  In the last week I have promised myself that, no matter what or who he is, he will respect women, call out these types of inequalities and stand up when he sees this type of behaviour in the future.  We all have to do that.</p>  <p>  We also need national campaigns in order that these conversations are constantly on the airwaves, in our newspapers, on social media channels and elsewhere.  It is about making sure that everything we do is backed up by evidence and real lived experiences.  We need to gather that information and make sure it improves our laws and policies, as well as the experience for victims and survivors.  Many Deputies mentioned the SAVI report and the upcoming sexual violence survey, SVS.  I reassure the House that there is no delay with that.  It is not that it is not being resourced or prioritised.  From the outset, it was made clear that it would take time, and five years was the timeframe given back in 2018 when it was started.  A lot of detailed and very sensitive information must be gathered.  There have been consultations and there must be multiple other consultations to look at how things change over time.  When I was in the Department of Health, the longitudinal ageing study carried out by Professor Rose Anne Kenny took ten years.  That is obviously a slightly different type of survey but this type of data gathering takes time.  I reassure people that the report is on time and will be delivered by next year, as we had set out.</p>  <p>  There is a lot of work to do, as we all appreciate.  However, it is very clear from all our contributions that we are all on the same page and want to achieve the same thing, that is, zero tolerance of any kind of violence or abuse against women.  I look forward to working with colleagues to make sure we can reach that end goal.  I again offer my deepest condolences not just to the Murphy family but to all families who are impacted by violence and those who are going through any type of abuse.  I acknowledge them.  We are thinking of them at all times with everything we do.</p></speech>

It is landmark legislation in recognising the right to identity and rectifying a longstanding historic injustice.  This Bill is fundamentally concerned with addressing the needs of adopted people and people who have questions about their origin of birth.</p><p>It will achieve this through the guaranteed provision of full and unredacted release of birth certificates, birth, care and early-life information; a statutory tracing service; a contact preference register and by safeguarding adoption-related records into the future.  In addition, this Bill goes further and provides for access of information for next of kin.  It aims to achieve all of this in a balanced, compassionate, supportive and constitutionally sound manner.</p><p>Having spoken to hundreds of affected individuals, it is their needs and concerns which lie at the heart of this legislation.  I have listened intently to stakeholders and sought to deliver clear and guaranteed rights of access to information.  I thank those stakeholders who have engaged with me directly.</p><p>I also thank the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, chaired by Deputy Funchion, and all its members, for the detailed prelegislative scrutiny report it produced.  A significant number of the committee's recommendations have been taken on board in this revised draft of the Bill.  Other recommendations within the report relate to the operation of the legislation and will be addressed by the implementation group led by my Department.</p><p>The Bill reflects significant improvements and enhancements to the general scheme published last May.  First, in terms of the necessary balancing of EU and constitutional rights, I acknowledge the strong views that exist on the information session through which this balancing is achieved.  Having heard these views expressed at prelegislative scrutiny, the information session has been modified and adapted.  It can now be held virtually and will no longer be provided by a social worker.</p><p>Where a parent has registered that he or she does not wish to be contacted, the adopted person will receive a phone call where the privacy wishes of the parent will be relayed to him or her.  Following this phone call, the full and complete set of records will be given to the adopted person.  Nothing will be held back.</p><p>We want to be able to provide as much information as possible to people without further delay.  Through the inclusion of a phone call in this process, we are rebalancing two sets of competing EU and constitutional rights in a way that does not limit the information that can be provided to somebody using the legislation, while still acknowledging the privacy rights of mothers.</p><p>It is now accepted that mothers often had little or no choice but to place their children for adoption in a culture of shame and stigma.  The secrecy has continued throughout some of those mothers' lives and they may be concerned about contact being made with them.  This is why the information session is an important measure within the Bill to recognise and respect the EU and constitutional privacy rights of these mothers.</p><p>Another key change that responds to stakeholder concerns and a prelegislative scrutiny, PLS, recommendation is the use of the term &quot;mother&quot; in the legislation, rather than &quot;birth mother&quot;.  The PLS recommendation is to use terms that are respectful and the change to the simple phrase &quot;mother&quot; is the more respectful term that can be used.</p><p>Access to medical information is a key interest for stakeholders and I note there are a number of recommendations on this in the PLS report, all of which I confirm we have either already accepted in the drafting of the Bill or will take on board in the guidelines that are being produced regarding the release of medical data.</p><p>An adopted person's own medical information, such as his or her vaccination records, will always be released to that person directly.  The Bill allows for full release of this information.  There are no restrictions.  It is only in situations where the medical data are those of a genetic relative and another person's medical data are being released to an adopted person, that the release may involve a GP.</p><p>A further change, which reflects stakeholder feedback and a PLS recommendation, is the new section that empowers the Minister to add institutions to the Schedule as set out in the Bill.  This new section will allow for the addition of any institution that was established or operated for the purpose of providing care to children in which children were placed and resident.  The new section will mitigate of anybody being excluded from this Bill.</p><p>Again, recognising the PLS recommendations, key definitions within the Bill have been enhanced, with a new definition of incorrect birth information added and open-ended definitions of care information and early-life information created.  In the case of the latter, the definition has been explicitly expanded to provide for the full release of the baptismal certificate and entry in the baptismal register.  The recommendations in the PLS report on access to counselling support have also been accepted and the Bill now provides, not only for counselling supports for parents with a no-contact preference, but also for all mothers and all relevant persons, if they wish to have such support.</p><p>I will now outline the key parts of the Bill, as initiated.  Part 1 contains the standard Short Title, commencement and interpretation provisions.  Section 2 provides definitions of key terms used in the Bill.  A central term is &quot;relevant person&quot; which comprises:</p> <blockquote> 	(a) an adopted person, <br /><br />(b) a person who is or has been, or who has reasonable grounds for suspecting that he or she is or has been, the subject of an incorrect birth registration, or <br /><br />(c) a person who has been, or who has reasonable grounds for suspecting that he or she has been, at any time in the period following his or her birth and ending on the date on which he or she attained the age of 18 years&mdash;   	(i) resident in an institution specified in the <i>Schedule</i>, or <br /><br />(ii) the subject of a nursed out arrangement or a boarded out arrangement;   </blockquote>  <p>Another central term is a &quot;relevant body&quot;.  This is a body to which an application for records may be made.  The Bill currently lists the Adoption Authority of Ireland and Tusla as relevant bodies.  The Minister can designate by regulation other persons or organisations as relevant bodies to which application for information may be made.</p><p>Section 5 provides that the Minister may, by order, add to the list of institutions set out in the Schedule to the Bill.  This ensures that anyone who was resident in an institution established or operated for the purpose of providing care to children and who is not already captured by one of the other categories I have just referenced in the definition of &quot;relevant person&quot;, can now be included within that definition and thereby avail of the provisions of this Bill.</p><p>Part 2 provides for the release of information, records and provided items to relevant persons on application.  A relevant person over the age of 16 can apply to the General Register Office or a relevant body for his or her birth certificate and it will be provided to that person.  A relevant person aged 18 and over can apply to a relevant body for his or her birth, early-life, care and medical information, as well as any provided items and it will be provided to that person.  A person's medical information will be released to him or her, without restriction.</p><p>A relevant person aged 16 or 17 years old can apply to the Adoption Authority of Ireland for his or her birth information, early-life, care and medical information held by the authority or the agency and this will be provided to him or her by means of a supportive meeting.  This meeting can be conducted by phone or face to face.  Where a 16 or 17 year old has applied to the General Register Office for a birth certificate, this will be provided to him or her during or after this supportive meeting also.</p><p>The purpose and function of the information session is dealt with by section 17.  This section provides for an information session to be held between the relevant person and a designated person, where there is an application for a birth certificate or birth information and a parent named within the birth information has registered a preference for no contact.  The information session can be held by phone or in person, depending on the preference of the applicant.</p><p>The content of the conversation will be on the entitlement of the relevant person to his or her birth certificate or birth information, the fact that the parent has stated that he or she does not want contact and the importance of respecting the preference of the parent.  I mentioned earlier the changes made to this, but also the essential role that this process plays in adequately balancing constitutional and EU rights.</p><p>Part 3 of the Bill provides for an application by a person for their parent's information and records where that parent was a relevant person and is now deceased.  Such persons can apply for their parent's birth certificate and birth, care and early-life information and that will be released to them in cases where the parent - the original relevant person - and grandparents are deceased.  They can also apply for their parent's and other genetic relatives' medical information and that will be released to them where it is of relevance to their health.</p> <p>This new provision responds to stakeholder feedback and the pre-legislative scrutiny process.</p> <p> Part 4 deals with applications by the next of kin of a relevant person who died as a child in one of these institutions.  Next of kin is defined, in order of hierarchy, as a mother or father, brother or sister, uncle or aunt or nephew or niece.  In terms of the release of birth information, this will be released to persons in order of hierarchy, in accordance with the highest order living relative.  There is also provision for the Minister to make guidelines to provide guidance on how a relevant body will satisfy itself that a person is deceased.</p> <p> Part 4 is also a major new addition to the Bill since the publication of the original general scheme last May and should support those with questions in relation to a relative who passed away while in a mother and baby or county institution.  It responds to concerns raised by stakeholders at the pre-legislative scrutiny and points made in the pre-legislative scrutiny report.</p> <p> Part 5 provides for a tracing service to be delivered by Tusla and the Adoption Authority of Ireland.  Traces will be carried out to locate individuals for the purposes of contact or sharing of information.  The tracing service is available to persons aged 18 or over.  An application for a tracing service can be made by a relevant person and certain relatives.  An adoptive parent of an adopted child can also seek a trace where the adoptive parent is seeking further information in relation to that person.  Section 34(6) lists bodies from which Tusla and the Adoption Authority can request information in order to trace a person and which must provide the requested information.  This list includes Departments.  These statutory provisions will be a game changer in enabling Tusla and the Adoption Authority of Ireland to deliver an effective and efficient tracing service.</p> <p> Part 6 provides for a statutory register called the contact preference register.  This register, which is to be established and maintained by the Adoption Authority, allows persons to register their contact and information sharing preferences.  Relevant persons and their relatives can also apply to the register to lodge information and provided items which they wish to be shared with a specified individual.  The information will be lodged in a secure manner.  This Part provides for the full transfer of all information and preferences from the existing non-statutory register to the new register to be established under this Part.</p> <p> Part 7 provides that prescribed bodies - termed "information sources" - must safeguard any relevant records they hold.  An information source, other than Tusla, can be asked by the Adoption Authority to furnish a statement to the authority which will state the nature, current location and condition of the relevant records held.  It can also be required to transfer these records to the Adoption Authority.  In this way, the Bill ensures the authority can develop a comprehensive picture of the relevant records held by different bodies and can take ownership of these records, where appropriate.</p> <p> Part 8 is to deal with the issue of illegal birth registrations.  It amends the Civil Registration Act 2004 to provide for the General Registrar to receive or request certain information concerning people with an illegal birth registration; to correct an affected person's birth registration; and to also create a separate registration in a new register that reflects the affected person's social identity, where that is the person's wish.  By social identity, I mean the name of the relevant person and his or her social parents as recorded on his or her incorrect birth registration.</p> <p> This Part provides that the General Registrar will notify affected people before any correction, cancellation or registration is made to the birth registration.  The person who is notified may then make a submission to the General Registrar in relation to the proposed correction.  The person will also be able to obtain a copy of the entries in the register of births and the new register created by this Part.</p> <p> Part 9 deals with other matters, including the requirement that the authority shall undertake a public information campaign; offences for the concealment or destruction of records; provisions clearly setting out the GDPR rights affected; and the provisions on counselling for all, should they wish to take it up.  This Part also provides for the Minister to designate, by regulation, the persons or organisations which qualify as relevant bodies to which an application for information may be made.</p> <p> There have been numerous attempts to legislate in this area.  It is essential that, as legislators, we reflect on these previous attempts to help us understand the challenges that the balancing of rights has presented for previous Oireachtais.  As far back as 1984, the then Minister for Health and Social Welfare, Mr. Barry Desmond, established a review committee on adoption services.  One of its main recommendations, never implemented, was for a right of access for adopted persons to their birth certificate on condition that they receive counselling before the certificate was released.</p> <p> In 2001, the then Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Ms Mary Hanafin, sought to publish heads of Bill on release of adoption information.  Those heads provided for access to a birth certificate subject to counselling and the applicant signing an undertaking agreeing that he or she would not seek contact.  The undertaking had criminal penalties attached if it was breached.  That draft legislation never reached publication stage.</p> <p> The late Brian Lenihan, as Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, also made an attempt to legislate, unfortunately, to no effect.  There was no movement and no change.  In 2014, a Private Members' Bill was initiated by then Senators Averil Power, Jillian van Turnhout and Fidelma Healy Eames.  That Bill allowed for the release of birth certificates with a mandatory information session to be held with a social worker before release, in all cases.  The Bill fell with the dissolution of the Government of the day.</p> <p> The adoption (information and tracing) heads of Bill were developed and brought to the Government in 2015 by the then Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Mr. James Reilly.  His successor as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Ms Katherine Zappone, continued this work and published the Bill in 2016.  The balancing provisions in that Bill were known as "compelling reasons and the undertaking".  The compelling reasons test was to be applied in circumstances where a parent objected to the release of information and it involved an application to the Circuit Court to determine if a threat to life was present and, therefore, justified the refusal of information.  These provisions were rejected and an alternative approach was developed and proposed by the then Minister, Ms Zappone, in May 2019.  This provided for situations where a parent objected to the parent's information being released, and both the parent and the adopted person were given an opportunity to state their case to the Adoption Authority, which would adjudicate.  This Bill reached Committee Stage in the Seanad in June 2019 and lapsed with the dissolution of the Seanad in February 2020.</p> <p> Here we are, in January 2022, almost 70 years since the Adoption Act was passed in 1953, without the right for an adopted person to access his or her identity information.  This Bill represents an opportunity for the Thirty-third D&aacute;il to finally end a historic injustice and enshrine in law the importance of knowing one's identity.  We must learn from history and we must not fail in our duty to those who were adopted, boarded out or the subject of illegal birth registrations.</p> <p> This legislation is a quantum leap ahead when compared with the previous drafts I described.  It does not criminalise or discriminate against adopted people.  It does not provide for complex procedures before the courts.  Most important, it guarantees access to all information in every circumstance.  That has never been achieved previously.  The Bill is expansive and flexible.  It includes provisions for applications to the General Register Office, full release of birth and baptismal certificates, counselling for all parties, new next of kin provisions, a review mechanism and enabling provisions to allow bodies and records to be brought under the legislation as and when required.</p> <p> As I said, I believe the Birth Information and Tracing Bill is landmark legislation.  It represents a change in our country's laws that is long overdue and is part of our atoning for historical wrongs done to individuals and women in this country.  Primary to this Bill's purpose is to enshrine in law the right to identity, a right that has been denied to adopted people for decades.  It will restore to adopted people information that so many of us take for granted about our personal stories.</p> <p> It is critical to the success of this legislation that this right to identity is realised in practice.  This means a commitment to transparency and openness, where relevant bodies operate on the assumption of full release of information rather than on the basis of withholding information, and where people can gain full and complete access to their birth and early life information, as defined in law, in all circumstances, with no redactions, refusals or exceptions.  That is what this Bill delivers, and I commend it to the House.</p></speech>

When we look at some of the ridiculous suggestions proposed in some of the Bills in recent years, I accept that today we have moved on.  In fairness to the Minister, he has delivered this legislation, unlike others before him who talked a lot of talk.  I would love to be able to welcome the Bill without any reservations but, unfortunately, I have serious reservations.  While discussion of the Bill should be considered landmark occasions when we finally move forward, there is potential for serious mistakes to be made in particular with the mandatory information session.  I do not believe it has been removed.  I accept that the requirement for it to be in person with a social worker has changed, but there is still an information session and it still explicitly states in the legislation that part of the reason for this is to explain to the relevant person the importance of the privacy rights of the parent.  That was something that came up in every single one of the PLS sessions.  I acknowledge the presence of Deputies Bacik and Murnane O'Connor from the committee.  The committee worked so well together.  We all know in this House that at times things can get fraught on committees, but there was genuine goodwill on everybody's part &ndash; Government and Opposition representatives.  We had 83 recommendations.  The Minister referred in his speech to changes on a number of issues that came up during PLS.  However, on the really big issues, such as the mandatory information session, we made a suggestion in the report about looking at alternatives, one potentially being the registered post option.  I do not understand why that could not be considered.  Sinn F&eacute;in will table amendments to that effect on Committee Stage.</p>  <p>  Medical history is a grey area.  I acknowledge what the Minister says.  I am pleased to get clarity on an adopted person.  However, my fear is that in the case of a person who does not know much about his or her life other than that he or she was adopted, people will say they are looking for their medical history and that is a grey area whether a medical practitioner is involved or not.  In the case of a family medical history, there is a chance that there will be a genetic relative, as the Minister described in his speech, so does that mean then they are in a different process?  In terms of the wording "relevant data", is not all the data relevant to them if it is about them and their personal life?  I am not adopted and I can get all of that information.  Why do we have a different set of rules for people who are adopted and, in the same breath, say we are trying to end the discrimination they faced for years?  I am not saying it to be critical for the sake of it.  As Chair of the committee, I would love nothing more than for the Bill to go through Committee Stage without any amendments because we have done a significant amount of work in the committee on the Bill and other areas relating to mother and baby homes.  That is the reason I feel I must raise these issues, and on behalf of people who have contacted us.</p>  <p>  It was a missed opportunity not to develop a new agency.  We acknowledged that it could not happen overnight and that a new agency would require time to develop at a time when we do not want to delay matters given that many of those who are affected do not have time.  We recommended an Ombudsman-type body for appeals and oversight of Tusla and the Adoption Authority of Ireland in the meantime.  I do not believe the recommendation has been taken on board.  Given that redress will be the next matter we will be talking about in this Chamber in a few months, a new agency would have been appropriate.  It could have been a time-limited one, as it potentially does not need to be in existence forever.</p>  <p>  I seek clarity on Part 4.  I am not sure I understand it correctly.  There is a hierarchy in terms of next of kin, starting with a mother or father.  The Minister can come back to me on this if he wishes.  I refer to a case where somebody has died in care.  In the event that perhaps the parent does not want to get the information, but a sibling does, is he or she entitled to get it or must the parents have passed away?  That is an issue on which I genuinely seek clarity.</p>  <p>  The Minister indicated that he will take recommendations on board in the guidelines that are being produced regarding the release of medical data.  I do not understand why that could not have been included in the legislation.  I do not want to be cynical, but it is easy for the Minister to say he will take them on board in the guidelines when it is not in the legislation.  Significant work was done by every single person on the committee and I feel strongly that there are many missed opportunities, in particular in terms of the mandatory information session and the new agency.</p>  <p>  I would welcome more clarity and perhaps a briefing from departmental officials on medical information in particular.  I hope it is the case that my understanding is incorrect, because that would be welcome, but I fear there will be grey areas as to whether people are entitled to data and if it is relevant to them.  People who do not know much about their own lives will not know exactly what information they are looking for and I am concerned that it might be considered too general.  I will leave it at that for now.</p></speech>

I accept his bona fides on that.  Compared to what we have had in previous attempts at dealing with this issue, this is a genuine effort and I acknowledge that the Bill is a huge leap forward.  However, we must also listen to the reality of the people who are most impacted by the Bill, adopted people who have sought progress on this issue for decades.  The age-old problem that seems to come up relates to the privacy of the mother who put the child up for adoption, often under duress, usually in very difficult circumstances and sometimes under pressure &ndash; peer pressure or pressure from families and others around them.  Further back, there was severe pressure in a climate where they simply could not keep the child they wanted and loved.  I have come across mothers in those circumstances.  I am sure the Minister has as well.  When they signed the piece of paper they were told to sign, they did it under pressure and duress.  They did not know what they were signing.  Usually, the document also included a reference to privacy.  They accepted they were putting up their child for adoption, but not in their wildest dreams did they consider that they were signing away forever their right to see that child again.  That must also be brought to bear in this situation.  What we are dealing with here is the present day impact of terrible historical situations people had to deal with.  There must be a recognition of that.</p>  <p>  The Minister says that the Bill allows in all circumstances for the adopted person to have access to all of his or her records without any restrictions, and then in certain sections he puts in place restrictions.  That is the issue that must be addressed.  The Minister shakes his head as if that is not the case.  If it is not the case, then he has done a poor job of making it clear.  I invite him to try to resolve that, if not here this evening then certainly on Committee Stage as the Bill passes through the Houses.  I am sure there will be amendments on the various issues Members have clearly set out that need to be dealt with urgently.</p>  <p>  A number of issues have been raised, including access to information.  The mandatory information session is something all adopted persons have a clear problem with and that must be addressed.  If a new body was set up it would have full responsibility for everything concerned.  It would be a big advance, which people expected to see in the legislation, but it was not included.  I fully accept that the Bill is a significant advance on where we have come from in the past, but it does not go far enough for many of the people who have been negatively affected for generations by this issue.</p> <p>I invite the Minister to try to ensure that the shortcomings of this legislation are dealt with and that where Members genuinely put forward amendments which would improve it, he would accept them.</p></speech>

The biggest criticism I have is that it does not take on board any of the recommendations contained in the report of the Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  There were 83 recommendations and not one is taken on board, which, frankly, is a disgrace.</p>  <p>  Alternative proposals to legislate in this area must not leave even one adopted person behind.  For decades in this country, adopted people have been failed by being denied clear access to their identity information, and this is a human rights issue.  The Bill does not provide unrestricted access to birth certificates, adoption files or early-life information files.  There must be unfettered access.  Terms and conditions cannot apply in this instance.  It must be the file, the whole file and nothing but the file.  There must be no discrimination when accessing personal data.</p>  <p>  The information session requirement is offensive to adopted people.  The concept of privacy should not have to be explained to applicants in any proposed format.  The definition of "personal data" is not clear, leaving the door open to various interpretations.  Information can be withheld in certain circumstances, which is not fair or acceptable.  The definitions in the Bill are extremely narrow and need to be expanded to include individuals, agencies and institutions involved in forced family separation.  Accessing records will be hugely problematic if this Bill is passed in its current form.  Rather than whole files being provided, parts of files that will be issued.  The expectation that applicants need to have knowledge of mementos contained in early life or adoptive files is ridiculous.  Applicants are expected to apply for several different categories of information, which makes things difficult for them.  Although I mean this respectfully, it is almost like the Government is trying to dissuade them.</p>  <p>  It is vital that we listen to those who will most directly be affected by this legislation.  The wishes of survivors and adopted persons must be heard.  I look forward to continuing to work with campaigners and others over the coming weeks to ensure that the right to identity will be recognised at last in our laws.  It is a little more than 20 years since the first legislation was introduced to allow access to adoption information.  It is worth remembering that the Government started this journey by trying to criminalise adoptees for seeking their birth information.  It is time the historic wrongs were put right.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-01-19a.259" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1613" speakername="Martin Browne" time="19:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022011900041#OO00300"><p>My heart sank when I saw how many of the most important recommendations of the Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth were not taken into account when revising this Bill.  An opportunity was there to address the injustices of the past that have been ignored or suppressed over the decades.  We have seen this with the attitude that was shown to the survivors of the mother and baby homes like Sean Ross Abbey over the years but, despite the horrors they experienced through no fault of their own, they have been persistently failed through half-hearted and incomplete measures.</p>  <p>  While this Bill has key associations with that shameful part of our history, what we are talking about today is an issue that affects all people adopted in this country and their right to access their own personal information in the same way as everybody else.  Years of extremely flawed schemes and Bills that put limitations on the ability of adopted people to access crucial information about themselves led to one thing, namely, discrimination.  Adopted people were discriminated against through the application of different requirements to them versus everyone else.  Then, this Bill was put forward but different standards and requirements still applied.  The Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth made 83 key recommendations on these outstanding issues but the Bill does not reflect that.  It still does not provide unrestricted access to birth certificates, adoption files or early-life information files, regardless of how the Minister may present it.  I understand that balancing the identity rights of applicants and the privacy rights of birth or natural parents is difficult, but this was discussed by the committee and witnesses at great length and it was still the overall view that more could be done to ensure unfettered access to birth records, adoptive files or any records relating to them.  This Bill does not go anywhere near the spirit of the committee's recommendations.</p>  <p>  The requirement for mandatory information sessions remains, just in a slightly different form.  All Oireachtas Members who are not adopted need to ask themselves whether they have to do it.  When it comes to the demands being made of adopted people in this Bill, the answer will be &ldquo;No&rdquo;, which confirms that this Bill imposes different requirements on people based on whether or not they are adopted.  That is unacceptable.  The fact that only parts of files will be made available rather than whole files is another case in point.  Family medical information will not be released to an adopted person&rsquo;s family without the intervention of a GP.  These are just some of the issues that remain unaddressed despite the recommendations of the committee, which spent hours and hours hearing from those whom this Bill concerns.  Let us not forget the supreme efforts that were made by adoptees, mothers, survivors and their families and advocates through their selflessness.</p>  <p>  We will be seeking to make a number of amendments to address these shortcomings.  I strongly urge the Aire not to repeat the mistakes that were made previously and to do the right thing by all adoptees.  I call on him to disregard what the Taoiseach said publicly recently and to revisit the redress scheme for survivors of mother and baby homes.</p></speech>

They speak of a journey that they have been on for so long in seeking their own information, yet, consistently and constantly, they have been let down and left feeling they have failed.  It beggars belief that we are back here again today and that these same people are expressing those same emotions of feeling failed once again.</p>  <p>  Nobody in government - in fact, very few people across the country - is unaware of what the people affected wanted to see.  They told us, they told us again and then they told us again.  Even when they felt ignored and they felt that their words were not only falling on deaf ears, but falling on deaf ears that were attached to a very unsympathetic representative arm of the State, they continued to tell us.  Many of the people who are campaigning for access to information have had to tell their personal stories, some of them very painful stories, repeatedly - far too many times - including the requirement of that information session.  Whether that is in person or on the phone, it is neither necessary nor justified, in my opinion.  Adoptees, mothers, survivors and advocates have already given hours and hours of testimony.  Another information session, regardless of the situation in which it is done, appears very strongly to be an enforcement of power were no such enforcement is necessary.  I do not believe that this approach is truly survivor-centred, nor is it a person-centred approach.</p>  <p>  There remain substantial amounts of work to be done.  As previous speakers stated , we will be putting forward amendments.  As one survivor put it to me earlier this afternoon, in many ways, this is two steps forward and one step back, but her lifespan is not going to make up that difference before she finally gets to the finish line.  It does not go far enough and it does not meet the repeated asks of people for whom time is simply not on their side.</p></speech>

I welcome the fact we are debating the Bill.  I acknowledge that we had all hoped that today would be a landmark day for the rights of adopted persons to access information, to access birth information and to access their identity rights.  I absolutely appreciate the Minister&rsquo;s commitment to ensuring that and the fact significant progress is being made in the Bill.</p>  <p>  I share Deputy Kathleen Funchion&rsquo;s reservations about aspects of the Bill, however.  In particular, I share her disappointment that some critical recommendations of our committee in its pre-legislative scrutiny report have not been included in the Bill.  I pay tribute to Deputy Funchion, who steered and chaired our lengthy deliberations at pre-legislative scrutiny stage.  As she stated, the 83 recommendations we came up with were based on the extensive hearings conducted.  I joined the committee having been conscious that there had already been quite extensive consultation, but I participated following my election in July in more extensive hearings.  We heard from many stakeholders.</p> <p>We engaged closely in respect of the draft heads and we believed our recommendations to be robust.  I appreciate that the Minister has accepted some of the recommendations, but I want to address three critical ways in which they were not addressed in this Bill.  It is in the context of those recommendations in particular that many of us on the committee will be disappointed.  Many of those who received our recommendations, including stakeholders who appreciated the recommendations, share that disappointment.</p> <p> First is the critical issue of access to information.  Will this access be unrestricted as was promised and as people had hoped or will it be conditional?  On this side of the House, we are all disappointed that the access remains conditional.  It is a great step forward from what was previously provided for in other iterations of this legislation but there is still the condition of a mandatory information session.  Why can we not get beyond this?  It was helpful of the Minister to set out the long history over many decades of this State grappling with how to provide for information rights for adopted persons.  The one thing he did not say was that in the recent past there were attempts by the Opposition, including my party, to bring forward legislation earlier.  In 2020, we brought forward the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill, which would have inserted a new section 86 into the Adoption Act 2010.  That would have been a simple mechanism to unlock the information necessary to enable adopted persons to access their birth certificates upon turning 18 by making traceable the connection between an entry in the adopted children register and the corresponding entry in the register of births.  Other Opposition parties produced similar legislation that provided for simple unlocking mechanisms without cumbersome restrictions being placed on access.</p> <p> It is clear, not just from the history the Minister outlined but also from the Opposition attempts to legislate on this matter, that there is a clear cross-party intent in the Oireachtas to ensure an unfettered right of identity and information is provided to adopted persons.  I pay tribute to the many individuals and advocacy groups, such as the Adoption Rights Alliance and the Clann Project, which also sought to do this, helped us with this and gave evidence before the committee.  We also looked at legislation in neighbouring jurisdictions and we looked at other European countries.  We are conscious that anyone in Northern Ireland aged 18 or over has had the right to a copy of his or her original birth certificate since 1987.  In other jurisdictions, that right extends back much farther.  In the provisions we have been presented with in this new Bill, however, we are still seeing the retention of a conditional right of access.</p> <p> I worked closely with the Minister&rsquo;s predecessor, Katherine Zappone, on trying to ensure that there would be a right of access to information.  We constantly heard, both in briefings with Ms Zappone and on the floor of this House and the Seanad, that this right had to be balanced with the right to privacy of mothers.  We were also told that the right to information could not be provided for in an unconditional way.  We examined this closely in the committee.  I looked at what we said at the committee again today.  We made the point that on the basis of the evidence we had heard and on the expertise of those who appeared before us, the constitutional balancing could be addressed in other ways and it would not be necessary to provide a mandatory information session.  We said clearly that the inclusion of a mandatory information session for persons who had registered a preference for no contact would still mean that adopted people whose parents had registered this preference would be: &ldquo;singled out for different treatment and a targeted warning about privacy rights.&rdquo;  This was seen by some witnesses as compounding misguided fears about adopted people and perpetuating injustice.  We proposed an alternative.  We said that an appropriate and clear alternative would be to send the correspondence and information about the no contact preference by registered post.  This was a way of ensuring a balance in the rights, along with the other measures.  As the Minister stated, there were other measures in the Bill to safeguard the privacy rights of mothers, namely, the age limit of 16 or over, the counselling provision and the measure to provide information in some way.</p> <p> The big question for any of us who have engaged with the process of pre-legislative scrutiny is why we are seeing the retention of this mandatory information session.  Looking at the wording of the sections in the Bill and one can see that it is a mandatory information session; there is no other way to describe it.  Looking at section 7, which states that in the case of a no contact registration the recipient body shall comply: &ldquo;only where it has received a notification ... of the completion of an information session&rdquo;.  What is that information session to comprise?  Section 17 clearly sets out what the information session will be and it is still referred to as an &ldquo;information session&rdquo;.  It is referred to as a section which is, &ldquo;a session held between the relevant person and a designated person, [and we know that is an employee of Tusla or the adoption authority] at which the designated person informs the relevant person of&rdquo; his or her entitlement to get the birth certificate or information.  The section mentions the fact that the parent has stated that he or she is not willing to be contacted and crucially, the importance of the relevant person respecting the privacy rights and preference of the parent.  Why does that have to be imparted during an information session?  Why can that information not be imparted through an easier mechanism such as the sending of registered post?  That could include the back-up measure of counselling or supportive meetings where desired by the adopted person.  Why could we not have seen an alternative mechanism put in place rather than this targeted warning session?  We all accept that it no longer needs to be held in person and that it can be done by way of phone call or virtual call and that is a welcome change.</p> <p> From the perspective of the people who are contacting us, including adopted persons, mothers and other stakeholders, it is still seen as a paternalistic approach and as representing a condition upon access that is not desired or welcomed by adopted persons.  We have seen some disheartened and disappointed language from those who have contacted us, some saying they feel it is offensive that our laws will still require the information session.  They feel it is unnecessary to explain to them in this verbal fashion that they must respect the will of the woman who gave birth to them when this much is already patently clear.  We are hearing real disappointment, disheartenment and frustration at what appears to be a grudging step forward rather than the big step we all hoped we would see in this legislation.</p> <p> I ask the Minister to look again at our report, particularly pages 23 and 24, where we clearly set out our rationale for moving away from a mandatory information session.  I know I have spent some time on this, but perhaps the most disappointing aspect of the Bill is to see that measure retained and to see the language that is still being used in section 17.  Again, I speak with a heavy heart.  I thought we had moved beyond this and that the arguments we had heard over the years about the balancing of rights should be taken in a different context in 2022.  We should be able to build on the experiences we have had and the different iterations, which the Minister has clearly outlined, that we have seen over the years in attempts to legislate on this.  We should no longer need to see this sort of mandatory condition.  What happens if an adopted person refuses to take the call?  That person will then not have access to the information.  This Bill does not provide, as we had all hoped and expected it would, for a release of information in all cases and that is the disappointment that is felt.</p> <p> I know others will be bringing amendments and Labour will be bringing amendments on this.  We will be looking to implement the recommendations of the cross-party committee, which was specifically charged with undertaking this pre-legislative scrutiny.  This is the important point and there will be a great deal of debate on Committee Stage on the provisions around this information session, particularly on section 17 and the related sections 7 to 10, inclusive.</p> <p> I also want to address the issue of illegal adoptions and incorrect birth registration information.  Again, the committee addressed this in recommendations 10 and 11 of our report, where we specifically looked at the definition.</p> <p>The committee recommended that a change be made.  In its view, having heard extensively from those affected, the definition of incorrect birth registration was somewhat sanitised and should be amended to read "falsely or incorrectly recorded" instead.  The concern was that this seemed to reflect a recording of incorrect information that was carried out in error whereas we know from extensive testimony over the years that there were false registrations of births and that this was done deliberately and not just in error.  The committee members believed, having heard from many of those affected, that this should be recognised in the legislation or in the explanatory memorandum.  The committee suggested that the text in the explanatory memorandum should refer to "illegal or unlawful adoption" to clarify that the procedures for rectifying the register, which are very welcome, would apply both to those whose particulars were deliberately falsified and those whose particulars were merely incorrectly recorded.  The Minister will probably move to reassure the House that the procedures for remedying the register will apply to false records as well as those simply incorrectly recorded in error.  I anticipate that and see the Minister nodding but I reiterate the need to reflect the lived experiences of those who were illegally adopted.</p> <p> I welcome sections 52 and 53 in particular, which address the issue of illegal adoption.  We are all conscious of the serious difficulties that so many adoptees have had due to false registration.  I want to pay tribute to former Deputy Joan Burton, who spoke so eloquently on "Sunday with Miriam" last weekend about her own experience as an adopted person.  She has been such a champion of adopted persons and their right to information and she really took forward the case of those who had been illegally adopted.  In 2019, she and I published legislation seeking to deal with this after the revelations of over 100 illegal registrations of births and adoptions at St. Patrick's Guild.  I also want to pay tribute to those who took the time to give their own public testimony of their experiences in the documentary aired by RT&Eacute; in March 2021, "Who Am I? - The story of Ireland's illegal adoptions", which was so powerful.  The contributors to that programme spoke about their experience of discovering, in many cases many decades later, that they had been illegally adopted and the trauma and anguish that caused them.  One contributor very strikingly said that they felt their life was built on a lie they had been told.  It is really welcome to see this legislation addressing their situation but when one hears that powerful testimony, it makes it all the more important that the reality of their situation is recognised.  These were deliberately falsified records in some cases and not just clerical errors but the language in the Bill does not adequately reflect that.  That is what the committee found also.</p> <p> Finally, in terms of the committee recommendations, I want to address a crucial recommendation which comes up a number of times in the report, namely, recommendation No. 73.  This reflects an issue we had with the Bill more generally and which comes up in relation to a number of different issues in the Bill, that is, the lack of an oversight or an appeals mechanism.  In recommendation No. 73, the committee called for the establishment in the Bill of an oversight process or accessible appeals mechanism.  Specifically, the committee argued that the Bill should provide "for recourse to an Ombudsperson or other process to ensure oversight of the application process, support for adopted persons and others in using the Bill's provisions, and an accessible and effective appeal mechanism".  On page 51 of the report, the committee outlined its rationale for this but it comes up in a number of instances in the pre-legislative scrutiny.  Regarding head 13 of the Bill, for example, the committee said that this enabled Tusla or the Adoption Authority to make a request to a third party for information needed to assist in the process of tracing but this is lacking an enforcement mechanism or some oversight.  I will have to check to see if that has been addressed in the Bill but more generally, what appears to be lacking in the Bill is a more general oversight mechanism or appeals process.  Again, I am coming back to the mandatory information session, which is so contentious.  What happens, I ask again, if the adopted person says "I do not want to partake of a phone call" or "I do not want take this call"?  Is there any appeal mechanism?  What is the next step in the process then?  Is there a next step or are we simply assuming there will not be a need for one?  The committee had a concern about the fact that the Bill is lacking a clear outline for adopted persons and others of where they go next if the primary processes set out in the Bill have failed them in some way.</p> <p> I hope the Minister will take this commentary as a constructive criticism.  What I wanted to do was outline three areas where the committee has made some very robust and clear recommendations that would have greatly improved the Bill.  It is unfortunate to see they are lacking.  As I said, there is much to welcome in the Bill.  All of us will acknowledge that we are very pleased to see it coming before the House at this stage, so quickly in this Government's term, albeit so long overdue given the long processes that have gone before.  We are all conscious of the history of the stigma which prevailed for so long that allowed for the incarceration of women and children and which has defined, for far too long, our national approach to adoption.  The primary legislation, the Adoption Act 1952, enshrined a secret and closed adoption system and as a result, we have developed a secretive system.  In the words of a former chairperson of the Adoption Board, Ms Vivienne Darling, this ensured that "adoptees were kept in the dark as to their origins" for far too long.  I want to acknowledge the Minister's own commitment to ensuring that adoptees are finally brought into the light in being enabled to access birth information but he will also appreciate the frustration many of us feel when we still see some form of condition being placed on access to that information.  </p> <p> I have spoken before about my experience of representing many survivors of abuse in industrial schools and other institutions over the years and of hearing from them the really harrowing experience not only of being incarcerated and abused in many cases but also of being failed by a State that simply did not provide any safeguards for children in their situation.  There is still a feeling among many of those who went through experiences like that as children, who were adopted, that they have been failed by the State.  We need to make sure that we are stepping up and are seen to be really addressing the needs of adopted persons in particular, but also of mothers who were also failed by the State, particularly those who were incarcerated in mother and baby homes.  </p> <p> The Labour Party has called for a full public inquiry into adoption practices in the State, to investigate the scale of illegal adoption because we are still not clear about the scale of it.  We need to give more scrutiny to that practice, which has been left in the dark for so long.  We must also reflect on the ways in which we are still failing women and children in particular.  Earlier tonight we debated violence against women and discussed the failure to provide adequate shelter for domestic violence survivors, for example.  These are all issues which are very much intertwined.</p> <p> It is great to see legislation that will go some way towards meeting the real needs of adopted persons, their real need for information as to their identity and their need to access their birth certificates.  Let us work together constructively on Committee and Report Stages to ensure that the Bill can be amended and can really provide for that full information right, that full right of access to identity that all of us want to see finally enshrined in our law.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-01-19a.264" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1511" speakername="Jennifer Murnane O'Connor" time="19:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022011900043#QQ00200"><p>As we all know, for decades there have been blockages to accessing birth information but those blockages will be removed by this legislation.  We need to clarify matters here tonight because there is a lot of misinformation coming from the Opposition.  We need to sort this because it is not proper for wrong information to go out from this House, as happened with regard to the mother and baby homes issue, when some Deputies claimed that the files were sealed away.  They were not sealed away but that information went out.  It is wrong to give wrong information and in that context, I need some clarity tonight.  I have also heard some things tonight that are worrying me and that are not true.  It is important that we get this right.</p>  <p>  The urgent need for this legislation has been recognised by all political parties, stakeholders and professionals working in this area.  I congratulate the Minister and his team for their work on this.  I know it was a priority for the Minister but it was also a priority for me.  This is good legislation.  We cannot risk this Bill being unconstitutional and we had to bear that in mind with the steps taken here.  Deputy Bacik raised a number of issues but she is very much aware of the question of constitutionality and the fact that we must bear that in mind when taking any legislative steps.  </p> <p>I worked very closely with the Minister and my colleagues on the Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth on this legislation.  I can stand over it.  We have an excellent joint committee.  It is hardworking and dedicated and works to the bone.  We were delighted to do the work.  It was hard because we listened to stories that had us sad and upset going home but we did it.  I think it was a Sinn F&eacute;in Deputy who said that none of the committee's 83 recommendations was put in the Bill.  That is not true.  You cannot put out that wrong information.  Is that what the Opposition is doing?  Do they want to work together but then go out and give everyone the wrong information?  That cannot happen.</p> <p> This comprehensive and inclusive Bill provides for the full release on application of birth certificates, birth and early life care and medical information for adopted persons, people who were boarded out, nursed out, subject to an illegal birth registration or who resided in a mother and baby home, county home or institution as a child.  I want people to have access to their information.  I encourage everyone here to support this Bill and get it passed as quickly as possible.  Access is here.  Let us get it to those who seek it.  Something else that arose at the committee is how quick we can get access to the adoptees who need it.  We have had no access for adopted people and now this legislation gives that.  There may be more steps to be taken.  Some of them might come into operation when the Bill passes.  However, overall we should accept that this is good legislation.  Amendments recommended at Committee Stage are ones I will support.  I urge everyone to support them too when the time comes, particularly those relating to illegal birth registrations.  This is something I have addressed with the Minister and I am heartened to see he has taken this on board.</p> <p> Time is against us.  We must do all we can to progress the Bill.  The speed is what has been necessary.  However, I ask the Minister to apply the same speed to redress for survivors as part of our action plan.  I am very mindful of the survivors who come to me and have worked with the Minister on that, as I have worked on the committee.</p> <p>  Criticisms of the Bill have to be dealt with constitutionally.  For instance, succession and the right the right to succeed to the estate to an illegal adopted parent is being addressed.  The issue for medical practitioners is also being dealt with.  If an adopted person seeks their mother's medical records to see if there was a medical issue, the information is only given to a nominated GP to protect the privacy of the mother.  That is an important issue that was also raised at the committee.  It is important that the information be given but that privacy rights are respected.  This change strikes the balance.</p> <p> Matters of GDPR often arise around this information and featured at the committee.  It is important that we note that there are different guarantees under this legislation that are not under GDPR.  While subject access requests under GDPR do play an important role in accessing information they do not provide an effective or satisfactory legal framework for the release of identity information to those adopted.  Data protection law is currently tasked with providing for the release of this information.  However, it does not strike the complex balance between the right to identity and the rights to privacy.  Therefore bespoke legislation is required.</p> <p> I very much welcome that baptism certs are now included.  They can be a really valuable source of information.  That was not mentioned once in all the criticism tonight.  That is along with information on illegal registration.  That is also vital.  The definition of care and early life information is in the Bill.  More sources of information can be provided.  These are good changes.  Things that I asked for in prelegislative scrutiny were given.  This legislation will provide access to them.  That is what is important to me and so many in my constituency in Carlow and Kilkenny and those who contacted me from elsewhere.</p> <p> The new agency not being set up was raised tonight.  The use of Tusla and the Adoption Authority of Ireland, AAI, is for expediency.  Time, as I said, is against us here.  We have waited too long already.  Adopted people now have legal rights.  They need this urgency.  I spoke to the Minister about this.  I am not saying we should not look at an agency in the long term.  It was something that the committee examined.  However, we know that we need to put this information out now.  To set up an agency could take months and months.  I am asking that people agree to a framework that can work so that we can get the information out.  That is most urgent.</p> <p> I discussed medical cards with the Minister.  I ask that it be fast-tracked because these supports are important.</p> <p> The Bill includes improvements in information but I sought clarification from the Minister today on the necessary minimal mechanism to protect the EU and constitutional rights of parents.  This is where the Bill needs to be corrected.  Again, there has been some misinformation here.  You know what?  That is not right.  Where a parent has indicated a "no contact" preference, it will be conveyed to the person applying for their birth information in a short, sensitive and user-friendly phone call or virtual or face-to-face meeting with a social worker.  It is also possible to find out what other information they want.  This only applies to somebody whose form states a "no contact" preference.  Anyone applying for information where the mother has agreed, then it is accessible.  I spoke to a lady today from a mother and baby home.  She is a survivor.  I told her about the concerns being raised by the Opposition.  I asked her about getting a registered letter while she was on her own, whether she would be upset that her mother had a no contact preference, or if she would prefer a phone call from someone to say sorry, the mother had put down a "no contact" preference but that counselling and supports will be offered and that they will be there for her.  She said to me that if she was in the house on her own and got a registered letter and there was no one to talk to that can give information, that would not be right either.</p></speech>

There is a huge loss, a feeling of not being a whole person, that they constantly carry inside them.  We have all been very struck by the sense of belonging that a person gets when they access their own records.  The right to identity is a fundamental human right.  All you need to do is talk to adopted people to understand how deeply they care about this.  This right is recognised internationally.  Many countries have for centuries recognised an adopted person's right to access to their birth certificates and adoption records.  Successive Government Bills have tried and failed fundamentally to correct this.  I respect the Minister's attempt to rectify this, however, the argument about striking a balance is not the issue.  The issue is the right of any individual to access their full records as a principle of respect and the right to know who they are.  No one should hold the authority to block or deny this.  Disappointingly the Information and Tracing Bill falls short of this principle.  It is not easy to share your story.  It is not easy to retell the hurtful and sometimes harrowing and traumatic experiences yet that is what some many adoptee's mothers, survivors and their advocates have painfully done for years.  In order to provide the information and evidence needed for the Government to produce legislation that can right these past wrongs, the Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth of which my colleague and long-time activist on this issue, Deputy Funchion is Chair, made 83 recommendation on this legislation after several long and difficult hearings.  How many of these recommendations were taken on board?  Why were they not listened to?</p>  <p>  Take the red-line issue of the mandatory information session, effectively treating people differently, as if they were children.  We know that this issue alone has caused deep resentment and hurt among adoptees, parents and survivors.  These are very serious issues which are being raised about the Bill, and full compliance with GDPR and other legislation, leading to real human rights concerns over why adopted persons are treated differently in Ireland compared to most of our European counterparts when looking for access to their private records.</p>  <p>  I hope that the Minister and the Government will realise that this legislation does not strike a balance.  Serious amendments are needed on Committee Stage.  We need to listen to the people finally who have waited far too long to be respected and treated with dignity.</p> <p>We owe it to them, to their stories and their stolen years, to finally uphold their human rights.  These are their very fundamental rights to discover their own identity and restore their confidence in a system that has let them down so many times.</p></speech>

I refer to forced family separation along with practices of illegal adoption, the falsification of records and the imposition of secrecy on women and children.  The State, as well as religious organisations and others, denied individuals their identity.  It assaulted their sense of belonging and personhood from the day they were born.  Subsequently, it did everything possible to oppose their access to information, including approaches that dismissed rights, infantilised survivors and further traumatised them.  The parents, especially and most often the mothers, were equally impacted on by this regime.</p>  <p>  Disgracefully, this impulse from the State is still present to a certain extent.  This legislation contains elements of it.  A Bill has been deemed necessary despite the existing right to access one's personal information.  It should also be noted that while these issues relate to mother and baby homes, there are many people affected who did not go through that system.  Aitheantas, the adoptee identity rights advocacy group, has highlighted that many of the people they represent could not participate in the mother and baby homes commission, and were not included in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s apology last year.  That fact needs to be rectified as part of this process.  We need to officially and fully acknowledge the wrongs intentionally perpetrated against these adopted people and their families by the State.</p>  <p>  While any improvement on the State&rsquo;s refusal to provide people with their birth and early life information is welcome, this Bill, despite months of engagement and recommendations from advocacy groups, falls short of what is required and fails survivors in many aspects.  It is deeply insulting and wrong that the rights of this group of people are not being fully vindicated when we have this opportunity.  The pre-legislative scrutiny was extensive and detailed with almost 40 witnesses appearing before the committee, including survivors groups, advocates, and human rights experts, as well as the written submissions being received.  We carefully reviewed all submissions with the assistance of the secretariat for the children's committee, which did incredible work, and the chairing of Deputy Funchion.  Our report synthesised all of those engagements into 83 recommendations.  Disgracefully, many of them seem to have been disregarded.  I am left wondering what the point of the pre-legislative scrutiny was.</p></speech>

The committee report was published on 14 December.  On 12 January, the Bill was published.  That is just 14 working days, not to mention the Christmas disruption.  Therefore, how much consideration was actually given to the recommendations of the committee?  This is not about the committee but about the voices of survivors and their advocates.  All of our recommendations are based on their submissions.  The Minister is not dismissing the committee necessarily but dismissing them.</p><p>There are several main issues I wish to raise today.  The first, which many other Deputies have raised already, is the mandatory information session.  The committee report was unambiguous, stating:</p> <blockquote> 	The mandatory information session should be removed from the legislation.  An  alternative appropriate safeguard should instead be provided for, such as the sending of correspondence by registered post. </blockquote>  <p>The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission stated the information session presented an obstacle and potentially a complete barrier to individuals accessing long-sought information.  The Council of Irish Adoption Agencies described it as contradictory to the spirit of the Bill.  Others classified it as insulting, discriminatory, and restrictive.  While the Minister has changed the format of the mandatory information session, it is still an obstacle to accessing information.  Many witnesses suggested alternatives that the committee highlighted.  It wanted to be proactive.  However, the Minister and Department are unwilling to consider these.  If this is about balancing privacy and identity rights, there are numerous ways to outline that to the individuals concerned.  Forcing a verbal interaction with an agent of the State to outline what is already known is deeply problematic and potentially traumatic.  The Government is saying that is okay, because there may be some counselling available.</p><p>Moreover, section 17 actually states that a purpose of the mandatory information session is to inform the adopted person of &quot;the importance of the relevant person respecting the privacy rights of the parent&quot; and the preference of the parent not to be contacted.  That is an incredibly condescending and paternalistic statement to have written into law, reflecting how the State still views adopted people.  This session remains deeply insulting, discriminatory and restrictive.  Those affected are the people most aware of privacy rights.  They have had a lifetime of negotiating these matters and do not need the Government to explain it to them.  Ultimately, this session is part of a false narrative that pits adopted people against parents.  The implication of adopted people trying to track down parents was strongly contested in the committee.  Our report shows a small minority of mothers have expressed a no-contact preference, approximately 5%, while far more adopted people on the register have indicated that they do not want contact.</p><p>The Bill treats categories of affected people differently.  The mandatory information session, which should not be in place, only applies to adopted people and not to parents.  Furthermore, it remains predicated on the concept that it is only parents who have a non-contact preference and that this is much more common than it actually is.  Unfortunately, this seems to be a case of the system protecting itself.  The reality is that secrecy was imposed by the State, agencies, and religious orders on both adopted people and parents.  The twisted morality of the time imposed social stigma on adoption and then engaged in the falsification of records.  Since then, Departments, public bodies and religious orders have tried to maintain this secrecy.  We can see all the remnants of this type of thinking in the very fabric of the Bill and the implications on which it is based.  The mandatory information session and all it represents must be removed from the Bill.  An alternative measure should be adopted that treats all relevant people the same and with respect.  In his opening statement, when he spoke about this being &quot;landmark&quot;, the Minster gave different examples of all these old Bills and referenced that the current Bill does not &quot;criminalise&quot; adopted people.  What kind of a low bar is not criminalising adopted people?  I will tell him.  It is so low a bar it just should not be referenced.  It is not worth referencing unless it is in a completely different context to this one.</p><p>The second main issue is early life and care information.  The committee heard extensive discussions on the need for broader understandings of care and early life information.  It was recommended that the scope and extent of care information provided should be increased and that &quot;All information is part of an adopted person&rsquo;s history and heritage and must be included in the records provided to them&quot;.  The prescriptive definitions in the Bill, while an improvement on the initial Schedule, are still limiting and do not guarantee access to the full range of potential care information, early life information and medical information.  The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission has warned that &quot;Using restricted definitions will have a significant impact on the type of information ... available and those who can access it.&quot;  The Bill&rsquo;s definition of &quot;care information&quot; is linked to the limited list of institutions identified in Schedule 1.  This confines the Bill&rsquo;s application to just 44 institutions out of 182 known institutions, agencies, and individuals that were involved with forced family separation.  The committee has a very clear recommendation here that has again been disregarded.  We sought that: &quot;The list of institutions in Schedule 1 should be expanded to incorporate the full list of known institutions, agencies and individuals that were involved with forced family separation in Ireland, without limiting the bill solely to these bodies.&quot;</p> <p>While there is provision for the Minister to add institutions to those outlined in the Schedule, it is not only nonsensical to exclude them but is indicative of an approach that is putting obstacles in the way of individuals seeking access to the information.  It is just ridiculous that they have to seek the Minister's discretion when there should be no need for it. <br/><br/>The third issue is the terminology around adoptions.  The Bill clings to the euphemism of &quot;incorrect birth registrations&quot; as if they were not part of a system of forced family separation and were a benign mistake rather than a multigenerational strategy by State institutions and religious orders to cover up illegalities.  Let us be very clear; this was not a case of &quot;incorrect birth registrations&quot;.  It was the intentional falsification of birth certifications and other documents.  It was illegal adoptions.  The least this legislation should do is be honest and name these practices for what they were and for what we all know they were.<br/><br/>In the 2015 report on the pre-legislative scrutiny of the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill, the Joint Committee on Health and Children said:</p><blockquote>	references to &lsquo;<i>wrongful registrations</i>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<i>incorrect registrations</i>&rsquo; suggest an administrative oversight, and do not adequately reflect the covert nature of many adoptions carried out in the past.  The Committee further notes that there are no references ... or acknowledgements of illegal adoptions in the Bill. </blockquote> <p>Again, in this Bill, the Department and the Government could not bring themselves to even acknowledge illegal adoptions.  In their submission, the Clann Project provided a definition of illegal adoption that should be in the Bill as a more accurate and truthful alternative to &quot;incorrect birth registrations&quot;.  On this point, the committee recommended that the Bill refer to &quot;falsely or incorrectly recorded&quot; birth registration.  This was another recommendation by the committee that was ignored.<br/><br/>Discussions of the general data protection regulation, GDPR, and the Government&rsquo;s conservative interpretations of it permeated the pre-legislative scrutiny.  This is an area of considerable complexity but, nonetheless, the committee was forced to recommend that &quot;the Bill must be proofed to ensure that adopted persons are provided with a clear means of accessing their information in compliance with GDPR requirements.&quot;  It is already clear that there are multiple issues with the Bill and GDPR.<br/><br/>The GDPR already defines personal data as &quot;any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person [or] (&lsquo;data subject&rsquo;)&quot;.  The definitions in the Bill do not align with that and it is not permissible to limit the definition of personal data more narrowly than it is defined in GDPR.  Several witnesses identified issues with State institutions and agencies deeming mixed information as third-party data rather than mixed data.  The State&rsquo;s position led to section 62 of the Bill, which restricts individual&rsquo;s rights under GDPR.  That is very worrying.  It should also be noted that the phrase &quot;mixed data&quot; does not exist in the GDPR and, where data relates to two people, it is personal data to both of them and should be released.<br/><br/>Section 16 introduces the insulting and simply wrong provision that family medical history will only be provided through a medical practitioner.  This new barrier is currently being used by the Department in relation to subject data access requests for mother and baby homes commission archives.  The Department is now extending it to adopted people and parents.  In addition, under our GDPR recommendations, the committee again called for the removal of the mandatory information session as it is a clear barrier to individuals' effective right of access to information.<br/><br/>These are only some examples.  Initial readings of the Bill by data experts and advocacy groups have raised serious concerns, which they warn could lead to massive confusion, a large number of complaints to the Data Protection Commission and litigation.  These issues need to be rectified by the time the Bill reaches the next Stage.<br/><br/>On reciprocal rights for mothers, there are no information rights for mothers in this Bill, except for those women whose children died in certain institutions.  Against this is a glaring inconsistency in that this Bill keeps shifting emphasis and applying different rights and restrictions to different groups.  The committee was very clear on this point.  We called for &quot;a reciprocal right for mothers to receive their full records, including information about their child and to have input into them in the form of an appended statement or similar.&quot;  This was forced family separation surrounded by secrecy.  Mothers were coerced and non-consenting participants.  Their rights to care, administrative, medical and other records, as they relate to them, need to be acknowledged.<br/><br/>On the matter of a public information campaign, the committee recommended that an information campaign &quot;should begin at the earliest point possible to avoid delays&quot; and &quot;should be designed with empathy and sensitivity and in itself be considered a safeguard in protecting privacy rights.&quot;  There was strong support for an information campaign around this issue.  While the Bill allows for a public information campaign, it gives the Adoption Authority of Ireland considerable latitude in deciding the content and timing.  Witnesses such as the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and the Clann Project suggested an information campaign as an alternative to the mandatory information session.<br/><br/>There is a recommendation for the campaign to be of at least six months' duration to allow people to consider their options.  There is a need for it to be advertised abroad, given the international nature of the illegal adoptions system.  It needs to consider non-digital routes, given the age profiles of individuals involved, and it also needs to be available in plain English and to consider people with intellectual disabilities.  On that point, the first recommendation in the committee report is that &quot;Plain text should be employed ... [as] far as it is possible, both in the Bill and in any accompanying documentation, particularly given the sensitive ... [content] of the legislation.&quot;  The Bill fails this first criterion.  Even for Irish legislation, which is unnecessarily difficult to read, this Bill is especially complicated and daunting in numerous sections.  This will put an additional onus on the information campaign to be as accessible as possible.<br/><br/>In addition to its technical function, the campaign should be part of a social response to help create a new discourse of truth, accountability and understanding.  It is very important and worth quoting the Clann Project on this matter: </p><blockquote>	The proposed publicity campaign presents a unique opportunity to let mothers know that they no longer need to bear the burden of secrecy and shame, to let adopted people know that they are equal in the eyes of the law, and to let relatives of the deceased know that they can finally learn what became of their family members. </blockquote> <p>The current section dealing with a public information campaign is insufficient.  There should be a greater emphasis on an accessible and wide-ranging campaign aimed at making the process as easy as possible for affected people and their families, as well as helping to reframe cultural understandings of this subject, especially in the absence of an official State apology.<br/><br/>Finally, on counselling, the committee heard unanimous support for extending the Bill's provision for counselling to all affected parties.  A range of supports should be offered to affected persons to include provision of information, counselling and interventions to help address experiences of trauma.  Section 63 of the Bill, counselling support for parents, again prioritises one group over others.  There is a reference in section 57 to counselling for applicants after they have received records.  However, given the limitations on who can apply, and for what information, this provision is restrictive.  What about those whose applications are unsuccessful?  What about relatives?  Several witnesses pointed out the transgenerational trauma that forms part of the legacy of adoptions in Ireland.  There is no recognition of that in the legislation.<br/><br/>I have only touched on some of the main points that I am aware of from my reading of the Bill so far and my engagement with individuals and advocacy groups.  This gives a sense of the amount of work that still needs to be done to make this Bill what it should be.  Any progress on this matter has to be welcomed.  For decades, State authorities have denied individuals access to information about themselves, their identity and their heritage.  This has intentionally perpetuated a culture of secrecy and stigma surrounding illegal adoptions, which has furthered the suffering of adopted people, parents and their entire families.  In this instance, one arm of the State is attempting to solve the problem created by another.  Individuals are entitled to this information under GDPR.  However, the Government&rsquo;s interpretation of these rights continues to uphold decades-old secrecy and barriers.  If this Bill is the answer to that, it is wholly inadequate.  It is based on false narratives, treats groups differently, restricts access, attempts to limit GDPR and fails to provide the reassurances that adopted people, parents and their advocates have sought.<br/><br/>I urge the Minister to engage with the pre-legislative scrutiny report and to incorporate its recommendations in amendments.  Be assured that I, and others, will do so.  I can only hope that the Government will allow sufficient time, at that stage, to discuss the many amendments that will come forward and not to apply the guillotine.  In the meantime, I will push for the children&rsquo;s committee to seek a comprehensive response from the Minister on our report, including his rationale for disregarding so many of its recommendations.</p> <p>It was seven working days and the disruption of Christmas.  It is hard to imagine that all of that work was considered enough.  We ask survivor groups to come before us time and again to relive trauma.  For what?  It cannot be for them to be ignored.  The least witnesses and advocacy groups can expect is to be listened to and considered.</p> <p> Over the past few days, all Deputies will have received emails and messages from many people asking us to amend the Bill.  I wholeheartedly support them.  The Bill needs to be amended substantially to achieve what it claims.  These individuals should not have to ask for amendments.  A Bill that has gone through several iterations of pre-legislative scrutiny should be much better than the one before us.</p></speech>

This legislation has been long awaited by many people.  Over many years there have been repeated attempts to draft legislation to provide adopted people with the right to key information about their birth situation.</p><p>I am a member of the Oireachtas committee which examined this legislation and met over many months with stakeholder groups.  It is important to pay tribute to these groups and the individuals they represent.  Their stories are personal and unique but there is a commonality of pain, hurt and emptiness of not knowing one's self.  I hope our committee has been empathetic to their pain and that D&aacute;il and Seanad &Eacute;ireann move as quickly as possible to enact legislation that will, to some small extent, help to ease that pain. </p><p>The urgent need to enact the Birth Information and Tracing Bill has been recognised by all political parties, stakeholder groups and professionals working in the area and the legislation has been progressed as a matter of priority by the Government.  The Bill, which I hope will be enacted, will ensure the full release on application of birth certificates and birth, early life care and medical information for adopted persons, people who were boarded out, nursed out, subject to illegal birth registration or who resided in mother and baby or county home institutions when they were children.</p><p>On top of all of this, the Bill seeks to establish a statutory tracing service and statutory contact preference register and to provide for the safeguarding of adoption and related records.  Furthermore, it addresses the issues facing people who were the subject of an illegal birth registration.  The Bill will provide a legal mechanism for provision of an accurate birth registration to affected individuals while remaining mindful of their current identity.</p><p>Following engagement with stakeholders, the Bill has been significantly enhanced in a number of areas.  When a parent has indicated a no-contact preference, this will be conveyed to the person applying for the birth information.  This will now be done by means of a short, sensitive and user-friendly telephone call to the applicant seeking information and will no longer require a face-to-face meeting with a social worker.  Information will then be released to the applicant in all cases.</p><p>The Bill also includes some major new provisions that allow access to records by next of kin.  These were not included in the original heads of Bill so that is an important matter taken on <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the consultation with stakeholders.</p><p>The Birth Information and Tracing Bill is fully congruent with the Constitution and GDPR obligations of our State and strengthens existing rights to information.  The Bill does not prevent a person from making a subject access request under GDPR or from receiving information beyond the categories in the legislation.</p><p>Leaving legislation aside for a moment, I will speak on the substantive matter of mother and baby homes.  Every child in the world is perfect at the time of birth and perfectly deserving of the love and affection of parents, extended family and the State.  For too many decades, the State, choked by a holier-than-thou and &quot;What will the neighbours and clergy think?&quot; attitude, did not live by the cherish all the children of the nation equally slogan of the 1916 Proclamation.  Instead, society, church and State were complicit ideologues for the &quot;born out of wedlock&quot; and &quot;living in sin&quot; outlook and, perhaps most disgusting of all, the term &quot;bastard&quot;, which has thankfully left public discourse.  These outlooks have caused immeasurable pain and torn families apart for far too long.  I hope the legislation before us can heal some wounds and help people find out who mum and dad truly were.</p><p>I had a conversation with a woman in my constituency some months ago.  It came up casually in our conversation that I was heading home that evening for some cake and a small party for my daughter's birthday.  With deeply sad eyes, the woman told me that, while most people look forward to their birthday, she finds hers the most painful day of each year because it reminds her that part of her identity and sense of self is not there.  I believe heart and soul that this legislation will to a large extent heal her pain and that of many others.</p></speech>

Violence against women, emotional and mental abuse and the ever-growing problem of coercive control are a national and social crisis.  The State and successive Governments have a poor record when it comes to support and protections for women who have been subjected to violence and abuse by men.  It has been left to community organisations and NGOs to step up, fill the gaps and help vulnerable and traumatised women.  Organisations such as Safe Ireland, Women's Aid, the Rape Crisis Network Ireland, rape crisis centres, local refuges and the National Women's Council of Ireland do Trojan work with little support from the State and deserve our recognition and thanks.</p><p>This is an incredible situation when we consider the scale of the violence faced by women.  Here are some of the facts.  Hundreds of women have died violently in Ireland.  Many were killed in their own homes.  Most were killed by a man known to them.  The majority of violence, abuse and coercive control of women is perpetrated by men and 99% of suspected offenders of detected sexual violence reported in 2019 were male.  The crisis we have is pervasive, continuous and getting worse.  Support organisations such as Women's Aid and Safe Ireland have reported a frightening increase in the numbers reaching out to them for help.  In 2020, Women's Aid support workers heard over 30,000 disclosures of domestic violence, including coercive control, while Safe Ireland's submission to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice stated that nearly 3,500 women and 600 children contacted a domestic violence service for the first time during the first six months of the pandemic.</p><p>The culture of everyday sexism, misogyny and violence against women is systemic.  We find it right across our society.  We believe it is time for everyone elected to the D&aacute;il and the whole Oireachtas to play our part in ending this scourge of gender-based violence in Ireland.  A particular and urgent responsibility falls on the Government.</p><p>Following the brutal murder of Ashling Murphy last week, there has been a collective outpouring of grief and anger and a demand for real change.  It is time and there is now the opportunity for the Government to respond in a way that matches the scale of this crisis and the magnitude of violence and abuse against women and girls.</p> <p>This means coming up with resourcing and funding for services.  The days of the b&eacute;al bocht and of services existing and surviving on a wing and a prayer must be over.  It means the passing of legislation and the delivery of policies with a modern and modernising outlook and a genuine determination to make things better.</p> <p> The Sinn F&eacute;in motion before the House focuses on practical solutions and actions that will make a difference in how the State tackles gender-based violence.  There are steps that can be taken immediately to turn the tide of a crisis that is ruining the lives of far too many women and girls right across our communities.  Our proposals include the need for the Government to complete and publish the comprehensive and integrated third national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence and, crucially, to commit to implementing, resourcing and funding that strategy in full.  </p> <p> Policy, legislation, resources and political decision-making relating to gender-based violence are currently scattered across a number of Government Departments.  I think everyone now accepts that this fragmented approach has not worked.  I note that the Minister for Justice will now be the single senior Minister to take all of these matters forward.  That is a welcome move.  However, we have also proposed the establishment of a dedicated unit in the Department of the Taoiseach for oversight and co-ordination to ensure the implementation of the national strategy and that all parties to it are held to account.  We believe it still remains important that the Taoiseach, the head of the Government of the day, drives this strategy and is accountable for it.</p> <p> To better inform policy decisions and response strategies, we are also calling for the publication of the sexual violence survey and the implementation of the recommendations in the independent study of familicide and domestic homicide reviews.  We have raised these matters, as the Minister knows, on many occasions.  This is an urgent matter.</p> <p> I understand the Government is supporting our motion, and that is to be welcomed.  It is important that all of us, as Teachta&iacute; D&aacute;la from whichever political party or the Independent benches, stand together.  I believe this is an issue on which there is far more to bring us together in common purpose than there is to divide us in disagreement because this is not about political parties or party politics.  This is about coming together to send a message that when this D&aacute;il says "Enough is enough", we mean business.  It is not a slogan at a time of grief to be cast aside when the time of mourning has past.  Women have had enough of that.  We have had enough of promises that go nowhere and, all the while, women and girls suffer the awful consequences of this State and too many Governments being found badly wanting.  When we say it ends here, the only way that can be made real is by the Government following up with actions and initiatives that will bring an end to this scourge of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  Everything else is just talk in the end.  This comes down to political will and the Government grasping this imperative to make real change.  Of course, that imperative also applies to all of us on the Opposition benches.  To borrow a phrase, we need to be in this together.</p> <p> I welcome that the Taoiseach earlier today accepted my proposal that a meeting of political leaders be convened early next week because I believe the entire political leadership of the Oireachtas needs to commit publicly and vigorously to sustain this matter.  We need stamina and persistence on these matters.</p> <p> The women of Ireland are crying out loudly and clearly.  It has been said already but let me repeat that this can be a watershed moment and the challenge for us all is to make sure it is.</p></speech>

It is absolutely necessary that we, as women, do so, and I include myself in that.  I have played by the rules.  I have played by societal rules even when I knew they were not fair and placed a disproportionate burden of responsibility on me, as a woman, because from the time we are young girls, we are conditioned to develop an awareness that young men and boys are not.  Think about that.  It is very wrong.</p>  <p>  We get advice and safety tips that we never ask for.  We are told not to wear revealing clothes, to lock our car doors, to always get a taxi but remember to text the licence plate number to a friend, not to exercise with earphones in, not to agitate men and always to pop &euro;20 in our bras on a night out to allow us to get home in the event we are mugged.  The only real advice, the only real rule that is going to make a difference is one that states clearly and categorically, "Stop attacking women and girls because it will not be tolerated."  As women, we deserve better.  As a mother, I refuse to raise my daughters in fear.</p>  <p>  I want to finish with an example of the real impact of gender-based violence.  I received a message this evening from a woman who told me she went to the doctor today.  She said it was okay, that is was difficult but she was glad she went.  Once again, the labels of post-traumatic stress disorder, PTSD, and retraumatisation were given.  She was told to stay off work for a minimum of three months.  She has been referred for an urgent review, which is to happen soon and she hopes it will be useful.  She told me she needs to get through this time and that she needs to get it sorted, once and for all.  That woman was attacked in 2004.  For 18 years, she has been living with that trauma.</p></speech>

The outpouring of grief for Ashling and the tens of thousands of women and girls who have shared their experience of everyday harassment and violence, and the fear of violence, have sent a clear message to us all - enough is enough.  We can all see that this is a watershed moment.  The causes are deep-rooted and will need serious consideration if things are to change.</p>  <p>  Women and girls have the right to be safe on our streets and in their homes, yet too often they are not.  We need to review our society.  It is not just an Irish problem but Ireland can lead the way.  Our education system, health service, justice system and social media all need reform.  We need to fundamentally consider the effect of every aspect of society on our attitudes towards women.  None of us wants to look back in one or two years' time having heard of another senseless killing and wonder why things did not change.  We have a unique momentum which can overcome all obstacles and deliver real change.</p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in's motion outlines the immediate measures the Government must implement to tackle harassment and violence against women and girls.  The third national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence is due to be published in approximately six weeks.  We need a Government commitment that it will fully implement and fund the strategy.  The current pandemic has exposed an epidemic of domestic violence.  In Kildare, things are so bad that women and children are being sent to refuges outside the county, even as far away as Drogheda in County Louth.  Kildare might be considered lucky because nine counties have no domestic violence shelter at all.  That needs to be addressed urgently.</p>  <p>  The Citizens' Assembly on Gender Equality has recommended that a revised relationships and sexuality curriculum should cover gender power dynamics, consent, and domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  Change is needed and failure to address this will cost lives.</p></speech>

In Ireland, it is an issue we need to tackle head on.  Women in Ireland experience sexism and harassment in their everyday lives, whether in the gym, on the bus or online.  Women face harassment by just being present in public spaces.  The vast majority of sexually violent offenders are men and, unfortunately, a lot of the abuse and harassment is not reported.  For me, that says something about the lack of confidence women have in the justice system.  We fear that we will not be believed or if we are, that the perpetrator will get off with just a slap on his wrist.</p> <p> The State needs to do more to support women who are victims of gender-based violence.  Government needs to fund these services properly.  Charities have stepped in where the State failed.  That is not good enough.  The women of Ireland deserve much better.  Safe Ireland stated that in the last four months of 2020, there were more than 800 requests for refuge that it could not meet.  For me, that shows a complete disregard for women who are victims of domestic violence and have nowhere else to turn.</p> <p> The Government needs to give a firm commitment that the upcoming strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence will be implemented in full as well as committing to gathering better data in respect of this area.  We need to strive to do much better across all Departments in making our public places safe for the women of Ireland.  There is no quick fix but we need to work together and start taking the necessary steps to improve Irish society in the here and now.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-01-19a.298" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1579" speakername="Mairead Farrell" time="20:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022011900049#WW00200"><p>Our nation's attention is currently focused on violence against women due to the horrific murder of Ashling Murphy.  I know that all our thoughts are with her family and loved ones.  Sadly, however, this is only the most recent violent attack against a woman to horrify our nation.  We have a long and shameful history regarding the treatment of women and girls in this State.  We must be under no illusion that this history has had an impact on the deeply ingrained misogynistic abuse directed towards women.  We see it in the way that women and girls were treated in Magdalen laundries; in the way women's healthcare is cast aside; in the way women's bodies, tone, image and behaviour are strictly policed in public discourse; in the way women have been forced to travel to get abortions; in the way our bodily autonomy has been denied to us by this State; in the culture of shame that puts the burden on us to talk about the violence we have experienced in hushed tones; and in the immediate and severe backlash and victim blaming if we dare to speak out.</p>  <p>  We know that 90% of sexual assault takes place within relationships and that we do not have adequate services in place to support survivors of domestic abuse.  This includes refuge space, but it is broader than that.  I have been contacted by women who are trying to get out of their current relationships but there are economic factors which severely restrict their ability to keep themselves and their children safe.  It is so difficult for any person to get away from their abuser but for women in poverty, women whose abusers control their finances and women who are isolated socially, it is all the more difficult.</p>  <p>  In the past week, I have often thought about Manuela Riedo, who was raped and murdered in Galway.  Many aspects of Ashling's case reminded me of that horrible attack.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a h-anam d&iacute;lis.  Sine Manuela's murder, 105 women have lost their lives in Ireland.  We cannot wait for another woman's murder to tackle the culture of misogyny and put policies in place to counteract it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-01-19a.299" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1497" speakername="Imelda Munster" time="20:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022011900049#WW00300"><p>I only have a couple of minutes.  It is certainly not enough time to speak to the enormity of the problem of violence against women in Ireland.  First, I wish to give my sincere condolences to the family of Ashling Murphy and to her partner and friends.  Their loss is unimaginable and we are all thinking of them at this very difficult time.</p>  <p>  Since Ashling was murdered, we have been hearing an outpouring of anger from women.  We know that violence against women and the threat and fear of violence is pervasive in Irish society.  It always has been and it affects all women.  We have heard that loud and clear.  Irish society has reacted to the death of Ashling with revulsion.  The calls for change across the country are deafening.  This is a decisive moment in Irish society and we must take action.  We cannot go back to business as usual after this.  Women simply will not accept it this time around.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge that the Government is talking about taking steps to deal with this with the political leaders meeting and the role of the office of the Taoiseach in implementing change.  That is all welcome.  It has to be backed up with action, however.  Services need to be properly funded.  Rape crisis centres need to be sure that they can answer every single call.  We need enough refuge places to ensure that no woman is ever turned away again.  Tusla provides just one third of the refuge places that Ireland is obligated to provide under the Istanbul Convention and nine counties have no domestic violence refuge place at all.  Practically every Member has raised that point and that speaks volumes in itself.</p>  <p>  We need a commitment that the third national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence will be fully implemented and properly funded after it is published.  Further to this, we need to address wider issues relating to women's safety, family courts, appropriate and safe housing and education for our young people.  We need a joined-up approach to bring about real systemic change.  This cannot be another case of promising change and not delivering.  Women have a right to be safe wherever they are - when they are working, socialising, exercising and in their own homes.  I hope that we can all work together in this because it has to happen now.</p>  <p>  My colleague, Deputy Conway Walsh, asked earlier that this issue be brought back to the floor of the House every couple of months in order that we can discuss additional changes and measures and get an update on progress.  I am hopeful and I am sure the Minister will agree to do that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-01-19a.300" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1502" speakername="Helen McEntee" time="20:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022011900049#WW00400"><p>It is true that the Ireland of today is a different country from the Ireland of the 1970s.  We are more open and willing to confront issues that were previously brushed under the carpet, such as domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, and we are more willing to listen to often unpalatable truths about our society.</p>  <p>  As we all know, however, despite seismic shift in attitudes over the past 50 years towards those experiencing domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, those protections, services and supports are needed now as much as they were then.  Deep-rooted misogynistic attitudes towards women and towards domestic abuse and sexual crime remain a blight on our society.</p>  <p>  As part of the Government plan to tackle domestic, sexual and gender-based violence in all its forms, my Department is leading on the development of the third national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  To tackle this epidemic, it is vital that we step up our policy response right across Departments and agencies to ensure that the third strategy is the most ambitious yet.</p>  <p>  The senseless murder of Ashling Murphy is yet another example of random violence against women.  It has drawn comparisons internationally and from our own past, leading to widespread public shock, anger and, indeed, an outpouring of grief.  Fear of harassment and violence should never be normalised and no women should have to think about an ever-present threat as they go about their daily lives.  We have heard so much about people's feelings on that throughout the day.</p>  <p>  The Government and I are doing everything that we can to ensure that people, particularly women and vulnerable people, feel safe and are safe in our societies, and that Government imposes a zero tolerance policy when we are combating domestic and sexual violence against women and girls.  Combating  all forms of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence is and will continue to be a priority for this Government.  To tackle this epidemic, as I said, it is vital that we step up our responses and that we have a policy of zero tolerance on violence and abuse against women.</p>  <p>  I have been working for the past 12 months on the goals and desired outcomes of the third national strategy, which is due to be finalised in the coming months.  Through consultations and seminars, the NGO sector has shaped and informed the drafting so far and a final consultation will be taking place in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  Like many others, I cannot thank enough those working in the sector who have contributed to the development of this strategy, but also for the work they do on a day-to-day basis locally.  I commend Sinead Smith and all the team in the Meath Women's Aid Refuge &amp;amp; Support Services and all those working across the country and nationally.</p>  <p>  Through these consultations, the sector and the victims have identified priority issues to be addressed and provided expert advice on moving to an outcome focused framework.  We are also very conscious that the new strategy should incorporate the voice of the child and we have reached out to child advocate groups to ensure that this critical element is included.</p>  <p>  The strategy will be accompanied each year by a detailed action plan setting out how each of these aims will be achieved, who will be responsible for them, the timeframe for delivery and, of course, how it will be underpinned by resources.  I will begin the final round of consultation soon so that we can publish the strategy and implementation plan as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  With regard to this issue and the overall structure, as the Taoiseach announced, we are developing a plan to bring policy responsibility for domestic, sexual and gender-based violence and the delivery of domestic violence services together under the Department of Justice.</p> <p>A detailed plan for how this will work is in preparation and will be announced shortly.  There will of course be oversight from the Department of the Taoiseach.  This is to ensure that all Departments deliver, including the Department of Justice.  The highest quality of supports and services will also be provided.  This includes increasing the number of refuge spaces available nationally to ensure that everyone who needs a space will get it.  This certainly means making sure that every county has a refuge and that we expand where they already exist.  On resourcing, the Taoiseach has been clear and has confirmed that this will be given the priority it requires.</p> <p> In the context of other initiatives, my Department has been running a six-year, two-part campaign to raise public awareness of sexual harassment, domestic and sexual violence and intimate image abuse in order to bring about a change in long-established societal behaviours and attitudes, as well as to activate bystanders with a view to reducing and preventing this type of behaviour and violence.  The implementation plan, Supporting a Victim's Journey, which is the recommendation from the O'Malley report - which, in itself, was a review of the protections for vulnerable witnesses in the investigation and prosecution of sexual offences - continues to be rolled out.  It is introducing important reforms to support and protect vulnerable victims and to ensure that the criminal justice system is more victim-centred and that more women come forward.</p> <p> To date, a number of key actions have been delivered.  I will outline a number of these.  We have introduced legislation for preliminary trial hearings and this will be enacted in the coming weeks.  The nationwide roll-out of divisional protective service units within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been completed.  The first cohort of staff of the new sexual offences unit in the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions formally took up their roles in April of last year.  Work to advance the training for all personnel who come into contact with vulnerable victims is under way within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the legal profession and the courts.  Funding for NGOs providing courts accompaniment and related information and support services has been increased.  A review of grants for organisations supporting victims has been undertaken to try and identify gaps in the service provision right across the country.  We have improved the victims charter website, which provides a comprehensive repository of information for victims.  The University of Limerick has been commissioned by the Department of Justice to develop the framework for the operation and training of intermediaries.  They will soon be engaging with stakeholders to develop this.  The purpose of this is to support vulnerable witnesses, including children, as they go through the criminal justice system.</p> <p>Upon the enactment of the Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Act 2020, or as we all know it, Coco's Law, my Department launched an awareness-raising campaign.  This will highlight the penalties that are applicable if someone is convicted of sharing an intimate image without consent and draw attention to the harm caused the victim whose intimate image is shared.  I thank Deputy Howlin, who is in the Chamber, for his work on that with Jackie Fox.</p> <p>This year, I will also legislate for the specific offences of non-fatal strangulation and stalking.  These offences will be called out.  Not only will that send a clear message about how seriously they are taken, but it will help us to understand the extent of the commission of these heinous crimes.  I will also strengthen the monitoring and reporting conditions for convicted sex offenders and legislate to give effect to all of the legislative changes recommended in the O'Malley review, further supporting victims in practical ways on their journey through the criminal justice system.</p> <p> I am not going to oppose the motion.  I just repeat what I said earlier.  In the spirit of this evening, we can all commit to Ashling, we can commit to each other and we will certainly commit to so many other women to make sure that we dedicate ourselves in order that, along what will be very difficult road, we will work in co-operation to demand zero tolerance for violence and for any kind of abuse of women and girls.</p></speech>

She mentioned the two issues, namely, the non-fatal regulation and the specific offence of stalking.  I raised these matters during Questions on Promised Legislation this morning.  I am glad that the Minister remains committed to driving forward in respect of both of them.</p>  <p>  While we are gathered here this evening because of the senseless murder of Ashling Murphy, like previous speakers I make reference to the fact that 244 women died in violent circumstances in recent years.  I had wanted to read out all their names in order that people could hear of each and every life lost but I cannot do that in the short time available.  That alone tells a story.</p>  <p>  The point I want to drive home is that many speakers have talked about how men are responsible for this violence and how they need to be the solution.  Men need to do more.  The men of Ireland need to do what women have been asking of them for decades, namely, that they do more to keep women safe.  That is a fundamental point.  There is not just one thing that we can do.  There are many interlinking policies and actions that can be introduced and things that we can do on legislative basis, on an individual basis and on a cultural basis to enable us, as men and Deputies, to have an impact in the context of that safety issue.</p>  <p>  I wish to use my time to briefly highlight the fact that we need to start talking to young boys at a very early age about issues relating to consent and harassment.  We should include this as part of our school curriculum.  The Rape Crisis Network of Ireland reported that over a 12-month period, 80% of adolescents in the study it carried out disclosed sexual harassment.  Some 63% disclosed that they were subjected to someone making unwelcome sexual comments, jokes or gestures in the school environment.  That is just not good enough.  Our continued inaction on this is just not good enough.  If we are to make the necessary cultural change, we need to begin early.  We need to begin by educating people about respect and consent and against harassment.  From there, we need to grow and counteract the harm that is being caused and that is being done.  Introducing a national policy to combat sexual harassment in secondary schools would be one tangible action that we could take.  The fact that I am standing here talking about the education system again reflects that this is a complex, interlinking action that we all need to take responsibility for.</p>  <p>  I welcome the motion.  I also welcome the debate and the opportunity to contribute to it.  Hopefully, I, too, can be part of the solution going forward.</p></speech>

She certainly lit a fire in mn&aacute; na h&Eacute;ireann, from Derry to Cork and from Galway to Leinster House.  To her family, Ashling was just their gorgeous young woman.  They wished she had just come home.  All of this must be very difficult for the family.</p>  <p>  The must be a before-and-after Ireland in the aftermath of what has happened.  Every woman has experienced degrees of what happened to Ashling and countless other dead women.  We all feel it.  We are angry at her murder.  We are broken-hearted, but we are furious too.  However, we will not be dismissed as man-haters.  That term is an insult, and it is a cop-out.  We carried ye, we gave birth to ye, we nursed ye, fed ye and cared for ye.  The only reason ye are alive is because we love ye.  Why are you so afraid of us?</p>  <p>  I know that one cannot live and breathe the patriarchy without learning how to survive.  We have all had to use appeasement to live through dangerous situations.  However, to the women who encourage misogyny, hoping to get some kudos, just stop.  The truth is that the misogynists loathe you too.  In the beginning, we ate the apple and we tempted the man.  Then, we wore the wrong clothes, drank too much, walked or ran alone, were out after dark, before dark and after dark again.  That we were out at all, really, meant we were asking for it.  We are sick to death of taking the blame.  Planning our routes home, locking car doors, pretending we are on the phone, wedging keys between our fingers and texting when we are home safe.  We do not want mace and we do not self-defence classes.  We do not want hollow words from a system that waits for the candles to burn out and then goes back to normal.  This is a normal where women are beaten at home and have their money controlled, their clothes are policed and are murdered.  This is a normal that is failing our children.  It failed our young Kildare girl, Ana Kri&eacute;gel.</p>  <p>  Deputy McDonald has outlined the provisions of our Private Members' Bill.  We want accountability, 999 calls to be answered, safe homes, safe streets and refuges when we need them.  We want to be valued for what our feminine qualities bring to the table, because we bring what has been missing from this State.  We want respect, rights, sovereignty and to take our equal place in the promised Republic.  We will accept no less. </p></speech>

The outpouring of grief that has followed Ashling's murder has been phenomenal.  The spontaneous organisation of vigils across our cities, towns and villages, as well as the huge numbers of men, children but especially women who turned up in sympathy, solidarity and anger was simply amazing.  All of us in society, but particularly men, have responsibility to do our part in ending the violence, the threat of violence and the fear of violence that is the hallmark of the lives of every woman and girl.</p> <p>However, all of us in this House have a greater responsibility to listen.  We must listen to those who attended the vigils and demanded that Ashling Murphy's death mark a turning point.  We must listen to all those women who came on the airwaves to share their own harrowing and often shocking experiences of humiliation, harassment and attacks endured while going about their daily business.  We must listen to those in this House who have bravely told their own stories, including my colleague, Deputy Tully, who outlined her experience of the domestic abuse, which almost cost her her life, in such an honest and powerful way.</p> <p> Above listening, however, we have a responsibility to act because it is by our actions that we will be judged.  The counties in my constituency, Cavan and Monaghan, have no domestic violence refuge accommodation.  For years, the Tearmann Domestic Abuse Service has appealed for emergency accommodation provision but its calls have gone unheeded by successive Governments.  If this Government and this House are genuine about the words that have been spoken in the Chamber tonight, then never again will Tearmann Domestic Abuse Service have to make that appeal.  The evidence of whether we have listened will be in the delivery of refuge accommodation in every county and the implementation of the dozens of other immediate actions that have been rightly demanded over the past week.  I commend this motion to the House.</p></speech>

Our hearts go out to her and her family, and all the other women who have died over the years at the hands of men.  We have discussed this for the past week or so and it has come to us all that it is about behaviour and attitude.  We cannot legislate for attitude but we can legislate for some things.  We can legislate for proper education in order that people know right from wrong from a very early age.  We can legislate to tighten sentencing guidelines in respect of violence against women.  We can legislate for domestic homicide and femicide reviews, similar to what we have in the North.  We cannot leave these tragedies without learning from them and making sure we provide for them in the future.</p>  <p>  We can also ensure that there is support in place for victims to prosecute in order that they have the courage to come forward and not be afraid.  The past experiences of others have been so negative that many do not come forward.  We must ensure aftercare, support and everything else is in place so they are able to do all that.  There are holes in the system, such as in the context of 999 calls and the domestic refuges that are missing in so many places throughout the country.  There are so many things we can do in this House to change things and make them better.  We must do them.  Many other things have also been mentioned, and everyone is aware that we need to change the attitudes and the behaviours of so many people around the country.</p>  <p>  In the past week I have been thinking about something that happened to me about 30 years ago.  I and another young man were going through a small town in rural Ireland and went into a chip shop.  After we ordered the few chips, a group of young men came in the door.  There were two young women behind the counter and these men made very inappropriate remarks towards the young women.  There was an elderly man sitting there.  This went on for a while and we were thinking it was a bit funny but the man got up and laid into them.  He said, "Who the effing hell do you think you are abusing these two girls?  This isn't right.  Get out of here."  He roared abuse at them and they went out the door.  About ten minutes later one of them came in very sheepishly, collected his few things and left again.  There are those who say that not every man is bad.  Well, every man has the opportunity to be like that old man.  I was not like that man that night, to my shame, and many of us in such circumstances would not be, but we have the opportunity to be.  We have the opportunity to stand up and be counted when things like that happen.  That is the big lesson society needs to take from this.</p>  <p>  Turning to the motion, we have the opportunity to bring in legislation and regulations to make things better and to supply the resources in order to ensure that the funds are there to provide for all these situations.  Women's refuges and people who are trying to help victims of domestic violence should not be spending their time trying to run fundraisers.  This is a service for the community, the people and every citizen of this State, and the State has to provide it.</p></speech>

Listening to the public debate over the past number of days, one comment has stuck in my mind.  It has been said that the issue here is not, in the first instance, the safety of women but the violence of men.  Every single day, women face abuse, harassment, sexual and physical violence and, in far too many instances, death, because they are women.  All women at some point in their lives are forced to live this reality and it is men who perpetrate this violence.  Toxic masculinity and institutional sexism are the root cause of the problem.  That is not just among individual men but throughout the very culture and institutions of our society, including at home, in work, on the sports field, in schools, in the courts and even sometimes in this Chamber.  We live in a society that simply refuses to treat women fully as equals.</p>  <p>  I agree with colleagues from both sides of the House that every single man has a role to play in tackling this issue.  It is not acceptable to stay silent and look the other way.  We must all play a part in bringing this unacceptable reality to an end.  Listening to the testimony of women has driven home for me that it is time for men to stand up and act - all men.  We must call out everyday sexism, educate our sons, our friends and our colleagues, challenge institutional gender discrimination and, crucially, fund support services for those experiencing gender-based violence.  Most important of all, we need to ensure our streets, homes, workplaces and places of leisure and entertainment are safe for all women.  It is time for us men to listen to women, to act and to put an end to toxic masculinity.  Those of us with the incredible privilege of being in this Chamber must do everything we can through legislation, policy and budgets to provide all the necessary supports to bring this appalling reality to an end.</p></speech>

I commend Sinn F&eacute;in on using its Private Members' time to give us all a platform to speak tonight.  On rare occasions in our nation's history, an event happens that stops people in their tracks.  One such occasion clearly happened on Wednesday last in County Offaly.  The murder of Ashling Murphy jolted every one of us out of whatever we were doing at the moment we heard about it.  It demanded our immediate attention and focus.  Like everybody else who has spoken, I send my deepest condolences to Ashling's family, her partner, her work colleagues, her friends, her pupils and all who have been so deeply affected by her savage murder.</p>  <p>  The murder investigation will continue to take its course.  Enormous efforts are being made by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to investigate this most awful of crimes and to bring those responsible to justice.  We will allow the Garda to do its job but the profound question being posed to every citizen, everyone in this State and every one of us relates to how we respond.  It is not just about how we respond to this specific dreadful murder and the robbing of a life with such promise and potential, but, more immediately, to the culture that has tolerated sexual and gender-based violence and the backdrop of sexism and misogyny that has supported it through the years.  I have contributed to many of the debates on societal issues in this House over the years.  In that context, changes in the law or the establishment of new agencies have been important steps.  The most important step in dealing with all these fundamental societal problems, namely, a change in culture, is the most difficult to achieve.</p> <p>As a nation, and the Minister alluded to it in her contribution, we are on a difficult journey from the establishment of this State, the centenary of which we are celebrating, where women were chattels; subservient; required to leave the Civil Service on marriage; incarcerated in Magdalen laundries; subjected to symphysiotomy; denied their basic human and sexual rights; and, most oppressive of all, made silent in their suffering.  All of us have heard down the years, in our individual case work, the individual horrible tales of ruined lives oppressed into silence.</p> <p> We know that we are on this long journey and, as the Minister indicated, we have made considerable progress from those darkest of days.  However, we also know we have a long way to go. The challenge now is for us to commit to the creation of a society where all women feel and are safe and where true equality can be achieved.</p> <p> The steps and proposals set out in this motion are an important start.  The work programme of the committee on gender equality, which will be chaired by my colleague, Deputy Bacik, will also be of huge importance.  The specific measures set out in the motion include a national strategy; an implementation programme specifically set out; a clear and adequate stream of resourcing in terms of money, buildings and personnel; implementation of the recommendations of the study on familicide and domestic homicide; a proper national database on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence; early completion of the sexual violence survey currently under way; and the establishment of a specific unit within the Department of the Taoiseach.</p> <p> I welcome the indication from An Taoiseach that he would convene a meeting of party leaders to discuss these things and I know all party leaders in the House will involve themselves in that, but there is a benefit to a specific unit in the Taoiseach's Department.  In major crises, having meetings formally chaired by the Taoiseach that bring progress reports is considerably important in making sure timelines are achieved and work is actually done.</p> <p> These are important and impactive measures that should be supported and must be acted upon but the mood of the nation demands more.  For once, each of us citizens, in which I include myself and everybody else, is called on to examine our individual actions, attitude, language and above all, our individual behaviour, to make a public commitment never to tolerate and certainly never to perpetrate an act of violence, either by word or deed, against a woman and call out sexism and misogyny when we see it and not to walk away.</p> <p> I listened to the debate earlier where many women Members made powerful personal testimonies about their own experiences and we have heard some further ones tonight.  These are enormously impactive and are things that people have internalised.  Politicians and political parties bear a specific responsibility in this regard.  We must look to ourselves and our behaviour to ensure women are safe and welcome in our political system and that anyone we endorse to stand for public office, in our parties' names or as Independents, subscribes to these basic norms of behaviour and practice.  This person must practice these norms, if he or she is to be supported by all our political parties.</p> <p> Institutions in this State have in the past refused to address abuses in our midst.  Let us now make sure that is ended.  Let us all, from this moment on, refuse to look the other way.  I said that cultural change is the most difficult to bring about and so it is, but this change is happening all the time too.  Macho culture and laddism are learned; they are innate.  They are observed behaviour.  It can and must be changed.</p> <p> Maleness should not be interchangeable with aggression or defined by belligerence.  Most men want a different definition of "manhood".  Let us all now set about creating that new definition and, in doing so, changing that culture I talked about, in order that it will be possible for all women and girls to take a run without being fearful or in terror.</p></speech>

In recent weeks, we have seen the acknowledgement that domestic, sexual and gender-based violence is a national social problem.  The tragic killing of Ashling Murphy and the visceral response from every community, city, town, village and even townland, obliges us to respond swiftly, meaningfully and tangibly.  Violence against women is a perpetual pandemic and one that never recedes or fades away.  It has always been with us.</p>  <p>  In this discussion and the statements earlier, we have, rightly, referred to the culture that permits and even encourages violence, abuse and harassment of girls and women.  We have highlighted the role that men and boys can play as individuals and the solidarity women provide to each other.  Now, it is our turn, as legislators, to respond and not just to give speeches, but to ensure substantial and effective policies.  Interventions must be early and effective and penalties for perpetrators must be robust and effective.  In the numerous times I have raised this issue, I have highlighted three areas of immediate action that the Government should have taken long ago.  I mentioned these earlier, but they are worth mentioning again and again.</p>  <p>  The first is domestic violence.  Throughout the pandemic we have seen significant increases in people fleeing domestic violence.  National support providers and those such as the West Cork Women Against Violence Project have seen clear increases in the numbers of calls.  There is a pressing need for more refuge spaces.  The Istanbul Convention standard, as we know, is one refuge space per 10,000 people and in Ireland, we provide one refuge space per 10,000 women, leaving us with 50% or half the recommended bare minimum, including very little infrastructure for male victims.  These refuge spaces are needed now.</p>  <p>  The other point on domestic violence is the importance of having a dedicated Minister or the Department of the Taoiseach to oversee this.  Campaigners have repeatedly called for a dedicated Minister with reach across all of the Departments and agencies, with which a survivor may interact, and a Cabinet standing committee.  Victims and survivors of domestic violence have to interact with local housing offices, social welfare officers, doctors, garda&iacute; and social workers.  We know it is a complex matter that needs a co-ordinated response and people often need training.  We need multidisciplinary teams and somebody overseeing all of these services that are able to interact with those needs.</p>  <p>  Second, we need a drastic overhaul of how our justice system understands and responds to sexual assaults and violence.  The detection rates for sexual offences were 10% for 2020.  There is significant under-reporting of sexual violence.  In 2019, more than 14,000 contacts were received by the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre's national 24-hour helpline.  However, only 3,307 offences were reported to garda&iacute; in the same year.  Only a small percentage of rapes and sexual assaults were reported and only 10% involved a perpetrator being charged or cautioned.  There must be reforms in how policing and the courts system engage with victims.  The hostile treatment of victims has to end.</p> <p>The Realities of Rape Trials in Ireland, a report from Dr. Susan Leahy of the University of Limerick, in conjunction with the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre, outlines the experience of victims or survivors, and has clear recommendations.  Delays in the trial process are a major source of concern which have a significant impact on the victims' recovery and their personal and professional lives.  General understandings of consent are still poor and biases, stereotypes and assumptions still influence juries.</p> <p> The report has 18 recommendations including making available free legal advice and information for anyone reporting or considering reporting any type of sexual offence and providing guidance for juries on consent and to address rape myths.  There is a need for immediate changes to our justice system to make it truly victim-centred and to support and encourage girls and women as well as boys and men to report all forms of sexual assault and violence.</p> <p> Third, there is an urgent need for education on consent, sexual violence, coercion and other types of assault, including online crimes.  The Government delayed the progress of the Social Democrats Bill ensuring a standardised and evidence-based approach to relationship and sex education.  The need for proper education on healthy relationships and understanding of sex is even more important than ever.  NUIG academic Elaine Healy Byrnes, who has written a PhD on consent, is calling for the relationships and sexuality education curriculum to be brought into the 21st century.</p> <p> I am calling on the Government to overturn its decision to delay my party's Bill.  I have raised all of these issues before and I will continue to raise them until we get the action that women and girls deserve.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-01-19a.313" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1560" speakername="Gary Gannon" time="21:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022011900053#AAA00200"><p>First, there are no words that can make this okay for Ashling Murphy and those who knew and loved her.  I express, once again, my party's sympathies and solidarity with her family and all who knew and loved Ashling.  I hope that our collective outpouring of grief and anger as a nation following her killing provides some modicum of solace to them in the horrendously difficult days, months and time ahead.</p>  <p>  For women all over Ireland, I hear how frustrating and heartbreaking it is to have the same conversations over and over again and yet see little progress when it comes to ending violence against women.  When it comes to political leadership, this D&aacute;il Chamber has failed them for decades.  We have had broken promises and abandoned strategies, flashy signs held up to the Istanbul Convention followed by an abject failure to increase refuge spaces.  It is has been said time and time again today that we still only have one third of the recommended refuge spaces and nine counties do not have any refuge at all.</p>  <p>  Today, we must clearly say that politicians will stand up and provide the top-down political leadership required to create a zero-tolerance culture to end men's violence against women because too many women are living in fear in their homes and in our communities.  Too many women are being killed by men.</p>  <p>  The safety tips that women so unhelpfully receive include: do not go out after dark, do not jog with earphones in and make it legal to carry mace.  None of this makes a difference because women are not the problem and while society obsesses about the movements and behaviour of women, we allow the behaviour and acts of perpetrators to go unremarked upon and, too often, unpunished.</p>  <p>  To end men's violence against women, we must accept that the perpetrators of gender-based violence are socialised by the sexism and masculinity that typifies our everyday relations and, in turn, institutionalises sexism and culture.  It is crucial to understand that while not all men commit violence, it is usually always a man who is the perpetrator.</p>  <p>  Men's violence against women operates on a spectrum.  It starts with what may seem like harmless banter with sexist jokes and it ends with women afraid and hurt in relationships, with random attacks and harassment of women in the street, and with women being killed.</p>  <p>  Violence against women is not an issue that will go away without a concerted focus being put into the protection of women, prosecution of perpetrators and, of course, prevention of violence in the first place.  Much more needs to be done by the State to ensure that women and their children are safe in Ireland.</p>  <p>  We need leadership at the top level.  I want to reference some of that.  We talked about the issue of having one Department with responsibility for ending men's violence against women and one Minister responsible sitting around the Cabinet table.  I was thinking about some of the Cabinet Ministries as others were speaking and about where there is an overlap.  I am talking about some of the issues that have arisen and have been raised with Deputies across this Chamber over the past number of years.  Even if you throw a stick in the air and it comes down, when you think about arts, for example, we have had the Waking the Feminists movement.  In the area of defence, we have seen the Women of Honour group stand up and hold to account those who treated them most horrendously wrong.  In transport, who among us here did not feel sick when we watched last year a young women getting onto the DART and having a kick aimed at her head by a group of young men?  In social protection, for decades motherhood has become the basis of a woman's poverty - a form of institutional violence that should be intolerable in a 21st century republic.  In the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, we had a debate only before this on the legacy of mother and baby homes.  We see the horrendous injustice of the State and start to see it replicated elsewhere.  That continues today in direct provision.</p>  <p>  Education is somewhere where we can intervene with young men very early on.  That starts with the means by which we teach them.  A couple of months ago, my party brought forward the Education (Health, Relationships and Sex Education) Bill 2021.  We hope this legislation will make a difference in how we teach children about how they interact in relation to consent and confronting the issue of toxic masculinity from a very early age.  It was lamentable that the Bill was put back, although People Before Profit had a Bill several years ago that was similar.  These are issues that we can address immediately and we can get ahead of this.</p>  <p>  There are other issues.  We talked about leadership at the top level.  I also want to talk about the role of local authorities.  My party rightly referenced the Istanbul Convention, but there was also a UN safer cities for woman and young girls initiative that placed a responsibility on local authorities to improve public infrastructure to make cities and towns safer for women and young girls as they interact with them.  That was about confronting dereliction, looking at street lighting and having public awareness campaigns on public transport, etc.  That all needs to be funded.  That report is there from 2017, I believe, and all across the country local authorities still have done nothing to address these issues.  If we are to have a concerted effort, everybody in a position of responsibility and leadership in this country needs to ask what we can do better and commit to doing.  That starts with ourselves as men, and that has been touched on, quite rightly, across the Chamber.  There is a multitude of things that we can do quickly, and should do.</p></speech>

It can and must be a watershed moment.  What struck me last week, attending the vigil outside the D&aacute;il, is that often you go to large assemblies that are powerful partly because people are shouting and making noise, but what was so powerful about the vigil last week was the silence.  There was a profound, long silence as people flooded up.  There must have been 10,000 people in front of the D&aacute;il on an evening after work.  It was a silence which was pregnant with, obviously, a deep sorrow for Ashling Murphy and for the 244 women who have been killed by men since 1996, with compassion for Ashling's family, friends and wider community, but also with anger at a society that perpetuates the sexism and misogyny which allows this sort of violence by men against women to persist and continue over and over.  The same thing struck me in Tallaght later that evening, and it was replicated across the country by tens of thousands of people who really have the potential to force a change on this issue.  The bottom line is that it is past time to recognise that violence against women - as it is often referred to - is perpetuated by men, and that it is men and the unequal economic and social structures and power dynamics of capitalism that perpetuate male dominance over women.  This will have to change if we are to end the scourge of male violence against women.</p>  <p>  I will focus in my remaining time on one aspect, which is the question of objective sex education.  If we cannot start by teaching children in an age-appropriate way at primary and secondary school basic objective sex education in a factual, consent-based and focused LGBTQ+ positive manner, we really are not going anywhere.  If we are ever to have a chance of changing the misogynistic and sexist attitudes that perpetuate male violence, we need to have objective sex education.  The Bill, proposed by Solidarity People Before Profit four years ago, was passed on Second Stage and since then it has languished in the Bermuda triangle between Second Stage and Committee Stage.  Since then, the Catholic bishops have come out.</p> <p>They have come out with a new syllabus saying that the church's teaching on marriage between a man and a woman cannot be omitted when discussing LGBT issues.  The then Minister, Deputy McHugh, said the ethos of the school is central to any curriculum.  Earlier, the Taoiseach responded very positively to Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith's question, which is welcome, saying that we need to deal with that, but then he suggested the main issue was to check the training of teachers.  The central issue is the ethos.  If we do not challenge the fact that the ethos can stand in the way of the delivery of objective sex education, we could have the best curriculum in the world and the best training of teachers in the world but we could not guarantee that people will get the objective sex education that they need to get.</p></speech>

I want to send my solidarity to the Murphy family at this terrible time.  They probably cannot comprehend that Ashling will no longer be in their presence.  None of us this week should have known about Ashling Murphy.  In the past week, her life brought every village and town together like never before in a spontaneous call of solidarity in song, in deep shock but also terrible silence.  Many of us tried to understand why this has happened, why in daylight, such a darkness should befall a young woman going for a run.  To understand and comprehend, we must look at the deep levels of sexism that exist in society, the crass nature of objectifying women and then some men subjecting them to abhorrent abuse, both mental and physical.  The toxic nature of the promotion of sexual violence by pornographic websites is both corrosive and very dangerous.  It is extremely insidious, in particular for young men who watch the horrible content that is online.</p>  <p>  This must be a turning point and I think the Minister will make the call to make this the turning point.  Women must feel safe, not only in their home but in their workplace, their street and in their town.  They have a right to feel very safe but this can only happen by all of us challenging the terrible sexism that exists in modern society.  There is probably not one solution.  We can do everything on a personal level, but there is no getting away from the fact that there exists an epidemic of sexism via the Internet and other means that demeans women and then men act out terrible violence against women.  That must stop.</p></speech>

What kind of change?  We need programmes in our schools that educate against sexism, misogyny and male violence against women.  We need to teach consent.  We need schools to bring young people of all genders together.  We need an end to single-sex education.  We need an end to religious control of schools.  We need to separate church and State.  We need to end sexism in the legal system.  Victim-blaming and rape myths have no place in courtrooms.  A public inquiry needs to be organised on the 999 call scandal.</p>  <p>  We need funding for change.  We should triple the funds to women's refuges, domestic violence services and other front-line services.  We must massively increase funding for mental health services and build public housing on such a scale that a new home can be offered to every victim of violence currently living in a home in which they are trapped.  We must not let finance stand in the way.  The wealth of Ireland's nine billionaires has increased by 58% since the start of the pandemic to nearly &euro;50 billion.  A mere 3% tax on wealth above &euro;4 million would raise &euro;8 billion in new revenue for Irish society.  It is time to tax the rich.</p>  <p>  Last but not least: a cactus grows in the desert and a rose blooms in good soil.  What is the societal soil in which sexism and misogyny flourish?  I put it to the House that these weeds grow best in a society that is based on inequality and oppression.  If we want to have a serious debate about sexism, misogyny and gender-based violence, we must have a serious debate about the patriarchal system of capitalism.  I look forward to that debate in the weeks and months ahead.</p></speech>

I also want to extend my sincere condolences to the family of Michael Tormey, a father of three, who was shot dead in the garden of his home in Ballyfermot in the early hours of 9 January.  I commend the Garda on charging a suspect in that case today.</p>  <p>  Ashling's death has forced this country to have a long overdue conversation about gender-based violence.  As elected representatives in this D&aacute;il, we have a responsibility today to move beyond rhetoric and to take action against the causes of violence and to build a culture so that every girl and woman in this country will feel safe.  Ireland is not as safe as it once was.  If we are honest with ourselves, society has become harsher, more dangerous and more violent.  Figures obtained by my office show there has been a shocking increase in sexual violence in the past five years alone.  In 2016, the CSO recorded 2,520 sexual offences.  That increased to 3,340 by 2019.  Figures published by the CSO on sexual assaults show that more than one in five, or 20.8%, of those assaults were committed by boys under the age of 18.  It is startling what is happening to young boys and men in this country at the moment.  We cannot get away from the fact that there has been a significant change in their lives.</p>  <p>  Access to hardcore pornography by young children contributes to violence against women.  We witnessed the shocking murder of Ana Kri&eacute;gel in recent years.  That case highlighted the fact that access to violent pornography especially plays a role in the attitudes of young boys to women.  Over Christmas I was talking to a parent who told me that she had checked the family tablet and a ten-year old child in the family had been googling Santa Claus one minute and hardcore pornography the next minute.  This is what is happening in this country in 2022.  Countries such as Iceland, France and Italy are moving to ban the provision of hardcore porn to children.  We in Aont&uacute; tabled a Bill that would ban hardcore pornography from being provided to children.  Right now, that Bill languishes, and is awaiting Second Stage.  When it was before the D&aacute;il on First Stage, we had platitudes, shrugs and people saying it was shocking, but there has been no move at all by the Government to get to grips with this issue.</p>  <p>  I also wish to mention domestic violence.  A number of documents released to my office have shown that in the first four months of lockdown, the number of people contacting the Rape Crisis Network Ireland helpline increased by 15%, while appointments increased by 11%.  Barnardos also wrote to the Minister saying that it had examined its intensive family support to early years services.</p> <p>Its snapshot look at 1,250 cases presenting in one week in September 2020.  It found that, of these families, 44% were experiencing difficulties related to mental health, one in four were experiencing domestic violence in the home and 21% were experiencing issues with regard to addiction.  All of these issues are feeding into violence against women in the State.  Around the same time, Parentline contacted the Minister to say it was experiencing a large increase in the number of parents calling its helpline, with a massive 300% increase in requests for access to the non-violent resistance programme.  According to Women's Aid, 244 women have died violently in Ireland since 1996.  We know the number of female murder victims as a percentage of the annual total cases is on the rise and rose sharply last year.</p> <p> In my and the Minister&rsquo;s county, I have been calling for seven years for a rape crisis outreach clinic to be opened.  Right now, if a person is a victim of rape or sexual abuse in County Meath, they must travel to Dundalk, Tullamore or Dublin.  If they do not have transport, that service is not accessible to them.  We need to make sure we have investment in the locations where victims and survivors live so they can access those services.  I reach out to the Minister today to see if she can do anything to help with funding to provide for this in our county of Meath.</p> <p> I see that I have run out of time.  I will leave it at that and hand over to my colleague.</p></speech>

I attended the vigil for Ashling at the gates of Leinster House with many members of the Oireachtas last Friday.  I listened to the call by speakers for the attack on a young woman, just going for a jog on a bright winter afternoon in a rural town, to be a watershed moment in terms of all forms of violence against women.  I know the death of Ashling also revisited trauma on many women across this country, as well as on the families of women who died in tragic circumstances in the past.</p>  <p>  I welcome the comments by the Minister for Justice and the Government and the commitment to publish the national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence this March but the reality is that the issues raised over the last week will not be sorted out by any single strategy.  If Ashling&rsquo;s death is to be truly a watershed moment, then the measures that are taken must be far-reaching and touch every sinew of our society.</p>  <p>  So much of this comes down to attitude.  The change has to start with us, as men.  Men need to be role models and call out unacceptable attitudes and behaviour towards women, be it our neighbours, our friends or, indeed, our family, and whether it be misogynistic behaviour, online abuse or disrespectful and degrading comments, wherever it happens.  We should make a start right here in politics.  Recent research by Dr. Ian Richardson found that while there was no gender divide in the amount of online abuse aimed at Deputies, there was a significantly higher level of abuse messages focused on female councillors and Senators than on their male counterparts, and much of this abuse was generated by party supporters.</p>  <p>  We all know a mother, a daughter or a sister who has tolerated a certain level of fear when it comes to living in our society.  Some walk with their car keys in their hands, ready to be used as a defensive weapon.  Others change into their runners when they are going for a walk so they can run away.  It is time for this to stop.  We also need to review our environment and public spaces.  More than half of the women reported in a Transport Infrastructure Ireland study that they would not use public transport after dark due to safety concerns, with one third saying they had feelings of insecurity that prevented them from travelling at all on public transport.  One of the reasons given for female second level students not cycling to school is that the bike shed is in a secluded part of the school campus.  It even comes down to the design or redesign of our public spaces, building women's safety into our streets, our parks and our countryside.</p>  <p>  This is not just about developing a whole-of-government strategy.  What is needed is a whole-of-society approach to this challenge if Ashling's death is truly to be a watershed moment.  We will not be able to achieve real and meaningful progress without a radically new approach to tackling a problem that has become embedded in our society.  I believe that, as a first step, the Minister should host an open policy debate with a policy remit across the broadest spectrum of society on the safety of women, including contributions from those working across this wide-ranging sector, such as non-profit organisations and the Government, as well as international expertise.  Most importantly, we must hear the voices of those who plan their route in advance, who walk with the keys in their hand, who make that phone call so someone knows where they are while they are out for a walk or run, that is, every single woman and girl in this country must be given the opportunity to contribute.  Such a citizen's forum will not only raise awareness among all participants of the work and activities being undertaken at present but, more importantly, it will identify the gaps and opportunities for reimagining solutions to age-old problems.  It is only by taking a comprehensive approach right across society that we can take the first steps towards preventing another tragedy and the ongoing serious assault of women in Ireland.</p></speech>

The horrendous murder of Ashling has hit every man, woman and child in Ireland.  As a father of two daughters, they should, as should my son, walk the streets and lovely country walks in the safety that should exist in this country for all.  As a country, we need to do better.  We need to put a better system in place.  We need better safeguarding for victims of violence.  We need harsher prison sentences.  We all saw the case where a family - a father, a mother, two uncles and an aunt - were sentenced for their abhorrent crimes against their own children, nieces and nephews.  Their sentences seemed very light in comparison to the crimes that were committed.  In the words of the judge, the parents had engaged in the most profound breach of trust a human being can commit against their children so surely 15 years and nine years is not enough.</p>  <p>  We also need cases where children and women are at risk to be expedited through the courts.  We cannot have women and children living in fear.  A priority needs to be put in place for cases where women and children are at significant risk.  Last week, I was told of a case like this in west Cork where the case needs to be heard but it will not be heard until late 2023.  That is not good enough.  It is of the utmost importance that these cases are pushed up the ladder and dealt with as a priority.</p>  <p>  We also need to look at our legal system in a far deeper manner than we have been doing for many years now.  Many women come to my office every week who have legally agreed maintenance in a separation but, in many cases, the father of the child or children stops paying maintenance.  In its own right, this is another form of abuse; it is financial abuse.  The law should be the law.  If it is agreed to pay maintenance, it should be paid, or dealt with severely by the courts if not paid.  It should be dealt with in weeks, not, as in some cases, left to be dealt with in years, leaving mothers and children hungry at the end of every week due to some men's efforts to control women.  Maintenance must be paid at a set amount and there should be no stress for the parent.</p>  <p>  In my humble opinion in this discussion overall, we need to give out harsher sentences and make people realise that Ireland is not a place where people who are born here or come to live here can murder someone and get away with it.</p></speech>

The question so many women are asking is, &ldquo;How do I begin to feel safe again and how can other women in Ireland feel safe?&rdquo;  There has rightly been a chorus of calls for more action by the Government and the end of a culture of Departments saying it is not a matter for them.  I am talking about the Department of Justice, the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, the Department of Health and other Departments as to the responsibility they have for services for victims of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  I am calling for accountability.</p>  <p>  We have heard from campaigns for women&rsquo;s and children's safety in recent days and a joined-up approach to women&rsquo;s and children&rsquo;s safety is long overdue.  Over Christmas, I was speaking to a person who came home from Canada.  She was in a local village when a group of 11 to 13-year-olds heckled her on her way to the shop.  There were people on the street and not one person came to her aid.</p> <p>Is this the norm in Ireland and in our towns and villages?  Is it the norm that we see people being heckled, including women, children and elderly people, and nobody coming to their aid?</p> <p> I give my sincere sympathies to Ashling Murphy and her family.  There are no words I can say that will make it any better for the family but it is our job to make sure we do everything possible to bring this perpetrator to justice.  For the future safety of women in this country, we have to protect them and all people in society.</p> <p> What is the answer to Departments and commissions when last week Limerick City and County Council was fined &euro;110,000 for placing cameras in public places by a commission?  These are the same cameras we ask for to protect people in this country because of a lack of garda&iacute; and a lack of accountability from Government.</p></speech>

I want to commiserate with and convey my heartfelt sympathies to the family of Ashling Murphy, and to her boyfriend, friends, class and extended musical family all over the country.  It was such a terrible act and no words can describe it.  It was horrible, dreadful, terrible and unacceptable.  It is awful to think that thugs can carry out these kinds of depraved acts and kill a beautiful girl like this who had so many things going for her.  Then we hear of all the other things but you could not say they are lesser because it is unacceptable to treat women or girls badly.  We have to strengthen our laws on women and the protection of young girls and I am glad the Minister and the Government are of a mind to do that.  Youngsters must be educated on what they cannot and should not do and on what is right.  It must start at an early age.  I mention refuge accommodation for women.  Girls should be able to walk, run or do whatever they want to do wherever they want without being interfered with or assaulted, and certainly without being killed.</p></speech>

I want to offer my sincere sympathy to Ashling&rsquo;s family, including her parents, siblings, boyfriend, her extended network of friends and the lovely young students who she was teaching and doing such great work with.  They will miss their teacher and friend.  I am glad that Deputy McEntee is the Minister for Justice at this time and I really mean that.  What she has said in recent days has been helpful in difficult circumstances.  The family has not had time to even think about what parliamentarians are saying but in time the way the Minister has dealt with this awful problem in recent days will be appreciated by a lot of people.</p>  <p>  We all have a responsibility to try to do the right thing and the big question is what is the right thing?  What can we do to ensure that no one will have to lose their life?  There should be stronger deterrents.  Our courts, Judiciary and prison set-up should not be places of comfort and small sentences.  There should be deterrents in this country so that people would say you cannot commit a crime because the deterrent would be so strong.  We have to all try to work together.  No one in this House has the answers but we have to work collectively.  That includes the political parties and the individual politicians.  We must all use the brainpower we have to do the right thing.</p>  <p>  This has upset people to their core.  Every person should be entitled to go out for a walk and exercise in safety.  Equally, people should be able to go to bed at night and not necessarily be locking doors and setting alarms.  People should not have to be worried about where they park their cars either.  These types of things might seem minimal when we are talking about the enormity of what has happened to this family but it is all part of what has happened in society.  People behaving improperly seems to be accepted and that should not be the case.</p></speech>

I thank Sinn F&eacute;in for its practical motion and we could not but support it.  I welcome the fact that the Government is supporting it as well.  However, this has happened many times with many motions.  While acknowledging the Government&rsquo;s bona fides, I sometimes despair about words spoken in this House.  Ashling Murphy is dead.  Her name means "dream" or "vision".  The greatest tribute we could leave to her is to make the dream of zero tolerance of violence a reality.  That would be a real legacy and would give meaning to words.</p>  <p>  We have stood up here many times and I make no apology for doing that but one tires of it and one tires of the responses one receives over and over again.  When we asked where the audit on extra spaces for refuges was last year we were told it would be published shortly.  September and October passed and we are now nearly in February and the Government has given us no reason that was not published.</p>  <p>  The audit on how sexual and domestic violence are treated in the various Departments was published last year and I thank the Minister for that.  The audit shows that it was utterly fragmented.  We are waiting on the third strategy but the audit made some interesting points on the second strategy.  It stated: &ldquo;Oversight responsibility is held by a (largely inactive) Interdepartmental Senior Officials Group...which is nominally accountable to the Cabinet&rdquo;.  It made many other points about gaps in knowledge and so on and it points out that there is &ldquo;a disconnection between intended and actual action&rdquo;, which raises &ldquo;questions about what is blocking progress and how it can be addressed".  I have looked at all of this and I have pointed to the fantastic work of Women&rsquo;s Aid in 1997.  It made recommendations, particularly on prevention, working with perpetrators and so on.  Some 26 years later we are still talking about it.  We have had the various murders of women that have been mentioned from 1996 on and we are barely touching on it.</p>  <p>  I ask the Minister to forgive me for my cynicism on this issue.  She knows I have spoken on this continuously since February 2016 and that I have demanded, asked, appealed and almost begged for a review of the SAVI report.  Some 20 years later we are still talking about it although I know it is coming.  It is only after extraordinary pressure from this mixed D&aacute;il that this is happening.  When we talk about a seminal or turning moment, let us go back to Manuela Riedo, look at the programme the Rape Crisis Network Ireland carried out with the Manuela Riedo Foundation and let us integrate it in the schools.  If the Minister does nothing else after tonight, I ask her to read about the Manuela Riedo Foundation's collaboration with the Rape Crisis Network Ireland.  I have no time left to go through it but I will speak to the Minister about that any time.  That would be one practical thing to do.</p></speech>

Like Deputy Connolly, I want to continue on from my earlier intervention today.  In one of my first speeches in the House when Covid hit, I lobbied the then Minister for Social Protection, former Deputy Regina Doherty, and the then Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, to put in place emergency rent supplement for victims of domestic violence, women who were in abusive situations and prisoners in their own homes.  The issue was raised with me by Safe Ireland which, along with the National Women's Council and others, had already started working with the Department.</p>  <p>  As a brief aside, I want to mention the incredible, tireless work that is done by so many different organisations to support victims of domestic abuse.  Their advocacy, diligence and unswerving determination to be there for women and children in violent, abusive and coercive situations is second to none.  Their humanity and empathy for those suffering domestic violence is something special to see and know but they are stretched way beyond what is reasonable.  An essential part of any ongoing strategy to stamp out domestic violence must include proper resourcing of and support for those organisations that stood in the gap with abused women and children when Covid raged.</p>  <p>  To go back to the issue of the emergency rent supplement, that was put in place because people worked together and because we had an emergency situation, namely, Covid.  The situation has escalated and we need to put in place the measures called for in this motion with the same speed, determination and co-operation as was evident in putting place the emergency rent supplement.  When we do that, we can hold our heads up.</p>  <p>  There are many other issues I would like to raise but I must return to a matter I have raised on at least four occasions in this House, which is the fact there is no dedicated refuge for victims of domestic violence in Sligo-Leitrim.  The Domestic Violence Advocacy Service, DVAS, in Sligo-Leitrim and west Cavan continues to advocate, if not beg, for a dedicated emergency domestic violence refuge for victims of abuse.  In 2020, DVAS worked with 226 victims of domestic abuse in Sligo-Leitrim and west Cavan.  All it has is three apartments that serve as temporary accommodation but which are totally unsuitable for those at real risk of trauma, injury or fatality and those who need 24-hour supported emergency services.</p>  <p>  I have to finish now although there is so much more I would like to say.  The Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, and the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, committed to moving the issue of a refuge for Sligo-Leitrim forward and I ask the Minister for Justice to give a commitment on that this evening.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-01-19a.331" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1547" speakername="Thomas Pringle" time="22:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022011900057#EEE00200"><p>I will start by extending my sympathy to the family of Ashling Murphy on her tragic murder and to the community of Tullamore and surrounding areas.  Sadly, we could have had this debate or discussion on any number of occasions in any year that I have been a Member of the D&aacute;il about any number of the many women who have been killed in this country.  That says a lot about the situation of women.  Some people will say we have not had this discussion because there are not enough women Members of this House.  However, there are enough members of the group of perpetrators of violence against women to whom we can talk, who need to listen to women, stand with them and bring about the change that is required.  It is by talking to men and influencing men that we can bring change, and the men who are Members of this House can lead that change.</p>  <p>  It goes without saying and yet it has to be said that pepper spray, knives or even guns will not prevent violence against women.  It will just ensure more women die in violent attacks.  As a man, I need to be reminded of the difficulties women have and how we as men do not really understand the situation.  Recently, I was talking to a woman in Donegal about the huge amount of abuse she suffered during a political campaign in the county.  She told me how men shouted abuse at her and drove around roundabouts twice just so that they could shout more abuse at her.  I was shocked and told her that this was not my experience.  She replied, "Of course it wasn't; you're a six foot, three inch man so you would not have that experience."  That is the reality of the situation.</p>  <p>  The Rape Crisis Network sent a very worthwhile document to Members yesterday outlining what needs to be done and not once does it mention legislation, which is welcome.  The danger is this House, in wanting to be seen to respond to the situation, will see the passing of legislation as a sufficient response.  That may be necessary but I do not think so.  There is a lot that can be done before we legislate.  In this country we are great at proposing legislation but terrible at implementing it.  What we need is implementation rather than the passing of even more legislation.  The fact rape crisis centres receive funding of &euro;25 million annually while the horse and greyhound industry receives funding of approximately &euro;70 million shows where the priorities of the system lie.  As a country and as a Legislature, we need to step up to the mark.  The Government must prioritise the funding of rape crisis services.  Nobody in this House would oppose that.  As I said earlier, when you consider we are only at 29% of the Istanbul Convention targets for the provision of women's refuges, you can see where the priorities of the Government lie.</p>  <p>  Last year the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, said in the D&aacute;il that the Government chose to provide the current number of women's refuge places because community-based organisations and outreach supports are in place alongside refuges.  That hardly deserves to be commented on, but if that is the height of our ambition for women, we have a long way to go.</p></speech>

The entire country is behind the Murphy family as they face this unimaginable grief.  I attended very poignant candle-lit vigils in Dungarvan and Portlaw last week.  We, like many others around the country, stood in silence but our silence was deafening amid a collective understanding that this terrible incident has affected us all so deeply - a beautiful life lost.  People are saddened and sickened by the loss of such a young and promising life, a girl who, by all accounts, gave so much to her friends, her family, her students and her community.</p>  <p>  I am encouraged by the Taoiseach's words this afternoon and by the poignant statements made by the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, in recent days.  The Minister has been working on a national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence that will be completed in early March.  I am heartened that the Minister will, following the publication of that report, lead the policy area on these matters and be responsible for the provision of the services required.  Oversight of the delivery of all aspects of the strategy and existing policies will be undertaken at the highest level of Cabinet and by the Department of An Taoiseach directly.</p>  <p>  As a wider society we must not and cannot accept a situation in which fear, harassment and violence towards women is normalised to any degree.  We cannot be bystanders.  We must call out all misogyny, intimidation and violence against women by men when we witness it.  Men can make a huge difference in this process through leading by example, showing our younger boys and men that such behaviours are no longer acceptable and need to be replaced by an enhanced level of respect for women.  Women should not have to be fearful when going for a walk or a run.  Women should not be in fear for their safety when walking home from work on dark winter evenings or from social outings at night with friends or family.  If this is consistently the case and women are living in fear, it reflects very poorly on where we are right now as a society and a country and we must reflect deeply on this.  It simply should not be the case that the women of this country do not feel safe in their own communities.</p>  <p>  Given the outpouring of support and grief in the past week, it is clear we can no longer take such a presumption for granted any more.  We have been shocked and frightened as a national community, terrified by the thought this could have been any of our own, any woman among us: a mother, a sister, a daughter, a wife, a partner or a friend.  We need to remind ourselves of these women in our lives, so close to our hearts, as we strive for the monumental shift in culture that is required within our society.</p> <p>It is especially important to remember that more than 240 women have been violently killed in Ireland in the past 25 years.  Everyone has a contribution to make to this movement, which needs to start from the ground up and requires a whole-of-society response.  The men in our society need to be more active and understanding of the issues that face women each and every day.  Having discussed this tragedy with many men in recent days, I believe there is an encouraging willingness, by and large, to be part of the solution and an instructive and collaborative way.  This is a positive starting point, but we have an awful lot to do if we are to see the mass culture shift that is obviously required to better all facets of our society for women. <br/><br/>On a personal note, it is encouraging to see so many strong women of our Parliament speak so passionately about the issues in the House tonight and this afternoon, in tribute to Ashling Murphy.  It is not easy to be a woman in politics at times, but I am certain that my female colleagues in both Houses will be more determined than ever to fight for the cultural and behavioural changes that are so desperately needed on behalf of Ashling and all women throughout the country.  <br/><br/>I want to conclude with a text message that I received this morning at 8:56 a.m. when I was leaving my house to travel to Dublin.  I know what it is not all men but it is all women.  The message stated:</p><blockquote>	I'd say you're starting to sweat a little, no? Wait 'til we the people drag you out onto the street and you're crying out for help but there's nobody coming. Hahaha. You know what's coming too.  </blockquote> <p>We have a long way to go. </p></speech>

Less than two weeks into the new year we are reminded of this yet again with the senseless murder of Ashling Murphy, a young school teacher barely starting out in life.  I extend my profound sympathy to Ashling&rsquo;s family, friends and community.</p>  <p>    Everyone in this Chamber shares a common goal.  We want to end the menace of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence and make Ireland a safe place for all.  To achieve this we must work in partnership and with the NGO sector, which has been working tirelessly on the front line to make women and children safe from domestic, sexual and gender-based violence .</p>  <p>  The Government and the whole of society now needs to listen, believe and support all victims of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence but particularly women and girls who are disproportionately experiencing this violence.  Men, all men, must step up to the challenge.  The problem of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence can no longer be one for which women and girls must carry the burden.  We as men must recognise our role to play by having the hard conversations by calling out instances of misogyny and casual sexism, which are often played down as a bit of a laugh.  They are not, and have never been, funny for women.  Let us as men take responsibility for changing the caustic atmosphere that our wives, girlfriends, mothers and daughters experience and tell us about when we are listening.  We must now all work together to achieve a shared simple goal of zero tolerance of violence against women and abuse.  </p>  <p>  As the Minister, Deputy McEntee, previously highlighted we will launch the third national strategy of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence in March.  There have been extensive consultations across the Government to ensure that we really do articulate and then deliver an ambitious whole-of-government response.  The reforms that we set out in the third strategy will mean that victims of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence will be fully supported within the criminal justice system and their abusers punished.  They, like all victims of crime will know that our system is there to serve them when they are at their most vulnerable.  The new strategy will address head-on and then unconditional terms the whole unacceptable behaviour by some men in our society, and the enabling of others who may see casual misogyny as banter or having a laugh.  This strategy will be backed by a clear, accessible, measurable implementation plan which will be fully resourced and backed by the strength and the weight of the whole of the Government. </p>  <p>    As the Taoiseach and the Minister have announced, we are developing a plan to bring policy responsibility for domestic, sexual and gender-based violence and the delivery of domestic violence services together under the Department of Justice.  Along with the oversight of a new Cabinet committee, the new arrangements to be announced will ensure that the actions set out in the new national strategy are delivered and implemented.  </p>  <p>      The Minister has shown real leadership on this issue.  Once responsibility for both policy and service delivery are brought together under her remit, we will, as a Government, deliver on sustained and radical changes that are needed.  Funding and resources will not be lacking in this endeavour, as the Taoiseach has promised.</p>  <p>  To continue what the Minister outlined about our Department's efforts to tackle domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, I would also highlight the Covid-19 domestic abuse response plan.  Our Department along with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, identified the need for specific actions to protect victims and potential victims of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  The approach taken was a collaborative one to ensure that all aspects of the problem was addressed and that the well-being of the public was kept clearly at the forefront of all efforts.  Through Operation Whistle, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na adopted a proactive approach contacting former victims of domestic abuse to check on their safety and well-being.  Additional funding was made available to NGO services to adapt their services to ensure continued availability.  Our Department in conjunction with front-line services developed and ran a public awareness campaign that was particularly effective, the Still Here campaign, which is ongoing.  The Department is also committed to launching a consent website and launching a consent-awareness raising campaign through working with the Department of Further and Higher Education, Innovation and Science and the National University of Ireland, Galway.  The information hub went live last year and further elements will be rolled out early in 2022 and a review of the projects happening in July.  </p>  <p>  Awareness raising of victim rights and the new website continues on social media.   Funding has been secured to expand awareness-raising activities of victims&rsquo; rights in 2022. </p>  <p>  The Government does not oppose the motion.  There are elements of the text that we would debate and that could be improved but today is not a day for the House to divide on a motion where the spirit of the motion, which we all support, is on zero tolerance on violence against women.</p></speech>

I also offer my condolences of the families and friends of any woman who has lost her life at the hands of a man.  As others have said, 244 women have died violently since 1996.</p>  <p>  The death of Ashling Murphy has brought to the fore the everyday sexism, violence, harassment and misogyny that women must endure.  It is systemic across society.  While it is not all men, it is almost always men.  To the men who contacted me and got defensive and feel they are being portrayed a bad light, I suggest they look at themselves and cop on.  Instead of becoming defensive, it would serve them better to become a little more reflective and reflect on how their everyday behaviour as a man can effect women.  They should reflect on how they can change because, after all, it is men's behaviours that need to change, not women's.  As a father to two girls, as a son, as a brother and as a basic human being, the senseless death of Ashling Murphy has shaken me to the core.  It is incumbent on all men to call out the everyday sexism, violence, harassment and misogyny that women must endure and to be the voice that says, "Enough is enough".  </p>  <p>  I do not want to live in a society that treats 50% of its population as less worthy just because of its gender.  We, as legislators and public representatives, must now work together across all parties and none to put in place measures that will lead to the systemic changes that are needed.  Women's Aid support workers heard more than 30,000 disclosures of domestic violence including coercive control in 2020.  We all heard the evidence that incidents of domestic abuse increased during lockdown simply because men were at home.  I thank Saoirse women's refuge in Tallaght for all the assistance it has given to women and children during these difficult times.  A week does not seem to go by that I do not refer somebody to its service.  Societal change will not happen overnight.  In the meantime, we need to support services such as Saoirse women's refuge and all refuges across the country so at least women will have a safe place to go.</p></speech>

The tragedy of her murder is compounded by the lost potential of this gifted and popular teacher and musician.  My heart goes out to her grieving parents, boyfriend, family and friends.  My own constituency experienced two tragedies in the last year with the murders of Jennie Poole and Fabiole Camara De Campos.  The community of Finglas was shaken by the extremely violent deaths of these two young women.  Just like the community response to the murder of Ashling Murphy, the people of Finglas came out to express their grief and support for the families of the murdered women.</p>  <p>  Women from every ethnic, cultural and social background experience domestic violence.  It can come in many forms and is not always physical.  Psychological abuse can be as harmful as physical abuse, especially if a woman lives under the constant threat of violence.  It can also take the form of financial abuse.  However, the most common form of gender-based violence is domestic violence.  It is an indictment of our society that domestic abuse can remain a hidden crime as many women are reluctant to report it.  Substance abuse and the excessive consumption of alcohol is also linked to domestic violence.  The lockdowns and restrictions have almost certainly led to increased instances of domestic violence.  It is a horrific scenario where a woman in an abusive relationship is trapped with the perpetrator of the violence and abuse during lockdowns.  There is an onus on men to confront and challenge men's violence against women, in particular the casual, everyday harassment of women.  What we are teaching about such issues is not working and needs to change.  There are supports available for women from groups such as SAFE Ireland, Women's Aid, rape crisis centres and the Rape Crisis Network.  However, it is sad to say that these supports are only necessary because violence against women continues and will continue until men, the predominant perpetrators of such acts of violence, address their behaviour, and society addresses the ingrained prejudice against women so prevalent in everyday life.</p></speech>

This day last week, all of us, as an entire nation, were brought to a stop.  A young woman with her whole life in front of her, with hopes and with dreams, had her life stolen from her in broad daylight along a very popular walking route.  A popular walking route in broad daylight was a fairly safe choice to make, you would think.  Ashling Murphy; another woman killed by a man.  As has been said repeatedly in this House, and cannot be said enough, 244 women have been violently murdered in Ireland since 1996.  These were women who were loved, women who were part of families and part of communities and women whose children had to grow up without them.  Their lives mattered yet these women, year after year, were murdered and it is still happening.  That tells us everything done up to now has not worked.  It is not enough just to remember these women, we must instead act and act right now.</p>  <p>  Much has been put forward here this evening, in the form of reports, policy, data and legislation.  All of it is important but moving forward we must have accountability for every single action we now put forward on tackling gender-based violence.  Every month we should have statements in this House outlining the progress being made to achieve zero tolerance of violence against women.  We need to show progress, see progress and see the practical steps that are being taken.  The public needs to see that too and we must start now.</p>  <p>  In my two short years of being a TD, I have come across a number of instances of violence against women that have highlighted many issues to me.  In two instances, they showed me the reality faced by women who come forward; the women who actually seek help and seek a way out of violence at the hands of a man in their lives.  These were domestic violence situations that showed me first-hand the very difficulty women face in fleeing the family home and seeking alternative accommodation.  First, there is no refuge because Roscommon is one of nine counties with no refuge spaces for women.  In all of Roscommon, Galway and Mayo there are just 14 refuge spaces for women and children.  The three counties have a population of over 228,000 women.  Based on the Istanbul Convention, Roscommon Safe Link has told us there should be 46 spaces for Mayo, Roscommon and Galway and as I said there are just 14.  In many situations of domestic violence, there is not an opportunity to ring your local TD, maybe to go and meet them or to ring others and reach out.  There may be just one chance for a woman to reach out.  That is why it is so vital those supports and services are there and they need to be there in an instant.  If they are not there, then we have failed.  I read through what SAFE Ireland sent us, namely, the 808 requests for refuge it referenced receiving between September and December 2020 that it could not meet because there was no space.  I wonder where these 808 people are now.  I cannot imagine what it must be like to be in a domestic violence situation where you have no family, no refuge and you are trying to secure private rented accommodation, for we know the difficulties of that in itself.  I welcome the permanent extension of rent supplement for survivors of domestic abuse.  It is important, welcome and needed but we need to do so much more.  I was also contacted by a woman last year whose case of rape and sexual abuse went to trial.  However, once the trial was over, all State support vanished.  Those are her words.  She told me that while the man convicted and sent to prison could access support, a care plan and psychological support she could access nothing.  She was told of an 18-month waiting list for post-trauma psychological support.</p>  <p>  They were just two women I have engaged with in the last year alone.  There are so many more.  There are so many more women suffering, so many women living in fear and too many women whose lives were cut short and too many times the State has come up short.  To conclude, I hope we can work together.  I hope that as women we in particular can work together to make the changes that are so desperately needed and lead the way on this once and for all.</p></speech>

As of today, Covid-19 has claimed 5.5 million people worldwide.  It is an incredible statistic.  Nearer to home, 150,000 people in Britain have died of Covid-19.  On our island, 10,000 people have died, thus far, as a result of the pandemic.  It has taken a terrible toll on those people, their families and society as a whole.  There is hope; without it there will be despair.  The pandemic continues to separate us in some ways, but also unites us and brings us together in other good ways.</p> <p> This virus is universal and indiscriminate.  Through science, we have found a vaccine that at least stops the ravages of this terrible disease and saves lives but, at the same time, we have a contradiction.  While we have a vaccine, many people in this world cannot get access to it.  Almost 40% of the world's population have not got a single vaccine.  Even health workers in the developing world have not got access to this vaccine.  It is quite extraordinary that in the circumstance of a world emergency countries cannot get access to vaccines because pharmaceutical companies have control over supply and intellectual property rights.  Many people will ask if this is not the time to waive intellectual property rights, when is it?</p> <p> As I said, the statistics are extraordinary.  Even this week, Oxfam International stated: "Vaccines were meant to end ... [the] pandemic, yet rich ... [countries] allowed pharma billionaires...to cut off the supply to billions of people".  Many people, through NGOs, religious organisations and civic organisations, are calling for a waiver to end the embargo on intellectual property rights to allow countries to make these vaccines.  The argument is that countries in the developing world cannot make these vaccines, but they have the infrastructure in India and Africa.  Factories where these vaccines can be mass produced are ready to go, but big pharma is not allowing that to happen and is allowing people to get the disease and die.</p> <p> I do not know anybody who can stand over that.  I do not think anybody in this Chamber could stand over it with a serious face, but that is the reality.  Last December, a motion was passed in the Seanad calling on the Government to publicly call on the European Commission to support the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, TRIPS, waiver.  The European Commission has failed to do so, even though two countries who are members of it, Italy and Portugal, have stated that they support the TRIPS waiver.  I call on the Minister of State to use his influence, as a member of the Government and a Deputy who is part of the Cabinet and so forth, to push for a TRIPS waiver via the European Commission so people can get access to this vaccine.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-01-19a.346" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1505" speakername="Damien English" time="22:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022011900060#HHH00200"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising this debate and important discussion.  The figures he outlined, and the loss of life we have seen all over the world, reminds us all just how serious Covid-19 is and of the impact it has had on many people's lives, including those who have lost their lives, their families and many of those who have been left very ill.  I again reiterate the importance of all of us all over the world working together, which is what we are trying to achieve through the WTO talks.  More than 164 countries are working together and making decisions together.  It is important that Ireland is in the middle of that and leading it.  The Irish people would expect us to do that.</p><p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  I am conscious that he had it down for discussion at a similar time as the Seanad debate in December, but it is important that we get a chance to look back over it.  It refers to Ireland's and the EU's position at those talks, which have not yet happened.  This scheduled meeting was postponed because of the Omicron variant but, hopefully, it will happen soon.  There have been ongoing meetings and discussions over the past few months, but we also need to have those formal talks. </p><p>It is important to point out that TRIPS is an international legal agreement between all the member nations of the World Trade Organization, WTO.  Therefore, any proposal for a potential variation or waiver of the current intellectual property, IP, protections under the TRIPS Agreement is for negotiation at the WTO, where Ireland is one of 164 members.  It is important that we are there and we use our influence through the EU Commission; we speak together with it.</p><p>As the Deputy is aware, the T&aacute;naiste, who is the lead Minister in our Department, is on the record as saying very clearly that:</p> <blockquote> 	The Government is a very strong supporter of vaccine equity in the world.  Morally we need to make sure the world is vaccinated.   </blockquote>  <p>It is something we are very committed to as a country because it represents the views of our people.  That is why we did not oppose the motion in the Seanad.  I think everyone in this Chamber today would support this view, as was the case when I addressed this matter in the Seanad in December.  I wish to reiterate what I said then; Ireland will continue to do all we can to help make sure countries worldwide have access to Covid vaccines for their people.  We will do so as universal and equitable access to vaccines is crucial in the global fight against Covid-19.</p><p><font color="#4F4F4F"> </font>Ireland will continue to engage with the European Commission, and other member states, on the EU position for the WTO discussions regarding how the flexibilities within the TRIPS Agreement can contribute towards increasing the manufacturing capacity and the equitable access to vaccines around the world.  The EU continues to be committed to an open and comprehensive dialogue with all WTO members to explore how the multilateral rules-based trading system can best support universal and equitable access to Covid-19 vaccines and treatments.  This is why the EU proposed an alternative to the TRIPS waiver proposal.  That proposal was targeted and pragmatic and aims at ensuring that governments can resort to compulsory licences, including to export to countries with no or limited manufacturing capacities, in the most effective manner and adapted to the circumstances of a pandemic.  The EU will also consider any other pragmatic proposal for a TRIPS waiver, should a further proposal be submitted.  Again, it is something we are very committed to working through.</p><p>The Government has an open mind on the alternative suggestion of a TRIPS waiver.  The T&aacute;naiste recently met the United States trade representative, Katherine Tai, and made it very clear that we would happily look at a proposal, if one lands, and discuss that with her.  It has not yet been formally put forward.  Those talks have not formalised yet, but hopefully it will happen soon.  The EU has repeatedly made clear that it sees intellectual property as being part of the solution to the pandemic and not the problem, but it is an issue.  There are IP regimes in every country and it is a matter our Department has had a role in over many years.  Due to that IP regime, we have seen billions invested in many drug treatments and solutions all over the world, in addition to Covid-19 treatments.  A lot of taxpayers' money in many countries, amounting to billions, has been put forward in the past couple of years to build on that previous research to develop the drugs that are now helping us to deal with Covid.  It is important that we get that balance right.</p><p>Consideration of this matter must balance the need to encourage and incentivise industry to continue to carry out research, to innovate and to develop new medicines and medicinal products during this public health crisis.  Intellectual property protections are a crucial incentive for the research and development of new vaccines, modified vaccines adapted to new variants and new medicines and treatments for Covid-19, as well as investment in production capacity.  Intellectual property, in our view, continues to play an important role as an enabler that contributes to our overall objective of ramping up production of Covid-19 vaccines and medicines.  Again, therefore, any solution must balance industry&rsquo;s research and innovation costs, and the importance of maintaining a workable IP regime, with the importance of ensuring fair, equitable access to medicines and medicinal products during this public health crisis.  We remain very much committed to achieving that through dialogue with the European Commission and the WTO talks.</p></speech>

It runs into tens of billions at this stage.  At the crux of this argument, because we can talk about and almost intellectualise why companies have to have property rights to what they create, we are talking about an emergency that the world has not seen for the past 75 years.  We are talking about people dying unnecessarily while big pharma creates huge amounts of money and profits for its shareholders.</p>  <p>  It is a binary choice.  On the one hand, do we protect big pharma and its intellectual product?</p> <p>Is it, on the other hand, to protect the vulnerable, the poor and people who cannot access vaccines?  That is the binary choice.  When it comes down to it, there are governments in rich countries that do not care about poor people and never have.  That is the nature of capitalism, which at its heart has to cannibalise, consume and profit from a product.  That is what it is doing with vaccines.  Rationally, one would think this vaccine would be available to everybody and that everybody in this world would have got at least one.  However, 40% of the world has not got any.  How anybody logically can stand and defend that, I find very hard to take.</p></speech>

The Irish response to the pandemic has been rooted in our commitment to the principle of universal and equitable access to vaccines and treatments.  We will continue to use our influence across the world on that.  It is right and fair to say, and I acknowledged it in my opening comments, that billions have been invested from the public purse by countries and governments all over the world on behalf of their taxpayers.  That, in conjunction with many billions spent before that on developing those drugs, has enabled us to be in our current position with regard to vaccines and a number of treatments.  It is about how we utilise that wisely to get it to those who need it in all developing countries and situations where there is poverty, as well as continuing to be able to invest in treatments and drugs for future emergencies.  We have to get that right.  We know it is important to make sure there is equitable access to those vaccines around the world.</p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to engage with the European Commission and other member states on the EU position for the WTO negotiations and discussions on how the flexibilities within the TRIPS agreement can contribute to increasing manufacturing capacity and equitable access to vaccines around the world.  Consideration of this matter must balance industry&rsquo;s research and innovation costs and the importance of maintaining a workable IP regime with the importance of ensuring fair, equitable access to medicines and medicinal products during this public health crisis.  That balance is key to protecting future investment from all of us - taxpayers, private, etc.  We will get the best bang for our buck by putting the two together.</p>  <p>  We recognise and are clear in the Government that global access to vaccination is essential to curbing the spread and future mutations of the Covid-19 virus.  Ensuring developing countries have access to vaccines is a complex endeavour involving a number of policy and operational areas, such as manufacturing, supply, distribution, transport, storage, capacity to manage vaccination campaigns and the uptake of vaccines by citizens in the countries concerned.</p>  <p> While the production of Covid-19 vaccines has substantially increased globally, fair distribution and diversifying production remain major objectives and ones we have to achieve.  I think we can agree on that.  The focus is shifting from vaccine production to administering vaccines and how strengthening health systems and preparedness is pivotal to the achievement of the 70% vaccination target.</p>  <p>  We have to come at this from a range of areas but we are committed to the agenda of making sure there is fair and equitable access to vaccines across the world.  That is something the Government will continue to do on behalf of the Irish people.</p></speech>

Currently, there are three schemes available.  There is the better energy warmer homes scheme, which is a free scheme that applies to people who qualify under a range of social welfare headings.  It has been in place since 2009 but has changed over that time.  In 2009, attic insulation and cavity walls were the main ones that applied.  In 2018, that was extended to include internal and external wall insulation and replacement of windows from single to double glazing.  The problem is that if you applied at any time from 2009 on, let us say 2010, and qualified under the scheme, you would not have got the double-glazed windows.  However, your neighbour could apply today and qualify for the replacement windows as well as the internal and external wall insulation.  That is an anomalous system and needs to be changed.  We must ensure people can apply under the better energy warmer homes scheme more than once.</p>  <p>  There are two other sister schemes, which are grant-based.  They are the better energy homes scheme and the one-stop shop scheme.  In those cases, you get a grant and can apply on a number of occasions on the basis you have not claimed under a certain heading.  The better energy homes scheme is where you get the contract yourself, whereas under the one-stop shop scheme, the State will arrange for the contractor.  Under that scheme, you can apply for ventilation as well.  Under both of those schemes, you can get solar panels, which are not available under the better energy warmer homes scheme, which is the free scheme and which is also taking up to 18 to 24 months.</p>  <p>  I ask for a commitment that, under the new national retrofit scheme to be announced shortly, the better energy warmer home scheme, which is a free scheme for people on social welfare in specific areas, would allow them to apply more than once and be extended to include solar panels and ventilation, which is very important with Covid.  The waiting time at the moment is 18 to 24 months.  There should be consistency between schemes.  This scheme has evolved over time and there is an anomaly where someone who applied at any time up to 2018 was not eligible for internal or external cavity walls for insulation and did not qualify for replacement windows.  That is an issue in terms of combating fuel poverty, dealing with climate change and emissions reduction.  We must ensure this scheme is amended.  I seek a commitment that will happen.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-01-19a.352" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1505" speakername="Damien English" time="22:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022011900061#JJJ00400"><p>I thank Deputy O&rsquo;Donnell for raising this important issue.  It is important and timely because the new scheme is under consideration and will be brought to the House quite soon.  The Minister, Deputy Ryan, was unable to make the debate, but I will feed in the comments and issues the Deputy has raised because he is right on waiting times, giving greater access to the scheme, reforming the scheme, dealing with ventilation and solar panels and many other issues.  This scheme is targeted with a significant amount of money around making our homes safer, warmer, healthier places to live in, and more efficient to run to play their part in relation to emissions and to make it more affordable for people to live in these homes.  Those are the aims of the scheme and it will be updated and brought by the Minister to the House soon.  I will feed in the Deputy's comments to make sure they are heard.</p>  <p>  The programme for Government and the climate action plan have set ambitious targets to retrofit 500,000 homes to a building energy rating of B2 and install 400,000 heat pumps in existing buildings over the next number of years.  These targets represent a significant increase in both the volume and depth of retrofit activity in Ireland.  The recently published national retrofit plan sets out how we will achieve these targets and identifies an unprecedented &euro;8 billion to support homeowners to retrofit their homes out to 2030.</p>  <p>  The better energy warmer homes scheme delivers a range of energy efficiency measures free of charge to low-income households vulnerable to energy poverty.  It is administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI.  Since the start of the scheme, more than 143,000 homes have received free upgrades.  In 2021, the average cost of the energy efficiency measures provided per household was &euro;17,100.  Activity under this scheme and the associated expenditure were significantly impacted in 2020 and 2021 by the Covid pandemic.</p>  <p>  The Deputy raised the issue of the 18-month timeline, which is longer in some cases.  That is not acceptable and we want to get back on track with that.  It has been hit by Covid, which has affected the number of houses that could be reached.</p>  <p>  The budget 2022 allocation for energy poverty schemes, including the better energy warmer homes scheme, is &euro;109 million.</p> <p>The SEAI&rsquo;s business plan for 2022 is currently being examined by the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.</p> <p> The eligibility criteria for the scheme were selected because they represented the view of the Department at the time on those areas where the limited resources available to the scheme could have the greatest impact.  The Deputy was right to say they need to be looked at again.  The criteria are kept under ongoing review with the Department of Social Protection to ensure they are consistent with and complementary to the other income support schemes offered by that Department. </p> <p> There are currently just over 7,000 homes awaiting works on the better energy warmer homes scheme work programme.  This includes homes that are currently undergoing works, homes that have been allocated to contractors for works, homes that have completed an initial home survey and are awaiting allocation to a contractor and homes that are awaiting an initial survey.</p> <p> Until 2018, as the Deputy referenced, the scheme predominantly focused on delivering shallow measures, such as attic or cavity wall insulation.  In many cases, where the walls were not cavity walls, only the attic was insulated.  With the expansion of the scheme in 2018, internal and external wall insulation were introduced, which meant that solid wall properties could now receive insulation under the scheme.  However, in line with the current one home, one visit rule, which the Deputy referenced, where a home has already received any works, it cannot receive further works under the scheme.  This rule was introduced to help to manage demand for the scheme and ensure homes that had not previously benefitted from the scheme were prioritised.  With the scheme expansion, many homeowners who only received attic insulation previously but who would, under current scheme rules, qualify for wall insulation began contesting the one home, one visit rule.   The Department of Environment, Climate and Communications committed to review the rule and, in line with the Deputy's request, will assess the possibility of allowing second visits to homeowners.  That is important and essential.  Recommendations on the implementation of changes to the scheme to better target those most in need will be finalised shortly and brought to the House by the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan.</p> <p> The provisions of the new national home retrofit scheme are currently being finalised.  The new scheme will focus on the delivery of B2 retrofits with heat pumps as well as the development and expansion of the one-stop shop and retrofit market.  That will reflect the request the Deputy has put forward today.  I will make sure that the points the Deputy has made will be brought to the attention of the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, tomorrow.</p></speech>

The one home, one visit rule needs to be amended.  There needs to be consistency across all schemes in terms of what is covered and how the schemes are administered.  Through the better energy warmer homes scheme, which is a grant scheme, and the one-stop shop scheme, everyone, no matter who they are, should be able to access the same range of measures.  That needs to happen.</p>  <p>  The grants will have to be increased for the new retrofit scheme that is going to be announced.  They will have to be accessible so that people from every walk of life, including people dealing with fuel poverty and those on social welfare, can access the entire range of measures.  We cannot have a situation where people who claimed under a scheme prior to 2018 are omitted and are left with single-glazed windows.  That needs to be changed to double-glazing, at a minimum.  I look forward to that review taking place.  </p>  <p>  I also look forward to the announcement of the new retrofit scheme that will include multiple visits to households and is based on ensuring that all schemes are consistent, including the better energy warmer homes scheme.  I also hope that grants will be extended and other forms of supports are available to ensure that all families in houses can avail of the retrofit programme.  I also hope that the waiting times are brought down.</p></speech>

He has covered most of the issues that need to be addressed through the new schemes that are being brought forward.  I have listened with interest to the points raised by the Deputy.  I will make sure they are brought to the attention of the Minister and his team in the Department who are working on these matters.</p>  <p>  As I mentioned earlier, the new national residential retrofit plan, published on 4 November as part of the Climate Action Plan 2021, sets out how we will achieve ambitious targets to retrofit 500,000 homes to a building energy rating of B2 and to install over 400,000 heat pumps in existing buildings over the next number of years.  It identifies an unprecedented &euro;8 billion to support homeowners to retrofit their homes to 2030.  We must make sure those schemes are reformed correctly to make use of that money and ensure it reaches the right people, those who need assistance, as the Deputy has identified.  The plan sets out measures designed to address barriers to retrofitting in the key areas of driving demand and activity; financing and funding; and supply chain, skills and standards.  It also sets out measures to support those least able to afford to retrofit to participate.  Those include the people the Deputy is representing tonight and those he has mentioned in his questions.  They include people in low-income households and in the rental sector.  It is important to point that out.</p>  <p>  The annual allocations set out in the plan totalling &euro;8 billion will primarily be used to fund the expansion and enhancement of the SEAI residential and community retrofit schemes, including the warmer homes scheme, and their reformation, as well as other initiatives to support retrofitting.  The consistent and significant increase in the annual allocations will help the sector to grow in a sustainable way over the years to come.</p>  <p>  Funding for the SEAI's free energy poverty retrofit schemes has increased dramatically in recent years and we want to build on that.  It increased from &euro;15 million in 2015 to &euro;109 million in 2021.  This shows the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the issue and to reflect the needs the Deputy has highlighted.  The budget 2022 allocation for energy poverty schemes, including the better energy warmer homes scheme, is &euro;109 million.  As I said earlier, the SEAI&rsquo;s business plan for 2022 is currently being examined by the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications and will be announced soon.</p>  <p>  The average value of the energy-efficiency measures provided per household under the better energy warmer homes scheme has also increased very significantly, year on year, from approximately &euro;3,000 per home in 2018 to more than &euro;17,000 in 2021.  We recognise that it will probably cost more than that for the full retrofit scheme that is now being recommended.  The deepening of retrofits provided does not mean that each home takes longer to deliver and it should not mean that.  We want to bring those waiting times back down.  I am confident that the actions I have outlined will increase output, address the Covid-related delays and have the effect of significantly decreasing average wait times over the coming year.  We need to make sure we can get the one home, one visit rule changed.</p></speech>

This is a matter we have spoken about privately on a number of occasions.  I acknowledge that she has always been constructive in those discussions and in her deliberations with me.  I always appreciate her time.</p>  <p>  At the outset, I will acknowledge that there have been a number of improvements in the whole area of special education over the past few years.  We have seen record investment in special education.  I think that investment now accounts for over 20% of the education budget as a whole, amounting to approximately &euro;2 billion.  That needs to be acknowledged.  There are also record numbers of special needs assistants, SNAs.  I know the Minister got an extra allocation in last year's budget.  There have also been efforts made to tackle the pupil-teacher ratio.  I acknowledge all those positive steps before I get to the challenges ahead.</p>  <p>  I received correspondence from the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, last March.  It details comprehensively the issues we are having in Cork city and county, primarily suburban Cork.  That correspondence details that at primary school level, all but one primary school, a school in Midleton, were full in terms of autism spectrum disorder, ASD, provision.  The same was true for villages such as Berrings, a relatively small village on the western side of Cork city.  For Blackrock in the city centre itself, Grenagh, or whatever other village one wants to mention, this correspondence details the same thing, namely, that in the whole issue of special education, the lack of places is quite stark.  The figures suggest that schools are operating at capacity.</p>  <p>  The picture is similar when we move to second level.  The majority of areas such as Glanmire, where I live, Ballyvolane, The Glen, the entirety of the north side of the city and Churchfield are at capacity at second level.</p>  <p>  The most important figure provided by the NCSE is that 193 primary schools have ASD provision for students and only 70 are available at post-primary level.  Those figures might have changed since then and I know there was an extra allocation last year but the figures paint a stark picture for kids who depart primary school and transition to second level.  There is nearly a 3:1 ratio of ASD provision in primary schools compared to secondary schools.  An awful lot of parents and children honestly feel as if they are falling off the edge of a cliff in terms of service provision when they make that transition.  </p>  <p>  The picture painted by the figures available to me is quite stark.  Where do we go from here in terms of service provision for Cork?  I am aware that the Minister has powers available to her under section 37A of the Education Act and those powers have only been utilised sparingly, and primarily in Dublin, since that legislation came in.</p> <p>I ask at this stage that the Minister seriously considers, for parts of the city that I represent, particularly Glanmire and the northern side of the city out to Blarney where it is fairly obvious that certain schools are not pulling their weight, enacting those powers.  Saving that, I encourage her to legislate for the NCSE to make direct interventions where schools are failing to meet that need.</p> <p> Before my time finishes, I will highlight one area in particular that is a real bone of contention.  It is not an area that I represent but in Ballincollig, there is a considerable deficit in autism spectrum disorder, ASD, provision.  Children are travelling from that area, where I believe there is a population of more than 25,000, to outside villages like those I mentioned earlier such as Dripsey, Farran and so on to get the kind of ASD provision their students need.  That is a damning indictment of the system as it is currently set up.  I believe that we need to consider changing that to where the discretion is taken away from schools and ascertain whether we empower the Minister or the NCSE to make those interventions.</p></speech>

In fairness, I acknowledge his ongoing engagement with me and his very clear and specific interest in this area of education.  I thank him for that.</p>  <p>  Enabling children with special educational needs to receive an education appropriate to their needs is a priority for this Government.  This year, the Department of Education will invest in excess of &euro;2 billion or more than 25% of the Department's budget in special education needs support.  As a result, the numbers of special education needs teachers, special needs assistants, SNAs, and special class and school places are at unprecedented levels in this country.</p>  <p>  Since 2011, the number of special classes in mainstream schools has increased by almost 386% from 548 to 2,118 for the 2021-22 school year.  Of these, 1,854 special classes cater for students with autism.  Throughout 2020 and 2021, the Department of Education and the NCSE have worked closely on a more streamlined and joined-up planning process, which has ensured a targeted approach to meet demand for special needs placements ahead of each new school year.  This approach is delivering.  This intensive intervention has seen an additional 269 special classes providing more than 1,600 new places opened nationwide for the 2021-22 school year.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the extent of this investment, there are some parts of the country where increases in population and other issues have led to concerns regarding a shortage of school places.  The NCSE has responsibility for co-ordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide.  It has well-established structures in place for engaging with schools and parents.  The NCSE seeks to ensure that schools in an area can between them cater for all children who have been identified as needing special class placements.</p>  <p>  Normally, special class and special school places are established with the full co-operation of the schools in areas where they are required.  There are, however, some parts of the country where the NCSE has faced challenges in getting schools and their patrons to voluntarily agree to provide special classes or special school places.  I know this can cause much anguish for the parents and families involved.</p>  <p>  There is currently a network of 357 special classes in Cork of which 309 are special classes for children with autism.  Of those, 228 are at primary level, including 21 early intervention classes and 81 at post-primary level.  A total of 45 new special classes were established for the 2021-22 school year.</p>  <p>  The NCSE, through its network of special educational needs organisers, SENOs, is currently engaging in a process of establishing new classes for the 2022-23 school year and beyond.  The council is looking at local information with regard to projected demand for future special education places, particularly to cater for students with autism who have associated complex needs.</p>  <p>  Budget 2022 has provided for the creation of 287 additional special classes for the 2022-23 school year.  These additional classes will provide more than 1,700 new places this year.  This additional provision will bring the total number of special classes to more than 2,400 in the 2022-23 school year.</p>  <p>  The provision of special school places in Cork was also significantly increased for the 2021-22 school year with the opening of a new special school in Carrigaline.  The number of places available in this school will again increase for September 2022 and work is also progressing on the expansion of an existing special school in Rochestown.  Overall, budget 2022 has provided for an additional 23 teaching pots and 46 SNA posts in special schools nationwide, which will create an additional 140 special school places in 2022.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-01-19a.360" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1521" speakername="P&aacute;draig O'Sullivan" time="23:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022011900063#LLL00300"><p>The response gives me an update on the figures but it still points out a concerning ratio in the provision of ASD places from primary versus secondary school.  In Cork, we are now at 228 at primary level and 81 at post-primary level.  There is, therefore, still almost that 3:1 ratio of ASD provision from primary versus secondary, particularly in Cork where the pinch point is.  It is when kids are transitioning from primary to secondary level that parents are finding it extremely difficult to get access to ASD places and ASD classes.</p>  <p>  With regard to the responsibility of the NCSE for co-ordinating and advising on education provision, as I said, it is quite clear that every unit in suburban Cork is full.  It might be anecdotal evidence but it is quite clear to any Teachta D&aacute;la from Cork who is approached by parents.  We have parents driving or sending their kids on minibuses, often for 30 to 40 minutes and up to an hour.  Kids are not getting that provision in their own locality as should be their right.</p>  <p>  Without naming schools, I can give examples or large towns where there are three secondary schools and only one school is providing ASD classes.  In one case, the other two schools have never bothered.  Whether that is an issue over snobbery and not wanting to run an ASD class or whatever the case may be, those are the facts.  As long as we allow that discretion for secondary schools and boards of management, that difficulty is going to remain.</p>  <p>  I ask again that the Minister give further consideration not only to her own powers under section 37A, but to strengthen the role of the NCSE and get it to directly intervene.  Even looking at the demography of Cork, the population growth is quite apparent.  From the city centre east to Youghal, there is not one ASD place at the moment.  I think there was one last year in St. Aidan's, Ballyvolane but those figures are outdated now.  That was the only place between the city centre east as far as Youghal.  That is almost 40 km.  That is the stark picture and that requires urgent action.  I acknowledge that good progress is being made on a new special education site in Glanmire.  I know it is at a sensitive commercial stage but, again, there is progress on that issue and that is giving us hope as well.</p></speech>

The NCSE is leading work in this regard.  I reassure the Deputy that the Department will continue to support the NCSE and schools through the provision of necessary funding and capital investment to ensure all children are successful in accessing an education.</p>  <p>  Considerable work is undertaken with schools on the ground and this has proven successful, notwithstanding the issues the Deputy has raised and the need to continue to engage with schools in this respect.  I want to again emphasise that there is a huge commitment from the point of view of the Department to accelerate provision of school places and special schools.  Considerable progress has been made in this very short time span since the formation of this Government.  It is a significant recognition that almost 25% of the budget now is being expended on special education and rightly so.  Beyond that, specific interventions, for example, budget 2021, provided an additional 990 SNAs and this resulted in more than 18,000 SNAs being allocated to schools by the end of December in 2021.  Budget 2022 then provides funding for an additional 1,165 SNAs to provide support to children with special education needs, which will bring the total number of SNAs in this country to more than 19,169 at the end of December 2022.  As I said, provision for 19,169 SNAs at the end of the year will represent an increase of 81% since 2011, at which time 10,575 SNAs were provided for.</p> <p>Budget 2021 also provided for an additional 145 special educational teachers, bringing the provision to 13,765.  Budget 2022 provides for the creation of additional 980 new teaching posts in special education.  This new investment is required to meet the needs of students with special educational needs.  The point is that there is an ongoing commitment to address the issues that arise in staffing and supports for students, as well as the provision of places for students with additional needs.</p></speech>

We have to stick tightly to the time of one minute each.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-01-19a.365" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1508" speakername="Michael Fitzmaurice" time="23:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022011900064#MMM00300"><p>First, I thank Minister coming into the House.  Last Monday, Deputy Kerrane and myself met students in St Cuan&rsquo;s College in Castleblakney.  Those students last Monday gave up their dinner time or their lunch break and went out to stand together in solidarity looking for the hybrid system that they believe they deserve.  I believe they deserve it.  In fairness, most Deputies around the country believe that the choice should be given to those pupils.  Today, we see students in different parts of the country looking for the same.</p>  <p>  Bear in mind that many families unfortunately have been affected by the Covid and have lost time.  The same has happened to teachers and we must remember this as well.  I was rather surprised to hear the Taoiseach at Leaders&rsquo; Questions today state that there may difficulties because they may not be enough college places.  Are we now saying that a student sits the leaving certificate exam so that we will be able to make sure that X number will get in and X number will not?  I would be very worried about that.  The Minister's Department needs to go back and look at this.  I will hand her a copy of the letter.</p></speech>

On that same day, students in the Holy Rosary College in Mountbellew were also protesting.  A number of those protests also continued today.  They have been clear that they want certainty.  It is great shame to leave students with this worry and stress.  The leaving certificate year is already stressful enough as it is.  They have not had an ordinary year.  It is a two-year cycle.  It has not been a normal leaving certificate year and therefore the normal leaving certificate should not go ahead.  There should be choice for students.  I ask the Minister to make a decision and to give certainty to the students now so that they are allowed choice.  That is the very least they deserve.</p></speech>

It is in all weathers, including freezing cold.  Of course, I cannot ask that that be done because there are no windows in the D&aacute;il Chamber.  However, the basic idea is good.  What he was saying to me was that we should put ourselves in the students&rsquo; shoes.  They missed months of direct classroom teaching time in fifth year.  They have real mental health pressures bearing down upon them.  They have just gone back to school at the start of a new year.  Some have not been able to go back because they had Covid-19.  Some have not been able to go back because they were close contacts.  Some did not go in because their parents kept them home, fearful of Covid-19.  Some of their teachers did not arrive.  My question to the Minister is why, given all of this, has she still not shut down the option of an unwanted traditional leaving certificate?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-01-19a.368" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1460" speakername="Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire" time="23:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022011900064#MMM00600"><p>I first want to echo Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s points in the previous debate.  There is a very serious issue in relation to the allocation of special educational classes in Cork city and suburbs.  I give specific mention to the issue of post-primary in Ballincollig.</p>  <p>  Much has been made of the fact that this is not the same situation as last year.  Of course, that is true, it is not precisely the same.  However, it is the case that this is not a normal year and it is nothing like a normal year.  Students faced months outside of the classroom.  They have endured significant periods of self-isolation themselves, perhaps two or three periods, perhaps the same for their class teachers.  It is proving very difficult to cover the course.  The Minister will go to the stakeholders' meeting tomorrow.  Of course, all voices have to be listened to, but she should listen in particular to the voice of students.  What they are saying is clear, it is fair and it is deliverable.  That is that they are given the choice between accredited grades and written exams.  I believe it can be done.  The Minister went for that herself last year.  It was the right choice.  Many people called for it and she responded to it.  I urge her to do the same again this year.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-01-19a.369" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1582" speakername="Norma Foley" time="23:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022011900064#MMM00700"><p>I thank Deputies for raising this issue and for allowing me to address the matter.  At the outset, I would like to say that I am very much aware of the disruption experienced by students who are due to take their leaving certificate examinations this year in the class of 2022.  It is welcome that the schools reopened at the normal time after the Christmas holidays.  I know that schools are working tirelessly to deliver the best possible educational experience to students.  It is important to say that.  All planning for the 2022 examinations is guided by the prevailing public health advice and it will have regard to the well-being of students.  The Department of Education continues to engage with the partners in education on all matters relating to the leaving certificate 2022 examinations.  The next meeting of the advisory group on the State examinations is planned for tomorrow.  The advisory group includes representatives of students, parents, teachers and school leaders, as well as representatives from the State Examinations Commission, SEC, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, higher education and my Department.</p>  <p>  Adjustments to the examination papers for the 2022 State examinations were announced in August 2021.  These adjustments were designed to take account of both the disruption to learning experience by students in the early part of 2021, as well as providing for some possible further disruption in the 2021-22 academic school year.  The adjustments ensure that the overall structure of the examinations remains intact, but allow for greater choicer for students.  Revised arrangements for leaving certificate oral examinations in Irish, in the modern foreign languages and the practical performance tests in leaving certificate music were announced last month.  These examinations will now take place outside of school time over the first week of school Easter holidays.  By moving these examinations to the Easter holidays, the State Examinations Commission aims to minimise disruption to teaching and learning, especially for those candidates preparing for the examinations, as this change will specifically limit teacher absence from schools.</p>  <p>  The State Examinations Commission also recently provided further information to schools regarding aspects of the 2022 State examinations.  This included postponing commencement of assessment of what is known as the leaving certificate applied February tasks from 31 January to 14 February.  Schools were also reminded of the flexibility which is available regarding the dates for completion and authentication of coursework for leaving certificate candidates.  I have also announced that an alternative set of leaving certificate examinations will be run 2022, shortly after the conclusion of the main set of examinations.  This will be for students who are unable to set the main set of examinations for various reasons, including Covid-19 illness, bereavement or serious illness.</p>  <p>  Finally, the Department of Education has also provided a suite of guidance materials agreed with the educational partners to enable schools to mediate the curriculum safely for all pupils and students in a Covid-19 context.  The Department of Education will continue to engage with all partners in education on all matters relating to the leaving certificate 2022 examinations.  As I said, the meeting of the advisory group on planning for State examinations 2022 has been planned for tomorrow, Thursday.  As previously outlined, this group represents the widest possible experience of stakeholders in education, students, parents, teachers and managerial bodies.  It is important that this advisory group has been in operation for a considerable amount of time.  Their last meeting was on 20 December, where the decision around the final arrangements as regards the examinations for the orals and the musical practicals was taken.  The next meeting will take place tomorrow.  I look forward to that opportunity tomorrow to hear again the views, thoughts and experiences of everybody around the table.  They have played a vital role up to this point in determining how we proceed.  It is important that they be afforded the opportunity also tomorrow.</p></speech>

We should not even be debating whether children should have the choice.  This should be an option every year going forward.  The Minister spoke about the group that is going to meet tomorrow.  With everything she has outlined, I would not hold out much hope.  The Minister should respect the children and what they have gone through and give them the choice.</p></speech>

I understood that was the position until the Taoiseach made the situation seem different again in an interview last weekend.  Has the decision been made on this matter?  Students are trying to get their voices heard.  They have been clear on what they want and it is unfair that we are putting this further pressure and stress on them now and not listening to them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-01-19a.374" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1522" speakername="Mick Barry" time="23:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022011900065#NNN00300"><p>The Minister said the Department is offering students more choice in the papers and that some exams have been postponed until the Easter holidays.  That does not really matter a damn.  It is not the point or the issue.  The issue now is whether there will be a traditional leaving certificate or non-traditional leaving certificate.  What is the Minister's answer on that?</p>  <p>  On the mental health issue, the Minister and I both know there is a mental health crisis in schools.  Is she going to compound that further by imposing a leaving certificate that 70% of students - that is seven in ten - are against, as shown clearly by the ISSU poll?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-01-19a.375" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1460" speakername="Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire" time="23:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022011900065#NNN00400"><p>We all anticipated that the Minister's response would kick this question into tomorrow's meeting.  I understand how things work.  What I did not anticipate was that her response so far does not even contemplate giving students the choice, even though the Government has stated it is open to that.  I am hoping the Minister will say in her next reply that she is open to that.  I urge her to take that decision early because the situation students are in at the minute is unbearable due to the uncertainty, stress and pressure they are under.  Many of these students will have missed upwards of eight weeks of in-class time last year and potentially five or six weeks between themselves and the teacher covering the subject this year.  Teachers are saying they will not organise mock exams on certain subjects because they have not covered the course.  That is the reality they are facing.</p></speech>

I will note them.  In my previous response, I took the opportunity to outline the progress and consultation that has taken place to this point.  It has been a process of progress and consultation, which is important.  As I have already outlined, it is a consultation with the widest possible representation of stakeholders through the advisory body.  That includes students and they have been very much part of the process, which continues tomorrow.  That is right and proper.  It has been the hallmark of progress to this point for the leaving certificate in 2022 and equally so for those in 2020 and 2021.</p>  <p>  I emphasise that I am acutely aware of the disruption caused to students who are taking the exam in 2022.  The Department will continue to engage with education stakeholders to ensure the best interests of all students are at the heart of all decisions made relating to the leaving certificate in 2022.  There was ongoing engagement in planning prior to the return to school when plans were put in place for accommodations to exam papers.  As I outlined earlier, other accommodations such as second sittings of exams and the provision of exams at Easter outside of school time will be made.</p>  <p>  There will be a further opportunity tomorrow to hear all voices and opinions at the advisory group meeting in what has always been an open and constructive manner.  An opportunity will be afforded to each of the stakeholders tomorrow to articulate their views, experiences and representative thoughts and ideas on the next stages of development for the process.  I look forward to that opportunity.  I have always supported the opportunity for the widest possible stakeholder engagement, including with students, and I will continue to do that.  It is a proper process and it is right and proper that that opportunity be facilitated tomorrow.</p></speech>
