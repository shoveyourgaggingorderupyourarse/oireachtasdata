There is an enormous backlog, largely because of a decision taken by the Minister for Health last April to offer a free test to every woman who requested one.  For about three months we have been seeking to ascertain the extent to which the Minister sought, received or ignored official advice on this decision because it has had significantly damaging repercussions for the programme which has been very effective over a period of ten years, with 65,000 pre-cancer cases being diagnosed and a very high participation rate.  It is now in something of a crisis.</p>  <p>  The truth and the record of the House matter.  The Minister's story has shifted continuously from January onwards, following questions about the issue.  We need a comprehensive statement from him.  On 5 February he denied that the decision had been made against official advice.  He said that was not the case, but we now know that there was official advice against the decision.  Professor Gr&aacute;inne Flannelly's submission was one element of it.  We know that there was a meeting between Department of Health and CervicalCheck officials on that day and that an email went from CervicalCheck to the Department.  The Minister subsequently said the warnings had been significantly after he had made his decision.  He set this out in a statement to the D&aacute;il in February.  We know that Mr. Tony O'Brien, the then director general of the HSE, spoke to the Minister on the Sunday after the decision was made and asked him to walk it back.  This was before a Cabinet meeting on the following Tuesday at which the decision was formally endorsed and when a presentation was made.  Were Ministers aware of all of that detail, the warnings and official advice against the decision to proceed?  A number of the statements from the Minister are incorrect.  There were warnings from very senior people on the day and the day after.</p>  <p>  On 8 May I asked the Taoiseach during Leaders' Questions if there was the capacity to do the smear tests and if it was the correct official response.  That was despite all of the spin that I had allegedly welcomed all of this.  I asked some clear, pertinent questions on 8 May and what I said has been borne out in the fullness of time because Professor Gr&aacute;inne Flannelly said the decision had fundamentally undermined the advice.</p><p>Will the Taoiseach ask the Minister to come to the House and issue a comprehensive statement outlining the sequence of events leading up to the decision, the advice he received and when he received it and correcting the D&aacute;il record as he does so?  Will he publish the email sent by CervicalCheck to the Department on the day he made his decision?  What is the timeline for the elimination of the backlog?  Will the Taoiseach confirm that the CervicalCheck screening programme can cope with the overload that has resulted and that there is capacity to clear the backlog while continuing with the programme?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-04-09a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="14:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019040900004#B00200"><p>The most important thing is that we deal with the backlog.  There is a backlog of approximately 80,000 smear tests waiting to be examined.  While the clinical risk is negligible, there are, of course, lots of women who are very concerned about their test result and have been waiting a long time for it.  We need to deal with that issue.  Some women are getting their result back within four weeks.  The average is 15 weeks, but, in some cases, it is 33.  </p>  <p>  The Health Service Executive, HSE, and the National Cancer Screening Service have been doing a lot of work to try to find laboratories that would be willing to take on additional tests.  They have sourced capacity, but they need to spec the laboratories and come to commercial arrangements with them to take on the additional tests.  Given the litigious environment in Ireland, among other things, it can be difficult to get laboratories to agree to take on additional tests, but the HSE has identified laboratories that may be willing to take on the additional tests, subject to a commercial agreement and an agreement on liability should there be future claims.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Health will be before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health tomorrow when I am sure Deputies will take the opportunity to ask him questions.  I am absolutely confident that he will be willing to answer any question he has not answered already.  In my view, he has answered the questions already.  There was indeed advice from CervicalCheck after the announcement had been made, albeit on the day.  I think the email to which the Deputy referred has been published.  I certainly heard the party's spokesperson quoting from it-----</p></speech>

It did not go, as the Deputy claims, to the Minister for Health.</p>  <p>  The advice from the Chief Medical Officer, CMO, was reflected in the decision made by the Minister for Health which was subsequently endorsed by the Government.  If the Deputy refers to the statement released on 28 April 2018, it states: "For any woman who has had a CervicalCheck smear test and where her GP feels she should have a further test as part of her reassurance, the Minister has asked CervicalCheck to make the necessary arrangements, including payment provision.  These arrangements will be confirmed next week."</p></speech>

That proves that the CMO's advice was followed because 100,000 women attended their GPs and in about half the number of cases a repeat smear test was done.</p></speech>

My understanding is the email from CervicalCheck to the Department has not been published.  What has been put forward is that because it is subject to a freedom of information request the Department does not want to release it.  I will stand corrected if it has been published, but I would like the Taoiseach to say in the D&aacute;il today that he will ensure it will be published before the end of the day.  There is no reason it should not and cannot be published.  I want that commitment from the Taoiseach because this has been ongoing for three months and the story has shifted and changed.  Sometimes it is better to put the hands up on day one and admit that it was a huge error and mistake because why else would the director general of the HSE talk to the Minister and ask him to walk back?  What the Taoiseach has just read is an attempt by the system to walk back from the Minister's kneejerk tweet.  That is very clear from the story in <i>The Examiner</i>on Saturday, which is very interesting, about who leaked the text between the CMO and the Minister.</p><p>There is a very short list of people who are potentially responsible.  He mentioned a request from a doctor in the National Association of General Practitioners, NAGP and then said:</p><blockquote>Tony please see below confidentially.  From NAGP.  Would seem better to do this than be forced to do it??</blockquote><p>That seems to be the rationale for a decision which has heaped hundreds of thousands of additional unnecessary tests on the system, causing an enormous backlog, and has delayed the rolling out of the new human papillomavirus, HPV test, which is far more precise and more accurate and would yield even better results for the women concerned.  The record of the House unquestionably needs to be corrected and the Minister needs to make a comprehensive statement.  Tomorrow's business in the House is about the wide Estimates in health, it is not specifically about this issue.</p></speech>

To the best of my knowledge, the information that was on the front page of the <i>Irish Examiner </i>was not a leak, it was on foot of a freedom of information request made by that newspaper, so the Deputy is really into his conspiracy theories again.  A newspaper makes a freedom of information request-----</p></speech>

This was the major issue coming up on the helpline, the NAGP called for repeat smear tests, the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO signed an agreement to provide them and it was welcomed by the Opposition.  Some Opposition spokespersons said that they would have done the same thing and patient advocates called for it too, so this was done for good reasons.</p>  <p>  On the email the Deputy mentioned, I will check whether it has been published.  If it has not been published, I do not see why it could not be but I will check into that.

Last week there were serious problems in Cork University Hospital, CUH, and a black status escalation was declared, which meant that the hospital was at maximum capacity and was deemed unsafe to admit further patients.  The outworking of that has had serious implications and two specific incidents were reported in the <i>Southern Star</i>newspaper yesterday, which illustrate the extent of the problems at Cork University Hospital.</p><p>A general practitioner, GP, in Bandon, Dr. Mary Roycroft, has said that an 84 year old patient refused to attend the emergency department at CUH, despite being very unwell, and told her that she would rather die at home than be in there.  She said that the patient's response is not unique and that many other patients have expressed similar fears.  These are patients who need to be in hospital but who are unwilling and afraid to attend accident and emergency services because of persistent overcrowding.  That is a scandalous situation.  In addition, an elderly man who fell in Skibbereen last week was left lying on a pavement for nearly two hours while waiting for an ambulance to take him to CUH.  The ambulance in question was one of eight that were queueing outside the hospital waiting to offload patients and it never came.  This man was eventually taken to hospital by a paramedic crew from County Kerry.  This is no way for our health service to operate and yet it is the reality.  It is in a state of perpetual chaos and no meaningful action is being taken to address the extent of this crisis.  That is a disgrace.</p><p>University Hospital Limerick was similarly in a state of chaos last week and that shows no sign of letting up.</p><p>There are 55 patients on trolleys there today and Limerick is yet again the worst affected hospital in the State.  State-wide today, there are 631 patients on trolleys, the highest number in 2019 so far according to the INMO.  There are 55, as I said, in Limerick, 42 at Cork University Hospital, 50 at Sligo University Hospital, 39 in Beaumont, and 37 in Galway.  I am advised by Deputy Ferris that there are 36 patients on trolleys in Kerry University Hospital and nine sitting in chairs.  It was equally chaotic yesterday.  On and on it goes.  It is frightening.  Overcrowding, as the Taoiseach knows, impacts on patients and puts them at risk.  It also affects the health and well-being of staff.  Both of these things are intolerable.  This is no longer a winter problem or one that is amenable to a seasonal intervention.  It is year-round and State-wide.  The Taoiseach has failed to get to grips with it.  Quite simply, I ask what he and his Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, plan to do to respond to the capacity crisis in a meaningful way.</p></speech>

I do know and understand the enormous inconvenience and suffering that hospital overcrowding causes patients and their families who care for them, and also the stress and pressures it puts on staff.  I say that as somebody who spent over a year working in emergency departments in three different hospitals, where we often experienced very high levels of overcrowding.  None of us wants to see that persist.</p>  <p>  I never like to reduce this to statistics because it is not about statistics, it is about people.  The Deputy is right to point out that the number of patients on trolleys today, whether we use the nurses' figures or the HSE figures, is the highest so far this year.  It is not higher than it was last year, however, or in the three years before that.  It is always possible to pull out record highs and record lows by identifying a particular day of the week or a particular hospital or a particular month.</p></speech>

Even taking the nurses' figures, which cannot really be used for year-on-year comparisons because they change the way they count them every year, or at least have changed the way they count them on a few occasions in recent years, their figures show fewer patients on trolleys so far this year compared with last year.</p>  <p>  The Deputy's question is what we are going to do about it.  We should focus on solutions, not on accusations.  Our solutions are threefold, namely, bed capacity, better use of our existing resources and beds, and I will explain what I mean by that a little later, and investment in primary care and community care.  The first item is bed capacity and we are increasing the number of beds in our hospitals all the time.  There are three new hospitals under construction, new wings in Limerick as the Deputy mentioned-----</p></speech>

By the end of this year, we will be back up to about 11,000 beds in our acute hospital system.  That is the highest number since 2009, reversing the policy of the previous Fianna F&aacute;il and Green Party Government to reduce the number of hospital beds, by restoring those beds.</p>  <p>  The second area is better use of our existing bed capacity.  Obviously a hospital with an average length of stay of six days needs way more beds than one with an average length of stay of four days, even though it sees the same number of patients.  That is about making sure that there is reduced length of stay, that patients get out of hospital quicker, and if they are in hospital, that they get their tests and investigations more quickly and are not waiting around for days to see a specialist, have a scan or have an intervention they need.</p>  <p>  The third area is investment in primary and community care, because in Ireland we rely too much on our hospital system.  Much more can be done in primary and community care.  That is why last week's agreement with the IMO on a revised contract for GPs is so significant.  It is a 40% increase in resources for general practice over the next three and a half years, including provision of 250 more practice nurses.  What are we doing?  We are providing for more beds, more efficient use of our existing resources, and a decisive shift to primary and community care.</p></speech>

He has typified the stories I told him as accusations.  They are nothing of the sort.</p><p>They are the experiences of two people in Cork, namely, an 84 year old woman and an elderly man who fell and was left on the pavement for two hours.  That is not an accusation.  It is a scandal and an utter disgrace.  I am shocked that the Taoiseach seems to be so out of touch that he would classify that as an accusation.  These are the stories behind the statistics that are so regularly quoted.  </p> <p> The Taoiseach has said that he is pulling out all of the stops and is on top of this.  All of the evidence contradicts that.  The evidence tells us that this is a crisis and that the Government cannot manage it.  It tells us that this is a disaster.  Staff in Kerry told Deputy Ferris so earlier today and people are saying the same in Cork.  I was in Mayo last week, where the emergency department and its staff is under enormous pressure.  The Taoiseach seems to be totally out of touch and is blissfully unaware of this.  I put it to the Taoiseach that, rather than providing any positive solutions, it is quite shocking that the Minister has spoken recently about a recruitment freeze and an overtime ban.  How on earth will that do anything other than worsen the capacity crisis at accident and emergency departments?  </p></speech>

I said I could not comment on those individual cases because I do not know the facts.  The accusations she made concerned what was said about the Government, not those individual cases.  The Deputy asked about solutions.  I provided the solutions to her.  I pointed towards the three areas in which we are implementing solutions.  I have not heard, nor do I ever hear, solutions in the Deputy's contributions to this House.</p><p>I appreciate that the Deputy is outraged and angry on behalf of patients who  have received a very bad service, whether in Cork or elsewhere.  Where is her outrage for those who are receiving a really bad health service in Northern Ireland?  The last Minister for Health was Michelle O'Neill, the Sinn F&eacute;in deputy leader, or its leader in the North.  She walked away from government in Northern Ireland.

It is hilarious, is it not?  That man cannot rent in the city in which he works.  His story is typical of many people who have been failed by Fine Gael's strategy for the rental sector, the policy that introduced rent-pressure zones.  The effect of those zones is "to limit rent increases, both within existing tenancies and between tenancies, to 4% per annum for a specified period", yet the housing affordability crisis is getting worse.  More than 10,000 people are experiencing homelessness at present.  Since the policy was brought in, we have seen more and more areas designated as rent-pressure zones because rents have been shooting up in the areas alongside rent-pressure zones.  This is the case in Galway, Maynooth and Drogheda.  Housing officers in local government have told me directly that rent-pressure zones are the single worst thing to have happened to the private rental sector.  Rather than capping rents, the policy has given a signal to landlords to increase rents by 4% per year.  Landlords believe that as every landlord is doing the same thing, they should too.  Rent inflation is at 4% in the rent-pressure zones, but inflation outside of the zones, in the contiguous areas, is even worse.  The policy is a failure and the reason for that failure is that the benchmark used for rent affordability is wrong.</p><p>Affordability must be benchmarked against earnings, what people can actually afford to pay.  Average annual earnings for full-time workers grew by 1.7% between 2016 and 2017.  Rents in rent-pressure zones are capped at 2.5 times the growth in earnings over the same period, which makes no sense whatsoever.</p> <p> The minimum wage set by Government rose by 1% in 2017 and another 3.2% in 2018.  The minimum wage in turn affects sectoral wages in cleaning, security, retail, hairdressing and other low-paid occupations.  Many people working in these areas are renters.  The Government is setting wage increases at far less than the 4% rent increase that it is not only tolerating, but in many cases encouraging.  It is effectively encouraging a 4% annual increase in rents.  Why did no one make the link between a proposed cap on rents and actual increase in earnings?  Who came up with the 4% figure?  Does the Taoiseach honestly believe that such a level of rent inflation continues to be acceptable or sustainable?</p></speech>

That is why we introduced the rent-pressure zones.  They have only been in place for a few years.  There is evidence from the RTB's quarterly reports that rent increases are now moderating.  That can be seen in the most recent report.  They were never going to work overnight; it was always going to take time for them to work.  However, we can now see a slowdown in the rate of increases and even some reductions in rents in the last quarter.</p>  <p>  No amount of rent-pressure zones, caps, regulations or formulas will solve this problem.  They can help to alleviate the problem and make it less bad.  They can act to treat the symptoms, but as long as there are more people who want or need to rent than properties available to rent, we will have a problem.  It might appear as rent price inflation or under-the-counter cash payments, which is what happens in countries with very strict rent controls.  It might appear in the form of people who cannot find anywhere to rent and have to continue to live with friends or relatives because there is a waiting list for a place to rent.</p>  <p>  The solution must be based on supply.  We need to ensure more places are available for people to rent, which will moderate prices and bring them down.  The last time rent prices in Ireland fell was because the mismatch between supply and demand was corrected, and there was more supply than demand for rental properties.  That is why we have put such effort into increasing supply.</p></speech>

The policy is to ensure there is a greater supply of housing: social housing for people on the housing lists; private housing for people who want to buy because most people want to buy their own home; and places available for people to rent.</p>  <p>  Any other measures such as rent caps, rent-pressure zones or whatever formula we use are only treating the symptoms and are not actually treating the problem.  However, symptomatic treatment is important while we solve the underlying problem.  That is why the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government is introducing additional measures to strengthen the rent-pressure zones, to make them more enforceable by giving more powers and resources to the RTB; to change the way they are calculated so that they are calculated differently outside Dublin, because there are parts of the country that would be rent-pressure zones but they are not because the Dublin rents distort things; to extend the notice-to-quit periods and other such measures; and to extend the rent-pressure-zone rules to student accommodation, an issue on which the Minister of State, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, and the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, have worked very closely, recognising that many people in student accommodation have seen very big increases in their rents because they had not been covered by this legislation to date.</p></speech>

There is a way of doing that quickly.  We have public land and the Government should use public money to build public houses on public land.  In the meanwhile, before we actually implement the cure, we need to treat the symptoms.  People are in pain and that pain needs to be addressed and alleviated.</p><p>We suggested the introduction of a national cap on rents because people cannot afford existing rents.  If we had a national cap on rents, we would not have the instant pressure on the next zone that is outside the current line for the rental pressure, where they can increase, as we heard in one instance, by 30% because they think that they will be next.  Let us have a national rental zone and link it to something sensible such as the consumer price index or wage inflation, not to an arbitrary figure of 4% which makes it unaffordable.</p> <p> We need to increase supply dramatically and we need to see dramatic action, as set out in our own proposals, to deploy &euro;16 billion to build public and affordable houses on public land, but in the interim we need to allow people to continue to rent and not be in mortal fear of not being able to afford their rent or find they have to commute inordinate distances to keep themselves in a job.</p></speech>

We have a rising population, increasing by about 1.5% a year - very few countries in the western world have a population increasing as fast as ours - and we also have an emerging phenomenon of smaller household sizes, so we need a great deal of extra housing every year just to stand still.  We agree that supply is the solution to the underlying problem, and addressing that is what we are doing.  A total of 18,000 new homes built last year.  One in four of those new homes were for social housing built by local authorities or affordable housing bodies.  I do not know the last time we  built one in four houses for social housing but that is what was done last year.  It was probably the biggest social housing programme in decades, and that needs to continue.  We want to increase that to about 25,000 new homes this year.  If we could ramp it up quicker, believe me, we would, but we have not been able to do that.</p>  <p>  We considered the introduction of a national cap on rents a year or two ago and there were a number of reasons we concluded that was not a good idea.  First, we do not have a national rental market.  Dunmanway is very different from Cork city and Cork city is very different again from Dublin.</p></speech>

Sixty percent drive and 10% travel as passengers.  There is daily gridlock on the roads leading into Cork city.  For example, tens of thousands of motorists use the south link road daily.  People from west Cork in my constituency travel daily to Cork city for work.  People are spending hours on the road driving, often stuck in traffic on outdated roads starved of proper funding.  I would point to the unfinished southern bypass in Bandon and the proposed two-phase relief road on the northern side of Bandon, which if it goes ahead in two phases would be a disaster for Bandon as we go forward.  I point to the promised bypass for Innishannon, which was an election promise but it has not been delivered on.  While I acknowledge there has been some resurfacing of damage to the N71 road, the main N71, R586 and R585 roads to west Cork desperately need funding to bring them up to an acceptable standard.</p>  <p>  The existing public transport services from west Cork are not sufficient to meet the needs of the people.  Fares are too high and timetables are not always suitable.  While I recognise the Kinsale bus serves the airport, it is difficult for other commuters from west Cork using public transport to access the airport.  Accessing the railway station using public transport from west Cork is almost impossible, with many people having to walk from the bus station in Cork to the railway station.  Many commuters using the Cork to Dublin train are forced to use their cars to access the railway station due to the lack of suitable public transport, especially from rural regions of the county.</p>  <p>  I want to concentrate on a solution.  I know there is no hope of getting rail to west Cork but the Taoiseach can ensure something is done.  Will the Government consider putting in place a park and ride type service for west Cork as a pilot project?  Specifically, a park and ride type service from Clonakilty to Cork city would be of major advantage to workers and others travelling to the city.  If such a service was properly run, it could have buses linking from Skibbereen to Mizen Head, from Dunmanway through to Bantry to the Beara and Sheep's Head peninsulas and could also cater for people from Bandon, Innishannon and surrounding areas on its way to Cork.</p><p>For every 40 people travelling by public transport to work, 30 cars fewer would be on the road.  The reduction in traffic congestion and carbon emissions could be considerable.  If fares were competitive, timetables suitable, and wheelchair accessible buses used, with some buses servicing the airport and railway station, this type of service would have the potential to be hugely popular.  It would also give financial ease to families who are financially squeezed at this time and who may not require a second car in the home.</p> <p> Is the Government willing to request Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, to pilot a park and ride system from Clonakilty to Cork city?  I am confident it would get backing from the local community in west Cork and, for example, I believe sporting organisations and other community groups would not be found wanting in regard to parking facilities if this service was piloted.  This park and ride service could be tendered out by TII.  Companies like Bus &Eacute;ireann, Local Link or private operators could tender for the service, which could become cost-neutral.</p></speech>

I am delighted that Cork is getting so much attention on Leaders' Questions today.  We have great ambitions for the beautiful second city.  As the Deputy knows, our ambition is that the population of Cork will increase by 50% between now and 2040 and that Cork will grow at double the rate of Dublin between now and then.</p></speech>

We have had mixed experience of park and rides.  Sometimes they work and sometimes they do not.  Perhaps the suggestion the Deputy makes would work but it would require the NTA, TII and Cork County Council to work together.  I will take up the suggestion with TII and see if it is a feasible solution.</p>  <p>  In terms of other investment, the Deputy will be aware the enabling works have begun at Dunkettle, and anyone who knows Cork will know the kind of congestion that is faced at the Dunkettle interchange.  As I said, those initial works have started.  There will also be progress this year on the N28 and N22, thereby improving the road network in Cork.  The bulk of road investment now is happening in the north west, the south west and the south east, and there will also be investment in public transport, with a BusConnects programme for Cork, which will reduce traffic in the city and make things better for people who live outside the city and are commuting into it.  The NTA is also working on a new Cork transport strategy, which I anticipate will leave open the option of a light rail system for Cork, which will be needed in the decades ahead.</p></speech>

It is astonishing that, in 2019, not alone do we not have rail in west Cork, we do not even have a connecting bus service to the train station from west Cork.  A spokesperson from the Automobile Association is quoted as saying recently that the recovery in Cork will be hampered unless traffic gridlock is dealt with.  As a country, we will not meet our reductions targets for carbon emissions and may face massive fines.  In rural Ireland, most people are being forced to use their cars to get to work due to the lack of public transport.  A park and ride service, if properly planned, could help reduce our carbon footprint and give greater ease to stressed motorists in west Cork.</p></speech>

We did not have so many roads and we had no dual carriageways, no motorways and very few people owned cars, so it was a very different world back then.  It was the development of the roads and the expansion in car ownership that caused the railways to close in the first place because they became non-viable.</p>  <p>  When it comes to Cork, as the Deputy knows, our ambition is to increase the population of the Cork city region by 50% between now and 2040 and to ensure that it grows at twice the rate of Dublin.  We have an opportunity in Cork to learn from the mistakes made in Dublin and to get it right.  That involves a lot more high density development in the city centre area, in Tivoli, the docklands and all around that area, which is very much part of Project Ireland 2040.  It also means getting public transport right.  That is why we have set aside &euro;200 million for BusConnects to make sure Cork has a much better bus service, and it is why we need to listen to suggestions, such as the Deputy's suggestion on park and ride.</p><p>As I said, I will take that up with Transport Infrastructure Ireland and the National Transport Authority.</p></speech>

As he is aware, there is an election taking place in Israel today and the Prime Minister, Mr. Netanyahu, has pledged that if he is re-elected, he will annex illegal settlements.  As the Taoiseach is aware, the settlements are in contravention of international law and have been condemned repeatedly.  There is a commitment in the programme for Government to recognise the state of Palestine.  That is now a pressing and an urgent matter and delay only damages the prospects for a viable Palestinian state and, furthermore, encourages and facilitates a hawkish Israeli Government that is intent on frustrating any prospects for Palestinian sovereignty and, in turn, peace and stability in the region.</p></speech>

As the Taoiseach will recall, when the United Kingdom decided to leave the European Union, a bid was made to have two UK-based agencies, the European Medicines Agency, EMA, and the European Banking Authority, EBA, relocated to Ireland, but we lost out narrowly to Paris in a tied vote on the relocation of the EBA.  It is not too often that the European Union creates new agencies, but in February it was agreed by the Commission, the Council and the Parliament that a new agency would be established, namely, the European Labour Authority.  As I understand it, so far only Cyprus and Slovakia have declared an interest in the new agency.  Will the Taoiseach support the call made by Sheila Nunan, the Labour Party candidate in Ireland South, to have the agency located in Ireland?  It is one of which we have experience and Ireland would make a fine home for it.  Is it the Taoiseach's intention to make a bid to have the European Labour Authority based here?</p></speech>

It is similar to a Bill we proposed two years before which, among other things, would ban a "sale" as grounds for eviction.  It is becoming clearer every day and week that we need to have such a Bill passed.  Does the Government intend to allow the Bill to continue its progress through the House and be passed, or does it intend to seek to block it by refusing to issue a money message?  I ask, in particular, in the context of the mass evictions facing many of my constituents in Exchange Hall in Tallaght by the auctioneer, McPeake's, which is seeking to sell with vacant possession by kicking out the tenants before it sells.  There was a very effective protest on Saturday outside the building.  There was another effective protest on Saturday outside McPeake's offices in Blanchardstown, but the bottom line is that the tenants should not have to protest.</p><p>The Government should have progressed this legislation already and no one else should face this situation. </p></speech>

The number of people on trolleys last week was appalling.  The figure for today in University Hospital Limerick, which serves north Tipperary, is 55 and 30 in South Tipperary General Hospital.  South Tipperary General Hospital, or St. Joseph&rsquo;s as I like to call it, is a much smaller building and 30 people on trolleys in that hospital is as bad as 100 in CUH because it is an old building.  While I welcome that work is progressing on a 40-bed modular ward, there is no sign of staff being appointed.  The winter that has just passed is the third since this was promised and it is still not delivered.  This situation cannot be sustained.  The staff are at breaking point and people are fearful going into accident and emergency departments.  The Taoiseach will say he worked there years ago and in three other hospitals but I am talking about now.  I am not complaining about last year or the year before that.  It is now spring, we are heading into summer weather and there are no major scares in terms of health issues.  The situation is appalling, and the pressure is ongoing on the front-line staff.  It is not a good service for the people of Tipperary and I will not accept it.</p></speech>

There were 36 patients on trolleys and 12 patients on chairs, some of them since yesterday evening.  Subsequent to that, I was contacted by my daughter, Toir&eacute;asa, who is a councillor.

In the interest of health and safety, would it not be appropriate to call in the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, to examine the situation?</p></speech>

It costs approximately &euro;125 a week to keep somebody in their home.  It is costing &euro;7,000 a week for a hospital bed.  What is happening at the moment is economic madness.  I know of people who have received letters stating that they were entitled to home help but that they were on a waiting list.  I am aware of people who passed away while on that waiting list.  What is happening is absolutely crazy.</p></speech>

There were 41 on trolleys yesterday.  In the past week there have been over 30 people on trolleys.  Bed capacity is central to this issue.  There is a proposal from the hospital to build a new 50-bed unit.  Deputy Tony McLoughlin and I met the Minister last week and while he has said he wants to progress that, we need action right now to resolve the problem.  As for what can be done right now, there are two advanced nurse practitioners in the accident and emergency department.  They carry out work such as treating cuts and bruises and small injuries with which people come into the hospital.  The hospital has applied to have two more advanced nurse practitioners appointed and that request has been turned down twice.  If that were done, it would relieve the situation immediately in the accident and emergency department in Sligo University Hospital.  It is a practical solution to the problem.  It will not resolve it but it is something that needs to happen and can happen right now if those appointments were approved.</p></speech>

When it is completed it will be staffed but we know from bitter experience throughout the country that merely providing additional beds and additional staff does not solve the problem.  We need extra beds.  We need to make sure that beds are used efficiently, that the length of stay is reduced and that patients are not waiting days for necessary investigations to see specialists for interventions.  A hospital that has a length of stay of six days needs more beds than one with a length of stay of four days but no more people get treated.</p><p>The third element which I mentioned is ensuring we do much more in primary care services and the community because in Ireland we do too much in hospitals and not enough in the community.  That is why we concluded an agreement with general practitioners last week.</p></speech>

In the programme for Government and on many occasions since many commitments have been given on respite care.  A service is simply not available.  Families who have members with intellectual disabilities have been told by service providers that if they have already received a respite care service over a weekend or for two or three days in 2019 - this is only the second week in April - there will be no further service available to them for the rest of the year.  It is absolutely disgraceful and nobody is taking the matter seriously.  We are facing a massive crisis.  Elderly parents are trying to look after loved ones, particularly children, as best they can and crying out for respite care, but a service is simply not available.</p></speech>

We are approaching the end of the Government's term of office and the minimum wage stands at &euro;9.80 per hour, a rate on which many workers cannot meet day-to-day costs such as rent, childcare and insurance.  In government Sinn F&eacute;in will introduce a living wage, with appropriate transition supports for small and medium enterprises, SMEs.  That would see workers earn enough to achieve an adequate standard of living.  Will the Taoiseach give a commitment to introduce a living wage?  If not, will he explain to workers why he thinks they should continue to work for the minimum wage, a rate on which many of them cannot afford basic essentials?</p></speech>

It takes into account many factors, ranging from the cost of living to risks to employment, particularly in Border areas, should the minimum wage be increased too rapidly.  We take the advice of the Low Pay Commission and the minimum wage has been increased by approximately 25% in the last couple of years.  While it is modest, it is one of the highest in the world.  There is a living wage in the United Kingdom, including Northern Ireland, which is lower than the minimum wage here.</p></speech>

While the increased investment in key military infrastructure is necessary, there is also a need to address pay and allowances for members of the Defence Forces.  The Public Service Pay Commission process must come to a conclusion sooner rather than later.  It must recognise the valuable role played by the Defence Forces.  Some specific military allowances must be addressed to ensure more appropriate take-home pay for troops.</p></speech>

A large number of Defence Forces personnel live in County Kildare.  The Government is working on the issue.  We have asked the Public Service Pay Commission to examine the allowances paid to Defence Forces personnel, specifically to see if there are targeted measures we could apply to the Defence Forces that would improve pay and conditions but would not have a knock-on effect across the board and that would thus be affordable.  When I spoke to the chairman of the commission a few weeks ago, he said he should be able to have a report for the Government by the middle of May.  We will act swiftly on it.  In the meantime, members of the Defence Forces are benefiting from the pay restoration occurring generally across the public service.</p></speech>

The National Transport Authority is forcing a policy change on rural transport service operators.  It is splitting functions and stripping away the booking and co-ordination office from transport operations.  Let us consider County Clare as an example.  The booking office for the Local Link service will now be based in west Limerick, where there is no knowledge, experience or understanding of the geography or terrain of County Clare.</p><p>One could not make this up if one tried. There is little doubt that this decision will destroy the Local Link service that has been operated by Clare Accessible Transport for many years and which is a pilot project that is recognised as best in class right across the country.  I cannot understand why this policy decision has been changed and implemented.  I appeal to the Taoiseach, at this late stage, to try to get the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, to stall the process and prevent the signing of the contract in order that we have a chance to hold onto what we have and ensure that a good service is maintained for the benefit of those people.</p></speech>

On 21 February, the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, endorsed the national Traveller health action plan in a meeting with Pavee Point and promised to publish the Traveller health action plan this month.  Given that the suicide rate among Travellers is six times the national average, and that suicide accounts for 11% of Traveller deaths, I am sure the Taoiseach agrees that this constitutes a mental health crisis, which demands an urgent response and positive action.  I welcome the Minister's commitment but ask for an update on the status of the planning advisory body on Traveller health and the national Traveller health action plan.</p></speech>

Three years into the lifetime of the Government, and after eight years of the Taoiseach's party being in government, the health service is in an unprecedented state of crisis.  In Cork, the number of accident and emergency departments has been reduced from five to two.  The ambulance service has been restructured and many of our elderly are not receiving sufficient home help hours.  Last week, we had a status code black in Cork University Hospital in which eight ambulances were kept waiting for numerous hours there.</p>  <p>  Last week in Skibbereen, an 82 year old man fell on the street and suffered suspected neck and hip injuries about which I received numerous telephone calls.  This man lay on the street for two hours and 15 minutes while waiting for an ambulance, which eventually came from Cahirciveen, County Kerry.  This situation is unacceptable and the Government's policies are not working.  Will the Government carry out a review of the ambulance services in west Cork?</p></speech>

As the Deputy knows, they were held back in October due to changes at European level.  The idea is that they will be the most up-to-date guidelines.  It is hoped they will be published for an eight-week public consultation in the next two or three weeks.  They have been slightly delayed because of legislation to do with Brexit, but they are more or less ready and will be out to be viewed.</p></speech>

Indeed, it may have been published already.  I think it probably has been published in the past hour.  Any decision to debate the report in the House will be a matter for the Business Committee.  I am sure it would be appropriate to do so although I imagine the best step would be for the Joint Committee on Health to invite in the authors of the report to allow them to set out their findings.

Is there a timeline in respect of the collection of data?  Where are we at with that timeline?  Has any research been done on it?  Have any results or outcomes emerged?

I know the cost of insurance is of great concern to people.  We have made some progress in bringing down motor insurance premiums and stabilising health insurance premiums, but there is more to be done for public liability and business insurance.  I am unsure exactly where we are on the claims database.  I met the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy D'Arcy yesterday.  He is heading up the Government work on this.  He gave me a document to read.  I have not had a chance to read it yet but I will ask the Minister of State to contact Deputy Neville and fill him in.</p></speech>

The programme for Government puts a particular emphasis on affordable housing.  The Rebuilding Ireland affordable home loan scheme, which commenced last February, is a mess.  More evidence of the mess around it was provided by Brian O'Connell on the "Today with Se&aacute;n O'Rourke" radio programme.  We heard of numerous families who had been approved but who are now being told the funds may not exist.  We know that a considerable amount of the funds have been drawn down.  These funds would have been expected to have been drawn down in the timeline set out for the &euro;200 million.</p><p>I have had multiple items of correspondence, which I have raised and will again today, from people being refused the loan for inexplicable reasons.  One family was told that they earn too much and that the other reason they were not being given it was because it was not thought that they could repay the loan.  It cannot be both.  Is the real reason that the funds are running out?  Is that why people are being refused and may not get loans even when they are approved?</p></speech>

One of the biggest challenges is the lack of affordable accommodation.  The Government has made much of the Rebuilding Ireland home loan.  According to a reply to a parliamentary question that I received, of 262 loan applications assessed by Cork County Council, only 25 have been approved.  Of 112 loan applications assessed by Cork City Council, only a single loan has been approved, in an area which one would imagine has the greatest demand.  Many people cannot afford to get a deposit for a commercial mortgage and do not qualify for social housing.  Very little is being done for them and the current mess with the Rebuilding Ireland home loan scheme is creating a lot of uncertainty and anxiety for many people who need help to get accommodation.</p></speech>

The focus of our discussions was on Brexit, ahead of the European Council which took place in Brussels later that week, on 21 and 22 March.  We exchanged views on political developments in the United Kingdom.  We agreed that the best way to ensure an orderly withdrawal and protect the Good Friday Agreement was to ratify the withdrawal agreement.  We were clear that this is not open for renegotiation and that there can be no withdrawal agreement without the backstop.  We also agreed that if the UK were to change its red lines about the future relationship, then the European Union would be willing to amend the political declaration.  I expressed my appreciation to President Tusk for the strong leadership that he has shown throughout the Brexit negotiations and his support and understanding for Ireland.</p><p>In addition to Brexit, President Tusk and I discussed other items on the agenda of the March European Council, including jobs, growth and competitiveness, seeking to boost the European economy, which is showing some signs of slowing down; preparations for the EU-China summit; climate change; and efforts to combat disinformation, particularly in the run-in to the European elections.  President Tusk and I were accompanied by advisers and officials from our respective teams but we also met <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>in private.</p><p>I met President Macron in Paris on 2 April at his invitation.  Our discussions focused on Brexit in advance of the special meeting of the European Council, which is being held tomorrow.  We were both accompanied by advisers and officials from our respective teams but again, there was a <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>.  We exchanged views on recent developments in London and our shared priorities in advance of the special meeting of the European Council, which has been scheduled for 10 April.  President Macron and I discussed contingency planning at both EU and domestic level in the event of a no-deal exit.  We also exchanged views on bilateral relations between Ireland and France, which are excellent, and welcomed progress on the proposed Celtic interconnector for energy, and how we can develop links between our ports.  I appreciate the strong ongoing support of President Macron and my other EU counterparts with regard to Brexit.</p><p>I met Michel Barnier in Dublin yesterday in advance of the special European Council tomorrow.  We exchanged views on political developments in the United Kingdom and I expressed my sincere appreciation for the work of Monsieur Barnier and his team in having negotiated the withdrawal agreement with the United Kingdom.  I reiterated my view that this is the best way to ensure an orderly withdrawal.  I will continue to engage closely with EU member states and institutions with a view to protecting Ireland's interests and ensuring positive outcomes on Brexit and other issues.</p></reply>

It was and is an agreement that, despite the challenges that remain as a result of the partition of our country, we can collectively hold up as an illustration that tolerance and inclusivity are the way forward for our island.  Over the past two decades, our island has changed beyond recognition and for the better.  Regrettably, Brexit fundamentally alters the relationship between Ireland and Britain and threatens the progress that we have made over the past 21 years.  Yesterday, in London, I met with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.  I pressed him on the need to protect the Good Friday Agreement and to ensure that a hard border on the island of Ireland is avoided.  He fully understands and supports these imperatives.  I put it to him that these objectives must be met whether or not there is agreement and whether or not there is an extension of any duration.</p>  <p>  I thank the Taoiseach for his response in setting out some of the matters that he discussed with Messrs. Tusk, Macron and Michel Barnier.  What is the Taoiseach's understanding of Monsieur Macron's view of any extension that might be afforded, as requested by Mrs. May?  What, if any, measures do any of the parties, Michel Barnier or Donald Tusk, envisage to ensure the objectives of protection of the Good Friday Agreement, the avoidance of a hard border on our island and protections of citizens' rights, in the event of a crash or disorderly Brexit?</p></speech>

I acknowledge the receipt of the Taoiseach's letter last Friday evening with details on Brexit preparedness, which I had sought, along with others in the House, for quite some time.  That includes details of levels of business preparedness for a no-deal Brexit on 29 March.  The letter came after that date and contained information that was put in the public domain after 29 March.  It is fair to say that Mr. Donald Tusk has been very supportive and that support is welcome.  He has also called for patience.  Notwithstanding the fact that some European Union leaders are becoming impatient or are losing patience with the British political system, I think that an extension is clearly in Ireland's interest.  A no-deal exit would significantly damage the United Kingdom, Ireland and other EU countries.  It is in Ireland's interest to have as long an extension as possible.  There are clearly ramifications for the United Kingdom and the European Union elections.  We are in an unprecedented situation with a country leaving and then the onset of European elections, and whether that country participates in the Parliament for a period.  We have legislated to deal with that.  Did the Taoiseach have any discussions with Donald Tusk on Britain's continued participation in the Union after the European elections and the likely participation by the UK in those elections?</p><p>In terms of the Good Friday Agreement we must agree and I am somewhat concerned that there was a sense and attitude from the Government side and from all parties involved in the North that we should postpone any attempt to reinstate the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement in the North until after Brexit was dealt with.  That seems questionable because the only way to sustain the Good Friday Agreement is to live and work the institutions.  Their absence has been a contributory damaging factor to what has been a very difficult process on Brexit.  It seems to me there is no accountability in the North.  There is no voice for the anti-Brexit majority in the North and it is time, even in the context of Brexit, to push the parties very strongly for an immediate restoration of the Executive and the assembly so that dialogue can develop and people can be accountable to some parliament and executive in the North.</p></speech>

It is reported today that President Macron would support an extension not later than 31 December of this year.  I am confused about why an arbitrary date would be picked.  I am interested in the Taoiseach's views on this key issue.  I understood the real concerns were about an extension that went beyond the date of the European Parliament elections because there are consequences to that.  Now that Secretary Lidington has signed the orders to prepare for British participation in those elections, I do not understand why there would be any arbitrary date put beyond that rather than allow as much time as necessary.  There are concerns that Britain might be disruptive in the process after that, but it if is in the ring, if its members are there, they are participating in the election of the Commission President, the President of the Parliament and so on.  It is involved.  Would it not seem more logical to allow sufficient time, whatever time, for Britain to reconsider the position?  The tumult happening in Britain is evident to everybody.  Rather than the view that seems to be emerging there of, "We know what is going to happen is profoundly wrong, it will be damaging for all but let us do it", would it not be better to give as much space and time for calmer thought processes to prevail and to allow those decisions to be made in a rational way with a real prospect of Britain remaining a member of the European Union?  I would be interested to hear the Taoiseach's views on what exactly President Macron said about ports and shipping connections between Ireland and Britain, as the Taoiseach instanced.</p></speech>

He is saying he is willing to consider backing the deal as long as workers' rights and environmental and health standards are not undermined.  It is the headbanger politics on the right of the Tory party that have left us in this mess.  What is the European Union's attitude and the attitude of the Taoiseach towards the possibility of a general election in Britain?  If that becomes a prospect, that would be a very good thing for us and Europe.  Ireland should be very tolerant of creating the space for a general election that might change the political landscape in the direction of the left and of Mr. Corbyn in Britain because we would be looking at a far better opportunity for a deal that was not a crazy crash-out.</p>  <p>  I note from the Taoiseach's comments about meetings over recent days that there were more detailed discussions about arrangements for the Border issue and so on in the event of a crash-out, which we hope does not happen.  Will the Taoiseach elaborate on these because there is an anxiety, notwithstanding positive statements from European leaders, that in the event of a crash-out, Europe might push for Border infrastructure to protect the Single Market?</p></speech>

The UK is scheduled to crash out of the European Union, this Friday, 12 April.  The British Prime Minister, Theresa May, has suggested an extension to 30 June.  Donald Tusk has suggested a one-year extension.  What is the Taoiseach's thinking on this?  There will be pre-Council meeting statements later today.  In some member state parliaments the parliament plays a much bigger role in mandating the Head of State on these meetings.  Will the Taoiseach be forthcoming either now, or in the statements later, on the Irish position on an extension?  Does he agree that a long extension is far preferable to a crash-out Brexit?  I would welcome the Taoiseach's views.  Views are being sought throughout the EU.  I am sure the draft of the communiqu&eacute; is being put in place.  What is the Irish view of an extension?  Are we looking for a short-term or a long-term extension?</p></speech>

I am always reluctant in this House to act as a spokesperson for a Head of Government or, as in this case, Head of State, of another country.  I do not want to misquote or misrepresent him in any way but I think it is fair to say he is certainly open to it.  I have no reason to believe, despite some suggestions in some newspapers, that France would even consider vetoing it.  He certainly wants to know about conditionality, particularly the issue of the United Kingdom being involved in future decision-making.  If it is leaving, should it be involved in shaping the new Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, in the multi-annual financial framework, MFF, or in electing the next President of the Commission?  It is also fair to say that, as is the case in many European countries, people are increasingly concerned that Brexit is taking up so much of the EU agenda that it is causing other important work not to be done, and many countries are frustrated about that.</p>  <p>  I am confident that an extension will be agreed tomorrow at the European Council but there will be different views and there will be a discussion on the length of it and the conditionality connected to it.  The United Kingdom has only asked for an extension until 30 June.  If we were to offer a longer extension, what would that offer be?  Would it be that the UK must accept this longer extension or it must leave on Friday?  We will have to think this one through.  It is requesting an extension.  It does not want a crash-out on Friday.  If we are to offer a longer extension, it will have to be an offer that it is willing to accept because we do not want to cause a crash-out on Friday by only offering a long extension which it would then be forced to refuse.  I will need a bit of flexibility from the House and Government in getting that right.  In my discussion with Prime Minister May last night, she was very firm in saying that no matter how long the extension, the UK should be allowed to leave once it has ratified the withdrawal agreement and passed the necessary legislation.</p><p>Even if it was nine months, 12 months or 15 months, they would not have to stay in that long if they ratified the agreement and ratified the legislation it needs to do it could then leave earlier and that is a reasonable request from Prime Minister May.</p> <p> The Irish Government obviously prefers an extension to no deal and we have no objection to a long extension, but we need to bear in mind that if the extension is very long, certain dates in the withdrawal agreement start to be passed.  The withdrawal agreement has specific dates in it such as a date to agree on fisheries so once a certain point has been passed, the withdrawal agreement has to be amended and I would not like to see the withdrawal agreement opened up because one amendment can lead to another and that is something that we have to bear in mind when it comes to any extension.</p> <p> On the participation of the United Kingdom in the European elections, it will be required to take part in the European elections if they have not left the European Union by 22 May.  As I understand it, the European treaties say that it is the right of European citizens resident in the European Union to be represented in the European Parliament so we would have to amend the treaties in order to stop the elections happening in the UK and that is not feasible.  If they are in the European Union beyond 22 May, it certainly seems that they will have to take part in those elections although there are others who express the view that were they to leave before 30 June they still would not have to participate because the European Parliament does not sit until 2 July.  Either way, if they are staying they will have to participate in the European elections because EU citizens will still be EU citizens and therefore they have a right to have seats in the European Parliament.  There is a concern, however, about the European Parliament not being constituted legally.  If the United Kingdom were to stay a member of the European Union but not hold European elections, then there is a risk that the new European Parliament would not be legitimate and therefore would not be able to legislate and would not be able to agree to a new President of the European Commission and that would be a big problem for everyone, so that is a real concern.</p> <p> I very much agree that the Good Friday Agreement institutions should be re-established.  That is principally up to Sinn F&eacute;in and the DUP but the Government stands ready to assist in any way that it can as a co-guarantor of the agreement.</p> <p> The ports are an issue I raised in the meeting with President Macron.  I raised the possibility that we would need to enhance sea links between Ireland and France if there were delays in using the UK land bridge or if there were delays at Dover of course.  For some products it might make more sense to go directly from Ireland to France and that would logically be new or enhanced sea links between Cork and Rosslare and Cherbourg, Le Havre and some other ports but we did not get into much detail on that.  It will all really depend on demand.  I am told that there is already excess capacity on the existing lines.</p></speech>

I was pleased to welcome Chancellor Merkel to Dublin on Thursday, 4 April.  We had a very constructive and friendly meeting at Farmleigh House and our discussions focused mainly on Brexit, looking ahead to tomorrow's special European Council meeting.  Chancellor Merkel has been a strong and consistent ally of Ireland throughout the Brexit negotiations and I was pleased to be able to reiterate our gratitude to her in person.</p>  <p>  Both Ireland and Germany want the future relationship with the United Kingdom to be as close, comprehensive and ambitious as possible and we would like the withdrawal agreement, which represents a fair and balanced outcome to almost two years of difficult negotiations, ratified, so we can begin negotiations on a new economic and security partnership without delay.  We must, however, continue to prepare ourselves for all outcomes and therefore we discussed planning at EU and domestic level for no deal, including how we can work together to meet our twin objectives of protecting the Good Friday Agreement and protecting the integrity of the EU Single Market and customs union, on which our economic model, jobs and prosperity are founded.  On this the Chancellor expressed her understanding and support.</p>  <p>  Before our formal meeting, the Chancellor and I had an opportunity to meet with, and hear directly from people for whom the Border is a very real and live issue, people from communities along the Border, from business, and some whose lives have been profoundly touched and shaped by the Troubles.  I would like to express my appreciation to those who gave their time to explain why the issue is such a fundamental one and for sharing their stories with us.  The meeting served to underline, for both the Chancellor and me, the importance of what is at stake.  We also had the opportunity to take stock of wider EU developments ahead of the European Parliament elections in May and to discuss other international issues including EU-US trade and the events in Ukraine.  Our exchanges also acknowledged the excellent bilateral relations between Ireland and Germany, including our plans to open our new consulate in Frankfurt later this year to complement the embassy in Berlin.</p></reply>

She has experienced difficulties before at European level in various crises and she knows that a hard Brexit would be difficult for Europe as a whole, given the precarious nature of the European economy.  She is clearly anxious to avoid it.</p>  <p>  From what the Taoiseach said earlier, it seems to me that the British Prime Minister has indicated to him that she wants to give the withdrawal agreement one more go.  Is that the Taoiseach's sense?  A short extension is probably more preferable to the British Prime Minister than a long extension at this stage because a longer extension could have implications for her premiership and for the cohesion of her Cabinet, given that the majority of the Cabinet are apparently against a long extension.  We are in a very precarious situation in terms of British parliamentary politics and its governmental system.  Am I correct in saying that the sense is that the British Prime Minister will give the withdrawal agreement one more go?  Or alternatively, will she look to whatever emerges from her talks with the British Labour Party Leader because the Taoiseach said earlier that she indicated to him that if she manages to get the withdrawal treaty through, she would be anxious to leave the European Union as early as possible.</p></speech>

Several times we have got to the point of this being the defining week but one week will be the defining week and this may well be it.  In terms of the critical decision, and I understand the Taoiseach's explanation of how he will ultimately decide on the length of the extension, has the Taoiseach given up on the prospect or is it still the understanding that the optimum outcome is if the possibility existed for Britain to remain a member of the European Union?  My judgment on this, which is a political judgement and no more than that, is that given sufficient time that would be an achievable objective and the optimum objective.  In the absence of that, the withdrawal agreement is obviously the optimum option on the table.</p>  <p>  Since the Bill of Yvette Cooper MP has become an Act and received royal consent yesterday, parliament in Britain has declared clearly that it does not want a no deal exit.  It still can happen by accident because if no deal is in place and Britain runs up to the deadline for Article 50 to be triggered, then a disorderly fallout would happen by mistake.  We should provide sufficient time for Britain to think again.  Does the Taoiseach have a view on that matter and what tactics will he deploy with that objective in mind?</p></speech>

She showed empathy with the cause of preventing a hard border on this island.  On foot of the earlier question, there have been discussions about intensifying the detailed discussions on that outcome which we hope will not happen, can the Taoiseach tell us anything about the details of those negotiations?</p>  <p>  On the day of the Israeli election, where we have a government in Israel that is all about walls, borders, annexing people's territory, dividing people up and so on in the most brutal way, did the Taoiseach take any time to discuss that with Angela Merkel?</p><p>Germany is one of the most unflinching supporters of Israel and the most muted in criticising Israel for its mistreatment of the Palestinians.  Given her welcome comments about borders and walls in Germany and Ireland, she might take the same view in terms of Israeli walls in Palestine.</p></speech>

It is hard, when we look at Germany now and witness its political and economic strength, to imagine what it was like 30 years ago when it was divided, disunited and split by the iron curtain.  I very much welcomed the fact that Chancellor Merkel made the equivalence between any notion of hardening the border on the island of Ireland and the Berlin wall itself.  Politically, there is certainly a parallel.  A decision was taken by the European Council in Dublin Castle in April 1990 and, as a result of that decision, the EEC as it was then became an active persuader for the reunification of Germany, quite correctly.</p></speech>

Has he started that conversation?  I imagine it is a conversation in respect of which she could offer very valuable insights and perhaps some wisdom.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-04-09a.203" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1360" speakername="Se&aacute;n Haughey" time="16:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019040900020#S00500"><p>There was an expectation before the Taoiseach's meeting with Chancellor Merkel that she was going to be very strong on the issue of protecting the integrity of the Single Market and the customs union, even despite the other aim of protecting the Good Friday Agreement.  I think that expectation did not come to pass, but did Chancellor Merkel offer any practical suggestions or solutions to that major problem, having regard to her experience?  If the UK gets a longer extension to Article 50 and it contests the European Parliament elections, presumably it will be a full, legal member of the European Union, entitled to participate in the institutions and to make decisions along the same lines as other EU member states.  Would that be the Taoiseach's understanding of the situation as well?  They cannot be half in and half out.  It is either one or the other.</p></speech>

That is something we would welcome and support too.  Part of what the European Union is all about is preventing a race to the bottom.  In fact the European Union has caused us to raise labour and environmental standards across the Union.  Competition with a level playing field and high standards is what the European model is all about.  We would very much like the United Kingdom to still be part of that, should it agree to do so.</p>  <p>  In terms of the general election in the United Kingdom, that is really not my business so I would prefer not to comment on it.  I was asked about the Celtic interconnector.  That is an undersea electricity connection which will link Cork to Brittany.  It has been officially designated as an EU project of common interest, meaning it is an EU energy project of the highest importance.  We strongly back it, as it would create a direct electricity link between Ireland and continental Europe.  It also reflects our strong and deepening links with France.  Our national regulatory authorities are working closely on this and we should be in a position to sign a memorandum of understanding, MOU, between our two Governments in the near future.</p>  <p>  In my conversations with Prime Minister May, my impression is that she accepts that the withdrawal agreement is not up for renegotiation.  She is not seeking to reopen it and the focus of her talks with the Labour Party and other parties is very much on the future relationship.  If possible, she would like to come to an agreement with the main Opposition party which would allow the withdrawal agreement to be ratified.  Then we can go on to discuss the future relationship.  If not, it is intended to try to agree on a series of proposals with the Opposition which would then be put to a vote in Parliament.  She is committed to being bound by such a vote.  That is what is intended.</p>  <p>  Deputy Howlin asked me what I thought the optimal outcome would be.  I believe in the European Union and I believe that the United Kingdom is part of Europe.  The optimal outcome in my mind for Ireland and for Europe and the UK would be for the United Kingdom to remain.  However, we have to respect their democracy and their referendum.  They voted to leave.  We also have to respect the fact that Parliament voted not to have a second referendum.  That may change but it is none of our business really.  We have to respect the decisions of their Parliament and their people in a referendum.  In the absence of an option to remain, the withdrawal agreement is the best outcome for us and I think it can be achieved.  Whatever happens, if the United Kingdom does leave the European Union, and I expect that it will, I think we should always leave a light on for it should it ever decide to come back.  Ultimately, the United Kingdom is part of Europe and if it ever wishes to return, even if it is ten, 20 or 30 years' time, I think we should welcome it with open arms.</p></speech>

I emphasised the Government's commitment to being fair and impartial in working with all parties in Northern Ireland and particularly with individuals, groups, civic society, civic nationalism and civic unionism.  I met with Alliance Party leader, Naomi Long, and other senior party members during the evening.  We discussed a wide range of issues including the political situation and citizens' rights in Northern Ireland, and Brexit.  Prior to the Alliance Party dinner, I had the opportunity to meet with representatives from Northern Ireland business organisations to hear their views and concerns on the latest Brexit developments and the ongoing political impasse in Northern Ireland.  We discussed the all-island economy, challenges that businesses in Northern Ireland are facing and Brexit contingency planning being undertaken by the Irish Government.</p>  <p>  I last met with DUP leader, Arlene Foster, while in the United States last month for St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day.  We discussed the situation regarding Brexit, as it stood at the time, including prospects for the ratification by the UK of the withdrawal agreement.  We also discussed political developments in Northern Ireland, including the importance of the restoration of the institutions under the Good Friday Agreement.  I also spoke with Ms Foster at various events that we both attended.</p>  <p>  Previously, I met Arlene Foster and Sinn F&eacute;in vice president, Michelle O'Neill, when I travelled to Belfast on Friday, 8 February for a series of meetings with each of the five main political parties.  I also met with the UUP leader, Robin Swann; the Alliance Party leader, Naomi Long; and Colum Eastwood, leader of the SDLP, on that day.  These meetings provided an opportunity to engage with the Northern Ireland political parties and to hear their views on latest Brexit developments and on the current political situation in the North.  We discussed what could be done to get the institutions up and running again.  Once again, I emphasised the Government&rsquo;s commitment to all aspects of the Good Friday Agreement and our continuing determination to secure the effective operation of all of its institutions.  The Government wants to see an agreement in place to secure the operation of the devolved institutions and we will continue to engage with the British Government and the political parties in Northern Ireland to seek to progress that in the period immediately ahead.</p>  <p>  On Brexit, I outlined to each of the Northern Ireland parties the Government's position, shared by the EU, that the withdrawal agreement is not open for renegotiation and represents the best way to secure an orderly Brexit while avoiding a return to a hard border.  We also discussed the negative implications of a no-deal outcome for Northern Ireland business and farmers.</p>  <p>  For completeness, I would like also to add that I spoke with Claire Hanna, Jeffrey Donaldson and Naomi Long when they attended the Fine Gael Party conference in Wexford on 23 March 2019.</p></reply>

However, in the case of Emma DeSouza, a Derry-born Irish citizen, which was highlighted last week, it appears that the goalposts have been moved by the British Government, with new immigration rules introduced on 7 March.  Under those rules it is stated in future, "dual British nationals who are British by birth will not be considered an EEA national in the UK".  Ms DeSouza and other Irish citizens have been told that in order to access an EU right of residence for her US husband she must renounce her British citizenship which she acquired automatically at birth but never sought.  Has the Taoiseach raised this matter either with the British authorities or with Mr. Barnier when he was here yesterday?  </p></speech>

It is somewhat surprising that almost a month has gone by without a meeting, especially given the significance of some of the votes in Westminster since then and the narrow margins by which some were won and lost.  It is surprising that he has not had more substantive discussions with the leader of the DUP and others.  I accept that he has met the leader of the Alliance Party and others.  In the context of the restoration of the Executive and the Assembly, the politics of Northern Ireland and the need to get the Good Friday Agreement up and running, and indeed Brexit, he should have ascertained what the issues are.  When one particular vote was defeated following the advice of the British Attorney General, Geoffrey Cox, there was some indication in advance that there had been movement from the DUP.  It would be interesting if light could be shed on why negotiations prior to the vote did not succeed in getting the withdrawal treaty over the line.  Some of the votes since then have been narrowly defeated.  Was there any sounding out of the DUP position by the Government?  Where does the DUP stand now?</p></speech>

Not only that, people now have to pay the princely sum of &pound;400 in order to renounce a Britishness that does not pertain to them.  This case has caused very considerable anger right across the North of Ireland and beyond.  The astonishing thing is that the British Prime Minister, Theresa May, may have told the Taoiseach that this is an anomaly, that the Home Office is aware of it and that it needs to sort it out, yet the British state is pursuing Ms DeSouza through the courts.</p></speech>

The <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i>of the DUP is to maintain political sectarianism, even if it has self-defeating consequences and leads to a hard border or something else.  We could more usefully talk about the social and economic transformation of this island in a progressive direction and things that can unite people North and South.  One of the most obvious ways to do that is the extension of abortion rights to women in the North.  Did the Taoiseach have any discussions with any of the people he engaged with on issues such as that?</p></speech>

Has the Taoiseach made arrangements for training for those responsible for customs and excise in the North, presumably in locations distant from the Border, with their counterparts in the Republic?  Has the Government made progress on recruiting the promised extra customs staff, given that there are only 210 customs staff for all of the counties on the Border?</p></speech>

I have not raised it personally with the Prime Minister, but I believe the T&aacute;naiste has raised it with his counterparts in discussions.  As far as the Government is concerned, the Good Friday Agreement is explicit on this matter.  People have the right to be British or Irish or both and to be accepted as such.  That applies, and should apply, to both Governments, in our view.</p>  <p>  We have regular discussions with the DUP at political level and advisory level.  The relationship is good and we understand its position very well.  It is that Northern Ireland should leave the European Union on the same terms as the rest of the UK and there should be no difference between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.  That is its position, and it has never demurred from it.  It is a misunderstanding to believe it is open to persuasion on these matters but that is not to say that we do not talk regularly or that we do not have an understanding.  We do.  </p>  <p>  Issues such as abortion and marriage equality are regularly discussed when I meet political leaders in Northern Ireland or when I am in Northern Ireland and speaking to everyday people.  Of course, decisions on those matters should be made in Northern Ireland by the Executive and the Assembly, and are not decisions for us to make for them.  </p>  <p>  I do not know the details of any customs training programmes.  I will ask the Revenue Commissioners to reply to Deputy Burton on that matter.  In terms of staffing levels, I am told that Revenue had just over 100 staff dedicated to customs and trade facilitation functions at the start of September last year.  In addition to the staff assigned to trade facilitation work, there are approximately 120 staff in ports and airports who are responsible for ensuring compliance with customs procedures.  In the context of Brexit, the Government approved the phased recruitment of 600 extra Revenue staff in September, and in preparation for a no-deal Brexit, Revenue has accelerated and expanded its recruitment and training schedules to meet the end of March deadline.  It is now on track to have over 400 additional staff in place.  Existing staff have been reassigned and preparations are being made for any necessary further redeployments on a temporary basis.  The balance of additional staff will have to be recruited by the end of this year.  Activities are being co-ordinated across the Government to ensure optimal trade facilitation at the ports and airports.  </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-04-09a.229" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="16:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019040900021#T01000"><p>Tomorrow I will attend a special meeting of the European Council in Brussels.  This meeting, which will take place in Article 50 format, was convened by President Donald Tusk following the rejection of the withdrawal agreement by the UK Parliament on 29 March.</p>  <p>  At the last European Council, on 21 March, we agreed to extend the Article 50 deadline until 22 May, provided the withdrawal agreement had been ratified.  If it had not been ratified, we agreed to extend it until 12 April, by which time the UK should outline an alternative way forward.  As part of this, Prime Minister May wrote to President Tusk last Friday requesting a further extension until 30 June 2019, in order to pursue cross-party talks with the objective of finding a way forward.</p>  <p>  From our perspective, the British Prime Minister&rsquo;s letter is a positive step.  It offers welcome assurances that the UK will prepare for the European Parliament elections and will hold them if the UK has not left the EU by 22 May.  Importantly, from our perspective, the Prime Minister acknowledges that the withdrawal agreement cannot be changed, and that any solution must respect that agreement in its entirety. </p>  <p>  The EU has always stated that the withdrawal agreement, which includes the backstop, cannot be renegotiated.  It is the outcome of almost two years of difficult negotiations between the EU and Ireland and the UK.  It represents a finely balanced compromise, including the challenge of the UK leaving the EU without giving rise to the return of a hard border on the island of Ireland.</p><p>Our ambition is to see a future relationship which is so deep that the backstop will never need to be triggered.  However, until this happens, it is needed as an insurance policy to protect the Good Friday Agreement and ensure there will be no hard border on our island.  It has been obvious for some time that the solution to break the deadlock lies in London and that the impasse there can only be resolved at Westminster.  It is welcome that cross-party talks are under way and that the focus is on the shape of the future relationship.  When I spoke by telephone to the British Prime Minister, Mrs. May, last night, we discussed the latest developments, including the cross-party talks.  I hope those involved will be able to build sufficient consensus to ratify the withdrawal agreement, thereby allowing the transition period to take effect and enabling an orderly Brexit to occur.</p> <p> Our focus tomorrow at the European Council will be on the question of a further extension.  We are conscious of the British Prime Minister&rsquo;s request for an extension until 30 June.  We will also take into account any additional request that might come from the cross-party talks in London.  As President Tusk said, we should continue to show patience.  The talks in London are likely to require some time.  It would be damaging for everyone if the United Kingdom was to crash out of the European Union without a deal on 12 April.  From Ireland's perspective, we are open to extending the deadline to allow time for the discussions to run their course and conclude.  From our perspective, three things are crucial: a decision must be based on a coherent and realisable plan; any extension must not be used to try to reopen the withdrawal agreement; and the talks in London must focus on the shape of the future relationship.</p> <p> In the past week I have spoken to many of my EU counterparts about Brexit and the matters for discussion at the European Council tomorrow.  On Tuesday, 2 April, I met President Macron in Paris, while last Thursday Chancellor Merkel visited me in Dublin.  I also met Michel Barnier, the EU chief Brexit negotiator, during his visit to Dublin yesterday.  I had discussions with the Prime Ministers of Luxembourg, Malta and the Netherlands and will make some more calls this evening.  There will be a preparatory meeting of the EPP Heads of Government before the summit tomorrow.  These have all been very positive and constructive conversations.  We were all in agreement that the best way to ensure an orderly withdrawal and protect the Good Friday Agreement was to ratify the withdrawal agreement.  We were adamant that it was not open for renegotiation and that there could be no withdrawal agreement without the protocol on Ireland.  As Members know, during her visit Chancellor Merkel participated in a round-table discussion with people from Northern Ireland and the Border counties.  It was an opportunity to hear their perspectives on the impact any return to a hard border would have on Border communities and business, even if it were to happen gradually over time.  The Chancellor and my other interlocutors understand these concerns very well and fully recognise the importance of the backstop as an insurance policy but also as a mechanism to set a floor under the future relationship, giving us an enduring assurance that whatever may happen in the future as a consequence of Brexit, a hard border is not one of them.</p> <p> I took the opportunity during my meetings with Chancellor Merkel, President Macron and Michel Barnier and my phone conversations with other EU leaders to reiterate Ireland&rsquo;s appreciation of their solidarity and understanding throughout the Brexit negotiations.  The European Union has consistently recognised the unique position of Northern Ireland and the unique situation in which it has been put by the decision of the United Kingdom to leave the Union, noting that Northern Ireland voted to remain.  The European Union has always maintained that, should the UK red lines change, we would be prepared to amend the political declaration on the future relationship.  I sincerely hope it will be possible to build sufficient consensus at Westminster to enable ratification of the withdrawal agreement and an orderly Brexit thereafter.  From Ireland&rsquo;s perspective, we are open to extending the deadline to allow time for the discussions to run their course and come to a conclusion.  Above all, we want the withdrawal agreement to be ratified in order that negotiations can begin on a future relationship which I hope and expect will be a new economic partnership between the United Kingdom and the European that is as close as can be achieved.  I also think it will be a close security partnership.</p> <p> All of this will be discussed at the European Council tomorrow.  There will be different views, but I am confident that we will reach agreement.  However, given the ongoing uncertainty in London, we need to continue our preparations for a no deal Brexit.  The people and businesses deserve reassurance and security.  Therefore, we have ramped up our planning at home and at EU level for all outcomes and this work will continue to intensify.  Brexit will have negative consequences in all scenarios but most acutely if there is no deal.  We will be as ready as we can be.  This work is not new.  We have been preparing for well over two years.  In the last three budgets supports were introduced to help businesses and farmers to prepare for Brexit.  A comprehensive contingency action plan is in place.  It is a whole-of-government response, working in tandem with the European Union to implement measures to mitigate the impact of a no deal Brexit.</p> <p> We have regular discussions at the Cabinet, including today.  The T&aacute;naiste has chaired regular stakeholder meetings.  We are working to ensure ports and airports will be ready to deal with new customs and trade controls.  The necessary infrastructure, staffing and ICT, will be in place to ensure trade flows will continue, although some disruption is inevitable.</p> <p> The President signed the Brexit omnibus Act on 19 March and it became law.  It has been designed to protect citizens, the economy and jobs, particularly in the sectors that will be most exposed to Brexit.  It complements measures in place at EU level, including contingency actions on air connectivity and road haulage.  It also reflects our focus on protecting the Good Friday Agreement, North-South co-operation and building an all-island economy.</p> <p> We have taken actions to maintain and strengthen the common travel area between Ireland and the United Kingdom, ensuring people in Northern Ireland can continue to access the European health insurance card and that third level students will continue to access the Erasmus+ higher education programme.  We have been engaging with the European Commission on the support that would be required in a no-deal scenario, including for the agrifood sector.</p> <p> On the Border, a no-deal outcome would not change our priorities which are to protect the Good Friday Agreement; to avoid a hard border; and to protect the integrity of the Single Market on which the economy and our economic model are founded.  As co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement, the Irish and British Governments continue to have obligations.  We will continue to work together to ensure peace and stability in Northern Ireland.  The United Kingdom&rsquo;s own papers state that in a no-deal scenario they would quickly need talks with the European Union and Ireland to get a deal to avoid a hard border.  For us, the backstop would be the starting point for these discussions.  There is no better solution; there are no alternative arrangements.  We are in close contact with the Commission on how best in a no-deal scenario to meet our shared objectives of protecting the Good Friday Agreement and avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland, while also protecting the integrity of the Single Market and the customs union, ensuring we would not be dragged out of the Single Market by a decision made in the United Kingdom.  Our contacts with the Commission on this issue have intensified in recent weeks.  The Commission and our EU partners fully understand the challenges and are supportive and understanding in finding a way forward.  Should there be no deal, they will be shared challenges between the European Union and Ireland.  Our greatest protection against the challenges Brexit will bring is, of course, our EU membership.  The European Union is a home that we have helped to build.  Ireland was a founder member of the euro and the Single Market and is a member of the customs union.  Irrespective of what happens, we will stay at the heart of Europe.</p></speech>

Two weeks after the date on which the United Kingdom was due to leave the European Union, there are some hopes something may emerge at Westminster which will be acceptable to the European Union and can win the support of a majority in the House of Commons.  The passage last night of legislation designed to make a no-deal scenario less likely was very welcome.  However, in concrete terms, it has achieved little beyond reaffirming what has been clear since January - the opposition of the House of Commons to a no-deal Brexit.  We are still confronted by the major issue of for how long the process can carry on and what the final permanent relationship with the United Kingdom will be.  There is no more clarity on this issue today than there has been at any stage and new concerns have arisen about various options on the length of any new extension which might be agreed to tomorrow night.</p>  <p>  It has been Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s consistent position that the damage threatened by a no-deal Brexit would be too severe to allow it to happen.  We have, therefore, argued for and strongly supported the flexibility shown by the European Council at the last summit, at which it was clear there was tension between those who were emphasising the need for the European Union to move on from Brexit and those who were emphasising the need for further patience and openness to a potentially longer term extension.  The risk that impatience would lead to a rapid no-deal Brexit was real.  Therefore, it was very welcome when key leaders compromised and accepted the need to prevent a Brexit crash-out on 29 March, even if it meant more uncertainty.</p>  <p>  What was supposed to be the final Brexit summit tomorrow is highly unlikely to be so.  The task for the summit, as determined by President Tusk, is to consider how much time the British Government should be given to reach the point where the withdrawal agreement can be ratified and an amended political declaration can be sought.  Obviously, the best outcome for us would be for the United Kingdom to either hold a referendum to remain or to quickly ratify the agreement and seek a much closer connection with the European Union than the free trade agreement proposed last year.</p><p>It has been established for some time that simply reaching an agreement with the British Government is not enough and that most speculation about voting in Westminster is nothing more than speculation.  Therefore, there are many legitimate points of view on the length and scope of an extension.  We support the idea of offering any extension required to enable a process which has a credible chance of reaching a concrete conclusion.  Whether it be a short or a long extension or the sort of flexible extension which President Tusk has proposed, it remains absolutely the case that the European Union should do whatever it takes in the context of an extension to avoid the damage of a chaotic Brexit.</p> <p> It is, however, important for Ireland to acknowledge that an extension which requires the United Kingdom to hold elections to the European Parliament carries a potentially dramatic downside which we need to help to manage.  A long extension may be the best option, but let us not pretend it is an easy option.   The opinion of President Macron and some other leaders that such a scenario threatens to destabilise the elections and radicalise some contests is one we have to take seriously.  Therefore, if the summit agrees to maintain the demand for the UK to hold the elections, it must also agree some initiative to tackle the backlash.</p> <p> The threat from extreme forces and radicalised anti-EU rhetoric is one which must not be ignored and it must be challenged.  It has been suggested that the elections could be avoided even if the withdrawal agreement has not been ratified if the United Kingdom were to adopt some measure such as a referendum to ratify an outcome and this brought with it a certain conclusion to the Article 50 process.  We have not seen any legal opinions on this and alternative scenarios, but it is one which we would support if it were legal and it could avoid undermining the European elections.  Those elections are more important than they have been at any stage in the past 40 years.  They should be a direct fight between those who believe in the European Union and want it to work better for their citizens and those who seek to undermine it and have opposed it relentlessly.  The elections should be about where we go once Brexit is finished, and anything which can make this happen should be endorsed by Ireland.</p> <p> I would say, as an aside, that if it is the case given recent reports that Fine Gael intends to campaign on the basis that people should vote Fine Gael to, as it were, back the backstop, it would be almost breathtakingly cynical.  Given the cross-party support and lobbying for Northern Ireland from even before the early negotiating guidelines were drawn up, any attempt to exploit European Union solidarity with Ireland for partisan interests would simply confirm that for this Government, politics always comes first.</p></speech>

That is the T&aacute;naiste's party's campaign slogan.  An extension beyond this week is inevitable in all circumstances and this gives Ireland more time to prepare.  I acknowledge that the Taoiseach has sent me a lengthy letter on the issue of no-deal preparations following regular requests from me for this information over recent months.  Unfortunately, the letter contains no information that was not already in the public domain.</p>  <p>  On 29 March, 50% of businesses identified by the Revenue Commissioners as trading with the United Kingdom had not completed the first step of commercial registration.  This is much worse than was expected when figures were released early last year showing the lack of follow-through from information to action on Brexit preparations.  On 29 March, less than 10% of the funds in the main Brexit loan instrument were awarded.  Just as seriously, in the past two weeks a wide range of basic and fundamental notices about what different sectors must do in a no-deal situation have been issued every day.  This information is being published, the Government says, because businesses need to be ready, which raises the obvious question of why this information was not distributed in the week of 29 March when the United Kingdom came perilously close to a no-deal Brexit?</p>  <p>  Whatever further delay is agreed tomorrow has to be followed by a completion of no-deal preparation so that we will be genuinely ready for any eventuality.  We also need some assurance about the process which will follow any final agreement.  Under the withdrawal agreement, the backstop is contingent on the European Union engaging with the United Kingdom in good faith on issues related to the Irish Border.  What is the process to be followed in this and what arrangements are being contemplated?  Are they in some way related to the company and ports-based measures briefed to the media last week?</p>  <p>  Of course, the damage being caused to Ireland by the absence of the Northern Assembly and Executive continues.  The people of Northern Ireland have been left without a voice at this dramatic moment in their history because their democratic institutions were collapsed two years ago over a heating scheme which appears to have lost a fraction of what it was originally claimed to have lost.  The threat of imposing direct rule in Northern Ireland is unacceptable and we need a serious effort to break the impasse.  I have said time and again that it is incomprehensible that we do not have the institutions up and running in the North given this dramatic moment in the history of the island and the implications for jobs and livelihoods as a result of the Brexit issue.</p>  <p>  This summit confirms again that those who were demanding that we collapse this D&aacute;il and Government and spend months on campaigning and Government formation were wrong.  Ireland&rsquo;s position is strong because Europe knows that Ireland's approach is based on a broad consensus established in mid-2016 and strengthened continually.  There are no circumstances in which Brexit will end any time soon.  If everything works out, we will still have nearly two years of new Brexit negotiations to undertake, and the economic hurt caused by Brexit will continue.  The fall in sterling has directly undermined many businesses, particularly smaller indigenous firms which are reliant on the United Kingdom market alone.  We cannot wait for finality from London.  We need much greater urgency in helping businesses and communities which are already hurting from Brexit and are scared of what lies ahead.  As we have before, we will support any reasonable proposal from the summit which protect the European Union and limits the damage of Brexit.  The fact that this summit has to be held at all is a failure of the process and of the United Kingdom's political establishment.  We should all hope that what emerges from the summit moves the core issues to a resolution and does not just move the can one step down the road.</p></speech>

Once again, the European Council meets tomorrow to discuss the Brexit debacle and specifically to discuss another request by the British Prime Minister, Theresa May, for an extension to the Article 50 process.  Brexit was a bad decision made worse by the refusal of the British Government to deal with the reality of the needs of Ireland, its failure to meet its own commitments, and a startling lack of understanding of the rules-based nature of the European Union.  The approach by the British Government has only created greater uncertainty and instability, and that approach continues to this day, because despite the speculation, the commentary and the Westminster drama, the British Government and Parliament are in reality no closer to accepting the withdrawal agreement.  While we all wish to avoid a crash or disorderly Brexit, we have to accept that that is, sadly, a real prospect or possibility.  At this 11th hour we need to ask that logic and rationality might finally prevail.</p>  <p>  Any extension must maintain pressure on the British Government to deliver the withdrawal agreement, with all of its limitations, because our citizens, businesses and society require certainty and stability.  Therefore, any extension, whatever its duration, must be an extension with a purpose.  The important thing is not the granting of the extension to Article 50 in and of itself.  The important and potentially significant thing is where any extension might lead in respect of Brexit and its impact on our country.  We must remain steadfast in that view.</p>  <p>  The withdrawal agreement, and the Irish protocol and backstop in particular, must be honoured as the least worst option for our island and it cannot be renegotiated or picked apart in any way.  What the withdrawal agreement offers, and I made this case to the Labour Party leadership in Britain yesterday, is a deal that mitigates against some of the worst aspects of Brexit for Ireland.</p><p>It is a means of upholding, in some way, the democratic will of the majority of the people of the North who voted to remain, as well as the majority view of people in the South who do not want a hard border on this island under any circumstances.  Neither the withdrawal agreement nor the backstop are the perfect answer to Brexit for Ireland.  In any event, our country, our island, will incur damage.  It is a matter of degree and extent.</p> <p> A no-deal scenario is in nobody&rsquo;s interests, whether in Dublin, London, Belfast, Cork or Derry.  It is something none of us wants to see.  In the absence of an agreement and the backstop, there is no way of guaranteeing that there will be no return to a hard border, that citizens&rsquo; rights will be protected or that the Good Friday Agreement will be upheld in all of its parts.  I have set out on many occasions to the British Prime Minister what must happen if there is no deal and, therefore, no backstop.  I set out very clearly that in the event of no deal, what we will require is a backstop because the protections required and committed to for Ireland must be honoured in full.  I also said to her that in the event of no deal and a crash out, then the constitutional question looms large and it must be put to the people of the North by way of a referendum.  That is essential.  The Taoiseach and the Government must also now articulate that view because the onus must be on the Irish Government and on us in this D&aacute;il always to defend and promote an all-island view.  That has, regrettably, been lacking in challenging times during the course of this State&rsquo;s history.  It is not enough to say that no Irish Government will ever leave the North behind.  Deeds in this context say much more than words.  I once again press the Taoiseach on the need to prepare for change, and that preparation must include the convening of an all-Ireland forum on Irish unity as well the preparation of a White Paper on Irish unity.  That work should be initiated immediately, deal or no deal.</p> <p> If there is an extension to the Article 50 process, then it is inevitable there will be elections to the European Parliament in a couple of weeks in the North.  Sinn F&eacute;in will be there.  We will contest, as we always do, and we will give the people an opportunity to vote for a candidate who will stand for their interests and who has stood for their interests, for Ireland&rsquo;s interests and against the efforts of the Brexiteers and the DUP to ride roughshod over the Good Friday Agreement, over progress and over people's rights.  I take this opportunity to invite all of the other parties here to do likewise.  They can be vocal when it comes to criticising Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s record in the North, as they see it, so let them avail of this opportunity and put their own pitch to the people of the North.</p></speech>

Angela Merkel has publicly backed the idea of creating what she calls a "real, true" army for the European Union.  She said the EU "will have to create a European intervention unit with which Europe can act on the ground where necessary".  This echoed similar comments by Jean-Claude Juncker who said "a common European army would show the world that there would never again be war in Europe".  This is an increasingly worrying development.  Having a militarised EU and an EU army is not the way to ensure we do not have war in Europe.  I would say the last thing the world needs is an increasingly militarised EU.</p>  <p>  In recent years, the European army agenda has been increasing at rapid pace.  This agenda includes increased military and defence budgets as well as moves towards a European defence union.  This includes a vast increase in funding for military purposes.  Post 2020, these funds will go from &euro;500 million to &euro;13 billion, a 2,000% increase, and this is on top of a 180% increase for internal EU security and a 260% increase for migration and borders.</p>  <p>  The people I represent and meet, the people the Taoiseach claims to speak to, although I do not believe he represents them, are ordinary working people who find it hard to make ends meet.  They are people who work and who struggle to pay mortgages and meet the costs of childcare and sending their children to education.  They do not want their taxpayers' money, the money they earn, spent on a militarised EU.  They want taxpayers' money spent on increasing public services and reducing the cost of living for those working people, who get up early in the morning, as the Taoiseach said, and go out and work.</p>  <p>  This EU agenda of militarising Europe is not supported by the majority of people who live in this State and, I would argue, across the island.  Peacekeeping and having EU peacekeeping operations is something we and the majority of people support.  The figures I have given and the increased military spend, however, are not in the interests of smaller nations such as Ireland.  While the Taoiseach may have his own view, and his party is entitled to its view, it is my clear understanding that the majority of Irish people support Irish neutrality and the majority, North and South, do not want to see a European army.  Whether it is the view of Guy Verhofstadt, of Jean-Claude Juncker, or of any of these federalists who want a more federal Europe, a European army, and more taxpayers' money from Ireland and elsewhere spent on a militarised Europe, it is not something we should support.  It is not something we in Sinn F&eacute;in will support and I do not believe it is something the Irish people will support.  We have a Private Members' motion on Irish neutrality this evening and these issues will be debated.  It is an issue that surfaces again at the European Council meeting and it is something that will concern many people across the island of Ireland.</p></speech>

As we know, the UK was meant to leave the European Union on 29 March but its Parliament was unable either to support the withdrawal agreement or to support any alternative to it.  Prime Minister May sought an extension to this coming Friday, 12 April, to maximise leverage on Parliament to vote for a withdrawal agreement, but Parliament has again rejected it.  It has also overwhelmingly rejected leaving the EU without a deal, however, so Prime Minister May has once again asked for an extension, on this occasion until June.</p>  <p>  UK politics, quite simply, is stuck in a bind.  Theresa May is leading a minority Administration and many people are openly speculating now that she has only weeks left of her premiership.  The Conservative and Labour parties are deeply divided on the issue of Brexit, as are the British people as a whole.  The British Government has agreed to prepare to hold European Parliament elections, which are due to take place across the Union between 23 and 26 May, even though British MEPs may not take up their seats.  Many European leaders have expressed their frustration at this stop-start process, which is understandable.  They are angry that the UK&rsquo;s political chaos is interfering with normal EU business.  We have many other important issues to address, such as climate change, migration and the need for decent standards for workers across the Union.  There are two schools of thought on the extension.  Some, like Guy Verhofstadt, the leader of the ALDE liberal group, to which Fianna F&aacute;il belongs, have cautioned that any long extension will create prolonged uncertainty in the EU.  Others have gone as far as to say that the UK might interfere with the EU&rsquo;s budget process or trade policy in a damaging, interfering and obstructive way.  On the other hand, Council President, Donald Tusk, has taken a much softer approach with his proposal for a one-year flexible extension which would permit the UK to leave at a time during the year if it finally can get Parliament to agree to terms acceptable to the other EU partners for its departure.</p>  <p>  In my judgment, there are two fundamentals that should inform us on whether to advocate for a long or a short extension.  First, what is in Ireland&rsquo;s best interest?  Second, what relationship with the EU is likely to attract majority support within the UK?</p><p>It is clear that in Ireland&rsquo;s national interest we must take all possible measures to avoid a no-deal scenario in which the United Kingdom will suddenly exit the European Union.  As we have said during Taoiseach's Questions, this could happen by accident or by design.  A no-deal Brexit would be most damaging to the economy, with some sectors being completely devastated as a result.  Many thousands of jobs would be at risk in such a scenario.  On that basis it seems a longer extension would be in the national interest.  We also do not want to see use of the guillotine at the end of a long extension.  We do not want to reach a sudden impasse.  If the United Kingdom has still not made up its mind after one year, we do not want a no-deal Brexit to happen by default on a date picked from the air.  </p> <p> There was a strong demographic factor at work in the 2016 referendum in the United Kingdom, with older people more inclined to vote to leave and younger people much more likely to vote to remain.  That is a simple fact.  Judged objectively, the longer the extension the more likely it is that the majority of the British people will coalesce to remain.  For all of these reasons, a long extension would seem to fit best with Ireland&rsquo;s interests and the middle ground of British public opinion which appears to be shifting, as we have seen in many articles in recent days. </p> <p> My proposal is that we support a long extension.  I will be making this same proposal tomorrow in Brussels when I meet socialist Prime Ministers and other Labour Party leaders in advance of the European Council meeting.  My judgment, on which I am interested in hearing the Taoiseach's view, is that we should offer the United Kingdom a five-year flexible extension, to last for the term of the next European Parliament and the next cycle of officers within the European Union.  We should offer this to the United Kingdom without a range of preconditions or caveats on the basis that we expect it to honour its obligations as a full member, until and unless it actually comes to an agreement to leave.  We have the same expectations for all member states, including those headed by far-right nationalists.  We should not confuse our frustration with the UK Government with our real and enduring ability to co-operate and do business with the United Kingdom now and in the future.  The five-year extension could be flexible, in identical fashion to the flexible one-year proposal made by President Donald Tusk.  The United Kingdom could leave during the five-year period if it comes to an agreement on the terms of its departure.  A five-year extension would also make it clear to it that we were not going to keep pandering to it on short-term issues, crisis after crisis and month after month.  We are not going to keep calling special emergency summits of EU leaders and clearing the European agenda to deal with this one issue.  Any new UK proposal could be dealt with at the regular quarterly European Council meetings.</p> <p> I have been thinking about this matter in some detail.  If we offer anything less than a five-year extension, all EU institutions and member states will be constantly looking over their shoulders to gauge the United Kingdom's current level of commitment and second-guess its suggestions in case they are designed to undermine the European Union&rsquo;s best interests.  We should not choose an extension based on speculation about who might be the next UK Prime Minister.  We should not make decisions based on a suspicion about what he or she might or might not do.  Instead, we should build on 40 years of close co-operation between Britain and the European Union.  We should give the United Kingdom a long and open-ended period in which to reflect on its vision for its future in the light of the negotiations that have taken place in the past three years.</p> <p> There is the notion of an arbitrary date being picked.  It is speculated that President Macron suggested the end of December.  Why pick a date and then have another crisis?  If we get over the hump of the European elections - it is a real issue - with the United Kingdom participating as a full member, let us allow it to be a full member and offer the flexibility to enable it to think again if that is what it wants.  If it does decide to leave during the five-year period, such a long extension will remove the needless rolling crisis and the constant drama we have endured for more than a year.  It will allow us to build close relationships.  Such an extension will help to prevent the damage to jobs and livelihoods now threatened week in and week out.  If the United Kingdom does not leave during the five-year period, we should deem its Article 50 notification to have expired and its membership of the European Union to be normalised again.</p> <p> Some will say the United Kingdom staying in the European Union after June will lead to a group of wreckers in the European Parliament.  It is said Mr. Nigel Farage's new Brexit Party and other Eurosceptic extremists will be elected in Britain and take their seats in the European Parliament.  In my judgment the United Kingdom will also send an equally strong cohort of pro-EU MEPs.  The threat from the British far right is hardly greater than the threat from Germany&rsquo;s Alternative f&uuml;r Deutschland, the newly rebranded French National Front and all of the other extremists who will be standing for election in May, many of whom are likely to be elected.  We need to face the far-right challenge to the next European Parliament, but let us face this threat with our British comrades and friends, rather than painting a false stereotype of modern British politics.  It is a radical proposal, but in my judgment a five-year extension would give the best possible chance to those in the United Kingdom who wish to remain in the European Union to develop a stable and persuasive majority public opinion.  Let us give them a real chance to succeed in that objective.</p></speech>

It is very welcome and long overdue that Prime Minister Theresa May has moved away from trying to engage or have reason to prevail with the headbangers on the Tory right like Mr. Boris Johnson, MP; Mr. Jacob Rees-Mogg, MP, and the European Research Group, ERG.  They are driven by their own personal ambitions, a really rotten nostalgia for Britain's imperial greatness as they imagine it, little Englandism and xenophobia.  As they were never likely to listen to reason, it is welcome that Mrs. May has started to engage with Mr. Jeremy Corbyn, MP, notwithstanding the tendency of people both here and in Britain to malign him for his left-wing views.  This engagement actually offers the possibility of a deal being done because Mr. Corbyn does not want a race-to-the-bottom Brexit of the sort the Tory right wants.  It is noteworthy that the issues he is raising in his engagement with Mrs. May are ones that really matter to British people and people across Europe, issues such as workers' rights, health and safety standards and so on.  He is saying clearly that he wants a deal that would not undermine these standards.  Left-wing politics of Mr. Corbyn's kind are precisely about raising standards in areas such as workers' rights and environmental ambitions, opposing militarism and promoting an egalitarian and progressive agenda.  They are quite alien to Mrs. May and will make her reluctant to do a deal with Mr. Corbyn, but there is a glimmer of hope.  The best hope, however, lies in having a general election in Britain to remove the Tories and open the way for a left-wing Government with politics of the kind Mr. Corbyn is articulating.</p>  <p>  It is welcome that the clear message from here to the European Union is that in no circumstances can a hard border in Ireland be considered for any reason and it seems to be having an impact.</p><p>I hope we can trust our European counterparts in the event of a no-deal Brexit, which we hope will not come to pass, and that they will not intend to put pressure on us to impose border infrastructure between the North and South, something that should be hotly resisted if there is any attempt to do it.  It would seem that the message at least from here is clear in that regard.</p> <p> I wish to move on to some other issues, which the Taoiseach will probably not have much time to discuss at the European Council but it would be remiss not to mention given the day that is in it, that is, the Israeli general election.  I made the point to the Taoiseach earlier that it is a very positive thing for Angela Merkel to come here and say that the bitter experience of the Berlin Wall and the division of East Germany, which ended with the wall being pulled down in 1989, led her to somewhat empathise with our concerns and opposition to a hard border North and South.  That is a positive development, but Europe is failing to take the same attitude when it comes to the walls and borders brutally imposed by Israel, and in particular by the Netanyahu Government on the Palestinian people.  We are seeing the rottenness of Israeli politics manifest in a particularly repugnant way in recent weeks and months.  The talk by Mr. Netanyahu of annexing further illegal settlements on Palestinian territory follows the acceptance by the United States of the annexation of the Golan Heights.  All of those things completely fly in the face of international law, yet the European Union does nothing about it.</p> <p> An Israeli lawyer came into my clinic in the past week who represents Palestinian children who are locked up.  He explained in detail how an apartheid legal system is in operation.  I do not know why the Taoiseach is smirking.  Palestinian children, almost always, are arrested in and around areas of illegal Israeli settlements.  They are arrested in the middle of the night, tied with plastic ties, blindfolded and their parents are not allowed to go with them.  They are dragged into cells and interrogated under military law.  In the same towns and areas, Israelis who might be accused of the same crimes are brought to civil courts where none of that sort of mistreatment and abuse of children is allowed.  It is illegal to do that to an Israeli child, but it is done every single day to Palestinian children because a different set of laws applies to Palestinian children than to Israeli children even though they live in the same place.  That is the definition of apartheid.  What is being done is appalling.  Thousands of Palestinian children are arrested every year and at any point, hundreds are in prison.  The Israeli lawyer explained that those children are marked forever by that experience.  They are damaged and traumatised forever but nothing is being done about it.</p> <p> Similarly, adult prisoners commenced a hunger strike on Sunday.  Some 30 Palestinian prisoners initially refused food and water and it is going to escalate to 1,500 because conditions in Israeli prisons, in particular Ramon Prison in the Negev, are deteriorating.  Conditions are so appalling and obnoxious that the Palestinians simply cannot take it anymore.  According to human rights groups, 1,800 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli prisons are very seriously ill and are not getting the medical treatment they need.  Hundreds more have chronic illnesses and in some cases they are life-threatening illnesses.  That is going on under the nose of the international community and nothing is done.</p> <p> Israel sticks two fingers up to Europe when it comes to Europe putting money into projects in Gaza and in the West Bank which the Israelis just go and blow up.  They blow up projects that are funded with European money and Europe does nothing.  While I welcome the statement the T&aacute;naiste issued yesterday, it is not good enough.  Countries like Germany, and in particular Merkel, have a hands-off attitude to what Israel is doing to the Palestinians and do not want to take any action.  We continue to give preferred trading status to Israel under the Euromed association agreement.  The agreement contains human rights clauses which mean it should be suspended, but we do nothing about it.  When will there be sanctions over the systematic, ongoing, unacceptable human rights abuses, including most horribly the systematic abuse of children's rights who are being treated in the most brutal fashion?  In the case of Ahed Timimi, a family relative of hers was shot through the skull and permanently damaged by an Israeli soldier.  Following her protest at what happened, she ended up in prison and was treated in the same way that hundreds of other young children are being treated by the Israelis.  I appeal to the Taoiseach to do something about that and to demand that, finally, Europe shows a bit of moral backbone and imposes some real sanctions on Israel for its systematic ongoing brutal suppression of human and civil rights in Palestine.</p></speech>

In the meantime, other very serious issues are not getting the attention they should be getting from the European Parliament and I wish to refer to two of them in the time available to me.</p>  <p>  While the issues in Catalonia are presented as being internal matters for the Spanish Government and there are matters before the court, the EU has been conspicuously silent on the human rights issues involved.  No one should be prosecuted for exercising the fundamental right to free expression but if there are grounds for prosecution, three things must be in place.  First, there should be a lawful investigation.  It should be free of political considerations and there should be a presumption of innocence.  What we are seeing are serious irregularities being noted by international observers at the trials.  The concept of spontaneous demonstration is covered in international law but what we are seeing is an acceptance of the criminalisation of the practice and of the exercise of the right to demonstrate.  We also see violations of EU regulations on the presumption of innocence and the abuse of pre-trial detention.  As well as the ongoing trial in the Supreme Court, there are three other court cases going on simultaneously, which are having an adverse effect on the defence teams.  With the defendants being tried in the Supreme Court, there is no hope of appeal except to the Constitutional Court.  Of those people on trial, two of them are civil society leaders.  They were involved in peaceful assembly to express their opinions and at this stage they have been in jail for 17 months.</p>  <p>  This is in the context of a Europe that is emerging where human rights and the right to free assembly and free expression are seriously under threat.  Recently, the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade had an informal meeting with activists from Poland and Ukraine.  The ladies from Poland told us of their experience of violence while they were protesting peacefully.  They were at a march where there were thousands with banners proclaiming "A White Poland", "Europe will be White or Deserted" and the witnesses to the joint committee had banners stating "Fascism Stop".  The women were physically assaulted and they were charged with interference with a lawful assembly.  The right to protest is under serious attack in Poland and it would appear that there is no support from the authorities.  The lady from Ukraine told us about serious attacks on their march on International Women's Day, and said a particular target is LGBTI people.  While Ukraine might not be in the EU, Hungary is, and what we are seeing there is a trampling of independent and dissenting voices.</p><p>Last September, in an historic vote, the European Parliament called for the triggering of Article 7 of the European treaty, which would mean challenging the Hungarian Government on its laws and policies and for failing to uphold basic human rights.  The founding principles of the European Union are the rule of law, respect for human rights and freedom.  Is very obvious, therefore, that European Union member states and national parliaments need to be more proactive on what is not acceptable within the European Union, particularly given the forthcoming European elections.</p> <p> In looking at Prime Minister May's letter the one thing that struck me was that it was riddled with ironies.  She makes the point that if the talks do not lead to a unified approach, there will be consensus on a small number of clear options and a series of votes.  We have had all of that already.  She states: "These steps demonstrate that the Government is determined to bring this process to a resolution quickly."  We are certainly not seeing that from what has been happening in the House of Commons.  Her last point is: "It is frustrating that we have not brought this process to a successful and orderly conclusion."  There is little or no acceptance of its responsibility in the current debacle.</p></speech>

Yesterday the one functioning airport in Tripoli was bombed.  Twenty-eight people are dead.  In 2011 we had only just been elected to this House when the then Minister of State Lucinda Creighton bragged about the success of the mission in Libya.  It gives me no comfort whatsoever to say we warned that she would live to regret those words.  There is a sad irony in the words of the then Labour Party leader and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Eamon Gilmore, during the same debate:</p><blockquote>These developments and the uprisings which have followed in other countries throughout the region such as Yemen [dear God], Bahrain and now Libya are historic in nature.  They rightly bear comparison in many respects to the collapse of the former communist regimes in eastern Europe in the late 1980s.</blockquote><p>That naivety would be touching if the consequences were not so serious.  The T&aacute;naiste knows that what happened in Libya was certainly historic.  However, the then Government was certainly on the wrong side of history because it was always about regime change and only the very credulous would have thought it had anything to do with humanitarian reasons.  During the intervention NATO supported an array of rebel groups fighting on the ground which were dominated by Islamic extremists.  It pummelled Libya with air strikes and the outcome was grimly predictable.  We see the consequences in the escalation of violence over the weekend and in recent days in which thousands of people have died.  Millions of Libyans have been displaced and nearly one third of the population have fled to Tunisia.  In the midst of all of this - we might deal with it in the questions to be asked - the European Union has decided to trap desperate refugees in Europe.  Will the Government bring up this issue with the European Council or will Europe's leaders pretend that the destabilisation of Libya and its transformation into what is in reality a nightmarish &quot;Mad Max&quot; replica has nothing to do with them or the decisions they made at the time?  When will our neutral Government try to shake the European Union out of its complacency in that regard?  I ask the T&aacute;naiste to deal with that issue and the issue of the thousands of desperate refugees and migrants who are trying to get into Europe and essentially being forced back into the hands of the Libyan coast guard, open slave markets and so on.  </p><p>While he is doing so, the T&aacute;naiste might deal with the issue we raised in the previous pre-European Council meeting statements of moving from one regime change to another and indicate the reason he decided to take a call from Juan Guaid&oacute;, a person who had no authority under international or Venezuelan law to be declared as President of Venezuela, whether he regrets that stance and if he will outline his latest protestations against the continued economic, not humanitarian, crisis in Venezuela.</p></speech>

I will spare the T&aacute;naiste advice on Brexit, although I know the summit tomorrow will be dominated by it.  I am sure he has enough wise fellows telling him what to do, but it is important that we put some other issues back on the table, as the two previous speakers have done.</p>  <p>  The corporate capture of the European Union and national governments has rarely been as evident, while the rationale for our decisions, in the context of foreign policy, has scarcely been so utterly and transparently false in many ways.  As in so many regressive policy areas, from failing in the mitigation of global warming to robbing the global south through our tax haven operations, when it comes to global economic and foreign policy, Ireland leaves much to be desired.  Frankly, our positions on Iran and Venezuela are insane.  One would think we would have learned something from the disasters in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya.  The formula is familiar.  I refer to former colonies which, as a result of colonisation, have the majority of their economic activities centred on one commodity such as oil, minerals, sugar or whatever else.  Some of these countries elect leaders to try to stop the cheap acquisition of these commodities by corporations and businesses in the global north, but more often than not the powerful fight back.  Chile is a perfect example.  Mr. Allende who was democratically elected nationalised the copper sector in July 1971, but the telecommunications giant ITT, Pepsi-Cola and the copper monopolies put pressure on the US Government to protect their financial interests and sanctions were imposed.  The then CIA director, Richard Helms, said he wanted to make the economy of Chile scream and that he was not concerned about the risks involved.  The CIA made contact with elements of the military which were seen to oppose Mr. Allende and on 11 September 1973 helped them to overthrow the democratically elected government, install the brutal dictator, General Pinochet, with many US economic advisers, and restore the flow of cheap natural resources to the private sector in America.</p>  <p>  The ongoing coup attempt in Venezuela has been taking a similar shape.  The T&aacute;naiste and I have spoken about it.  As Deputy Clare Daly pointed out, we very much regret the position he took with Mr. Guaid&oacute; and believe it was a serious mistake.  It was totally in breach of international law and had no standing in international law.  The position the European Union took, with the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s support, with Mr. Guaid&oacute; did not stack up.  Since the Bolivarian revolutionary regime came to power in 1998, the United States has fought constantly and relentlessly to overthrow it and undermined it in a terrible way.  Idriss Jazairy, the UN special rapporteur, in speaking about the negative impact of unilateral coercive measures, has said the US-led sanctions against the Venezuelan state-owned oil company and the new sanctions that restrict access to food and medicines are killing Venezuelan citizens, starving others and that it is women and children who suffer the most.  The sanctions are illegal under international law and our support for them constitutes the perpetration of economic violence against the people of Venezuela.  We have to play a different role.  We should be working with governments that want peace, are not violently expansionist in their foreign policy and do not exploit whatever they can around the world for their own financial benefit.  We have to play a different role and can be a neutral voice.  I know that it is difficult, but our voice can be very significant.</p>  <p>  As Deputy Boyd Barrett pointed out, in our lifetime the Israelis have not behaved as poorly with the Palestinians as they have for a number of years and the European Union is doing very little about it.  What stop is being put to the activities of Israel?  The situation in the Golan Heights is just another example.  The truth is that Israel is practising apartheid and carrying out genocide in Palestine and with the European Union we are not doing enough to stop it.  I acknowledge that the T&aacute;naiste has been good at speaking out about it at times, but we need to do much more.  </p>  <p>  A girls' school in Yemen was bombed at the weekend.  There are horrific pictures of girls running to try to get away from the bombing.  It is a US supported Saudi-UAE coalition that is carrying out unbelievable atrocities in Yemen and we are not doing enough to stop it.</p><p> Consider what is happening in Libya.  The place is a casino now.  There is nothing but suffering and madness there.  It all started with a NATO intervention and, unfortunately, we supported it.  Even if his voice is a voice in the wilderness against them when the T&aacute;naiste attends the Foreign Affairs Council meetings in Europe, it would mean a great deal for him to speak truth to those powers.  He could have a positive impact.</p></speech>

The EU 27 leaders will meet tomorrow, 10 April, to discuss the latest developments on Brexit.  In fact, it is an iconic date for people in south Tipperary as the leader of the Irish Republican Army, General Liam Lynch, met his death on that date.  We commemorated that last Sunday.</p>  <p>  The European Council meeting is happening as a result of the rejection of the withdrawal agreement by the House of Commons.  On 5 April last, the British Prime Minister, Mrs. Theresa May, sent a letter to Donald Tusk asking for an extension to Article 50.  She proposed the date of 30 June 2019, adding that the UK Government would continue to prepare to hold European Parliament elections should the UK still be a member at the time of the elections.  That is confusing in its own right, and it is obviously confusing for the constituencies here which are set to get an extra seat each, Ireland South and Midlands North West.  People do not know whether they are coming or going.  However, that is probably not unusual here.  The Government does not know whether it is coming or going on many issues, not to mention Brexit.  I have acknowledged the hard work of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade in respect of Brexit on several occasions, as well as the various briefings he has given us.  That is unlike his boss who has sometimes said things that sent out mixed messages.  The T&aacute;naiste has put a great deal of hard work into this.</p>  <p>  I am delighted he found time to visit Cluain Meala last Thursday evening.  It is a pity he did not let me know he was coming as I would have been there to meet him.  I am delighted he called to our mutual friends, the wonderful businessmen, Mr. John FitzGerald, and his colleague, Mr. Donagh Dougan, to see their new expanded offices in this rising economy.  They are two good business people who are providing great employment.  I am glad the T&aacute;naiste had time to call to them and if he had let me know, I would have had a cup of tea ready for him in my office.  I hope he got tea anyway.  In Tipperary we always give a special f&aacute;ilte for a Cork man.</p>  <p>  On 21 March, the EU 27 leaders decided to delay the Brexit date until 12 April 2019 should the withdrawal agreement be rejected.  It has been delayed.  It is clear, therefore, that we are in incredibly dangerous times in terms of the chaos and inability that is afflicting Westminster.  The Prime Minister, Mrs. May, has almost caused a civil war in her party by reaching out to the Labour Party leader, Mr. Jeremy Corbyn, who she has repeatedly said is unfit for government.  This is creating major additional instability.</p>  <p>  I heard the leader of the Labour Party in this country, who would not claim to have anything to do with the Labour Party leader in the UK, call for a five-year delay.  There is merit in that for one reason, namely, the absolute uncertainty that has been created for Irish business people, workers, farmers and everybody in the Twenty-six Counties.  There has been absolute nonsense.  Confusion has reigned.  I must refer again to the EU leaders.  When the sovereign people of Great Britain decided to leave they received much derision and many lectures from the big boys in Europe.  That was uncalled for and did not help.  I believe it poured petrol on the emerging flames.</p>  <p>  We are in a perilous situation.  When we had referendums on the Nice and Lisbon treaties - we will be discussing another one later - we went back to the people again.  That is the type of democracy we have here, an elasticated one.  We even have an elasticated Government and a confidence and supply agreement.  The pipe is jerking but the water is still going through.  It is a case of "I am all right, Jack".  The Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, is fine.  There is no need to worry about the cervical cancer or the children's hospital, on which there is a report out today.  The Government has a free pass to do what it likes, but that is no good to the man who wants bread and butter on his table and to look after his children's future.  We have passed the omnibus legislation but that will not be good enough either.</p>  <p>  There is complete uncertainty.  If there is a crash out, which almost happened and still might, it would be economic sabotage.  It would be waging economic war on us in our little island country.  I do not use those words lightly.  That is the impact it would have.  Uncertainty has been generated and it has mushroomed.  One day the Taoiseach says we will have soldiers on the Border, next he says there will be no Border.  Then there are the customs and Revenue Commissioners staff being hired.  What will we do with all the people we hire if we do not need them on the Border?  I hope we do not need them there.  The Good Friday Agreement, and this is its anniversary, must be respected.  It is an international agreement.  People such as the late Fr. Alec Reid, my former colleague, Dr. Martin Mansergh, and many others played a part in that and it cannot be touched.</p>  <p>  We are putting up with too much.  We are being the nice boys in Europe, but what are we getting at times from our friends across the Border?  We are getting kicked where it hurts.  That is not good enough.  Too many people's livelihoods and too many people's hard work in setting up expert businesses in manufacturing, agrifood and other industries are affected.  The people are having sleepless nights and do not know when the end will come, so I believe there is merit in what Deputy Howlin said.  I do not agree with him on many matters much of the time but we need to have a decent period in which to work on a withdrawal date, if there will be a withdrawal date.  We must stop the knee-jerk reactions that we only have 20 or 30 days more and that we might see what happens in the European elections.  It should not be up to us in this Parliament to second-guess who might be elected to the European Parliament to represent the people of Great Britain.  Everybody who is elected has the right to be in the Parliament regardless of where they come from.  They are elected by the people and that is democracy.  We should not be sounding off as to who might represent England.  Obviously, we must have clarification of whether it will have seats.  That is why we need certainty, now more than ever.</p>  <p>  I compliment the T&aacute;naiste, as I have done several times both privately and publicly, on his tireless efforts in this area.  However, the man who was sitting to his right earlier, the boss, has been a little flippant at times and all over the place.  That is nothing unusual.  He is used to that, along with sending selfies and so forth.</p></speech>

I agree with the expressions of frustration by many Members of the House that Brexit is taking up so much bandwidth for the European Union at present when there are so many other areas internally and particularly in foreign policy on which it should be focusing.</p>  <p>  Libya is on the verge of a civil war.  It is very worrying.  I did not attend the Foreign Affairs Council meeting yesterday where it was discussed because Michel Barnier was in Dublin and I had to be here.  With regard to the human rights consequences of what has happened in Libya, we have tried to respond in a pragmatic way.  I was Minister for Defence when we first decided to send a ship to the Mediterranean.  Many people said that it was impossible and would not work but over the past three years, it turned out to be a very successful humanitarian mission.  I also spoke out directly at the previous Foreign Affairs Council meeting before yesterday's on my concerns about what is effectively the ending of Operation Sophia from a humanitarian perspective in terms of a capacity in the Mediterranean.  The EU, collectively, has been unable to make decisions on landing locations for refugees who are taken out of the water.  That is a quite disgraceful failing of politics within the European Union.</p><p>I continue to advocate for solutions that can allow countries like Ireland and others to continue to operate on a humanitarian basis and also to be effective in tackling the scourge of people trafficking and the crimes that are taking place there.</p> <p> On Venezuela, I remind the House that Ireland's position on this, along with other EU member states, is clear.  We recognise Juan Guaid&oacute; as interim President to call elections.  This is not about a recognition of somebody for a permanent status as President but an interim status.  At the last EU Foreign Affairs Council meeting, I spoke about the need for the EU to look at its position, to review it and to examine whether we should be advocating at this stage for international mediation in Venezuela.  I have subsequently spoken to a number of EU ministers on this by phone and in person to advance that thought process.  I have not received feedback from the latest international contact group meeting in South America, but when I get that, those conversations will continue.</p> <p> On Israel, I made a statement last night on more announcements around expansion of settlements deep into the West Bank, some of the very unwelcome commentary, which I would regard as electioneering, in the last days before polling today, and the signals that have been sent from a brand of politics that is constantly shifting to the right in Israel now, which is worrying.  We will have to wait and see what happens in the election today and what kind of government is formed in the coming weeks.  My approach to Israel has and will continue to be to have direct conversations and not to shy away from being critical when necessary.  Ultimately, however, we cannot succeed in a peace process in the Middle East without talking to both the Palestinians with whom we have very good relationship and the Israeli Government, with which we will also continue to work, despite the fact that we strongly disagree at times with policy decisions that it makes.</p> <p> On the critical meeting, as part of the Article 50 process that is taking place tomorrow, the European Council will reflect on Prime Minister May's request for an extension of Article 50.  The EU 27 will need to decide unanimously on any further extension.  At the same time, talks are ongoing between the UK Government and the Labour Party leadership to see if a joint approach can be agreed on Brexit and the future relationship with the EU.  That is a serious process and the feedback that we are getting is that it is a serious engagement and we will have to wait and see where it goes.</p> <p> I discussed developments with Michel Barnier during his visit to Dublin yesterday and again this morning at the EU General Affairs Council meeting, which I attended.  The solidarity on the Irish issues, I am glad to say to this House, is stronger than it has ever been.  As the Taoiseach said earlier, Ireland favours an extension.  At the same time, an extension is not a solution in itself.  For us the best outcome is that talks result in an agreement in London that will allow approval of the withdrawal agreement.  President Tusk has rightly said the patience is needed.  We need to allow time for the talks in London to come to a conclusion and to encourage the UK to find a way to secure the ratification of the withdrawal agreement.</p> <p> However, an extension cannot be used for endless prevarication either.  The UK must provide a clear concrete plan on how it intends to proceed.  Westminster needs to make a choice on Brexit and its future relationship with the European Union.  EU member states are rightly asking that they would know what the choice is going to be.  We will also need to ensure a proper functioning of the European Union.  As Prime Minister May acknowledges in her letter, it commits the UK to taking part in the European parliamentary elections.  As the Members are aware, if the UK continues to be a member of the European Union through an extension period and does not take its seats in the European Parliament, then the European Parliament is not legally constituted under the treaties and therefore cannot make decisions.  We cannot allow that to happen.</p> <p> It is also clear that under no circumstances can the extension be seen as an opportunity to reopen the withdrawal agreement or the Irish protocol in it.  This was clearly set out in the European Council conclusions of 21 March and is repeated again this morning in the EU General Affairs Council meeting.  The solution to the impasse in London can only come from Westminster.  We hope that the way forward set out by the Prime Minister and her ongoing discussions with the Opposition will deliver a solution and soon.</p> <p> Should the discussions in London see a change in red lines, the EU has always been clear that it is open to looking again at the political declaration in such circumstances.  The EU is fully committed to achieving an ambitious and comprehensive future partnership with the UK.  A no-deal Brexit is not in anybody's interest and is certainly not in Ireland's interests.  Time is short, but there is still an opportunity for a sensible, managed and orderly outcome.  While the risk of a no-deal scenario may have receded slightly this week, the Government continues with our intensive preparedness and contingency work which has been going on now, as the Taoiseach said earlier, for the past two years.  This includes our engagement with the European Commission on how we can work together to avoid a hard border in the case of a no-deal outcome while also protecting the integrity of the Single Market and customs union.  As I have said repeatedly, we cannot allow Ireland to be dragged out of the EU Single Market in a no-deal scenario.</p> <p> In my meeting with Michel Barnier yesterday, he made clear the EU's solidarity with Ireland on this issue.  Throughout this process there has been a strong understanding from EU partners of the need to address the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland.  The EU has been clear that it is determined to do all it can, deal or no deal, to avoid the need for a border and to protect the peace process.  Intensive discussions with European Commission are continuing in good faith to find operational solutions.  Our basic priorities are not changed which are to avoid a hard border in Ireland, to protect the Good Friday Agreement, and at the same time to protect the integrity of the EU Single Market and customs union and Ireland's place in them.  Achieving these twin goals is difficult.  Without a withdrawal agreement, avoiding a hard border would become a more complex and demanding challenge.  There are, in simple terms, no easy answers.</p> <p> All options are being discussed within the rules of the customs union and Single Market right now.  Such a solution would be suboptimal compared with the backstop, however, and I want to make that point very clearly to Parliament here.  While it may be possible to avoid physical infrastructure at the Border, it will be difficult to avoid serious disruption to the functioning of an all-island economy.  The seamless trade that we enjoy today will not be possible, and the benefits of the backstop for business in Northern Ireland will be lost, at least in the short term, in a no-deal scenario without the co-operation of the UK.  This is why the backstop is an essential part of the withdrawal agreement and why we remain focused on securing its ratification.  It provides the best way to ensure an orderly withdrawal while fully protecting the Good Friday Agreement, and it enables both sides to move on to negotiate a deep and ambitious future relationship.</p></speech>

The Rebuilding Ireland home loan scheme was launched on 1 February of last year to replace the existing house purchase and home choice loan schemes.  It provides a new line of mortgage finance that includes fixed rates over 25 to 30 years to creditworthy first-time buyers who cannot access sufficient mortgage finance from a commercial lender.  The Housing Finance Agency borrowed &euro;200 million to fund the scheme.  It was estimated that the drawdown would be approximately &euro;200 million over the three years.  Some criticism at the time suggested that insufficient loans were being approved and drawn down.  However, as Minister I had made a commitment to seek further funding at an early stage, if necessary, given my belief in the scheme's potential.  The scheme has been more successful than anticipated.  By the end of January &euro;106 million had been drawn down.  That accounted for 53% of the available funding at a point when &euro;66 million would have been more consistent with the expectation of a three-year drawdown period.  By the end of March of this year drawdowns had reached &euro;127 million.</p>  <p>  My officials have kept me informed regularly regarding progress on the loan scheme.  They have been engaging with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform since October of last year when higher lending and drawdown volumes were beginning to materialise.  I informed the D&aacute;il on 29 January of this year of the scheme's success and of the need for additional funding.  Furthermore, I indicated that my Department was in discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Finance with regard to the allocation for 2019.  Local authorities could continue to accept applications as the total funding had not been drawn down.  A meeting with the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform took place on 5 March of this year.  Ongoing discussions between the three Departments have included consultation with the Central Bank as recently as last Friday, 5 April.  When these discussions have concluded I will be in a position to confirm the level of allocation for 2019.  In the meantime, the scheme remains open - it is not frozen - and all local authorities have been advised to continue to receive and process applications.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-04-09a.268" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1228" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="18:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019040900030#CC00300"><p>I do not know where to start.  For local authorities to receive and process applications is one thing but to issue loan offers is another.  How many local authorities are not allowing the drawdown of those funds?  I imagine the Minister has heard in recent days of testimony from several individuals throughout the country from south Dublin to Waterford.  People applying to several local authorities have been unable to get the funds.  The Minister says the scheme is open and is accepting applications.  The local authorities may be processing applications up to the point of the issuing of the loan offer, but they are not processing them any further and that is the issue.  In many instances those who have made an offer on a house at the moment cannot draw down the loan.  What is the actual position?  The Minster can say that the scheme is open but the local authorities are not concluding the processing of applications.</p>  <p>  Will the Minister inform the House when a new round of funding will be confirmed by the Department of Finance?  When will we know that additional funds have been allocated?  Last September, the Department was still noting the fact that the take-up was slow.  Monitoring was a major problem between the Housing Finance Agency and the Department.  We need to give clarity to those who are depending on a Rebuilding Ireland loan to be able to purchase a home.</p></speech>

First, as I confirmed to Deputy O'Brien at a recent meeting of the joint committee, all approvals given to date by credit committees and local authorities will be honoured.  There should be no hesitation or pause in facilitating the drawdown of those loans where an approval has been made by the credit committee.  Of the &euro;200 million provision, only &euro;127 million has been drawn down.  In fact, if we drill into the detail, only &euro;85 million has actually been drawn down by the local authorities from the Housing Finance Agency.  There is more than enough funding in the scheme at present to honour the approvals for drawdown.</p>  <p>  The Deputy asked about allocations for this year.  The money is available for drawdown and more money will be made available.  Local authorities need not wait for their allocations for 2019.  We will honour any approval given by a credit committee of a local authority.  They can continue to do that.  If we find examples of where that is not happening - there was one on the radio today - we get in touch with the local authority to ask why it is not happening.</p>  <p>  I am very sorry for the confusion that is in some local authority areas.  The confusion is not because of anything the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government or the Housing Finance Agency are doing.  Where there are difficulties we will work to address them.</p></speech>

It is really important.  The message the Minister is giving in response to the questions I am asking on behalf of Fianna F&aacute;il is that there should be no impediment to any of the loans or mortgages approved as of now being drawn down.  Will the Minister indicate whether the Department will issue a written directive to the local authorities, including South Dublin County Council and Waterford City and County Council?  South Dublin County Council has not permitted drawdown of mortgages since December last.  Why is that?</p>  <p>  I genuinely welcome the clarification from the Minister.  It is important.  There is confusion, although it has not been brought about by this side of the House.  I put it to the Minister that we should get those loans that have been approved drawn down should the applicants need them.  I call on the Minister to continue to update the House and give us some timeframe for when he envisages additional funds will be allocated and when the 2019 allocations will be made.  People are making loan applications but are unsure whether they will ever be able to get to the stage of drawdown.  We need to clear this up once and for all.</p></speech>

This is why it is important to clarify the matter and I thank Deputy O'Brien for affording me the opportunity to clarify that any loan from a credit committee that has been approved is to be honoured and the drawdown is to be facilitated by that local authority.  We are not to be getting in the way of people buying homes.  I issued a circular to local authorities recently clarifying that the scheme is still open and that they are still to continue to process applications.</p>  <p>  The Deputy asked about funding allocations for 2019.  Again, there is more than sufficient funding in place at present for local authorities to be able to draw down from the Housing Finance Agency.  They can continue to access that money and lend it.</p></speech>

Will the Minister give us as much detail as possible about the cost of that public private partnership?  Will he comment specifically on the concern many of us have about the variance in costs between the more traditional methods of delivery and the public private partnerships?</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-04-09a.277" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1264" speakername="Damien English" time="18:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019040900030#CC01200"><p>I am pleased to take the question to bring some clarity to this issue.  The Deputy's question and some public commentary on this matter appear to be based on an assumption that the balance of the contract for bundle 1 of the social housing PPP programme after the pure construction cost is excluded is all attributable to management and maintenance of the homes to be delivered under the contract.  This assumption is not true or accurate.  I am happy to break down the figures with the Deputy.  I cannot give all the science behind it but it will come out at a later stage.</p>  <p>  The full value of the PPP contract includes a range of costs.  The construction costs cover what might be referred to as the pure bricks and mortar costs in respect of the homes involved and the associated infrastructure, including play and community facilities.  It is not only for houses but associated facilities.  The remainder of the contract includes not only management and maintenance costs but also other costs, including the costs of finance for the project, projected inflation over the 25 years of the operational life of the contract, and the costs of complying with other terms of the contract.  Such other terms include the requirement for certain quality requirements to be met when the homes involved are passed over to the local authorities concerned at the end of the 25-year period.  That is the key part.  They have to be handed over at the end of the period in a certain condition.  That is the key part of the PPP.</p>  <p>  It is a different model of delivery with its own requirements.  This can give rise to incompatible comparisons between individual elements across different methods of delivery.  It is one method among many in the toolkit.  It is a question of comparing apples and oranges when people compare it directly with the approved housing body situation.  I understand why there is confusion but at all times there is a value for money element to this.  We have to apply a value for money process to the four different stages.  Like all social housing project delivery mechanisms, it is essential that homes delivered through public private partnerships represent value for money for the taxpayer.  In that regard, clear requirements are laid down centrally by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform through which the National Development Finance Agency, as the professional financial advisers for projects of this kind, develops a public sector benchmark that reflects the cost of delivering the contract concerned through traditional procurement mechanisms.  This is then used as the benchmark against which value for money tests are undertaken at a number of stages in the procurement - there are four different stages - primarily when it comes to assessing the final tenders submitted.</p><p>The successful tender under bundle 1 of the social housing public private partnership, PPP, was assessed in this manner and was lower than the public sector benchmark, thereby representing value for money.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-04-09a.279" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1215" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="18:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019040900031#DD00200"><p>None of what the Minister of State said reassures me that there is not a significant cost variance between approved housing body availability, payment agreements and public private partnerships.  At the heart of this is the public sector benchmark, which is used to calculate that so-called value for money exercise.  None of us get to see it.  There is no transparency around it and we are not in a position to be able to verify what the Minister of State is saying, either here today or in previous parliamentary questions.  On the basis of what the Minister of State said here today, the construction cost per unit is &euro;225,000.  That is higher than figures I have received from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government on comparative costs for local authority builds.  In this contract with the public private partnership, there is a different inflation calculation to the one used for approved housing bodies, a different calculation for what the Minister of State called equality requirements, and an element of profit and risk adjustment.  While I accept the two types of contracts, availability agreements with the approved housing body sector and PPPs are not the same, they do very similar things and nothing the Minister of State has said has reassured me that there is not a cost difference, if not a significant cost difference.  Has the Minister of State seen the public sector benchmark?  Is he satisfied that both the methodology used and the price comparisons represent value for money to the taxpayer?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-04-09a.280" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1264" speakername="Damien English" time="18:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019040900031#DD00300"><p>I am not given all of the figures but I am satisfied with the process of how this is handled.  There are four stages at which we assess the value to make sure that the taxpayer is getting value for money and that is how we judge this too.  I will talk the Deputy through the process.  The key criteria for assessing whether a PPP project represents value for money for the executive follow the guidance set out by the central PPP unit in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  This guidance sets out four specific tests that are applied to PPPs over the course of the planning and procurement process.  The tests focus on assessing whether the PPP approach compares favourably with the alternative cost of using traditional procurement to achieve the same result.  There are different methods of traditional procurement but they are all compared to make sure that we get the best value for money and do not lose out.  Only one of the social housing PPP programmes has met the relevant thresholds for each of the four tests in this rigorous process and I am confident that it demonstrates value for money.  That is the Deputy's concern, which the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, and I also have, to deliver top quality, good value housing quickly.  We are satisfied that the process delivers that.  The Deputy wants to have information released.  I understand why he wants that but it would not be appropriate to do that at this stage.  We are committed to release it after three bundles.</p></speech>

If one takes two housing projects that commenced construction today, the public private partnership that is currently under construction and traditional social housing delivered by a local authority and an approved housing body, it is unequivocal from the information that we have that the public private partnership will get a significantly larger amount of money to deliver, manage and maintain the units, and that is before we even get into the issue of risk adjustment or cost.  Given that the Minister of State has not seen the public sector benchmark, why will he not publish it now?  The contract has been signed and the contractors are on site.  The Minister of State could publish this now because it is no longer of any commercial sensitivity to bundles 2 and 3 because they will have separate public sector benchmarks.  Will the Minister of State give a commitment that, when that public sector benchmark is eventually published, he will come to the House or the committee where we can properly scrutinise it?  If I am wrong at that stage and there is value for money, I am more than happy to accept it and hope the Minister of State would do the same.</p></speech>

The Deputy, with respect, is probably comparing apples and oranges.  This is a 25-year contract.  They will be paid per month for upkeep and management of the house and all that goes with it.  At the end of 25 years, the State will own that house.  It has to be in a condition that is fit for purpose, as set down in the contract.  That is different to the contract that is operated by approved housing bodies.  I ask the Deputy to understand that.  I think he probably understands that but might not want to admit that in public.  There is a process there and I am happy to bring the Deputy through it with regard to the next phase of it too.</p></speech>

Considerable work has been ongoing between the Irish Council for Social Housing, a number of larger tier 3 approved housing bodies, AHBs, and their financial advisers on the development of a vehicle for delivering private financing for AHBs providing social housing in line with ambitions set out in the Government's Rebuilding Ireland action plan on housing and homelessness.  The ICSH work is being undertaken in three phases, the first two of which have been completed, which are the phases designed to test the market interest in investing in social housing and the appetite among AHBs for private finance.  While the ICSH had hoped to have completed the final phase of the work by now, and we certainly hoped it would be completed too, it is focused on the structuring of special purpose vehicles and this important work is ongoing.</p>  <p>  I understand that one of the issues which has given rise to the delay in concluding the work is the need to take account of other private finance arrangements and vehicles that certain AHBs have put in place in parallel.  Three different bodies have put arrangements in place and I believe they are working quite well.  The decision by EUROSTAT to reclassify AHBs has also influenced the progression of this final phase of work.  Alongside this project, three individual approved housing bodies have been successful in accessing private finance from financial institutions to deliver new social housing, with each financial institution having its own specific requirements for lending and investing.  While the completion of the outstanding phase of work is primarily a matter for the Irish Council for Social Housing, I hope that it will be in a position to finish it as soon as possible.  We are committed to it.  The Central Bank changed the rules to allow investment.  Deputy Darragh O'Brien keeps referring to a figure of &euro;10 billion.  Under the rules, up to &euro;800 million or &euro;900 million-----</p></speech>

Government policy since 2014 has been to provide alternative sustainable sources of funding and here is one that has not been utilised in five years.  The Minister of State has regularly replied to questions that I have tabled that one credit union body had a special purpose vehicle ready.  What is happening there?  Why has not a single red cent gone into the special purpose vehicle?  Is there no appetite for it?  Does the Minister of State not think it is needed?  What is the final phase that we are still waiting for and what is the Minister of State's timeframe for that completion?  He has mentioned rightly that AHBs are on-balance sheet now.  He has another source of funding here that could be off-balance sheet to provide social and affordable homes.  I really do not get it and that is why I ask the Minister of State questions repeatedly.  Is this a priority or is it something that the Government does not want to do?</p></speech>

All the rules and changes have been made to facilitate this to happen.  We committed to it in our programme for Government and it makes common sense.  If there is money to be invested and we want to fund social housing projects, we should put the two together.  There is only so far that a Government can go.  These are private finance arrangements and they have to design a special purpose vehicle themselves, separate to Government and to our Department.  I cannot be clearer than that.  The Deputy might not like that.  If he wants to help with the design of one, work away.</p></speech>

This is obviously not a policy priority for Government.  The Minister of State is contradicting himself.  The Minister could answer the question too but he seems to have delegated his responsibility for that to his Minister of State because, effectively, Government has said that creating a special purpose vehicle is for the credit unions.  Flatly contradicting that, however, is the fact that it has over the years engaged public money to assist the Irish Council for Social Housing to do what it says is up to the credit unions.  Does the Minister of State see at any stage this year when money will be invested through an SPV to provide social housing?  When he talks about providing any assistance in that regard, I have kept this on the agenda because it had fallen off the Government agenda and nothing was being done about it.</p></speech>

Deputy O'Brien does not like the answers to the questions and keeps trying to phrase them differently every time and tries to insinuate that I misled the House.  I have absolutely nothing to change on the record.  I have been very clear in saying one of the credit union bodies is ready to do this.  Everything is in place.  It can switch it on literally overnight once a body wants to draw down the money.  I said to the Deputy last September that a credit union body had a special purpose vehicle ready to go, and it does.  The Deputy might not like that but it is ready to go when a housing body wants to draw it down.</p></speech>

This project has been in development since the mid-1990s, originally under Dublin City Council and under Irish Water since January 2014.  This will be the largest strategic national water supply project in generations and will service communities across a wide area.  The project will, of course, be subject to the relevant planning and other environmental consent processes.</p>  <p>  The Water Services Act 2013 requires the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, in conjunction with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, to provide consent for all commitments for capital expenditure above a certain threshold.  This is a financial control and not a project consent.  In this context, given the scale and importance of the eastern and midlands water supply project and recognising the statutory role of the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities as independent economic regulator of Irish Water, including its role in reviewing Irish Water&rsquo;s capital investment plans, I have requested the commission to undertake a review to support my decision in relation to the major capital commitment consent that will be required closer to construction stage.

Some time ago I submitted a parliamentary question to the Minister seeking information on the proposed and projected cost of this pipeline to bring water through Tipperary to Dublin.  I was told the Minister had no responsibility for this matter and that it was a matter for Irish Water, yet last February he asked the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities, CRU, to carry out a review of the eastern and midlands water supply project under section 40 of the Water Services Act 2013.  At that time he said he was doing this to enable the Department to have full consent for all the commitments for the capital expenditure above a certain threshold.  On the one hand, the Minister seems to have no oversight of this project, and on the other, he needs to get the CRU to sign off on projects like this.  Which is it?  C&eacute;n sc&eacute;al?  I remind the Minister of another massive capital expenditure project that another Minister entrusted to the responsibility of another board, the national children's hospital.  We know where that is.</p></speech>

Of course the CRU has a central role here and I have asked it to do a verification process to give further comfort to the different elements that are involved as part of the financial consents that will be given.  I have already given consent for more than &euro;40 million last year for the planning stage of the project, and I am in consultation on consent for additional money for 2019, up to an amount potentially of &euro;60 million for further work that will be undertaken through the ministerial consent process for the project.  There are several different consents in place between me and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform as the project goes through the various stages of lodging the planning application and consent to undertake the capital improvements and everything else.  As we go through that process we review the different assumptions around the capital costs of the project.</p></speech>

The Shannon-Dublin water pipeline will cost more than &euro;1.2 billion, and if it is like the children's hospital, it will cost twice that.  It is intended to supply 40% of Irish households unconnected with, and around, Dublin with water from the River Shannon by 2025.  It will go into a leaking system that is leaking nearly 60% of the water.  We should be in kindergarten.  I do not deny the people of Dublin water and we are not mean spirited in Tipperary or in the Shannon region either.  Fix the leaks.  Sort out the water problem first.</p>  <p>  Does the Minister have oversight or not?  I tabled a parliamentary question and he said he has not.  Now he says he has.  This will be another national monument of embarrassment to the Minister and the Government for 2025.  It will look for an extension to 2030 because it will still be leaking into the ground.  Fix the leaks and preserve the very valuable resource of treated water.  It is pointless pumping treated water into a creaking system.  If the Minister was a householder with a well that was giving trouble and he could not keep running pumps to supply the water in the well, he would fix the leaks first, and very fast.  This is public money and he can do what he likes with it with no accountability.</p></speech>

A significant number of initiatives continue to be implemented under the plan to address the range of complex and deep-seated issues in the housing sector arising from the economic downturn.  These include the accelerated delivery of social and affordable housing as well as increased protections for those in the rental sector.</p><p>Within Rebuilding Ireland, tackling homelessness is identified as a key priority for the Government and it continues to be addressed with the urgency the seriousness of the situation demands.  Increasing the level of overall housing supply, particularly in terms of social housing, and ensuring stability in the rental sector are essential to addressing fully the challenging situation in relation to homelessness, and very substantial progress continues to be made in those areas.  In parallel with that, additional and improved emergency accommodation is being provided, including through additional supported emergency beds and family hubs, in order to ensure that the needs of those who find themselves in a situation of homelessness can be responded to in as comprehensive and compassionate a manner as possible.</p> <p> The focus remains on preventing homelessness to the greatest extent possible and ensuring that pathways out of homelessness are secured as quickly as possible for those individuals and families in emergency accommodation.  Budget 2019 reflects the commitment of the Government in this regard, with an allocation of &euro;146 million for homeless services by local authorities this year, an increase of over 25% on the 2018 allocation.  Rebuilding Ireland is delivering very significant results in supporting exits from homelessness.  In 2018, 5,135 adults exited homelessness into independent tenancies, an 8.6% increase on 2017.  It is disappointing that this level of achievement, although substantial, was not sufficient to keep pace with the extent of new presentations.  The Deputy can be assured that I and my Department, working with the local authorities and other homeless service providers, remain fully seized of the seriousness of the homelessness situation and fully committed to delivering fully on the actions required to address all of the issues involved.</p></speech>

Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann provides for the declaration of emergencies and I specifically refer to Articles 43.2.1&deg;  and 43.2.2&deg;  where the public good trumps private property rights.  This D&aacute;il has also voted for the declaration of such an emergency on 3 October 2018 by 83 votes to 43 on a Solidarity-People Before Profit motion.  There is also the fact that the Government is currently using this process with the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, legislation, where it is confiscating pension payments, which of course are private property.  The declaration of a homelessness and housing emergency is constitutional, it is legal and it is a practical solution to the housing and homelessness crisis created by the Government.</p></speech>

We are seeing a dramatic shift in construction as new homes are built.  Last year, one in four of those new homes built were built for social housing purposes, so it is not true to say that we are relying solely on the market or on the commodification of housing.  We are trying to move away from that old system of housing to a new system that has public housing at the core of our policy.  If I believed that declaring an emergency would help us to tackle the situation around homelessness more quickly and in a more sustainable manner, of course I would do so.  Why would I not?  However, I have met with the Attorney General on this issue, we have discussed it and there is nothing in declaring an emergency that would bring more powers to me to enable me to build more houses more quickly so I will not get involved in tokenistic gestures.  What is important is that we drive solutions that will help to bring more homes into this country, both social housing homes and affordable homes, but at the same time, bring in greater protections for renters.  While we do those things, we must do everything that we can to exit people out of emergency accommodation as quickly as we can.</p></speech>

More and more families are fleeced by big landlords, vulture funds and cuckoo funds charging astronomical rents.  The Minister has said from time to time and again today that preventing landlords evicting people on the sale of property was unconstitutional.  Of course this is misleading.  It is completely untrue and it is absolutely factual that the declaration of such an emergency would lead to a real tackling of the homelessness crisis but of course the real reason the Minister and the Government will not declare an emergency is that the Minister is part of an extreme, free-market, pro-the-super-rich and pro-landlord Government.

There is a balance of rights and that is why we were able to bring in the vacant site levy and increase it to 10% over a two-year period.  That is why we have been able to bring in rent controls.  That is why we have compulsory purchase order powers.

A significant part of that will have an impact on Wexford.  Very significant progress has been made in delivering on Rebuilding Ireland's targets, including in County Wexford.  This is reflected in the reductions recorded on the housing waiting lists, with the number of households on Wexford's list reducing by 567, or over 20%, between 2016 and 2018, with just under 2,000 additional housing supports provided in the county since 2016.  The target for 2019 is for the delivery of an additional 931 housing supports in County Wexford, comprising 353 homes through build, acquisition and leasing programmes and another 578 households to be supported through the housing assistance payment and the rental accommodation scheme, which will have a significant impact on further reducing Wexford's housing list.</p>  <p>  A substantial focus of all stakeholders is to increase supply through new build activity.  Wexford County Council has a social housing construction programme of 58 projects, yielding almost 700 homes over the next three years.  This pipeline continues to grow with regular approvals for new schemes.  We continually ask every local authority to increase its pipeline.  We visit them through the housing delivery office and the Minister and I meet the different local authorities either on site in the area or in meetings here in Dublin.  We constantly request them to increase the pipeline and add more projects through that so it is not limited to what I have outlined but that is where it is at this moment in time.  I am confident that these actions, targets and resources available under Rebuilding Ireland provide a strong platform for continuing to reduce the number of households on waiting lists in Wexford and across the country.  We have set targets with local authorities but we are asking them to go beyond those targets.  We see them as a minimum, not a maximum and in fairness, when it comes to targets, Wexford County Council has gone above its targets.  We will ask it to continue to do so and we will make sure that taxpayer's money is there to fund it.</p></speech>

For example, in those numbers the Minister of State gave, more than 60 houses are shovel-ready to go in one housing estate in Enniscorthy but it has been held up by seven and a half months because Irish Water will not give the go-ahead.  That is more than half a year lost waiting for Irish Water.  There are similar problems with other estates in County Wexford.  A utility body is holding up necessary social housing.  Wexford County Council has already run out of money to purchase houses for people.  I am particularly concerned that this will affect people with disabilities.  The average wait for somebody with a serious disability, even with something such as a broken back, to get an adapted house, is over two years.  As I have real concerns in that regard, I ask the Minister of State what he will do in those areas.</p></speech>

The specific questions the Deputy has asked have not come to our attention.  I can confirm that the budget for acquiring houses is not gone.  I am surprised that this is the impression that has been given.  We are encouraging local authorities to build more houses and to get involved in all the schemes but naturally, when there is good value to be achieved in acquisition, we are willing to do that.  I am not sure what information the Deputy has but if Wexford County Council has any particular schemes it wants to get involved in or houses it wants us to buy and if it recommends good value, we will work with it on that but we are very strong in our encouragement that it build new houses, as well as carry out leasing and so on.</p><p>Acquisition makes sense sometimes and we certainly fund it when it is requested, explained and backed up with information.  I am not sure where that is coming from.</p> <p> In respect of the two-year wait for someone with a disability, that should not be the case.  I have been in a lot of houses that Wexford County Council has specifically designed and built for people with special needs - some families needed a lot of additional help - and there was some great success there.  I am surprised that the Deputy has examples of houses that are needing two years because there are plenty of mechanisms to fund housing like that.  Wexford has been involved in a couple of cases.  The issue with the one site the Deputy mentioned in Enniscorthy was not raised with me directly through the delivery office.  The Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, and I have met Irish Water on numerous occasions and we went through different changes in work practices as well.  There should not be delays on sites.  If there are, we certainly will dig into that.</p></speech>

Approved housing bodies are agreeing to purchase houses off-plan but they cannot get answers out of Irish Water.  Wexford County Council is stepping in where it can but it simply should not be the case that houses are being held up, especially where these housing developments are in towns and connected to mains water.  It is not a big decision to make.</p>  <p>  On the disability issue and people with serious disabilities trying to get housing, Wexford County Council is doing its best but it is a simple supply issue.  There is a backlog of people with disabilities waiting and there is a considerable delay; the current wait is for two years.  The reply I have from Wexford County Council, and perhaps I was not clear in this regard, is that Wexford County Council is not purchasing any second-hand houses as its allocation for 2019 is already used up.  That is the reply I have from Wexford County Council.  I appreciate the Minister of State may not know off the top of his head but I would appreciate it if he could come back to me.</p></speech>

Wexford County Council went way beyond its targets last year, thankfully, and successfully did so in respect of both its build and its acquisition.  We encourage that when it makes good sense and is good value.  Certainly if there is targeted housing for someone with a disability, that is something we encourage.  We have also encouraged local authorities to work with private sector housing if there are already social housing tenants in those houses.</p>  <p>  I am surprised at the reply the Deputy received.  I did not fully hear the wording of what he read out.  It was a little bit different from what he said at the start but we will certainly check it out.  The Deputy can be very clear that we will talk to Wexford County Council.  In respect of any delays on sites, we have a housing delivery unit that troubleshoots where there are problems on certain sites.  The Deputy is bringing it to my attention now and it is news to me that there is a delay of six months.  It is a little bit different now as the Deputy is saying it is a private site, not a council site, for a turnkey.  That is fine, we will check it out.  I would just say that the local authority has not come to us with a site that was delayed for six or seven months.  Measures were put in place with Irish Water last summer by the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, to make sure this would not happen as it caught up and it should not be happening again.</p></speech>

I do not suggest that we should not have greater densities in cities but there are issues around planning applications in towns in particular, and there is difficulty in respect of complying with the densities that are required.</p></reply>

Under section 30 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, it would be inappropriate for me to comment on individual planning cases.  Under Project Ireland 2040, including the national planning framework, the Government has taken a broadly welcomed lead on moving away from sprawl to more compact urban growth as a key mechanism to support proper planning and sustainable development, as well as action on climate change and congestion.</p>  <p>  Project Ireland 2040 restates the commitment to implement statutory planning guidelines on sustainable residential  development in urban areas, which were published by my Department in 2009.  These guidelines generally require densities in the range of 35 to 50 dwellings per hectare in urban areas and more than 50 dwellings per hectare in more central urban areas.  Many examples of the successful achievement of these density levels are set out in an accompanying urban design manual, which is available on the Department&rsquo;s website.  In addition, it is important to note that the guidelines also provide scope for densities under 35 dwellings per hectare in smaller towns and villages, to assist in delivering sustainable urban housing alternatives to one-off rural houses.  I am satisfied that the 2009 guidelines are entirely consistent with the compact urban growth objective of the national planning framework.  My Department will continue to engage with local authorities, the home building industry and other sectoral interests to address any issues arising, particularly in the context of the amendments to be made to development plans as part of the roll-out of the national planning framework.</p></speech>

I welcome the fact that he said he is going to engage with local authorities because it seems to be a real problem in some of our towns.  Developments are being proposed where there is much need for housing - we all agree that we need to see more housing in our towns - but because of the specific densities, they are not viable and therefore are not being proceeded with.  We are ending up not getting the housing development we need in many of our towns because they have to satisfy these quite restrictive criteria.  I completely understand that we need more density in urban centres and so on.  There are practical issues arising where it does not become viable to go ahead with some of these developments.  I think the Minister's attention has been drawn to some examples; I understand my party leader drew his attention to some.  I ask the Minister to clarify how he is engaging and whether there is some scope for flexibility in that regard.</p></speech>

The requirement of 35 to 50 dwellings per hectare for urban areas is the equivalent of 35 to 50 homes on a site similar in size to the pitch of Croke Park.  I do not think that is over-densification in an urban area, if we are talking about a town like Wexford or a town in Cork, as was drawn to my attention.  We have to make sure we are maximising the sites we have that are close to town centres.  That is going to be important for community living and for reducing our reliance on cars.  It is also going to be important for reducing our carbon impact.  The guidelines and manual that we have speak to this.  It is also about taking a different approach, not just trying to build one type of home on one site but a mixture of different types of homes, in order that we can provide housing for someone coming into their first job, for a family, but also for someone of an elderly age as well.  Increasingly, what we are trying to drive, through the work of the Ministers of State, Deputies English and Jim Daly, is housing for the elderly.  On some of these sites, if they combine houses for families with elderly housing facilities or community spaces, they can achieve that 35 to 50 dwellings per hectare quite easily.</p></speech>

Certainly the idea of mixed developments, housing for the elderly and so on is very positive.  However, the practical result of it is that in some cases they are almost being required just to have apartments, which may not be appropriate for a town or for the demand within a town.  I ask the Minister to engage with the issues that are arising to ensure we do not end up with developments not happening at all because of the restrictions.  If there is a way in which the Minister can be flexible to ensure that the developments actually can happen, that is really what my request is.</p></speech>

I spoke at the annual planning conference last week in Carrick-on-Shannon.  The challenge of the right density was one of the key things that I spoke to.  So often now, when we talk about the challenge we have in housing, it is actually a challenge around planning.  We know more homes are being built, but are they being built in the right locations and for the right people?  This is the planning aspect that comes into it and density is key to that.  There is a meeting happening in Cork next week with the planning authorities there to talk through this issue to make sure the guidelines we have published are being used to their maximum flexibility.  We can arrange for other workshops if necessary in Limerick, Wexford or wherever else planning authorities might feel that the density requirements are not being interpreted in the right way by private planning bodies.</p></speech>

A multi-stranded approach is being taken to support such households in achieving home ownership, particularly those households earning annual gross incomes up to &euro;50,000 for single applicants and &euro;75,000 for dual applicants.</p>  <p>  In terms of affordable purchase, I commenced the relevant provisions of Part 5 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 to provide a statutory basis for the delivery of an affordable housing for purchase scheme.  I also made regulations last month on foot of which local authorities are now moving ahead to develop schemes of priority for the allocation of affordable housing in due course. </p>  <p>   The new scheme will be set in the context of moderating growth in house prices and rental levels in the market and will complement other key Government affordability initiatives.  These include the Rebuilding Ireland home loan, which has seen 720 loans to a total value of some &euro;127.5 million drawn down, and the Help to Buy scheme, under which some 10,500 applications, to a value of &euro;153 million, have been approved.</p>  <p>   In order to support the affordable housing programmes of local authorities, the Government has committed &euro;310 million, over the three years 2019 to 2021, under the serviced sites fund to support the provision of 6,200 affordable homes to purchase or rent.  An initial ten projects, with the potential for 1,400 affordable homes, have already been approved with an allocation of &euro;43 million under the first call for proposals, and a second call for further projects has now issued to 19 local authorities where economic assessments have been carried out by the local authorities concerned and affordability issues have been identified.</p>  <p>  In addition, approximately 2,350 affordable homes will be delivered on mainly publicly owned lands supported through the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, while 5,600 further homes will benefit from a LIHAF-related cost reduction, some of which are already coming to market and are being advertised.  The work of the Land Development Agency will also be of crucial importance in terms of delivering more affordable housing.  The initial portfolio of sites that the agency has access to will have the potential, over the short to medium term, to deliver 3,000 affordable homes in line with the Government policy of achieving 30% affordable housing on State lands generally.</p>  <p>  In parallel, the Dublin local authorities continue to progress a number of other significant housing projects on publicly owned lands, including the redevelopment of O'Devaney Gardens and a site at Oscar Traynor Road in Dublin city, yielding approximately 280 affordable homes.  In addition, 380 cost rental homes will be delivered between projects at the former St. Michael's Estate in Inchicore and at Enniskerry Road in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown.</p>  <p>  Taken together, programmes are in place under which nearly 18,000 affordable homes or homes with a LIHAF-related reduction will be delivered, with over 11,200 households also supported through the Rebuilding Ireland home loan or the help to buy scheme.</p></speech>

I do not know whether the Minister is familiar with what people in the Defence Forces earn, but it is not a huge amount.  The Minister did not once mention ordinary soldiers and how they are supposed to afford current market rents or purchase prices.  Last year rents increased by over 7%, with slightly smaller increases in the Dublin region.  I am not aware of members of the Army having received a wage increase which even closely matched those numbers.  The increases the members enjoyed was probably somewhere around 2% to 3.5%.  How are they supposed to make ends meet?</p>  <p>  The Minister's cost rental price, as announced by the South Dublin County Council recently, is &euro;1,200 a month.  How can an Army corporal or private with a family, perhaps two children and a spouse, afford a rent like that?  It is gouging.</p></speech>

I refer to the affordable purchase scheme.  I am not disputing what Deputy Burton said: I agree that there are issues on affordable rent.  We have heard for years about the Enniskerry Road development and the pilot project there.  I have heard that project has just gone to tender and that Focus Ireland and other groups are involved.  It will be good to see such a scheme up and running.</p>  <p>  The average age of home ownership is now 35 years, up from 26 years in 1991.  On the level of home ownership, I heard the Taoiseach bemoaning the fact that home ownership levels have now dropped to a record low of 67.6%.  We have a major affordability problem.  The Minister knows that: I have said it to him many times.  I am interested in the delivery of the affordable purchase scheme.  It is interesting to hear the Minister's response to Deputy Burton concerning the number of land banks that have actually been offered by local authorities.  I want to see a start being made on those affordable homes.</p></speech>

We must have a functional housing sector that provides not just social housing or general housing but affordable housing as well.  I am not responsible for the pay and conditions for anyone working in the public sector.</p>  <p>  If we are not building more homes then conversations around people in emergency accommodation or affordability, whether in terms of rent or purchase, become moot because there would not be enough supply.  Supply is now increasing.  The focus of Rebuilding Ireland in its initial years was to rebuild those parts of the housing sector that were broken so that more homes could be built.  As those homes were built more social housing homes were built at the same time.  Last year, one in four of all homes built was for social housing.</p>  <p>  We have a very ambitious pipeline for building affordable housing currently, whether affordable to buy, affordable to rent or cost rental.  Recently, notwithstanding the huge affordability challenge we have in this country, house prices have begun to moderate due to the increase in supply.  Last year rents began to fall in consecutive quarters.  The big increase in supply has made a positive impact, but notwithstanding that we have to drive affordability at the heart of public policy.  That is why we have the help to buy scheme, which has helped over 10,000 people buy a home.  The Rebuilding Ireland home loan has helped over 700 families and individuals get a mortgage for their first homes.  I will refer to a number of other schemes in more detail in my next contribution.</p></speech>

In Fingal the waiting time was six or seven months.  The Minister is totally out of touch.  I asked him about soldiers because they serve their country, yet we have lost 20% of them in recent times because they cannot afford to live.  The cost rental model in south County Dublin is offering future cost rental at around &euro;1,200 a month.  Can the Minister tell me of an Army private or corporal who can afford &euro;1,200 a month in rent?  We are supposed to have Defence Forces in which 10,000 or more people are expected to serve.  In the main people in the ordinary ranks are not very wealthy or well-off.  How are they supposed to get a home to rent or buy?  The Minister does not seem to recognise this fact.  He said that he has no responsibility for individual people.  The Government should feel an immense collective responsibility for our Army.</p></speech>

On the affordable housing scheme, the criteria has been assigned.  I provided my thoughts on some of it and did not agree with parts of it.  We should look again at the upper limits of &euro;75,000 for couples.  I am anxious to understand the price the Department is considering selling the affordable homes at.  The average price of a home currently is around &euro;380,000, which is not affordable for most people, particularly considering the pressures on supply mentioned by the Minister.</p><p>In recent weeks we have been made aware of the number of built units that have been purchased by real estate investment trusts.  That is affecting the market because some houses in my area which are within the reach of normal families to buy have been hoovered up by REITs and what are now referred to as "cuckoo funds".  That is not a recent phenomenon in the past couple of months.  When will the scheme open for applications and what will the prices be?</p></speech>

One of the later questions deals with institutional investors.  They are not hoovering up properties to the extent people think they are.  We need to rebalance our housing sector away from over-reliance on individual landlords with one or two properties; we need to find a balance there.</p>  <p>  On the serviced sites fund, the second call has gone out from my Department to 19 local authorities.  In answer to how much a home will cost under that serviced sites fund, it is a maximum of 40% off the market price and that will vary across the country.  Now that we have done the regulations it will be open to each local authority to open its scheme depending on when it sees the houses coming to market through its own local authority lands and what it has programmed.</p>  <p>  In response to Deputy Burton, I did not say I do not have responsibility for individual people.  I said that as Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, I have responsibility for ensuring that everyone in the country has housing security - that they have a home.  We are working to do that through social housing, affordable housing or housing more generally in the economy.  It is very important that we do that.  If the Deputy had been here the earlier contribution on the Rebuilding Ireland home loan, she would have heard it is not closed; it is open.  There is plenty of funding within it and drawdowns are happening.  We are working with local authorities where they are finding difficulty in drawing down that funding.  The objective is to help people get affordable homes, with more than 10,000 people on the help-to-buy scheme and about 750 people through the Rebuilding Ireland home loan.</p>  <p>  We have put in place a number of different programmes to help members of the Defence Forces, teachers, members of the Garda and nurses to be able to afford to buy a home or to be able to rent a home at a rate below the market rate.  That is now coming through the local authorities and the housing bodies.  We are working with them in conjunction with the European Investment Bank to make that more of a reality for more people.</p></speech>

I have received them via freedom of information request, but it might be helpful for him to publish them.  They make for interesting reading and it is a pity it took so long to get these progress reports.  Has the Department considered amendments to the vacant site levy on the basis of the information contained in these reports, which highlight major problems with the levy introduced in 2015?</p></reply>

These arrangements commenced in respect of vacant sites included on local authority vacant site registers prior to 1 January 2018 with payment of the levy due in January 2019. </p>  <p>  When I was appointed Minister, I initiated a review of the measure and introduced amendments under the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2018 aimed at further strengthening the vacant site levy provisions.  These amendments included increasing the rate of the levy from 3% to 7% for sites on local authority vacant site registers from 2019 onwards and the removal of the possibility of applying reduced or zero rates of levy for sites on registers that are subject to a site loan which is greater than a specified percentage of the market value of the site, reflecting the improved economic circumstances and higher property prices since the levy measure was originally introduced.</p>  <p>  The inclusion of sites on vacant sites registers continues to be determined by the criteria provided for in section 5 of the 2015 Act, subject to the site not exceeding 0.05 ha in area.  I am satisfied that the existing minimum size threshold of 0.05 ha reflects the appropriate size of a vacant site that should be targeted with a view to maximising return from the measure, thereby enhancing its effectiveness.  To give some context, 0.05 ha is about 500 sq. m or about 5% of the size of a rugby pitch, on which it would be possible to build a maximum of two to three small houses or three to four small apartments.</p>  <p>  My Department does not maintain a central register of vacant sites, as each local authority administers the vacant site register in respect of its functional area.  A recent review of the online vacant site registers across all local authority areas shows there are collectively more than 360 individual sites currently on the local registers.  Over 120 of these sites were entered on the local vacant site registers on 1 January 2018 and are therefore subject to the levy in 2019, unless development works were activated in the interim. </p>  <p>  As of 14 March 2019, sites with a value of &euro;416 million were listed on local authority vacant site registers, of which &euro;281 million related to sites listed on the registers prior to 1 January 2018.  Without any changes to the number of sites currently listed on local authority registers, it is estimated that the levy proceeds nationally could be of the order of &euro;8.4 million, applying the current 3% levy rate in respect of sites on the registers in 2018, increasing to &euro;29.1 million in 2020, applying the increased 7% levy rate in respect of sites listed on local authority registers in 2019.  </p>  <p>  Levy implementation progress reports were requested from local authorities late last year and all local authorities have submitted responses.  These responses are currently being examined by my Department with a view to determining what, if any, further implementation supports may be required, as well as publishing the progress reports.  I can in the meantime arrange for copies of the progress reports to be made available to the Deputy if he so wishes. </p></speech>

I wonder if the Department has any interest in doing anything about it.  The vacant site implementation report from Wicklow County Council shows that it looked at 158 sites.  It highlighted a lack of clear understanding and interpretation of the legislation by internal staff in other local authorities and the Department.  It referred to the lack of consistency in decision-making from An Bord Plean&aacute;la in regard to sections 5 and 6.</p>  <p>  The Wicklow County Council report is very good, but the Wexford County Council one is rubbish; it only looked at four sites in the whole county.  What is going on?  Does it not have the staff to do it?  Will the Department do anything about it?  It does not make any sense.  The Wicklow County Council one is comprehensive, but the Wexford County Council one is not.  Perhaps it does not have the people.  If it does not have the people maybe the Department would provide them to it.  If the Department does not think the local authorities can do it, why not get someone else to do it?  Perhaps the independent planning regulator should be brought in if the Department is not prepared to give the power or if the local authorities do not have the mind to do it.</p>  <p>  There are 162 vacant sites in Dublin.  I was the one who argued for 0.05 ha back in 2015 because the Government had it at 0.01 ha.  When I look at the Dublin City Council report, I actually think I went too big.  The Minister said it is only possible to put a couple of houses or apartments on 0.05 ha.  I could put 12 apartments on 0.05 ha and it would be possible to put at least eight and maybe ten on 0.03 ha.  It might be hard for people to get finance to build out a small site and that is very understandable.  The local authority should look at buying the 162 sites and build them out itself.</p></speech>

There are 360 sites on the local registers.  More than &euro;400 million worth of land is under levy.  The new 7% rate that I brought in is now in effect, which means that over the two-year period it is a 10% levy on the value of that site.  It is worth noting that 42 sites have come off the register since it was first compiled because construction has commenced, and been completed in some instances, on those sites.  That shows it is successful, with 42 sites out of 360 sites actually seeing construction and having construction completed because the levy was applied to that vacant site.  Many more sites would be on the register were it not for our decision to introduce the levy and to more than double it in the course of this year.</p>  <p>  I am reviewing the reports and the Deputy is right that it is a different picture in different local authorities.  That is why we will help the local authorities that need that help.  I still believe the local authorities are best placed with their local knowledge to compile and maintain their registers of those sites in their own functional areas.</p></speech>

As he knows, my Bill proposes a levy of 25% which would really encourage them not to bank land.</p><p>Mel Reynolds has pointed out that in Dublin alone it could bring in close to &euro;300 million in one year if all the sites are tapped into in terms of a levy.  We could then talk about bringing down the price of housing.  A girl telephoned me at the weekend wondering if she should buy a three bedroom house more than 30 km from here for &euro;330,000.  That is &euro;330,000 for a three bedroom house.  I can tell the Minister the cost of such a house is half that amount on mainland Europe.  He will not be able to bring down the price of housing if he does not tackle land banking.  His site levy is not workable.  It will not make a difference.  There are major concerns about the definition of what even constitutes a vacant site.  I gave some examples at the committee.</p></speech>

We did not bring in the vacant site levy to bring in money.  We brought it in to encourage the use of land for development.  We will not measure this based on the amount of money we bring in but on the number of sites we get under construction as a result of bringing in the levy.  As I said, development is taking place on 42 sites since we brought in the levy.  We more than doubled it to 7% but over the two-year period that becomes 10%.  That is punitive.  If someone has a piece of land worth &euro;1 million, which actually is not very much for a piece of land-----</p></speech>

We have also got the Land Development Agency bringing forward State land to make sure we are progressing the existing massive State land banks that are not being used efficiently.  We can look at the different individual measures we have under Rebuilding Ireland from the Land Development Agency all the way through to our vacancy officer teams and the vacant site levy.

We have also seen a significant increase in the level of institutional investment in recent years, both with respect to building and the buying up of blocks of apartments.  Is the Department undertaking an analysis of the these two trends within the private rental sector and, in particular, their impact both on price in terms of affordability for new entrants and on security of tenure?</p></reply>

There are approximately 340,000 tenancies registered with the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, of which approximately 310,000 are private rented tenancies.  The majority of landlords, just over 70%, own just one property, with a further 16% owning just two properties.  Almost 86% of the registered rental housing stock is owned by landlords with fewer than ten properties, reflecting the fact that the overall proportion of the rental stock held by institutional investors is relatively low.</p>  <p>  Historically, the private rented sector in Ireland has been largely made up of small-scale landlords, who will continue to provide the bulk of private rented accommodation.  However, a more diverse sector, which includes institutional investors specialised in providing and managing rented residential property on a larger scale, provides additional stability and less exposure to property market risk and volatility.  Institutional investors can also help provide the range of tenancy options that households need across their lifecycles.  The fact that institutional investors are entering the rental market, with a clear long-term focus on their investment, provides security for tenants who can be confident that their landlord is committed for the long run.</p>  <p>  It is important to recognise the positive effects that institutional investment can have in terms of the supply of housing, not least given the scale of housing development envisaged under the national planning framework over the period to 2040, particularly apartment developments in the main urban centres.  It is worth noting that a recent report on institutional investment from the Department of Finance clearly points to the benefits of professionalising the sector, realising economies of scale, and a resultant improvement in regulatory and taxation compliance standards.</p>  <p>  That report also notes that it would not be correct to assume that the properties being bought by institutional investors would otherwise have been bought by first-time buyers, with the suggestion being made that much of the stock would likely have been purchased by buy-to-let investors with access to equity, either through their household or business wealth.</p>  <p>  I am committed to improving security of tenure of tenants and I have brought forward additional measures in this regard for Committee Stage of the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2018, scheduled for later this week.  These include providing new powers to the RTB to investigate and sanction landlords who engage in improper conduct, including non-compliance with the rent increase restrictions in rental pressure zones, which are the areas where institutional investment tends to be concentrated.</p>  <p>  The legislation will allow the RTB to initiate an investigation without the need for a complaint to be made.  It will also require the annual registration of tenancies with the RTB and significantly extend the notice periods for tenancy terminations by landlords.  The annual registration of tenancies will provide improved data on the profile of landlords in the market, including institutional landlords and will be of benefit to my Department in keeping the market under review, ensuring that we facilitate the positive impacts of institutional investment, while addressing any broader issues that may arise. </p></speech>

I am not against institutional investors if they have a long-term reasonable yield return to provide security of tenure and reasonable rent for landlords, as exists in other European member states, but the business logic particularly of vulture funds that are looking for short-term high-yielding rents is having a particularly problematic impact on large cities.  It is happening in New York, London and elsewhere in Europe and we are beginning to see it here.  We are having a disorderly exit of accidental buy-to-let landlords from the rental market, which we have seen during the past two years according to the Residential Tenancies Board, and an under-regulated entry of short-term investment funds into the private sector, which is having a destabilising effect.  Is that something the Minister and his Department are looking at and, if not, will he give a commitment to start doing so?</p></speech>

That site is bounded to the north by sports pitches and to the south by the M50 slip road.  The Central Bank appealed its inclusion on the register and stated: "The site creates a security buffer enabling surveillance particularly of adjoining public roads."  An Bord Plean&aacute;la accepted this argument in its decision and it became a vacant site.  The Carmelites own a site of approximately 3.45 ha on Balllinteer Road which is valued at more than &euro;21 million.  They said that they had planning permission for a carpark on that site but it was never used as a carpark.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la accepted that it was a vacant site because they had planning permission for it.  That is nonsense because the Minister will not be able to catch the sites in this regard.</p>  <p>  With regard to real estate investment trusts, REITs, I had an argument with the then Minister, Deputy Noonan, here on 16 January 2014 about what REITS would do to property in Dublin.  I said they would drive rents up through the roof.  He said it would not happen and that I was exaggerating, but it has happened.  They have been an unmitigated disaster with respect to the supply of housing and rental properties.  Why does the Minister not admit it?</p></speech>

If we consider 2017, less than 1% of transactions were from large foreign institutional investors - that is based on either 2017 or 2018 data.  Approximately 4.5% of tenancies are under the control of or the administration of these foreign institutional investors but it is growing.  Part of the reason for that is because of the changed guidelines around build-to-rent to attract more finance in to invest in more apartments, building and development.  It is good we are doing that because I believe we would all agree that we want to move away from the instability we currently have, because of our over-reliance on small individual landlords, to a more stable, mature and European style rental sector.  That means larger landlords making a longer-term play but we want them to make that play based on what we might refer to as a steady Eddie, a reasonable rate of return that does not allow for gouging.  That is why there is some comfort in knowing that the vast majority, if not all, institutional investors have invested in rent pressure zone areas where we do have strict regulations and they will get only stricter when we agree the legislation coming through the House.</p></speech>

Again, I draw the Minister's attention to what is happening in a number of large European cities, where large institutional investors are not long-term professional landlords in the way the Minister has described but short-term funds looking for short-term gain.  Of course, here, for those particular investment vehicles, we do not charge tax on the rent roll or capital gains tax when they have flipped a property at a later stage, and depending on how they are structured, they may not even pay dividend withholding tax.  We are inviting in the very short-term types of investment in the residential property market that will lead to ever greater levels of instability.</p>  <p>  I repeat my question to the Minister as he has not answered it in the first two rounds.  Will the Department look at the specific impact of these types of investment vehicles?  Again, I stress I am not against long-term sensible investment in the rental market so long as it is producing security for tenants in terms of security of tenure and rent certainty.  That is not what is happening in other jurisdictions and my worry is that, as these funds start to enter our market, we will replace the instability of the small accidental landlord with the instability of the large institutional vulture fund, which is very bad for our rental market.</p></speech>

One thing has not changed: housing remains unaffordable.  The Government is not tackling the fact the supply of housing in this country is dysfunctional.  It is double the price of mainland Europe for a three bedroom house within 30 km of the capital city.  That is the truth.  Why is it like that?  There are two aspects.  There is land banking, which the Government refuses to tax in a proper way, as other countries do, and there is a fellow called the developer who does not build anymore and who is looking for between 60 and 80 units.  The Government needs to tax land banking.  Some 10% of the housing stock is social housing when it needs to be about 30%.  The Government needs to get interested in providing a serious amount of social housing.  It should tax land banking and have 30% of the housing stock as social housing, and that will go some way towards addressing the dysfunctional nature of the supply of housing in this country.</p></speech>

Will he tell us why they would not be or where the building is for first-time buyers of apartments in particular?  He suggested this is a different set of properties.</p></speech>

In reply to Deputy Wallace, the housing sector in this country was dysfunctional for decades and it broke completely following the financial crisis.  What we are trying to do now is rebuild it in a way that is sustainable so it will not crash again.  There is a levy on vacant land and that is what we discussed in the previous question.  In regard to our ambitions around social housing, one in four of every new homes built last year was built for social housing.  That is an ambition that no previous Government has had and we are going to continue that into the years ahead under the national development plan.</p>  <p>  I am sorry I did not come back to Deputy &Oacute; Broin's question but Deputy Wallace brought us into other areas.  In regard to this particular area, the ownership of a property does not abrogate a tenant's rights in regard to the rent controls we put in place or a lease agreement they may have.  We have brought in much stronger tenancy protections in recent years and we are only going to strengthen them in the coming weeks.  Of course, this is something we keep under review in terms of making sure that, as we transform the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, and make it a proper independent regulator of our rental sector, it can have a proper view of exactly what is happening in market.  That is why the annual registration of individual tenants is so important to allow them to build up a proper knowledge base of exactly what is happening on a real-time basis, year in, year out, in our rental sector.  Of course, we keep it under review and I have discussed this report with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, which was one of the Deputy's earlier questions.</p>  <p>  In response to Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, the view of the Department, which prepared the report, was that it would not necessarily be the case that had an institutional investor not come in and bought, say, 50 apartments in a single scheme, this would mean that 50 people who were going to be first-time buyers might have bought them instead.  The likelihood, on its analysis, is that they might have been bought by individual buy-to-let investors, which would perhaps further reinforce the instability we have seen from having such a large share of individual landlords control such a large part of the property sector for rent in this country.</p></speech>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-04-09a.424.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1259" speakername="Clare Daly" time="19:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019040900038#LL00700"><p>My question relates to whether the Minister has or will consider the idea of a consultative forum of the Pyrite Remediation Board, the Housing Agency and Deputies in the constituencies affected by pyrite to review the legislation.  As the Minister knows, there are problems in regard to how the board and the agency are interpreting the legislation.  They seem to be refusing any intervention from the Department or legal advice the Minister has got.  It is making life incredibly difficult for citizens affected by pyrite.</p></reply>

There are no plans to set up the forum she is calling for but that does not mean we are not open to discussing any of the issues.  We had very useful meeting at the back end of last year where all the relevant Deputies came together with the agency and the Department to tease through some of the issues.  Progress was a little slow after that but we have made some progress in recent weeks.  I would be very happy to have that ongoing engagement.  In fairness, we attempted on a few occasions to try to have that.  There are still certain sectors that need changes and we are willing to look at that.  We have made progress on foot of the previous meeting and I will try to arrange another meeting.</p>  <p>  I do not intend to have a formal consultative board, however, as it is not required.  We can try to work through the changes with the Deputies concerned.  If that does not work out, we can look at it again, but it does not need a formal board, in my view.  There is a process where people can engage with the Pyrite Resolution Board directly.  I would be happy to arrange a further discussion and we can see where we go from there.</p></speech>

What I wanted was the opportunity to raise this issue on the floor of the House.  The Minister of State knows there are cases that are being interpreted by the board completely incorrectly.  The legislation as it stands states that people who bought their houses after the enactment of the legislation were generally not covered by the scheme unless they could demonstrate they did not know of the presence of pyrite nor could they have known.  The Minister of State got legal advice on that and he said there was no impediment to the board including cases under this remit.  I had a meeting with it about a constituent of mine where we demonstrated in black and white that the man could not have known because nobody knew, given that nowhere in Swords or anywhere in that estate was pyrite present when he bought that property.  Subsequently, a small number emerged.  The board listened to the case and it could not give me a reason it would not deal with it.  That was six months ago and a year after the Minister of State and I met the board on this issue, yet it still refuses to include that case.  It is madness.  There is no impediment.  If it does not listen to the Minister of State, what hope do I have as a Deputy?  We need some forum to call the board to account.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-04-09a.427" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1264" speakername="Damien English" time="19:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019040900038#LL01000"><p>Perhaps I was not clear in my first answer.  I think we have made progress on that particular area.  The Department got legal advice because I do not expect any board to listen to me as an individual Minister of State, so we backed that up with legal advice and an opinion.  I understand the board then got its own legal advice and we have now finally made progress on that situation, which affects a certain number of people.  I believe that, as of the meeting last week, a certain amount of progress has been made, so perhaps the Deputy will be a little happier on that situation.  I am aware there are still other scenarios we want to tease through.  Nonetheless, we have made some progress because we did not give up in the past six months.  We kept pursuing this but we used proper legal advice and legal interpretation, not just my opinion or somebody else's.  That was as a result of us all coming together to tease through some of the problems.  I am happy for us to do that again to facilitate the process.</p>  <p>  To be clear, more than 2,000 people have made applications at this stage, in excess of 1,800 are in the system, more than 1,400 have had their houses resolved to a satisfactory condition, and approximately 500 will have their houses remediated this year as well.  We have made good progress, as the Deputy has acknowledged.  There are other scenarios which we will deal with.  I am happy to consult the Deputy to do that.</p></speech>

The Minister of State got legal advice, fair play to him, and that advice said there was no impediment to the board in this regard.  Then the board, presumably, used public money again to get its own legal advice to stop the implementation of something the Minister of State was trying to facilitate.  How in God's name is that a productive use of the board's time?  I hear what the Minister of State is saying, which is that, a year and a half down the road, he thinks he has got the board back online.  That is not good enough from a public body, particularly when I have at least one householder whose house is crumbling and who cannot be included in the scheme when we clearly demonstrated that he could not have known that pyrite existed because nobody in Swords knew at the time.  It is shameful.  I am not blaming the Minister of State because I know he is trying to push the board.  However, is it not shocking that the Minister of State had to go to these lengths?  We are now on our third round of legal advice to get these fellows to act.  It would have been cheaper if they had just gone and fixed the man's house to begin with.</p></speech>

It concerns two citizens of Ireland, Patrick Halpin and Anne Keane of Aberdeen Lodge, and their young family.  They are running a modest business and were encouraged by so-called experts to expand it some years ago.  It went wrong for them, as it did for so many others.  Their expansion failed and they ended up carrying losses.  The problem is that a cross-guarantee on their family home and the business that is supporting their two young children is being pursued.  Pat and Anne are paying &euro;5,000 a month towards their home and business which are one and the same.  Deputy Durkan and I have written to the bank and its agents and legal representatives offering to bring about an amicable solution for both the family and the bank.  The situation has caused huge strain for the family.  We have approached the experts and agents as two elected Members of this House more than a dozen times, but they have failed to meet us on any occasion.  Goldman Sachs and its agent, Pepper, is pursuing the case.  Goldman Sachs has refused to meet Deputy Durkan and me, no matter how many times we have asked.  This is not what we expect from a reputable major international lender.  To my mind, it is a vulture fund attempting to seize an asset that has increased in value by a huge amount in the past few years.  The couple has offered to pay off the outstanding moneys on their business and family home, but this has not been accepted or even explored to any great extent.  We are raising the issue today because persistent efforts by me and Deputy Durkan as elected representatives have failed to do anything.  We have acted on behalf of two citizens of the country and their two young children who will be on the street if the repossession goes ahead.</p></speech>

It is about taking their circumstances and the advice they were given at a particular time into account.  Like a lot of others, they made a mistake during the boom.  They made the wrong investment and were overloaded which resulted in their property being repossessed and sold at a value of more than &euro;20 million.  The guarantee - their family home and that of their children and their business - is now before the courts and the property is liable for repossession which will leave them homeless.</p>  <p>  We fully accept that the matter has been dealt with by the courts.  The family have gone through the system.  There is a belief at home and abroad that lending institutions must get their money back, but there is no such thing as risk-free lending.  It does not happen in that way.  People took risks during the boom times, but that was then and this is now.  </p>  <p>  Deputy O'Connell and I have made numerous attempts to reason with the lending institutions involved.  We have offered to meet them on numerous occasions, but our offer was rejected, unless we put our proposals on paper before we met anybody.  That is totally unrealistic, as the Ceann Comhairle will recognise.  We have offered to mediate, free of charge, to bring about an amicable solution for both the banks and the borrowers.  This is not something we have done lightly.  We have offered it in good faith, in the clear knowledge that a solution can be delivered.  We are now in a position to offer an enhanced settlement which we will deliver to the lending institutions when we meet them.</p></speech>

It would be wholly inappropriate for me or the Minister to comment on or interfere in any way with a matter that is before the courts.

The State is divided between the Government, the organ of State which exercises executive power, the two Houses of Parliament which comprise the Oireachtas with the President, and the courts.</p>  <p>  I will outline the Government's commitment to assist those in mortgage difficulty.  It is demonstrated by the establishment of the State-funded Abhaile scheme which seeks to find solutions for those in mortgage arrears by providing them with free independent expert advice and support tailored to their individual circumstances.  It includes the identification and negotiation of solutions and support in court if they are facing repossession proceedings.  Abhaile has assisted more than 11,000 people with vouchers to avail of free legal aid and financial support since it was established in 2016.  The director of the Insolvency Service of Ireland recently highlighted the fact that 95% of personal insolvency arrangements negotiated by personal insolvency practitioners had resulted in people staying in their own home.</p>  <p>  The latest figures from the Central Bank of Ireland, dating from the end of 2018, show that more than 111,000 principal dwelling home mortgages had been restructured.  This illustrates how important it is for borrowers to engage with their lenders as it is possible to put solutions in place.  That is notwithstanding the case the two Deputies have raised, in which there seems to be a difficulty in engaging.  While there are still too many in mortgage arrears, we are making progress.  The number of accounts in arrears has been declining every quarter since the peak in 2013.</p>  <p>  I would like to refer to the protections in place for those in mortgage difficulty.  The Government and the Central Bank of Ireland are strongly of the view that the consumer protection regulatory framework provides strong protections for those in mortgage arrears.  The House will recall that late last year the Government supported and assisted Deputy Michael McGrath in bringing his Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2018 into force.  The Act has expanded the scope of &ldquo;credit servicing&rdquo; to include legal ownership of legal title to credit granted under a credit agreement and associated ownership activities.  Therefore, if a loan is transferred, the holder of the legal title to the credit must be authorised by the Central Bank as a credit servicing firm.  The Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2015 provides that all of the consumer protections a borrower had prior to a loan sale continue to apply after the loan</p>  <p>sale, irrespective of the regulatory status of the new creditor.  Furthermore, the Central Bank statutory code of conduct on mortgage arrears applies to the mortgage loan of a borrower which is secured by his or her primary residence.  The code sets out how mortgage lenders must treat borrowers facing mortgage arrears.  Lenders are required to comply with all aspects of the code and its protections apply to residential mortgages provided for consumers, irrespective of who owns the loan.  The code is enforceable against regulated entities by the Central Bank.</p>  <p>  The mortgage to rent scheme is another Government initiative to help homeowners who are at risk of losing their home.

The key consideration for me and I assume for Deputy Durkan is fairness and the humanity of the situation.  The Minister of State referenced the &euro;25 million debt, but he failed to mention what was realised when the seized asset was sold and how much of the &euro;25 million had been paid off.  We are Teachta&iacute; D&aacute;la, messengers of the people.  People have asked us to act on their behalf.  A vulture fund - I am not its messenger and do not intend ever to be - is looking at an asset, rather than the debt.</p><p>The situation is that because of its location, this asset has inflated in value to such an extent.  My concern is that in a bundle of loans, this prime asset was picked out specifically as something it wanted to realise the value of.</p></speech>

I have no doubt he will take up the matter with his colleague.  I would like the Central Bank to become aware of the situation that affects people in these circumstances.  I do not agree with what was said about the satisfactory settlement of 95% of mortgage arrears cases throughout the country.  I have a considerable amount of experience in dealing with them, but I will not go into that just now other than to say that I believe there is a good case here for the parties involved to make themselves available to resolve the problem.  This is not about who wins.  This is not about putting people out on the road.  This is not about breaking up a family and shoving parents and their children out on the road.  This is about a commercial loan to which the people are making regular payments and have been doing so for the past two to three years.  They are willing to increase and enhance those payments.  It is about the lending institution, an internationally reputed one, climbing down from its high horse and dealing with people as it should.  If it does that, I believe we can achieve an amicable settlement that is acceptable to both the lender and the borrower.  We will reserve the right to raise this matter in various other fora as well.  With your help, a Cheann Comhairle, I have no doubt the matter will be resolved.</p></speech>

The information that was available to me from my departmental officials is that the case was before the courts, but I accept what you have said, a Cheann Comhairle.  I agree that an issue arises in terms of the code of conduct on mortgage arrears.  I will not refer to the particular case at hand but every Deputy in the House deals with lenders and financial institutions.  The code of conduct of those financial institutions has been strengthened by Deputy Michael McGrath's Act, which puts the onus on the lender.  It is important that lenders engage with customers regardless of the state the loan is in or at.  I do not refer to any specific loan.  As public representatives, we all make interventions with lending agencies to accept the bona fides of our constituents.  When customers nominate an Oireachtas Member to deal with their account, in my experience 99 times out of 100 the lending institution accepts that.  It is important for every financial institution in the State to accept that when Patrick O'Donovan or whoever else nominates an Oireachtas Member, for argument's sake let us say Deputy Michael Moynihan, then the financial institution should accept that and should engage with the Oireachtas Member and at least speak to him or her.  That is just good manners and it is in keeping with the code of conduct on mortgage arrears.  I wish to make it very clear that I am not speaking to any specific loan or mortgage, but given everything that we have gone through, it would be only good manners for a financial institution to engage with my two colleagues.  I hope whoever nominates somebody to speak to the bank on their behalf, whether that is a personal insolvency practitioner, PIP, a solicitor or a mere mortal Member of the Houses of the Oireachtas, that the financial institution will accept that.</p></speech>

It is not the first time I have raised it in the House.  The reality is that broadband is now one of the commodities required for daily life as we head into the third decade of the 21st century.</p>  <p>  Many commitments have been made on broadband.  One of the most recent initiatives was the announcement by the Taoiseach six months ago that it would become a personal crusade of his and that he would drive it on through the difficult challenges in the Department.  Five years ago, almost to the day, a previous ministerial colleague of the current Minister, Pat Rabbitte, announced that there would be broadband almost instantaneously and we have had many more commitments in regard to it.  The reality of the situation on the ground in my constituency in north Cork is that many communities fail to access broadband.  We have the farcical situation now whereby Eir has got a State contract to bring broadband to certain locations, but where there are two, three or four houses at the end of the line or in some instances just one house and while the line is there, the community cannot get connected to it.  Ongoing issues are evident in Rockchapel, Banteer, Bweeng, Rathcoole, and Waterfall, which is just outside Cork city.  It is not just a rural issue as it affects homes adjacent to the city.  It would be remiss of me if I did not mention Kiskeam.  I know you were waiting for me to mention it, a Cheann Comhairle.  I could see it in your countenance.  The reality for those communities in Duhallow and north Cork is that they are all waiting for broadband to be rolled out.  If they had broadband, people could decide to work two or three days a week from home, which is far more compatible with family life than long commutes.  People would like the option of working from home but the broadband is not sufficiently reliable.</p>  <p>  What is the status of the fictitious broadband plan?  There were indications earlier in the year that there would be an announcement before Easter, that it would all be hunky-dory and that the contracts would be signed.  Six weeks ago the Taoiseach announced that the final cost of the broadband plan could be many multiples of the original &euro;500 million.  While all of that debate is going on, the reality is that broadband is not being rolled out to the communities in north Cork, Duhallow and other places that cannot access broadband.  Will the Minister intervene at this stage with Eir and the contracts it has got from the State and find out its plans to provide for the three, four or five houses at the end of a line?  In the first instance, a sensible and common-sense decision should be made to ensure that every available house is connected to broadband.  In the second instance, will the Minister outline whether there is a plan to roll out broadband to those communities that are so badly in need of it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-04-09a.448" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="20:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019040900040#NN00800"><p>I thank Deputy Michael Moynihan for facilitating the timing of this debate.  He was seeking to have it earlier but I could not be present then in person.</p>  <p>  I will put the situation in perspective.  I am relatively recently in the post.  The position on to the national broadband plan is that, as Deputy Moynihan said, it has been at the inception stage for some time.  Part of that is to be delivered by commercial operators.  The plan is to achieve high-speed broadband for every home in the country.  Since the plan was initiated in 2012, the proportion of homes that get access to high-speed broadband has increased from 30% to 52% in 2016 to 74% currently.  There is a very substantial uptake in the proportion of people with high-speed broadband and that is all being delivered commercially.</p>  <p>  When it comes to the intervention or amber area, as it is described, where we will provide a State subsidy for delivering broadband, those are strictly confined to areas where the commercial sector says it will not deliver.  Under state aid rules, if the commercial sector opts to make provision for any area, it has to be carved out once it commits to delivering it to the standard that has been specified.  That is what happened in respect of Eir.  Originally, it was an intervention area of 750,000 homes but Eir said it would commit to delivering to 300,000 homes directly, and it is in the course of rolling that out.  At the last count, I heard broadband had been delivered to 225,000 homes.  As the Deputy has said, there are a number of areas of frustration involved.  Sometimes Eir has not yet fulfilled what it said it would do.  We are tracking households or areas where a commitment was made to deliver broadband, and some of them may have to go back into the intervention area and the state-aided support.</p><p>There are others who did not put up their hands for Eir but who are very close to people to whom it has given a commitment to deliver a commercial service.  I know that it is a source of frustration if the fibre has been laid half way up the road and not completed, but in most instances that is the way Eir bids.  It bid for what it believed it could serve commercially.  If the Deputy looks at the map, he will see it.  It is like a spider that is set out on it and it ends abruptly on roads where the connection does not extend any further.  The Deputy asked if I could intervene.  I cannot intervene to instruct Eir to do X or Y.  I could say that if it was not delivering, it should take them back into the intervention area.  If, after a discussion with it, it became clear that it was not able to do it, it would be brought back into the intervention area.</p> <p> On the broadband plan, the final tender was submitted in September.  As there is only one final tenderer, the House will understand we have had to engage in much more careful due diligence which has taken more time, but the Taoiseach is right.  The aim is to try to provide a recommendation for the Government in or around Easter.  The Taoiseach signalled in the House that while his objective would be to consider the issue at Easter, the handling of Brexit in the weeks around this period could see that objective deferred to some degree, but it is not intended to be a significant deferral, if it occurs.  I am aiming to bring forward a proposal on which the Government can make a decision.  As the Deputy rightly said, the project has become more expensive because of the diminished area.  We have to service 96% of the area in which only 23% of the population exist.  The numbers I have show that 184,183 people in Cork have access to high-speed broadband.  Another 11,000 will be served by Eir in the company's ongoing deployment of a high speed broadband network.  That will leave 74,820 premises to receive broadband using the intervention model.  They are in what is called the amber area.</p></speech>

First, have Government officials met Eir to discuss the issue of inflexibility in areas in which it is currently expanding the broadband network?  In communities with only two, three or four houses it makes common sense to tell Eir that the fibre cable is passing them and ask why it cannot connect them to it.  In the case of some of the communities it is serving, if more power was injected into initial delivery, Eir would be able to provide access further out on the line.  Irrespective of the fictitious broadband plan about which the Government is talking, I need the Minister to get his officials to talk to Eir to see if there is some flexibility in getting broadband to the communities I have mentioned.  I will not detail the entire area of north Cork, but every community within the Duhallow region is affected.</p>  <p>  Second, the Minister spoke about Brexit being the reason the Government did not have enough time to make a decision before Easter which would delay it by a few weeks.  If it comes out in, say, the first week of May with an announcement on broadband, the entire public will make only one comment, namely, that it is gobbledygook and that it is only being rolled out in advance of the European and local elections, as happened five years ago.  People will not buy it.  I refer to the Minister's figure of 74,000 houses, all of which must be on the northern side of Cork North West.  I know the people who are coming to me.  There are swathes of north Cork into west Cork and other parts of the county that are without a broadband connection.  A broadband service is essential in the way we live today.  Either the Minister or his officials should examine ways to be flexible in that regard.  For God's sake, if possible, they should roll out the plan.</p></speech>

It specified a figure of 300,000 homes, of which, 11,000 remain to be connected by Eir where it has committed to do so.  That will be monitored, but we cannot force the pace.  There are other cases which the Deputy may be describing in which Eir has not committed to providing a service, but it is frustrating.  Again, they are in the intervention area.  Unless Eir decides, on its own account, that it is in its commercial interests to deliver a service, they will remain in the area in which we will have to provide a service under state aid rules.</p>  <p>  There is a final category of cases on which Eir has made a commitment that it will deliver a service, but it appears that it will not fulfil that commitment.  My Department has conducted an exercise to identify such premises which are in the blue area.  If some of the premises to which the Deputy is referring are in that area, I would be happy to receive the details of them.  I will ask my Department to engage further with Eir on its plans to deliver a service to them.  If it is not in a position to do so, we will have to consider including them in the intervention area which would be included in the contract.  I am not sure whether the Deputy wants to see it brought forward or delayed.  I was confused at the end about what he wanted-----</p></speech>

I do not doubt that it is a complex project because we have detailed debates on it, with many Deputies on the Deputy's side of the House rightly raising many concerns about different aspects of it.  It is those very concerns I have been at pains to investigate in order that before I make a recommendation to the Government and come to the House to explain what is being proposed they will be thoroughly and robustly examined and due diligence applied.  That is what has been done.</p></speech>

The issue I raise concerns the criteria applied in the deployment of members of the Garda emergency response units or any other specialist entity within the force and the operational guidelines that apply once they are deployed.  The matter has been prompted by an experience in my community two weeks ago.  Before I left for Leinster House this day two weeks ago, Tuesday, 26 March, my home town and the wider community were awash with speculation about what had happened in Monaghan town that morning.  The speculation had built by the weekend when I returned and had been fuelled by the absence of any explanation for what had actually taken place.</p><p>What is known is that a significant number of heavily armed members, clad in black, of some section of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na had been deployed in the town.  There were reports of raids on buildings in the town centre and at least one domestic dwelling in a housing estate off a main approach road to the town.  A man was reported as having jumped or fallen from a second floor window onto the street below and sustained at least one broken leg and possibly other injuries.  Was he the subject of interest or one of a number of subjects of interest for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?  We do not know.  What type of operation would give rise to such a deployment?  Why was there such a show of heavily armed and presumably highly trained armed garda&iacute; on the streets?  We still do not know the reason for it.</p><p>In response to an inquiry from the local newspaper, the <i>Northern Standard</i>, the Garda press office issued the following:</p><blockquote>Garda&iacute; executed a search warrant at premises on Dublin Street in Monaghan at about 11 am on 26th March.  During the course of the search a man was injured.  The man was later treated for leg injuries in hospital.  No arrests were made.  The matter has been referred to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.  There were no shots fired or anyone stabbed and no search took place at a named facility within the wider community.</blockquote><p>That is the end of the statement and it is the only information that has been released to date of which I am aware.  The statement is not wholly accurate.  It says much less than what people already knew.  Why is that?  It refers to 11 a.m. but much of what took place happened at least two hours earlier that morning.  It states that a search warrant was executed on premises in the town's Dublin Street.  What were the members of the Garda expecting in the execution of this and other searches in Monaghan that morning?  The deployment of a significant number of heavily-armed members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na suggests they expected to be met by a level of serious resistance or, perhaps, firepower.  Why else would they present such a show in such strength?</p> <p> At a time when transparency and accountability are expected to be normal elements in the relationship between those who are entrusted to carry out the function of policing and those on whose behalf they act, the people of Ireland and its component communities, an explanation, a context or some level of openness should apply.  No such explanation, context or openness has been given or displayed in this instance.  Within whatever restrictions may apply, and I can understand this might be the case with regard to certain aspects, will the Minister offer my community an explanation or context for what took place?</p></speech>

The emergency response unit is a highly-trained and well-equipped special intervention capability that is supported by a number of regional armed support units and a range of other resources across the Garda organisation.</p>  <p>  I am advised that the detail of the number of garda&iacute; and resources allocated to the ERU is deemed to be operationally sensitive and cannot be disclosed for security reasons but I can say that the Garda Commissioner has established an armed support unit, ASU, in each of the six Garda regions to provide an armed response capacity and capability to support and supplement the national emergency response unit.  As the Deputy will understand, it is generally not the practice nor would it be prudent to disclose the detail of the security arrangements in place for the deployment of the ERU.  To do so would plainly provide an advantage to those with ill intent and, of course, Ireland still faces many threats, chief among them the threat from dissident republicans.</p>  <p>  The Garda Commissioner established the special tactics and operations command, STOC, in August 2017 following a number of recommendations in the November 2015 Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate report, "Changing Policing in Ireland".  The objective of the STOC is to make policing safer by providing specialist firearms and less lethal services, including for spontaneous incidents such as emergency 999 calls and for pre-planned operations.  The STOC has a number of specialist teams under its command including the ERU, the national negotiator and, within Dublin, the armed support unit.  The STOC also has a governance role for the ASUs located outside Dublin as these are managed locally as regional resources.</p>  <p>  The Garda Commissioner has provided the following information.  On 26 March 2019, an incident occurred in Monaghan in which an individual was injured and was subsequently brought to hospital where the person received treatment.  The matter was then referred to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in accordance with section 102 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.  The Deputy will appreciate that given the independent role of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission in investigating the incidents referred to it, it would be inappropriate for me to comment any further at this time.</p></speech>

He referred to armed response capacity.  To what is it a response?  I am told the estimates for the number involved was in the order of 20 to 30.  They were heavily-armed and disguised members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  What was their purpose?  What was it all about?  It certainly created significant disruption that morning.  Children going to school were subjected to the spectacle of a significant disturbance in their housing scheme and in one of the principal streets at the heart of our town.</p>  <p>  The Minister has just stated that an incident occurred in which an individual was injured.  Unless we are told to the contrary, the individual who was injured was obviously reacting to what would have been a very frightening presentation.  I do not know whether he was a person of interest or whether anybody associated with him was.  I know nothing of that but it would be a terrible travesty if he was an innocent party who was frightened into an action that resulted in serious injury and his hospitalisation.  What was it about?  It is important that the House is advised on what the criteria are for the deployment of such a number of heavily-armed and disguised members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It should not be part of normal policing behaviour or activity.  It should only be a response where significant threat or the prospect of same presents.</p>  <p>  Once again, can the Minister shed any further light on the mystery of the events in Monaghan town of 26 March?  Otherwise, the mystery continues.</p></speech>

However, I impress upon the Deputy the independence and importance of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.  It is an independent body which was established to receive complaints made by members of the public concerning the conduct of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  While the funding of the commission is provided through the Department, the commission is independent in the operation of its functions.</p>  <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in has put certain matters before the House regarding the disposition of the individual and the circumstances.  The House would be rightly critical of me, as Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in would be, if I sought to interfere in any way with the investigation of an incident by GSOC.  The House passed legislation by a substantial majority to establish the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.  It behoves us, therefore, to comply with the provisions of that legislation with regard to the independence of that body.  Like Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, I await the result of the investigation, which is undoubtedly taking place as we debate this issue.</p></speech>

While this announcement was welcomed, there was some surprise that the school was to be located down in the Citywest-Fortunestown end of the area, rather than, as everybody expected, in the Rathcoole-Newcastle end of it.  One of the reasons that is important is there is very significant residential development taking place in Citywest, Rathcoole, Newcastle and Saggart, with more to come.  We are already seeing, in Saggart in particular, a significant number of parents who are not guaranteed appropriate school places for their children in Holy Family national school next year.  Up to 19 families could be affected.  While some of the children could be accommodated in Scoil Chr&oacute;n&aacute;in in Rathcoole, other families do not know at this point if they will have appropriate school places for their children.  The question is whether the Minister is aware of this problem, he has spoken to schools in the area and he is willing to work with Opposition Deputies to try to resolve the issue to ensure, in the first instance, that all of the families who are unsure if they will have school places for their children next year will have them secured.  We also need to look again at the figures underpinning the proposal for an eight-classroom school in the Citywest-Fortunestown end of the area to see if, in fact, we need two new schools, one in Citywest and one possibly in the Rathcoole end of the area from 2020 to absorb population growth in the two school planning areas.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-04-09a.463" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1298" speakername="John Curran" time="20:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019040900043#QQ00200"><p>The principal of Holy Family national school has indicated the significant number of children he is unable to accommodate this year.  Some 117 applications were made to the school which has only been able to accommodate 93 pupils in classrooms with 31 children  Some 24 pupils have been left to their own devices.  If people cancel, they may be accommodated, but it is still a significant number.  At the same time, the Irish language school, Scoil Chr&oacute;n&aacute;in, has three additional emergency classrooms being provided in the community centre.  There is a very significant issue with this year's enrolment in September.  The school is at capacity and as new families move into the area, they will not always have children to be placed in junior infants; they may be placed in other classes or looking for a school place, but most of the classrooms are full to capacity.  </p>  <p>  This time two years ago we had a debate in this House about the provision of second level education in the general Citywest area and the Government had no plans to provide it.  It was not until April 2018 that there was an announcement of a new school.  The reason I say this is not to have a go at the Government but to highlight the rapidly changing demographics and population growth in the area.  Will the Minister agree to reconsider and re-examine this area?  The provision he is making for the general area is on Fortunestown Lane which is not appropriate or significant, considering what is required in Rathcoole which, in its own right, requires additional school capacity.  The housing developments in the immediate vicinity will fill the new eight-classroom school on Fortunestown Lane.  We, therefore, have two issues that we wish to raise with the Minister.  Can he give us any advice on what can be done with the children from Rathcoole who would like to have a place there this year?  Second, on the longer term development of a new school, can we look at providing a new primary school in the Rathcoole school planning area, not elsewhere in Saggart or Citywest, as is being proposed?</p></speech>

I am appreciative of the information and conscious of the fact that there has been a reaching out to see how we can help and work with each other.  I also acknowledge my colleague, Deputy Fitzgerald, for her work in keeping me informed on this matter also.  The question gives me an opportunity to set out for the D&aacute;il the position on school places at primary level in the Rathcoole area.</p>  <p>  In order to plan for school provision and analyse the relevant demographic data my Department divides the country into 314 school planning areas.  It uses a geographical information system, GIS, to identify where there will be pressure for school places across the country.  The GIS uses data from a range of sources, including the Central Statistics Office, Ordnance Survey Ireland, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and the Department of Education and Skills' databases.  With this information, the Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises at primary and post-primary level to determine where additional school accommodation is needed.  Major new residential developments in an area also have the potential to alter demand in that area.  In that regard, as part of the demographic exercises, my Department engages with each of the local authorities to obtain the up-to-date data for significant new residential developments in each area.  This is necessary to ensure schools infrastructure planning is keeping pace with demographic changes as there is a constantly evolving picture with planned new residential development, including additional residential developments arising from the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund, LIHAF.</p>  <p>  Where demographic data indicate additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may, depending on the circumstances, be provided through either one, or a combination of the following: utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools; extending the capacity of a school or schools; and provision of a new school or schools.</p>  <p>  As the Deputies will be aware, the Government recently announced plans for the establishment of 42 new schools in the next four years, including a new eight-classroom primary school to be established in 2020 to serve the Newcastle-Rathcoole-Saggart school planning area.  The four-year horizon will enable increased lead-in times for planning and delivery of the necessary infrastructure.  Following on from the announcement, the locations of all of the schools, including the new primary school announced to serve Newcastle-Rathcoole-Saggart, are being determined as part of the site acquisition process which is under way.  The 2020 design and build programme will provide a new eight-classroom school, including a two-class special educational needs base and a 1,000 pupil post-primary school, including a four-class special education needs base, on a shared site at Fortunestown Lane which is in the ownership of the Dublin and D&uacute;n Laoghaire Education and Training Board.  Owing to commercial sensitivities with site acquisitions in general, I am unable to elaborate further at this time.</p>  <p>  The capital programme provides for devolved funding for additional classrooms, if required, for schools where an immediate enrolment need has been identified or where an additional teacher has been appointed.  My Department has approved three temporary classrooms for Scoil Chr&oacute;n&aacute;in national school, Rathcoole, to cater for immediate needs.  These rooms are initially being provided in Rathcoole Community Centre, pending the provision of the temporary accommodation at the school.</p>  <p>  On school admissions, parents can choose to which school to apply and where the school has places available, the pupil should be admitted.  However, in schools where there are more applicants than places available, a selection process may be necessary.  The selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and applied fairly to all applicants.  However, it may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</p></speech>

It is a little disappointing, although in fairness, I would not expect him to have the full details of some of the changes taking place.  It is important for him to understand there are very significant demographic and residential changes occurring in this area, both at the Citywest end of the school area and in Rathcoole and Newcastle.  The concern Deputy Curran and I have is that the demographic analysis of the ETB and the Department's assessments that informed the capital plan are out of date and do not take into account the new residential developments that are taking place there.</p>  <p>We have two problems.  First, there are somewhere between 15 and 19 families who today do not know if they will have appropriate school places for their children next September.  We are asking the Minister to work with us to try to resolve that issue alongside the schools in Rathcoole. </p>  <p>  Second, we are asking the Minister and the Department to look again at the demographic data to reassess whether we need an additional capital investment in the Rathcoole area.  I am sure the three Deputies present and our colleague Deputy Gino Kenny will be very keen to meet the Minister and his departmental officials to talk through the finer details.  If the Minister can give us a commitment to do this, we will organise it in the next few weeks.</p></speech>

I reiterate that there is still a significant number of families who live in Rathcoole but who have no school places next September for their children.  It really is not appropriate that they have to send their children to Newcastle, Saggart or Clondalkin.  That is not an appropriate solution.  The Minister said there were options, including looking at extending the capacity of schools in the area.  We need to investigate these options.</p>  <p>  The demographics suggest there has been significant population growth in the west of Dublin.  Only two years ago we had a debate in the House in which we pleaded for a new second level school in the Citywest area based on the existing number of primary schools.  It was not included in the plans and was first announced in April 2018.  That shows the rate of change.</p>  <p>  I am appealing to the Minister.  The population of Rathcoole will need more than what is provided for in the current plan which is to provide a single stream school in Fortunestown.  That school may be extended, but it is too far away from Rathcoole.</p>  <p>  As the Minister has indicated clearly, the current school in the area, Holy Family national school, is at capacity.  The Minister has extended Scoil Chr&oacute;n&aacute;in.  There is immediate demand to plan for a new school in the Rathcoole area.  I appeal to the Minister to work with all colleagues to try to address the shortage this year and the longer term goal of providing a new school.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-04-09a.467" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1290" speakername="Joe McHugh" time="20:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019040900044#RR00200"><p>This is broken down into two issues.  I again thank the Deputies for raising the matter.  The demographics are evolving and there are young families in the area.  We have to be vigilant about the changed demographics and the increased number of residential developments.  That is at what my officials look.  They also look at long-term issues, including where planning permission is sought.</p>  <p>  We can provide enhanced capacity at existing schools sites.  That is looked at, as is the question of where there is a need for a new school.  That can also be analysed.  In this instance, we have a short-term issue involving 15 to 19 families.  At this time of year not all of the data for spaces are available.  I will ask the officials in the Department to work with the local authorities in the area to ensure a solution is worked on in that regard in the short term, but we also need to look at the long-term issue.  In Dublin, Meath, Kildare and the Acting Chairman's county of Louth there is a constantly evolving picture, with a growing population and more housing developments.  This is something of which departmental officials are conscious, which is why they use the geographic information system and as much up-to-date data as possible.</p>  <p>  I am happy to work with the Deputies on this issue and appreciate their raising it in the House.  The issues of education provision and ensuring we provide as much access for young people as possible are above politics.  Certainly, I am happy to work with the Deputies on the matter.</p></speech>

It is normally done by the committee, but here we go.</p><p>The European Union Agency for the Operational Management of Large-Scale IT Systems in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice, known as eu-LISA, was established in 2011 and has operated since December 2012 to provide a long-term solution for the operational management of large-scale information technology systems which are essential instruments in the implementation of the asylum, border management and migration policies of the European Union.  eu-LISA currently fulfils the operational management tasks for the Schengen information system, the visa information system and the European asylum dactyloscopy database, known as Eurodac.</p><p>eu-LISA keeps all IT systems under its responsibility functioning 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  This allows the continuous uninterrupted exchange of data between the national authorities that use the systems.  eu-LISA is also responsible for adopting and implementing security measures on the IT systems; organising training for national authority IT experts on the systems under its management; providing relevant reporting and statistics; and monitoring research activities.  eu-LISA is responsible for ensuring security and data protection requirements are fully met.  The agency has responsibility for the sophisticated communication tools and networks that support the various IT systems.  For instance, eu-LISA provides the communication infrastructure for SIS II, Eurodac and VIS.  In addition, it is responsible for the operational management of Vision and DubIiNet which ensure the communication infrastructure for the VIS and Eurodac systems respectively.</p><p>The headquarters of eu-LISA are in Tallinn, Estonia, while its operational centre is in Strasbourg, France.  There is also a business continuity site for the systems under management based in Austria and a liaison office in Brussels.</p><p>EU Regulation No. 2018/1726 repeals the regulation establishing eu-LISA and provides the agency with a renewed mandate.  It is proposed that eu-LISA will provide centralised operational management of EU information systems and be responsible for the preparation, development and operational management of the new information systems proposed by the Commission.  They include the entry-exit system, EES, and the EU travel information and authorisation system, ETIAS.  It is also proposed to provide for the extension of the eu-LISA mandate in respect of DubliNet which, to date, has been entrusted to eu-LISA via a service level agreement.  The regulation places additional responsibility on eu-LISA for improving the quality of the data, establishing common data quality indicators and developing a central repository for reporting and statistics.  The regulation requires eu-LISA to develop the main technical features of the Commission's approach towards interoperability, consisting of a European search portal, a shared biometric matching service and a common identity repository to ensure all EU information systems interact efficiently.</p><p>The regulation extends the mandate of eu-LISA with regard to research, in particular, giving eu-LISA the task of implementing the parts of the framework programme for research and innovation that relate to IT systems in the area of freedom, security and justice.  It is proposed that more pilot projects may be entrusted to eu-LISA.  It is proposed that eu-LISA may be requested to provide advice for member states on national systems connection to the central systems and <i>ad hoc</i>support.  eu-LISA may also be requested to provide advice and support for the Commission on technical issues.  It may also be tasked to develop, manage and host common IT systems by a group of least six member states in the area of freedom security and justice.</p><p>Ireland's participation in this regulation is complicated because the instrument builds on Schengen measures in which Ireland may participate, for example, police co-operation aspects of SIS Il; Schengen measures in which Ireland has chosen not to participate, for example, VIS, the border aspects of SIS II, EES and ETIAS; and non-Schengen measures in which Ireland participates like Eurodac.  The Schengen aspects are subject to Protocol 19, known as the Schengen protocol, while the non-Schengen aspects are subject to Protocol 21, known as the JHA protocol.  In order to participate in this regulation amending eu-LISA and, therefore, continue our participation in the agency that manages the operations of large-scale IT systems in which we participate, both Protocol No. 19 and Protocol No. 21 annexed to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union are engaged.</p><p>The opt-in process follows the process devised in 2012 to permit limited opt-in by Ireland to the supervision, management and oversight by eu-LISA of those aspects of the eu-LISA system in which we actually do not participate such as the border aspects of SIS Il and VIS, as well as those in which we do participate such as Eurodac.</p><p>Ireland issued a request to the European Council under Article 4 of Protocol 19 to take part in certain provisions of the Schengen acquis consisting exclusively of those aspects of the regulation that concern the operational management only of the Schengen-related IT systems in which we are not participating, that is to say, VIS and the border aspects of SIS II.  Ireland simultaneously exercised its option under Article 4 of Protocol No. 21 to notify the Council and the Commission of our wish to accept the Eurodac aspects of the regulation.  No adverse consequences arose on foot of this process, whether in respect of the operation and understanding of Protocol No. 19 or Protocol No. 21.  The Attorney General's office has, therefore, advised that it is appropriate to use the same process to opt in to this regulation and thereby continue our participation in eu-LISA.</p><p>The European Commission proposals that preceded this regulation were laid before the Oireachtas in July 2017.  They worked to enable Ireland to opt in to the regulation.  The process has been ongoing since that time.  The variable geometry of Ireland's participation in the regulation is complex and prevented the exercise of our opt-in under Article 3 of Protocol No. 21.  Ireland's Permanent Representation to the European Union consulted the European Council's legal service.  The service suggested the bespoke legal solution used to opt in to the establishing regulation of eu-LISA in 2012 could be used again.  This was confirmed by the Office of the Attorney General in June 2018.  The Government approved the bringing of a motion before the Oireachtas in September to approve Ireland's exercise of the opt-in to the regulation.  The regulation was published in the Official Journal of the European Union on 20 November 2018 and laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas on 22 November.</p><p>I have more to say, but my time is up.</p></speech>

It further proposes that we participate in the elements of eu-LISA that relate to the operational management of Eurodac.  Fianna F&aacute;il accepts, in principle, these measures which provide for Ireland's engagement with several systems related to information sharing on non-EU nationals entering the European Union.  The visa information system allows Schengen states to exchange visa data.  The main purpose behind the founding of the entry-exit system is to register entry and exit data for non-EU nationals crossing the external borders of EU member states.  The SIS enables competent national authorities such as the police and border guards to enter and consult alerts.</p><p>The Eurodac regulation establishes an EU asylum fingerprint database.  </p> <p> The measures, in combination, allow for the improved, enhanced exchange of visa data with other EU member states; the registration of the entry and exit of non-EU nationals into and out of member states; and the sharing of alerts related to policing concerns.  All of the measures appear to be positive and worthwhile.  Fianna F&aacute;il accepts that there may be concerns, as expressed in the course of debate, about the sharing of information on migrant refugees and visa holders.  It appears that these measures, in combination, do not introduce new barriers to entry or stay for non-EU nationals.  They simply provide the tools for better oversight of existing regulations.  </p> <p> We recognise that migration is a complex and challenging issue.  Conflict, forced displacement, extreme poverty, smuggling of migrants and trafficking of human beings cannot be solved with a simple remedy, but we believe it is imperative that all countries take a fair and proportionate share of refugees.  We believe the Dublin system should be transformed and a legal pathway for migration should be possible.  We also agree with the blue card system for skilled migrants.  The integration and inclusion of refugees and migrants is essential if we are to successfully tackle the politics of fear that are evident in some countries in the European Union and beyond.  They are based on scapegoating others.  This is particularly evident in some of the discourse on migration and refugees.  The spate of separate attacks in Europe is also being used by those who peddle the politics of fear to scapegoat refugees and denigrate the European Union and the values that underpin it.</p></speech>

However, we will oppose both motions on the basis that we have serious concerns about the implications in the protection of citizens' data in the future, for both non-EU and EU citizens.  Although in principle, interoperability means connecting the information contained in several existing databases, this initiative will, in reality and practice, result in the creation of a new giant database that will contain the personal information of tens and perhaps hundreds of millions of people in the longer run, including information collected for very different purposes, both for migration control and crime prevention, both of which have, unfortunately, been somewhat conflated in this specific proposal, despite the fact that they are quite different.</p><p>Ireland was authorised to participate in certain non-border aspects of the Schengen acquis by Council Decision 2002/192/EC, principally police and judicial co-operation.  There are already sufficient safeguards in place, with Ireland already availing of the Schengen information system for security purposes, as well as being linked with Europol and having signed up to other databases such as SIS, VIS and Eurodac, as well as entry-exit databases.  I note the serious concern expressed by the European Data Protection Supervisor which has warned the Parliament and the Council that interoperability would &quot;change the way legal principles have been interpreted in this area so far and would as such mark a &lsquo;point of no return&rsquo;.&quot;  It has called for extreme caution and a wider political debate before adopting the proposal.</p><p>We discussed the general data protection regulation, GDPR, a lot last year.  It is a matter for the European Union and its institutions which can bring forward legislative proposals that can adopt an independent approach to the GDPR.  On the principles that underpin the GDPR, Article 5 states:</p><blockquote>Personal data shall be:(a) processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to the data subject (&lsquo;lawfulness, fairness and transparency&rsquo;);<br /><br />(b) collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes; further processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes shall, in accordance with Article 89(1), not be considered to be incompatible with the initial purposes (&lsquo;purpose limitation&rsquo;);<br /><br />(c) adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed (&lsquo;data minimisation&rsquo;);</blockquote><p>It is unclear to me how this proposal complies the principles the GDPR outlined.  It is unclear how the creation of a mega database which is explicitly stated to hold the biometric data of citizens and third country citizens complies with the requirement related to specified, explicit and legitimate purposes.  It has been called Orwellian by some MEPs and I would be inclined to agree that it is certainly a step in the wrong direction.  By 2017 the Schengen information system had been accessed more than 5.1 billion times by member states.  In opting in to these protocols we consent to other member states having access to our citizens' information, much of which is personal in nature.  The European Council's press release on the matter states:</p><blockquote>The regulations introduce the possibility of using facial images for identification purposes, in particular to ensure consistency in border control procedures.  It also allows for the inclusion of a DNA profile to facilitate the identification of missing persons in cases where fingerprint data, photographs or facial images are not available or not suitable for identification.</blockquote><p>We will grant all member states the right to access such data and once a person is on one of the databases, he or she cannot get off it, despite the fact that he or she may have committed no criminal offence.  There may have been a question about an asylum application or such, yet the person will go through this process and it will follow him or her for the rest of his or her life.  He or she will be stuck in this database.  Recently the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection found itself in a little trouble with the Data Protection Commissioner on this issue.  I know that there is an investigation into whether the public services card system is legal, but I warn the Minister to take note of that episode in the context of how this jurisdiction manages data and how we will deal with it at a European level.</p><p>The system seeks to merge the areas of migration and crime prevention for reasons which I believe are ultimately political.  They are conflated to a point that is wrong.  The European Data Protection Supervisor states:</p><blockquote>[Repeatedly] referring to migration, internal security and the fight against terrorism almost interchangeably brings the risk of blurring the boundaries between migration management and the fight against crime and terrorism.  It may even contribute to creating assimilation between terrorists, criminals and foreigners.</blockquote><p>I do not think we should have anything to do with it.</p></speech>

I have a number of questions for the Minister of State.  I do not know if I will get answers to them today, but perhaps I will get them at another time.  </p>  <p>  In April 2018 the European Commission's data protection working party, an independent European advisory body comprising employees of the Directorate-General for Justice and Consumers, published an opinion on interoperability between EU IT systems for border controls, international protection, migration, police and judicial co-operation.  It highlighted the lack of analysis of data protection issues in the impact assessment given.  It also found that no information had been given on which data protection regime would apply to which operation and that no evaluation of security measures needed for the EU-wide databases had been carried out.  There had also been no analysis of less intrusive means to reach the goals set in the proposals.  That is a damning report.  Will the Minister of State provide details of any analysis carried out of interoperability in the meantime, specifically of data protection issues, the security measures needed, or less intrusive ways to achieve the same goals?</p>  <p>  The European Commission's data protection working party also highlights that interoperability between IT systems as proposed by the European Union raises fundamental questions about the purpose of, necessity for and proportionality of the data processing involved, as well as concerns about the principles of purpose limitation, data minimisation, data retention and the clear identification of a data controller.  </p>  <p>  The European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, FRA, has on a number of occasions expressed concern about the fundamental rights implications of interoperability with reference to eu-LISA.  The impact of large-scale IT systems on fundamental rights remains largely unexplored territory.  In 2017 the FRA issued a rebuke, warning that interoperability could lead to discriminatory profiling.  What safeguards are in place to prevent the information from being accessed illegally?</p><p>The FRA has identified the issue of function creep whereby data collected for one reason, for example, asylum and migration, can then be used for other purposes such as internal security by law enforcement agencies.  The FRA has found that the information technology systems established by the EU for asylum and migration management are increasingly being used for internal security reasons.  What safeguards are in place to ensure that the databases that are not abused by law enforcement agencies carrying out checks on people inside the EU who may be subject to the check due to their colour, effectively racial profiling? The FRA has documented many instances in which inaccurate biometric or alphanumeric data has been entered into databases in the areas of borders, visas and asylum.  This can result in a wrong Dublin Protocol transfer.  It can lead officials to suspect identity fraud and can bar entry into the EU.  It can even lead to a person being detained.  If this data is accessed unlawfully the person can be put in unnecessary danger.  Does the Minister of State have any concerns that the centralisation of this data will make it more difficult to spot inaccuracies and may actually put people in danger? </p> <p> Article 5 of the general data protection regulation, GDPR, requires that third country nationals are informed of the relevant aspects of their personal data being processed in a transparent and easily understandable manner, in reality the right to information is often not upheld.  The European Data Protection Supervisor, EDPS, has also raised concerns over interoperability, calling it a political rather than a technical choice.  According to it, the decision of the EU legislator to make large-scale IT systems interoperable would not only permanently and profoundly change their structure and way of operating but would also change the way legal principles have been interpreted in this area so far and would as such be a point of no return. </p> <p> The EDPS called for further debate on the issue in order to figure out how to protect fundamental rights.  These IT systems deal with migration, the fight against terrorism and serious crime.  As the EDPS points out referring to these terms almost interchangeably risks conflating all the issues and ultimately could lead to a perceived link between terrorists, criminals and migrants.  Considering the recent swing to the right across most of Europe and worrying incidents such as the protests against the Roma in Italy, is the Minister of State not concerned that supporting the securing of Europe is pushing us further down a dangerous road towards racism and exclusion which goes against the fundamental principles of the EU?</p></speech>

We will continue the discussion tomorrow morning.  We are discussing it now because of the tardy notice given to the committee to debate this issue which has been on the cards for months, attempting to bounce us into a discussion tomorrow morning with less than a week's notice and no information on the proposition.  That is why we are here tonight and we will continue this in the morning.</p>  <p>  The two motions before us today opt us into aspects of an EU regulation that strengthens the mandate of the eu-LISA agency, the agency that manages large-scale security and justice information systems in Europe.  The European Commission tells us it is doing this in a bid to close the gaps that threaten the security of Europe and its citizens, all of the usual rubbish that we have become accustomed to listening to.  A side effect of the mandate is that the EU information systems for migration, security and border management will become more interoperable.  I think it was quite creepy that in announcing the Commission's proposals the Commissioner for Migration, Home Affairs and Citizenship said the stronger agency, "wilI help us connect all the dots towards an effective and genuine Security Union".  As far as I am concerned when lreland signed up to the European Economic Community in the 1970s it was not signing up to a security union and I do not think the citizens have been asked about that matter.  The fact that the Commission was arrogant enough to come out and state that so boldly is a significant overreach on its part.  It seems determined to criminalise each and every third country national who wants to come to the EU, whether for work, fleeing war, or simply on a holiday.  We are creating a continent living in fear that a horde of barbarians is on the horizon, ready to invade.  That is giving us a continent distracted from the real and pressing issues facing us. </p>  <p>  Last October, the justice committee was asked to approve two proposals from the European Commission that touched on the same area of interoperable border IT systems as this regulation does.  What was proposed then was a vast, centralised database of a massive range of highly sensitive, biometric and personal data belonging to 218 million non-EU citizens visiting or living within the European Union and the justification for it was as the EU Commission said, an evolving and ongoing threat to internal security.  The threat, it said, was migrants, not some migrants but all migrants.  Other Deputies have used the quote from the European Data Protection Supervisor warning of the dangers of the blurring of lines by mixing migration management with the fight against terrorism.  This is setting a racist agenda in Europe and we are surprised out when Viktor Orb&aacute;n says what he does and gets elected. </p>  <p>  The Commission expected us last October to swallow the view that the threat to internal security posed by migration is severe enough to justify the creation of essentially an EU-wide Stasi.  The committee did not agree and yellow-carded the proposal.  Plenty of other people shared our view, including the EDPS, the Article 29 group, European Parliamentary Research Service, Privacy International, Statewatch and many more.  All of them loudly questioned whether this threat from migrants exists and whether it was sufficient to justify what the Commission wanted and whether the Commission had any evidence at all to justify its position.  None of those organisations was listened to.  Our committee was not listened to either and the Commission's proposal is now going full steam ahead and the regulation we have before us will allow the Commission's giant intrusive database to take physical form.  Even if Ireland is not taking part in that, we have a duty to flag the dangers because Europe's current migration policy, if it could be called that, is leading to fear, it is boundaries, high walls bristling with surveillance around the continent, driven by the far right and the arms industry.  It is an incredibly dangerous path and the Commission does not seem to care enough to join the dots and see where this is leading us.  We are paying Libya to keep refugees in dungeons to be raped and beaten, and we imagine there will not be consequences?  Of course there will be consequences.  None of this is making Europe any safer, it is making it a far more dangerous place and we should be playing a neutral and independent role.</p></speech>

There are reasons it is taking place now to do with Brexit and the dangerous things that might happen there.  We are strongly of the view on this side of the House that Ireland should participate in the adoption and application of this regulation.  With respect to Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire's point on the creation of a large database, this is not created by this particular regulation but by a separate interoperability regulation.  We are not talking about that particular point.  Sometimes colleagues conflate this regulation with the proposals currently under negotiation on an EU level on interoperability of IT systems.  This is not the subject of this regulation which relates to Ireland's participation in the eu-LISA regulation.  eu-LISA will prepare the technical points of interoperability but Ireland is participating only insofar as it relates to the operation and management of the IT systems that we participate in.  For Ireland these are SIS-II and Eurodac in which these Houses approved our participation.  eu-LISA is essential to our ability to complete our connection to SIS-II in 2020.  If Ireland opts to participate in any interoperability regulation then both Houses will have a say in that opt-in.  That is not the subject of this regulation.  Let us be clear about what we are at here.</p>  <p>  Ireland's participation in eu-LISA has been important for our connection to the update of Ireland's national Eurodac systems as required by our participation in the Eurodac regulation.  In progressing Ireland's connection to the SIS-II system, eu-LISA has been an important partner to ensure the efficient delivery of this project which will provide An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with access to this vital tool in the investigation of cross-border crime. </p><p>As Ireland participates in some of the systems which eu-LISA manages, it is important that we have a voice and a vote at the EU management board where decisions on the operational management of those systems are taken.  Ireland's participation is confined to those systems in which we already participate and does not oblige us in any way to participate in systems such as the VIS, ETIAS or EES.  However, participation in eu-LISA will enable us to exercise our option to opt in to future large-scale systems, should the Oireachtas approve of our doing so.<br/><br/>The central customs information system, CIS<b>, </b>is supervised by the European Data Protection Supervisor, EDPS.  Supervision of each national system is allocated to data protection authorities in each respective member state.  The systems and revision co-ordination group was set up in 2013 to ensure co-ordinated supervision of SIS II between the EDPS and national supervisory authorities.  The CIS group meets twice a year.  EU states must ensure that the taking of fingerprints and all operations involving the processing, transmission, conservation or deletion of data are carried out lawfully.  The Commission must see to the proper application of regulation by the central unit.  It also informs the European Parliament and EU Council of measures it takes to ensure the security of data.  As I indicated, EU states' data processing activities are monitored by the national supervisory bodies, while those of the Commission are monitored by the European Data Protection Supervisor.<br/><br/>The Data Protection Commissioner is the national supervisory authority for Ireland.  Section 12(2) of the Data Protection Act 2018 provides, among other matters, that: &quot;The Commission shall monitor the lawfulness of processing of personal data in accordance with (a) Regulation (EU) No 603/2013 ... on the establishment of &lsquo;Eurodac&rsquo; for the comparison of fingerprints for the effective application of Regulation (EU) No 604/2013 establishing the criteria and mechanisms for determining the Member State responsible for examining an application for international protection lodged in one of the Member States by a third-country national or a stateless person and on requests for comparison with Eurodac data by Member States&rsquo; law enforcement authorities.&quot;  There are serious safeguards there and it is important that this would be the case.<br/><br/>I commend the motion to the House.  I gather it will be debated tomorrow in committee as well and I hope the information which I put before the House earlier will be of assistance to colleagues in that important debate.  I apologise for speaking so quickly but I wanted to provide as much information as I could in the time available.</p></speech>

T&aacute; s&eacute; in am stad a chur leis sin.</p>  <p>  Once again I appeal to the T&aacute;naiste, the Government and the Government's partners in Fianna F&aacute;il to show common sense and pull back from the headlong rush into an EU army.  On this issue, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade does not need to be the best boy in the class.  He can stand with the Irish people, show backbone and take a firm stance against the EU warmongers and those imperialist countries which are harking back to the past in order that they will have the support of the EU in their future resource wars outside the boundaries of Europe.  The signing of permanent structured co-operation, PESCO, is another example of the major changes this Government has taken to undermine Irish neutrality.  PESCO was described as the sleeping beauty of the Lisbon treaty by the President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, and it lays the basis for a full security and defence union.  It also lays the basis for an EU army, which the Minister has repeatedly denied is the intention of the EU.</p>  <p>  One of the issues raised the last time this Bill was debated was that it would interfere with our ability to participate in peacekeeping missions.  Nothing is further from the truth.  This legislation will allow us to take part only in peacekeeping missions which have a United Nations mandate that allow a neutral country to participate, unlike what has happened of late, where this Government and its predecessor have tried to find ways to circumvent our neutrality, the Constitution and legislation.  I need only refer to the EU training mission in Mali, which is circumventing the triple lock mechanism a previous Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government persuaded the Irish people to support.  It is undermining our neutrality.  I recognise that we have a very longstanding and honourable reputation as peacekeepers around the world.  Irish soldiers have been in areas where they have not only managed to gain the respect of the warring factions, but also of the communities around them.  The Minister is now jeopardising that respect by engaging in a headlong rush into the EU military project.</p>  <p>  I ask Members to consider if it is good enough for Ireland to agree with PESCO.  Is it good enough for the Irish people to agree to the diversion of &euro;13 billion of EU social funds to be spent on military research and the production of military equipment for use in foreign wars?  A plethora of high profile EU leaders have blatantly called for the establishment of the EU army.  They do not mince their words.  There is no pretence or hiding behind greater security and defence co-operation.  They have clearly set out their agenda.  Any time I have raised this matter in the House, the answer I get is that the Government does not support an EU army.  In fact, it does support and EU army because every single action Governments have taken on EU security and defence issues since 1997 have undermined our neutrality to the extent that neutrality does not seem to be an issue for some EU leaders who flout it and ignore even the meek protestations the Minister may make in back rooms.</p><p>They know Deputy Coveney will roll over and be a good boy, as he did in 2017 when he signed up to the PESCO project against all expectation.  I hope the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade will for once listen to what is being said on this side of the House on this issue and that he will stand with the Irish people, who want to see neutrality enshrined in our Constitution.  That is the effect of the Bill, nothing more, nothing less.  Put it to the people; what has the Government got to be afraid of?  This time, the T&aacute;naiste should vote with us.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-04-09a.483" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1309" speakername="Se&aacute;n Crowe" time="21:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019040900048#VV00200"><p>This Bill is similar to the one I introduced during the Thirty-first D&aacute;il in that it seeks to amend the Constitution to ensure that Ireland will not and could not aid foreign powers in any way in preparation for a war, save with the assent of the D&aacute;il.  The Bill also affirms that Ireland is a neutral State, and that the State would have a policy of non-membership of military alliances.  That Bill was supported by members of the Independent Alliance, but when we voted on a similar neutrality Bill in 2016 they decided to vote against the Bill and in favour of a weak Government amendment.  Tonight they have the chance to return to the previous position of support for neutrality and to back this Bill, rather than a continuation of the <i>status quo</i>and the undermining of Irish neutrality.  I will not hold my breath in that respect.</p><p>The continued use of Shannon Airport by foreign militaries to facilitate their ongoing wars, coupled with the increased militarisation of the EU and this State's deeper integration in the EU's military system, especially through PESCO, ensure that this Bill is timely.  Sinn F&eacute;in believes that if Ireland followed a policy of positive neutrality, our State could make a highly significant contribution towards the long-held global objective of international peace with justice.  The aim of the Bill is to give power and choice to the Irish people to decide by referendum if they want to enshrine neutrality in Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann.  Who in this House could be afraid of that?  I appeal to all parties and Teachta&iacute; D&aacute;la to allow the Bill to pass Second Stage and to let us begin an honest and open debate about Ireland's policy of neutrality.</p><p>It is important to enshrine such a fundamental principle in Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann because successive Governments have breached the Hague Convention and undermined Irish neutrality.  The Government claims that there are already constitutional protections for neutrality, but the reality is that neutrality is not mentioned once in Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann.  This has allowed successive Governments to wear down neutrality piece by piece, against the wishes of the vast majority of Irish people.  As neutrality is not specifically protected in the Constitution, previous Governments have signed Ireland up to NATO's Partnership for Peace and allowed and facilitated the civilian airport in Shannon to become a virtual forward base for the US military.  The current Government also continues to support Ireland's involvement in the emerging EU military structures through PESCO.  The next EU budget will for the first time have a fund for EU military spending, containing a massive &euro;13 billion.  A referendum to insert neutrality would bring greater clarity to the State's neutrality policy, which has become blurred, distorted and riddled with doublespeak as successive Governments say one thing but actually do the opposite.  Given that the momentum behind the creation of an EU army has been accelerated by Donald Trump's election and Brexit, this Bill is timely.  The EU is developing a military-industrial complex and is setting aside EU and national funds in order to do so.  Across Europe, children are going to bed hungry while taxpayers' hard-earned money is going to be spent on military funding.  Sinn F&eacute;in MEPs have consistently voted against these disastrous projects and attacks on Irish neutrality whereas other parties, including Fine Gael MEPs, have supported and cheered it on.</p><p>We do not need to look to Brussels to find the Government's undermining of neutrality, we just need to focus our attention on Shannon Airport.  An estimated 3 million US troops have passed through Shannon Airport since 2002.  Like many others in this House, we have consistently raised the issue of the failure and the need for the Garda authorities to investigate and search flights carrying military personnel through Shannon.  These foreign military airplanes are guarded by Irish Army personnel and the Garda, but they have never been given an order or even asked to do even a cursory search of these craft for weapons.  Groups like Shannonwatch have provided the Garda with all of this information but the evidence is ignored and, strangely, no investigation has taken place to our knowledge.  Shannon is a civilian airport and not built for military traffic.  Any accident or crash there could cause major civilian casualties. </p><p>Some Deputies will argue that neutrality is outdated.  We do not agree.  We live in a world where half of the population lives in poverty, with one person in every eight suffering from malnutrition, and where poverty kills approximately 19 people every minute of every day, yet trillions of euro are spent on military expenditure every year.  To ensure that we live in a safer and more equal world, greater military expenditure is not the solution, nor is supporting the creation of an EU army or assisting NATO.  We need to challenge the very structures that cause poverty, food insecurity, conflict and division.  If Ireland allowed a policy of positive neutrality, the State could make a significant and powerful contribution towards the long-held global objective of an international peace with justice.  Through a policy of positive neutrality, the State would not look to increase its military spending, take part in the arms trade or profit from war and people's misery.  Instead, it could focus on enhancing the economic, social, political and cultural rights of people worldwide.  If we redoubled our efforts to focus on working with countries on implementing global targets on issues such as land rights, climate change, citizen participation, economic equality and government accountability, surely our planet would become a better and safer place for us all.  Irish neutrality is not a policy of opting out of international affairs.  Rather, it is a genuine commitment to a different type of international politics that is focused on justice, development and human rights.</p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in supports the continued role of Irish troops in UN peacekeeping missions around the world and the brave work that they do.  Blue helmet peacekeeping missions and Irish Aid continue to be two of the most positive pillars of the State's foreign affairs over the decades.  Surely it is long past time that power was given to the Irish people to decide on Ireland's future and on whether neutrality should be at the core of that policy. </p></speech>

T&aacute; f&aacute;ilte rompu.  The ownership of the neutrality of Ireland rests with the Irish people and with them only.  The Bill provides that: &quot;War shall not be declared and the State shall not participate in any war or other armed conflict, nor aid foreign powers in any way in preparation for war or other armed conflict, or conduct of war or other armed conflict, save where it is immediately necessary in defence of the State and with the assent of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.&quot;  This provision should be welcomed, supported and enshrined in our Constitution.  The further provision should similarly be welcomed and supported that:</p><blockquote>Ireland affirms that it is a neutral state.  To this end the State shall, in particular, maintain a policy of non-membership of military alliances.</blockquote><p>This position, based on opinion polling, is the will of the Irish people.  Some 57% of persons who responded to polling in February 2016 supported the enshrining of neutrality in our Constitution.  I have every confidence that this percentage has grown in the period since.  Over the past years and under Fianna F&aacute;il Governments every bit as much as under those of Fine Gael, there has been a distinct dilution of our status as a neutral country.  This began with the use of Shannon Airport in the Iraq war in the early noughties and that unacceptable facilitation continues to this day, under the watch of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney.</p><p>It was also happened under the watch of the Labour Party, which could have ended it when in government under the previous mandate.</p> <p> This is an unforgivable situation.  The facilitation compromises Ireland's international standing.  We are accommodating interference in Afghanistan, Syria, Libya, Yemen and perhaps in other countries in the Middle East and beyond that we are not aware of.  We are in a year of European Parliament elections which are but a matter of weeks away.  Europe is at a crossroads.  Many of the so-called main players in the European project support moves towards the establishment of a European army.  I fundamentally reject this position, as does my party.  I commend the work of the four Sinn F&eacute;in MEPs, namely, Matt Carthy, representing Midlands-North-West, Lynn Boylan, representing the city of Dublin, Liadh N&iacute; Riada representing Ireland South, Martina Anderson, our representative of the six county community on this island.  They have stood solidly and squarely against these moves at every turn, within the opportunities open to them as Members of the European Parliament.</p> <p> There was a time that I believed we all held the view that Irish neutrality was precious.  Unfortunately, that is no longer the case.  The Minister will dilute it or give it away at his peril.  There is no reason a referendum should not be held to allow the people to have their say.  Enshrining neutrality in our Constitution is the right thing to do.</p></speech>

Is Bille an-t&aacute;bhachtach &eacute; seo agus ba ch&oacute;ir don Rialtas tac&uacute; leis.  This Bill seeks to amend Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann to ensure that this State will not participate in or assist other states in the preparation or conduct of war or other armed conflict.  At a time when there are clear moves towards the creation of a European army, this assertion of Irish neutrality is needed more than ever.  EU leaders, including Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel, have openly called for the creation of an EU army.  Last December the European Parliament voted to establish a European defence fund.  When established it will receive &euro;13 billion of public money, to be spent on research and development in to new weapon systems.  This will include direct funding for arms programmes.</p>  <p>  Seo airgead gur ch&oacute;ir a infheisti&uacute; i seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; poibl&iacute; ar n&oacute;s talmha&iacute;ocht, sl&aacute;inte, oideachas agus ag dul i ngleic leis an athr&uacute; aer&aacute;ide.  We must also be mindful that European arms manufacturers are already selling weapons to states, including Saudi Arabia, which are using these weapons against civilians in Yemen and elsewhere.  The policy of allowing US troops to use Shannon is a shameful example of the direction successive governments have moved in recent time.  I include in that the disgraceful refusal to recognise the state of Palestine.  This Government has no anti-colonial instinct or sense of Ireland's proper place in world affairs.  </p>  <p>  Is f&eacute;idir le achan Teachta D&aacute;la taca&iacute;ocht a thabhairt don Bhille seo.</p></speech>

These principles are at the very heart of our foreign policy, and of our broader engagement on the world stage.  However, this Bill would potentially serve to undermine this international role and could curtail Ireland&rsquo;s efforts to contribute to the achievement of international peace and security.  On that basis the Government is opposing the Bill.</p>  <p>  Our long-standing policy of military neutrality remains a crucial element of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy, as articulated in the statement of foreign policy, The Global Island, approved by the Government in January 2015.  This was further reinforced in the ten-year strategy on defence, set out in the White Paper on Defence, approved by the Government in July 2015 and committed to in the 2016 programme for Government.  I understand this Bill has been put forward due to concerns about foreign military aircraft, in particular those from the US, landing at our airports.  This is an issue I have addressed many times in the D&aacute;il, but I am happy to correct any misconceptions.</p>  <p>  Facilitation of landing requests for foreign military aircraft does not alter or breach Ireland's policy of military neutrality.  Such requests must meet a number of conditions, including that the aircraft are unarmed, carry no arms, ammunition or explosives, and do not engage in intelligence gathering, nor can the flights form part of military exercises or operations.  We impose these conditions to ensure compatibility between these arrangements and our neutrality.  Governments have made landing facilities at Shannon available to the US for over 50 years.  These arrangements do not amount to any form of military alliance with the US.</p>  <p>  It has also been suggested that this Bill would protect Ireland&rsquo;s policy of military neutrality from the increased militarisation of the EU.  I hear increasingly aggressive language making that assertion.  I completely reject that view of the EU.  The European Union is an organisation borne of a desire to end war and division, founded on the principles of peace, security and human rights.  Robert Schuman, in his famous declaration of 9 May 1950, stated that the aim of this European integration was the foundation of a European development indispensable to the preservation of peace.  These are principles that Ireland shares and holds dear, and Ireland is proud to be part of an organisation that upholds and acts on those beliefs, whether it be through the provision of development aid and humanitarian assistance, or the upholding of human rights and democracy.  Listening to some in this House one might think that the EU is some kind of war monger.</p></speech>

Ireland has directly benefitted from peace-building programmes such as the PEACE programme, which works to support peace and reconciliation and to promote economic and social progress in Northern Ireland and the Border region, but people simply choose to ignore that element of the EU.  While there are some who may discuss closer EU co-operation in response to increasing security challenges, how such co-operation is designed is entirely in our hands.  Our values, our principles and our neutrality are fully respected at the EU level.  Ireland's participation in European common defence is prohibited by Article 29.4.9o of the Constitution.  This protection is reinforced by the Irish protocol to the Lisbon treaty.  Any change in that position could take place only with the approval of the people in a referendum to amend the Constitution.</p>  <p>  The EU&rsquo;s Common Security and Defence Policy, CSDP, is a recognition of the obligation on those states which are privileged to be part of this successful peace project to look to how they can help promote peace, prosperity, democracy and the rule of law elsewhere.  There is a moral obligation on us to do so, and Ireland is proud to participate in those efforts.  Tools and mechanisms are needed to allow states to work together efficiently and effectively to achieve those aims.  PESCO is one such mechanism.</p><p>It is about member states making more binding commitments to each other to jointly develop military crisis-management capabilities for use in support of CSDP operations.  Crucially in PESCO individual member states decide to opt in or not to opt in depending on the project or proposal.</p> <p> Our participation in PESCO in no way diminishes or undermines our traditional policy of military neutrality.  Certainly for Ireland, PESCO has nothing to do with the creation of a European army.  Indeed, the Irish protocol to the Lisbon treaty unambiguously states that the Treaty of Lisbon does not provide for the creation of a European army.  Rather Ireland&rsquo;s participation in PESCO will contribute to the enhancement of capabilities for UN and EU-mandated missions.  Inaccurate presentations of these policies and issues do a disservice to this House and to the public.  Irish people are rightly proud of Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to peacekeeping, whether that is through the EU, the Partnership for Peace, PfP, or the UN.</p> <p> Ireland&rsquo;s support for the work of the UN on international peace and security issues has been demonstrated by our continuous participation in UN peacekeeping missions for the past 60 years.  Today, more than 600 Irish peacekeepers are serving in international crisis-management and peace-support operations across the globe and I, for one, am very proud of them.  That participation is rightly facilitated by Members of the D&aacute;il when needed, as part of the safeguards relating to participation by Defence Forces in conflict situations.  The Defence Acts provide for the triple lock principle which governs the deployment of Irish Defence Forces personnel overseas.  It mandates that: deployment for overseas peace support operations may only be made if that operation is mandated by the United Nations; deployment must also be approved by the Government; and if it is proposed to deploy more than 12 personnel, a D&aacute;il resolution must also be approved.</p> <p> It makes little sense to cast aside such protections and safeguards in favour of a Bill which, rather than enhance protections, could in certain circumstances undermine the work that Ireland is undertaking in the international sphere.  The Bill could jeopardise Ireland&rsquo;s ability to fulfil its obligations to support UN-mandated actions, in particular peace-enforcement missions under Chapter VII of the UN Charter.</p> <p> I am more than satisfied that Ireland&rsquo;s long-standing policy of military neutrality is sufficiently safeguarded through existing constitutional provisions, through the protocol to the Lisbon treaty, through the Defence Acts, and through long-term strategies adopted by consecutive governments.</p> <p> I have had the privilege of being Minister for Defence and I have the privilege of being the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.  I have visited our troops on peacekeeping missions in different parts of the world, including in the Middle East and Africa, on UN-mandated missions in conflict zones.  For me neutrality is not about inactivity or excluding oneself from difficult situations.  It is about being proactive but not being aligned to any broader military alliance.</p></speech>

As I said earlier, we do a disservice to paint the European Union as something it is not.  We also do a disservice to make the case, which is not based in reality that somehow Ireland is drifting towards being part of some broader European army which is not taking shape.  Instead I am confident we can continue to rely on the safeguards we have which provide the guarantees that Ireland will continue to make its own decisions to send well-qualified troops to parts of the world in order to keep people alive, to support peace, to disarm people when necessary, and most importantly to make a contribution towards peace and stability in parts of the world that need that kind of intervention.</p></speech>

It has as a key defining characteristic non-membership of military alliances.  This policy of military neutrality has gone hand-in-hand with strong support for international co-operation for peace and stability as manifested in Ireland's participation in UN-mandated peacekeeping operations.  However, we believe that a constitutional provision would be too rigid, too doctrinaire and unnecessary.  Therefore, Fianna F&aacute;il will oppose the Bill just as we opposed similar Bills in 2015 and in 2003.</p>  <p>  If we were to amend Article 28, as proposed in the Bill, in the event of an international emergency where the UN Security Council had unanimously approved an international intervention involving military forces, it could mean the D&aacute;il needing to be recalled to allow airplanes to refuel at Shannon Airport.  Is this necessary?  While those who propose this may feel it would not apply in this case, it is still possible that a court challenge on this basis might arise.</p>  <p>  On the amendment of Article 29, the definition of a military alliance is open to interpretation.  Is it NATO?  Could it be interpreted as an EU battle group on a peacekeeping mission with a UN mandate?  Is our participation in the UNDOF or UNIFIL a form of military alliance?  Furthermore, in the event of Ireland being attacked, would such an article not render it unconstitutional for us to form a military alliance to repel the attack.  A constitutional declaration of neutrality is no guarantee that our neutrality will be respected.</p>  <p>  Various Defence Acts passed by the Oireachtas mean that Ireland only takes part in missions that are unambiguously authorised by the UN on the basis of a sovereign decision by Government and subject to the approval of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  Furthermore Article 29 of the Constitution confirms Ireland's dedication to the ideal of peace and friendly co-operation among nations, founded on international justice and morality.  Article 29 also upholds our observance of the principles of peaceful resolution of international disputes.</p>  <p>  Dr. Martin Mansergh, a former Member of this House and the Seanad, observed that our neutrality is a policy rather than a status.  Since the 1930s and 1940s we have never sought to have a type of neutrality which, for instance, Belgium had before 1914, for the very good reason that it proved not to be worth the paper on which it was written.  With this in mind Fianna F&aacute;il does not see the case for amending the Constitution in this area.</p>  <p>  The second referendum on the Nice treaty introduced a provision in the Constitution affirming that Ireland would not partake in common defence without further amendment to the Constitution.  This gave constitutional effect to the solemn commitment in the national declaration by Ireland at Seville that a referendum would be held in Ireland on the adoption of decision taken by the EU to move to a common defence.  The Seville declarations clarified that there was nothing in the Treaty of Nice or previous treaties that posed a threat to Ireland's traditional policy of military neutrality.  In order for Ireland to join a common defence, the people would first have to vote to delete or amend this constitutional prohibition.</p>  <p>  Of course, while no decision to create a common defence can be taken in the European Council without Ireland&rsquo;s agreement, it has never been Ireland&rsquo;s position that we would attempt to block the desire of other member states to establish common defence arrangements among themselves in circumstances where Ireland was not ready to participate, as long as these arrangements would not prejudice Ireland&rsquo;s national interests.</p>  <p>  At the Seville summit in June 2002, Ireland secured the agreement of our EU partners to declarations that reflect Ireland&rsquo;s position on military neutrality and European Security and Defence Policy.  Two declarations were included in the Nice treaty to underline the Irish position.  The national declaration by Ireland states that: Ireland is not party to any mutual defence commitment; Ireland is not party to any plans to develop a European army; and Ireland will take a sovereign decision, on a case-by-case basis, on whether the Defence Forces should participate in humanitarian or crisis-management tasks undertaken by the EU, based on the triple lock of UN mandate, a Government decision and approval by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.</p><p>The declaration of the European Council at the time confirmed that Ireland's policy of military neutrality is in full conformity with the treaties, on which the European Union is based, including the Treaty of Nice and that no obligations arising from the treaty would or could oblige Ireland to depart from that policy.  These declarations are solemn political declarations of a formal kind which were deposited in the UN and we stand by them.<br/><br/>Ireland has always conferred fundamental importance to the UN since we joined 58 years ago and, working with other members, we have supported international action in areas such as disarmament, peacekeeping, development and human rights.  We are strong and committed supporters of collective security through the organisation.  This has been the stated policy of many Governments during the past 58 years.  Alongside this, we have endorsed and supported the primary role of the Security Council in the maintenance of international peace and security in accordance with the charter of the United Nations.  This emphasis on the UN is not one we should lightly discard.  <br/><br/>While we are conscious of the opposition to the triple lock from some military and political commentators, we believe there is overwhelming public support for the mechanism.  We acknowledge the UN is not perfect and can be slow to respond to developing crises but it is the still the guarantor of the freedoms of small nations and the best bulwark against unilateralism.  Its <i>imprimatur</i>provides a greater legitimacy for peacekeeping operations than any other international organisation.  <br/><br/>Furthermore, the legitimacy conferred by a UN mission bolsters the safety and security of our Defence Forces when they participate in peacekeeping missions.  No mission will be without risk but the absence of the blue hat will heighten the risk.  While neutrality was the given policy of successive Governments prior to the Second World War, it was that conflict that put it to the test.<br/><br/>Regarding constitutional provisions for neutrality, Ireland is not alone in providing a constitutional provision for its neutrality.  A number of our EU partners do the same thing.  Sweden has a long-standing policy of neutrality but it is not a feature of its constitution.  Similarly, its neighbour and our EU partner, Finland, is not in a military alliance but does not feel any need to provide for a constitution prohibition.  In the EU, only Austria has such a provision.  After the war, Austria, similar to Germany, was divided into zones assigned to the four powers of the USA, the UK, the Soviet Union and France.  To secure the withdrawal of those forces, and especially the Soviets, Austria provided for a constitutional statute proclaiming its neutrality in return for the withdrawal of the Soviet troops.  The Swiss provide for it constitutionally.  Switzerland is not in the EU and it is not so long since it joined the UN.  <br/><br/>What would happen if we made a provision for neutrality in the Constitution?  It is likely that the impact is that it would be for the Supreme Court to decide on what our neutrality could mean.  Can the definition of a military alliance also be open to interpretation?  Is it NATO and only NATO?  Could it also be interpreted as an EU battle group on a peacekeeping mission with a UN mandate?<br/><br/>Is our participation in the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force in the Golan Heights or the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon a form of military alliance?  If the provisions of this Bill become law, that could well be for the Supreme Court to decide because I have no doubt that there would be a challenge to such missions.<br/><br/>A constitutional provision could be too rigid and too doctrinaire.  It could also have a detrimental impact on the ability of the Government to manage foreign policy issues.  Neutrality should not mean neutering.  Frankly, it could undermine the entire purpose of collective security and the United Nations to which Ireland is so committed. <br/><br/>I will share the reminder of time available with my colleague, Deputy Jack Chamber, who has now arrived.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-04-09a.500" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1255" speakername="Jack Chambers" time="21:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019040900051#YY00200"><p>I am pleased to be able to contribute this topic as my party's spokesperson on defence.  As my colleague, Deputy Collins, said, Fianna F&aacute;il is not supporting this Bill, as we are concerned it may impact on our ability to take part in vital peacekeeping missions around the world.  As a country that pursues military neutrality, Ireland has a long history and tradition of peacekeeping.  As mentioned, the UN disengagement observer force could be compromised, as could the interim force in Lebanon.  We would be handing over the jurisdiction, the oversight and the role of what we have in the current legislative provision potentially to the Supreme Court, which is a high bar in the context of our own participation, of which everyone collectively is proud.  That is not clarified in the Bill.</p>  <p>  We are renowned for our efforts in keeping and restoring peace in some of the world&rsquo;s most dangerous places.  Those of us in this House and beyond should all be very proud of that legacy and we should not compromise or undermine future missions.  We should not, as this Bill provides for, take actions that would jeopardise our commitment to helping the poorest and most vulnerable people in some of the most underdeveloped in the world.  The legislation could also result in difficulties and complications in the event of an international emergency where the UN has approved a humanitarian intervention and there could be a technical challenge to the Supreme Court, which could go beyond the current wording that has been provided for.  </p>  <p>  Perhaps most relevant of all, a constitutional declaration of neutrality is no guarantee our neutrality will be respected.  History, unfortunately, is littered with examples of small independent peaceful countries, which have had that status completely ignored.  Some Members and parties would have people believe that the country is sleepwalking its way towards becoming a fully-fledged military power, but anything but that is the case.  It is worth re-emphasising Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to being a militarily neutral State.  Why do we have ongoing scaremongering every time defence or foreign affairs policy is discussed?  </p>  <p>  Various Bills, many of which were introduced and passed by my party, underscore the fact Ireland can only take part in missions authorised by the UN and on the basis of a decision by the Government and backed by the D&aacute;il.  Our commitment to this triple lock is sacrosanct.  There are also the constitutional commitments to Ireland as being a peaceful and friendly nation which will co-operate with other nations.  The various referenda on European unity over the years have resulted in some incredible red herrings surfacing, often put forward by the party which has not supported any EU referendum and which has introduced this Bill.  The country was told that ratifying the Nice treaty meant Ireland was signing up to NATO.  Similarly, we heard that ratifying the Lisbon treaty would result in Irish people being conscripted into a European army, none of which has happened and will not happen because of the constitutional and legislative measures we have in place, as I have outlined.  </p>  <p>  Moreover, there is no provision in the EU treaties for the creation of an EU-wide army, although again some in this House continue to suggest that PESCO is in fact that.  We need to be clear that PESCO is about security and co-operation and those claiming otherwise, a bit like the Brexiteers in the UK who made wildly unsubstantiated claims, need to be called out for misleading people.  The only way that could happen would be by the consent of the people.  I do not know any Irish person who would want that.  It is important we recognise the democratic and constitutional provisions that we have in place, which can only be changed with the consent of the people.  PESCO is about defending Europe&rsquo;s shared borders and improving the capacity of the EU and Ireland to support international peace and security, and to assist in crisis management, particularly humanitarian crises.  If Europe is worth building, then it is worth defending.  In addition, involvement in PESCO will also ensure that our Defence Forces will have access to the best equipment and training.  Sending our men and women on overseas peacekeeping missions without the best preparation would not be appropriate and it would be reckless.  PESCO is not about building a European army but about deepening European integration.  That is not something from which Ireland should recoil in the context of Brexit and what is happening in other countries where eurosceptism is on the rise, and we will probably see that in the European elections.  This is more relevant now, particularly as Brexit continues to play itself out.</p>  <p>  Greater co-operation is also essential to properly tackle threats to national defence and security that did not exist a few years ago.  The area of cyberattacks comes to mind in this regard.  Such attacks have shut down apparatus in other countries, including the UK.  I fear it is more through luck than design that Ireland has not been affected by such an attack.  However, given our ever-growing status as a world leader in information technology and communications, it stands to reason that we remain vulnerable in this area.  In addition to bolstering our cybersecurity capabilities, something which I am consistently calling on the Minister for Defence to do, greater co-operation among nations in intelligence gathering and information sharing is the best way to defend against cyberattacks.  It goes beyond the historic argument of what neutrality is about in that we have to share information to defend ourselves.  That is an important context not to forget in the 21st century.</p>  <p>  However, this Bill would remove all that.  Rather than follow the approach being advocated, I would like greater consideration to be given to an active neutrality approach.  Such an approach would move us away from the past and reflect the reality that our sovereignty is secure, our democracy is functioning well and we are one of the most successful developed countries in the world. </p><p>Perhaps most important, it would also reflect the fact we are at a juncture in our development where we have an enhanced opportunity to focus on what we have to offer to other members of the international community.  In this sense, we have a responsibility to share the lessons of our experience of peace building on this island and of peacekeeping on the international stage in the Middle East and Africa with others who may benefit from them.</p> <p> In disagreeing with the proposal, I believe it is time for Ireland to further our approach in international affairs, building on our long and proud contribution in areas such as peacekeeping and development.  In an era when differences between the developed and developing worlds continue to challenge us, we have an opportunity to seek to build on our reputation as a bridge between nations, and we do ourselves and the world some service in this regard.  We need to continue on our present legislative and constitutional basis and oppose this proposal.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-04-09a.502" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1325" speakername="Jan O'Sullivan" time="22:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019040900052#ZZ00200"><p>The policy of the Labour Party is unambiguously to support Ireland&rsquo;s long-standing policy of military neutrality.  By debating this Bill, we have a useful opportunity to restate our perspectives on what Ireland&rsquo;s neutrality means today.  That is perhaps the real purpose of this Bill&rsquo;s introduction.</p>  <p>  I will return to the text of the Bill but I want to first elaborate on the core issue of our military neutrality.  Labour's perspective on Ireland's neutrality has a number of dimensions and I would like to focus on three of them: first, Labour's role in the long history of opposition to conscription and violent conflict in Ireland; second, the adequacy of our current defence policy on maintaining military neutrality; and third, the need to redefine neutrality as an active concept that can and should be promoted across Europe and abroad, including as a response to new forms of warfare, as well as a response to conventional warfare.</p>  <p>  On the first point, Ireland's people have a long history of rejecting armed conflict as a means to achieve political or economic ends.  Ireland adopted neutrality as a policy during the Second World War and that has been maintained as our national policy.  However, decades in advance of that, Labour's then leader, Tom Johnson, was a prominent pacifist.  Recently, we recalled that he was the primary author of the Democratic Programme of the First D&aacute;il but he also called western Europe's first successful general strike, when he mobilised Ireland's working people against conscription during the First World War.  Following the death of Connolly, Johnson became the leader of the labour movement and he and labour associates worked to achieve national independence.  Crucially, Johnson was a constitutionalist, guided by the rule of law.  When the anti-treaty faction of Sinn F&eacute;in refused to recognise the D&aacute;il and the Civil War began, he spoke out against the Army mutiny and in favour of civilian control.  This is all relevant to today&rsquo;s debate because we are talking about the deep roots of Irish people's antipathy to war and violence.</p>  <p>  Ireland's working people were mobilised by the labour movement against conscription in the First World War.  Labour sought to hold together the fledgling Irish State, and Johnson was the leader of the Opposition in the D&aacute;il for the crucial period of 1922 to 1927, including for all but three months of the Civil War.  After that conflict, it was Labour that helped ensure the reintegration of the Civil War enemies into the D&aacute;il, albeit as bitter rivals, and it was ultimately the constitutionalist, civil tradition that won out over violent factionalism in the establishment of this State and its traditions, including our tradition of military neutrality.</p>  <p>  On my second point, we have a range of defence policies and relationships in place that respect Ireland&rsquo;s military neutrality.  The triple lock arrangement means the Army will only be deployed when there is a UN mandate, a Government decision and a D&aacute;il vote.  Ireland's military neutrality is respected by our EU partners.  The Lisbon Treaty has its protocol on the concerns of the Irish people.  Among other things, the protocol states that the Treaty of Lisbon does not provide for the creation of a European army or for conscription to any military formation.  It will be for member states, including Ireland, acting in a spirit of solidarity and without prejudice to its traditional policy of military neutrality, to determine the nature of aid or assistance to be provided to a member state which is the object of a terrorist attack or the victim of armed aggression on its territory.</p>  <p>  Defence spending in Ireland is the lowest in the EU at 0.3% of GDP in 2017, compared to an EU average of 1.3% and spending as high as 1.8% in France or 1.9% in the UK.  That is as it should be.  We should not be spending a lot of money on defence, although I would like us to spend more when it comes to the pay and conditions of our Defence Forces personnel, many of whom are on shockingly low wages, as Labour has stated many times in this House.</p>  <p>  If these policies are currently working to maintain our military neutrality, the question that arises for Sinn F&eacute;in is what, if anything, requires us to amend the Constitution at this time.  From Labour&rsquo;s perspective, we do not want the Army involved in warfare.  However, Ireland has a proud record of UN peacekeeping where we make a unique contribution.  The Army is recognised as having world-class expertise in countering improvised explosive devices.  As part of UN peacekeeping work, Ireland has been involved in the destruction of mines, the removal of dangerous chemicals and the destruction of ammunition for small arms in the Balkans and Ukraine.  Participation in UN-mandated peacekeeping operations does not challenge our military neutrality.</p>  <p>  The third substantive point is that neutrality is not a concept that is fixed in time.  There are different traditions of military neutrality around the world and within Europe.  Switzerland has a long history of neutrality but it is a form of neutrality underpinned by mandatory military service for its citizens and a convincing military capacity to repel invasion.  That is not the type of neutrality we want for Ireland.  We want to promote peace and to share our antipathy to the use of violence to achieve political ends.  I do not see anything in this Bill that would ensure that Shannon Airport is not used to transport weapons of war, and while I share Sinn F&eacute;in's concern that this would not be the case, I cannot find that referred to anywhere in this Bill.  We do not want a large military but we do want to be able to defend ourselves adequately, including against terrorism and new forms of warfare such as cyberattacks.  That requires us to have some engagement with military alliances to access the technology and shared intelligence we need to protect our citizens.</p>  <p>  The proposed legislation seeks to make fundamental changes to our current tradition of military neutrality.  The proposed changes to Article 28.3.1&deg; could make it impossible for Ireland to continue to participate in UN peacekeeping missions, as it rules out any participation in armed conflict except to defend the State.  The proposed changes would tie the hands of any Government and D&aacute;il if they wanted to offer some assistance of a military nature to another European country that was invaded or suffered a major terrorist attack.  If something happened, the proposed text would not only rule out direct involvement in any mission but it would prevent Ireland from taking any action at all, even sharing anti-terrorist intelligence with our European partners.  At an extreme, the modified article could also rule out a range of normal civilian co-operation if that co-operation also had a benefit or alternative use for military operations.  While I sympathise with the intent behind the Bill, it would appear to promote an isolationist and uncooperative form of neutrality that would not respect our current traditions.</p>  <p>  On the proposed additional text for Article 29.3, I agree with adding the text: "Ireland affirms that it is a neutral state".  Perhaps it should state "militarily neutral and committed to non-aggression" to spell out exactly what we mean by neutrality in our own context.  However, the additional text is more problematic, depending on how it might be interpreted.  If the Constitution stated that the State shall "maintain a policy of non-membership of military alliances", would that rule out co-operation on UN-mandated peacekeeping missions if there was NATO involvement or membership of PfP?  Could that text even rule out membership of the EU itself?  After all, the Union has mutual defence as part of its treaties, even though Ireland has an opt-out in the protocol to the Lisbon treaty.  I raise these questions because the Constitution as it stands probably does not need to be amended to maintain our neutrality.  This text again would appear to have unintended consequences that would disrupt our existing tradition of military neutrality without any obvious benefit.  While Labour, of Ireland's political parties, has unquestionably the longest and clearest commitment to non-violence and military neutrality, there is no necessity, therefore, for a Bill like this to ensure we maintain our military neutrality.</p><p>It is utterly dishonest and frankly surreal for the Government, Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il to declare their commitment to neutrality and then move quickly to stating why they are going to oppose this Bill and defend our current relationship with the evolving European military machine.  They do not mention our ongoing complicity with the US war machine.  It is a little disappointing to hear a slightly diluted version of the same surreal narrative from the Labour Party, which states that this Bill is not necessary.  What about Shannon Airport?  That is the reality that blows a hole in the nonsense we just heard from the Government and Fianna F&aacute;il about their commitment to neutrality.  Some 2 million US troops have passed through Shannon Airport since the onset of the US-led slaughter in Afghanistan and Iraq.  We have facilitated that machine in conducting that slaughter with utterly disastrous consequences and in defiance of any meaningful definition of neutrality.<br/><br/>Members can play around with all the legalistic nonsense they want and try to dissect the Bill in a legalistic way in order to deflect attention from that reality, but they are not going to get away with it.  The people of this country do not believe it for one solitary second.  They know the reality.  They expressed their feelings on that reality when the Irish political establishment facilitated war in Iraq in 2003 by coming out on the streets in unprecedented numbers.  That was probably the biggest demonstration that had happened in the State since its foundation.  The only demonstrations that even came close to the one that happened on 15 February 2003 were the recent protests against water charge.  The numbers were so great that we still do not know how big the demonstrations were.  One of the organisers, Mr. Roger Cole, is sitting in the Gallery.  He, Mr. Brendan Butler, Mr. Gearoid Kilgallen and I met others several months in advance of a war we knew was going to happen in order to plan those protests for 15 February 2003 in the hope that this demonstration, as part of the global mobilisation that happened on that day, might force the US, Britain and their allies not to proceed with the military assault on Iraq.  The world spoke in the biggest demonstration in human history.  There has not been a bigger demonstration on a single day before or since.  People begged political leaders in this country and across the world not to support or in any way facilitate that military onslaught. <br/><br/>I remember writing an opinion piece for <i>The Irish Times </i>a few weeks before the war started.  I quoted some NGOs' estimates of what the casualties of that war would be and wrote that up to 50,000 people might die in Iraq if that war went ahead.  As it turned out, more than 1 million people were killed.  I ask Members to think about that.  This was the absolute destruction of Iraqi society.  Some 4 million people were displaced in the worst displacement in human history until the war in Syria.  The latter conflict is a direct consequence of the war in 2003.  There would be no Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, ISIS, if it was not for that war.  We facilitated it, we justified it, we defended it and we allowed it to happen.<br/><br/>The NATO military assault on Afghanistan which preceded the 2003 war continues.  That occupation is a humanitarian disaster for Afghanistan.  That war was justified on the basis that NATO had to respond to the horrific atrocity of 11 September 2001, but the majority of people who carried out that horrific assault were from Saudi Arabia.  Last year, Saudi Arabia overtook Russia as the world's third biggest spender on arms after the United States and China.  Where does Saudi Arabia get all its weapons?  It gets them from Britain, France and our friends in PESCO.  Some &euro;1.8 trillion was spent on weapons last year.  I invite Members to look at the list of spenders - the United States, China, Saudi Arabia, Russia, India, France, the UK, Japan and Germany.  Are these countries with a great history of peacemaking?  Come on.  These are imperial and sub-imperial powers with a bloody history of using their military power to crush colonial peoples and grab their resources, and to fight savage wars against each other in order to control markets and resources on a global level.  That is what we are involved in when we facilitate the US military at Shannon Airport.  That is what we are involved in with the Partnership for Peace, whose Orwellian name belies its nature as a structured alignment with the NATO military alliance.  It is headed up by precisely those powers who account for two thirds of all global military expenditure, who led the war in Iraq and who led the disastrous assault on Libya that destroyed yet another state.  NATO has a first-strike nuclear policy.  That means that it will fire nuclear weapons at other countries even if they do not shoot first.  That is the policy of NATO.  We are now aligned with it through the PfP and the PESCO arrangements, every hand's turn of which is about establishing interoperability between the evolving European military structures and NATO with its bloody history.<br/><br/>Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and Labour state that we do not need something in our Constitution to vindicate the views of the majority of people in this country who opposed the use of Shannon Airport for the war to which I refer and who oppose our involvement in military alliances or to vindicate the history of this country, whose neutrality flows from the fact that the State was born in a fight against empire.  We need this in our Constitution in order to vindicate that history and the view of the majority of Irish people.</p></speech>

This is a bit mad.  The abuse of language in making arguments about this issue is a somewhat disheartening.  We know there is no concrete and clear commitment to neutrality in the Constitution.  This has been taken advantage of by too many for too long.  Our facilitation of the US military's use of Shannon Airport for the Iraq War in 2003 was criminal by any standards and made a complete mockery of any notion that Ireland is neutral.  The then Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, argued that facilitating the use of Shannon for the illegal invasion of Iraq was not of a sufficient degree of substance to constitute participation in the war.</p>  <p>  I wish to refer to customary international law, namely, the Hague Convention (V) Respecting the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers and Persons in Case of War on Land of 1907.</p><p>The convention states that a power which claims to be neutral is forbidden to allow belligerence or move troops or convoys of either munitions of war or supplies across the territory of a neutral power.  That has not proven to be the case, however.  The language used in the motion debated in this House in March 2003 was unreal.  The motion stated that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann "declares its commitment to the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Iraq".  Deputy Clare Daly and I visited Iraq last year and that is not the impression one would get of what happened because the place was destroyed.  One cannot invade and destroy a country and at the same time respect its sovereignty and independence.  That is not the way it works.  The same motion welcomed the arrangements put in place by the Government to ensure that Ireland would be able to contribute rapidly to the humanitarian effort in Iraq.  The motion further stated that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann "recalls the long-standing arrangements for the overflight and landing in Ireland of US military and civilian aircraft" but it did not indicate that any US troops who passed through Shannon Airport up until 1999 were either going on holiday or travelling to air bases in Germany; they were not going to war.  What happened in 2001, including the military incursion into Afghanistan, was a game-changer.  People who pretend otherwise are being economical with the truth.</p> <p> If one checks the record, in 2013, Deputy Enda Kenny questioned the use of Shannon Airport for US military purposes.  Before we were elected to the House in 2011, I heard some Labour Members question the use of Shannon Airport by the US for military purposes.  It is amazing the difference between what people say in opposition and what they say in government.</p> <p> The truth is that, sadly, we have been linked to terrible atrocities since 2001.  When the T&aacute;naiste was present, he was defensive about the EU's peaceful role.  The EU has not engaged in as much military aggression or warmongering as the US.  For some time, however, I have found the its actions to be pretty disappointing.  I disagree with the support of many of its member states for the war in Afghanistan.  I disagree with the EU's support for the war in Iraq.  I disagree with its involvement in the bombing and destruction of Libya.  I disagree with it providing arms to jihadists in Syria.  I disagree with its lack of constructive opposition to what Israel has been doing to Palestine for a long time.  I disagree with the EU's silence on what is happening in Yemen.  The most recent official figure we received indicated that 13 million people are at risk of poverty in Yemen.  The US has supported the Saudi-UAE coalition in bombing the living daylights out of Yemen for a long time.  That campaign started in March 2015.  There is only one crowd bombing in Yemen.  There is no opposition involved in bombing.  Only one crowd has ever dropped a bomb from the air and it is the Saudi-UAE coalition, armed and supported by the US, the UK and France.  How bad is that?  How bad does it have to get in Yemen before anyone screams "Stop"?</p> <p> A girls school was bombed on Sunday in Sana, Yemen.  Horrific pictures show the children trying to get out of the place, losing clothes and books as they went.  Does that make any impression on the European powers?  Are they going to disassociate themselves from the US warmongering?  The arms industry has become one of the biggest industries on the planet.  In fairness to Donald Trump and his honesty, when it was put to him some months ago that perhaps it was time to stop arming the Saudis because what is happening in Yemen is not very good, he stated that more than 20,000 jobs were created by the arms the Americans are selling to the Saudis and that if they stopped selling them, those jobs would be lost.  Mr. Trump also referred to all the money they get for the arms that they sell.  He asked if they should stop and let the Russians or the Chinese sell arms to the Saudis instead.  He stated that he did not think so.  I admire his honesty because that is the truth.  Mr. Obama met the Saudis in 2012 and organised a regime change in Yemen.  They threw out Saleh and brought in Hadi and then sanctioned the war which started in March 2015.  He did not speak with such honesty.  What Obama used to do is not very much different to what Trump does now.  The only difference was that he looked well, sounded intelligent and was articulate, but he was a lying so-and-so.</p></speech>

I also thank Sinn F&eacute;in for tabling this incredibly timely motion.  The discussion so far has been sad, particularly as this is such an important issue.  We hear so much now about fake news because it is the order of the day, but we have had a lot of fake discussion.  We have had people saying one thing when the reality is patently different.  That is quite shocking and it gives on a feeling of being in "The Twilight Zone".  There is a certain irony that the speaker from the Labour Party spent half her time talking about Labour's role up to the First World War.  There is a reason for that.  It is because the party's contribution thereafter, particularly when it has been in government, has been pretty shameful in terms of the defence of our neutrality.  We do not say that to score cheap points but that is the reality and people have to own up to their political sins or crimes, whatever one wants to call them.</p>  <p>  Deputy Wallace introduced a Bill on neutrality in the previous D&aacute;il and, in fairness, Sinn F&eacute;in introduced a similar Bill.  Now we have the Bill before us.  It is more relevant now than it was then because nearly every week we are being asked to support some new assault on our neutrality.  It is quite clear that the Government cares very little about that.  Its view is diametrically opposed to the views of most citizens.  It is precisely because we cannot leave these matters to the whim of politicians or the permanent Civil Service that we need to have our neutrality enshrined in the Constitution.</p>  <p>  At the core of why we are not neutral is, as others have stated, what happens at Shannon Airport.  I pay tribute to the two US Veterans for Peace who made such a determined and noble stance to highlight the complicity of Shannon Airport in the US war machine with their attempts to peacefully and respectfully examine US military aircraft at Shannon on St. Patrick's Day.  For the stance that they took, Tarak Kauff and Ken Mayers, both of whom Deputy Wallace and I had the privilege of meeting, ended up being denied bail in Ennis District Court and being imprisoned for two weeks.  Did two men, aged 82 and 77, proud, peaceful US veterans, really need to be denied bail for such a dignified protest?  It is shameful and is sending out a signal to let the US know that we will take on anybody who tries to jeopardise its use of Shannon Airport.</p><p>The irony is that the lads and their colleagues who came to Ireland for St. Patrick's Day told us, as veterans who passed through Shannon Airport, that they had guns in their pockets despite the fact that we have been told here repeatedly by successive Ministers that that does not happen.  Those men told us that that is what they did and what all of their colleagues did as they went through Shannon Airport.  We know from our own case, in terms of when we tried to examine US military aircraft, that people gave testimony.  One person had been accused of robbing some US weaponry from a ship and another from a plane and another catering worker gave evidence that he had seen weaponry on the aircraft.</p> <p> What we have is an Irish solution to an Irish problem.  The Government tells us that military aircraft come into Shannon Airport but they are not involved in any military exercises and are not carrying anything.  It says it knows that because the US told it they are not but that does not explain how these aircraft travel two and three times a day on an annual basis now to destinations where we know appalling atrocities are being carried out with the assistance of the US military.  Instead, it says the troops travel on civilian aircraft and that the civilian aircraft only carry soldiers whose weaponry is stored underneath in the hold and that they do not have access to them.  That is not true.  This weaponry is on board and we have direct evidence, as has the Government, that that is the case.  We perpetuate a lie and pretend there are no weapons on them because we do not ask, even though everybody knows that there are and where they are going, when appalling examples have been given to various Ministers, even in recent days, of aircraft on their way to Camp Lemonnier, in Djibouti, the location for facilitating the ongoing war in Yemen.  We are complicit in that situation and that is certainly not something people want.</p> <p> As other Deputies said, the Irish public is very much in favour of neutrality.  The Government is very much out of step with that from the battle groups, to PESCO, to Operation Sophia, and obviously to Shannon.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, said that the EU is all about peace and the rule of law.  Is that really the case when we see what happened in Libya over the weekend, which we discussed earlier in the statements on the pre-European Council meeting?  I was in Libya 30 years ago.  I flew into a modern airport on a Libyan Arab Airlines aircraft to meet students - I was a student leader at the time - who were the best educated people in Europe and the wealthiest per head of capita.  The last remaining airport in Libya, which has not had international travel for years, was bombed at the weekend, with 28 people losing their lives.  Thousands of people have been killed in Libya.  The country is a basket case because of regime change facilitated by powers in Europe supported by our Government.  We are complicit in that and it is not what Irish people want.</p> <p> The T&aacute;naiste said earlier that he was sorry that the Operation Sophia humanitarian exercise was not back on track.  He is misinformed.  He is not stupid so he obviously knows what he is saying is wrong.  We had the same Ministers telling us at various times that Operation Sophia was not a military exercise only to tell us at the end that it was a military exercise.  Today, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, tried to tell us it is a humanitarian exercise.  It is absolute and utter nonsense.  That is a continuation of talking out of both sides of our mouths in terms of our neutrality.</p> <p> We believe tonight's motion is incredibly important.  Neutrality is not doing nothing.  Neutrality is ploughing an independent furrow.  People talk about defending the country.  Fianna F&aacute;il is worried about what will happen if Ireland is invaded.  I am sorry, and as a proud daughter of an Army family, I believe it will not be our conventional Army that will defend us if we are invaded.  I do not believe it is the &euro;6 million the Minister is spending on anti-aircraft missiles that will defend us either if it comes to that.  If we wanted to defend a country and a world, do the mathematics on it.  There are more wars now, more refugees and more terrorism.  I wonder if there could be a connection between that.  Guess what?  There is because when people are murdered in their beds, their societies are wrecked and their children are killed, that does not make them very happy.  It makes them leave their homes in pursuit of a better life elsewhere.  The instability is coming from that and the best stance against that is to stand for international solidarity across nations and for an end to war.  We can be a proud beacon in that but to do that, the first step is enshrining this legislation in our Constitution.</p></speech>

Irish neutrality has been an important principle since the founding of the State but, unfortunately, in the past few decades it has been eroded by successive Governments.  The beginning of that can be traced back to 1997 when Fianna F&aacute;il signed this State up to NATO's so-called Partnership for Peace and the deployment of Irish troops on NATO-led missions.  Since then, various Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael, Labour Party and Green Party Governments were happy to turn Shannon Airport into a staging post for the US military in its illegal war of aggression across the Middle East.  Fine Gael Deputies have been very clear that they would be happy to abandon Ireland's position of military neutrality.  I believe that is shameful.</p>  <p>  The right of our State to determine our relationships with others and to decide our foreign relations policy is a cornerstone of independence.  Recently, we have seen EU figures like Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron openly calling for an EU army.  It is no surprise that it is the largest states that want to make this a reality.</p>  <p>  I ask anyone of those who believe an EU army or a military alliance is a great idea to look at the chaos in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Syria and other countries where EU states and the US have engaged in reckless, ill-thought out and illegal conflicts and tell me they trust those countries to have the best interests of Irish men and Irish women at their heart.  They should get real because a small nation like ours will not be calling the shots.</p>  <p>  We had a situation where our Defence Forces were heroically saving refugees from the Mediterranean - an unending task - while over their heads flew French, British and US war planes bombing countries like Libya and Syria and creating more refugees.  We are a small nation which suffered the horrors of invasion and repression.  The idea that we would align with those who continue to dole out such horrific treatment to others is unthinkable.  Not only would taking part in such conflicts be morally wrong but it would undermine us and our proud history as a nation which acts as a mediator, a peacekeeper and an honest broker.</p>  <p>  It is my belief that the Irish public, and it is important that we remember the Irish people, want our neutrality enshrined in our Constitution.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-04-09a.512" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1215" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="22:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019040900055#CCC00600"><p>It is hard to understand why any party in this House would oppose this Bill.  Since the Lisbon treaty, there has been a step change in the development of a European Union common defence policy.  It is worthwhile reminding ourselves what that step change involved.  Article 28 of that treaty committed member states, "to make civilian and military capabilities available to the Union for the implementation of the common security and defence policy".  The treaty went on to commit that member states shall undertake to progressively improve their military capabilities.</p><p> There is no doubt that the crash of 2008 and the eurozone crisis may have tempered the advance of this militaristic logic, but the direction of policy from the Lisbon treaty to the present is very clear.  The articles enshrined in EU treaty law override, in the words of one of the country's EU defence policy experts, rather than accommodate the neutrality of member states.  From Sinn F&eacute;in's point of view, that is the key reason this constitutional amendment is necessary.  It is needed to protect us from the slow but undoubtedly relentless logic driving the EU common defence policy.  It is the logic evident in the development of PESCO and the initial commitment of &euro;1.5 billion of military spending committed under PESCO up to 2020, including contributions from Ireland.  It is a logic that has led to the first fully EU funded military project to develop a military drone, at a cost of &euro;500 million, and it will take another major leap forward in the forthcoming EU budget, with an expansion of military expenditure to the tune of approximately &euro;13 billion.</p> <p> Anybody watching this debate who has a family member on a hospital trolley or who is paying high rent, desperate to get into social housing or paying high childcare costs would be aghast at the idea of any additional taxpayers' money being wasted on such expansionist military projects.  More important, all of this erodes Irish neutrality and draws us ever deeper into an EU defence policy that is inextricably linked with NATO, thanks to the Lisbon treaty.  It is no surprise that Fine Gael will not support this Bill.  As my colleague, Deputy Mitchell, made clear, Fine Gael MEPs have launched a document suggesting that we should move according to its title, Beyond Neutrality.  The voting record of Fine Gael MEPs in the European Parliament shows that they have supported every advance in the direction of an EU common defence policy as advocated by major powers.</p> <p> The choice before us is simple.  We either stand up for our neutrality and ensure that we continue to play a positive and progressive role on the international stage, free from either active or tacit involvement in any military alliance or adventure, or we continue the corrosive entanglement with an EU common defence policy that both Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael have actively promoted over the past 20 years.  My colleagues and I in Sinn F&eacute;in know where we stand tonight, but when the vote on this Bill is taken on Thursday next the public will know where every Deputy stands on this crucial national issue.</p></speech>

Angela Merkel has publicly supported the idea of creating an army for the European Union.  She said that the EU will have to create a European intervention unit with which Europe can act on the ground where necessary.  This echoed similar comments by Jean-Claude Juncker who said that the common European army would show the world that there would never again be a war in Europe.  This is an increasingly worrying development.</p><p>Over the past number of years, the EU army agenda has been advancing at a rapid pace.  Mr. Macron's letter to <i>The Irish Times</i>recently mentioned a better Europe when he focused on the EU army agenda.  This agenda includes increased military defence budgets as well as moving towards a European defence union.  It includes vast increases in funding for military purposes.  After 2020 the funds will go from &euro;500 million to &euro;13 billion, a 2,000% increase.  On top of this there is a 180% increase in funding for internal EU security and a 260% increase for migration and border security.  The new defence fund will also be used to develop new weapons.  Under this scheme, private arms companies will have up to 100% funding for development and 20% of prototyping costs will be covered.  The EU is basically funding an arms race to go along with its desire for an army to call its own.</p><p>Many of the PESCO projects are aimed at developing this common EU weapons system and military development for use by member states in future EU military missions.  The Government has justified Irish involvement in PESCO by stating that the initial PESCO projects are of limited scope.  This ignores the clear evidence from the EU that these projects are only the beginning and that the scope of PESCO will be increased in the future.  Speaking in the European Parliament, the Taoiseach stated that Ireland was pleased to join this military alliance and to participate in EU defence.  He went on to say that the Lisbon treaty demanded this from the State.  This ignores the constitutional opt out that the State has.  Fine Gael assures us that PESCO does not undermine neutrality, yet this is contradicted by the party's stated goal of redefining Irish neutrality.  Fine Gael and the Taoiseach have been clear in their belief that the State should be willing to participate fully in military alliances.</p><p>It is worth reminding the Government that the Irish people are not in favour of the State being part of an EU army.  In a survey commissioned by Red C Research &amp;amp; Marketing, 78% of people agreed that Ireland should have a clear policy on neutrality.  None of this appears to matter to Fine Gael, which does not want to respect Ireland's constitutional position on defence.  In an EU context national defence is, and must remain, a member state competence.</p></speech>

I thank the Members for their contributions to the debate.  This is a final opportunity to echo the comments of my colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, in categorically emphasising the Government's commitment to Ireland's long-standing and highly valued policy of military neutrality.</p>  <p>  That policy is underscored by robust constitutional and legal frameworks which are worth highlighting again.  Article 29 of the Constitution provides a framework for our policy of military neutrality.  It clearly commits the State to uphold the ideals of peace and friendly co-operation among nations and "the principle of the pacific settlement of international disputes".  The Treaty of Lisbon contains a legally binding protocol, negotiated by the Government, which recognises "Ireland's traditional policy of military neutrality" while our Defence Acts provide for the triple lock principle which governs the deployment of Irish Defence Forces overseas.  That lock mandates that deployment for overseas peace support operations may only be made if that operation is mandated by the UN; deployment must also be approved by the Government; and if it is proposed to deploy more than 12 personnel, a D&aacute;il resolution must also be approved.</p>  <p>  The changes proposed in the Bill undermine rather than strengthen these frameworks and call into question the Executive's authority to take necessary and urgent action when obliged to do so, and to take those difficult yet necessary decisions through the powers entrusted to it by the Constitution.  They jeopardise the Executive's authority with respect to external relations.  They undermine the efforts that successive Governments have made in the contribution towards global peace and security as they put in jeopardy the State's ability to fulfil its obligations to support UN-mandated actions.</p>  <p>  Much has been said regarding Ireland's participation in international crisis management and peace support operations.  The Defence Forces have participated in UN-mandated missions for more than 60 years.  They are highly experienced and highly regarded.  The Irish public is rightly proud of the role they play in the attainment of peace and security.  We have an obligation to continue to work towards the achievement of peace and security, whether its through our development assistance, our humanitarian assistance or our active participation in peacekeeping.  We have an obligation, too, to share the experience and expertise that we have built up over 60 years of service.  Next week, peacekeepers from Bhutan, Namibia and Togo will learn invaluable peacekeeping skills from our Defence Forces at its UN training school.  I cannot support a Bill that would curb vital and necessary work undertaken by our Defence Forces overseas.  I take this opportunity to commend and thank our Defence Forces for the work they do in putting Ireland's principles and values into action.</p>  <p>  To those concerned about Ireland's involvement in NATO's PfP, I reassure the House that the work we undertake though our participation in the PfP is vital to the development of the capabilities and safety of our Defence Forces.  There is no desire to become part of NATO, and this participation is not a precursor to membership.  It is an international platform for the upskilling of our Defence Forces and serves as a vehicle for the achievement of our foreign policy goals.  It has allowed us to highlight and push forward on issues such as the protection of civilians and the implementation of Security Council Resolution 1325 on women, peace and security; disarmament issues; post-conflict recovery, with support to countries such Serbia, Albania, Ukraine and Jordan; the provision of education to reduce the risk of injury to populations by explosive remnants of war; the provision of equipment to defuse improvised explosive devices; and the destruction of anti-personnel landmines.</p><p>As to concerns expressed about potential involvement in an EU common defence, let me once again assure the House the European Union treaty makes it clear that there will be no common defence without the unanimous agreement of the European Council.  Moreover, Ireland's participation in a common defence is prohibited by Article 29.4.9&deg; of the Constitution.  This is reinforced by the Irish protocol of the Lisbon treaty.  Any change in that position can only take place with the approval of the people in a referendum to amend the Constitution.  May I also address concerns about continuing public participation in the CSDP?  The CSDP is an integral part of the European Union's Common Foreign and Security Policy.  It provides the Union with an operational capacity to undertake missions outside the European Union for peacekeeping, conflict prevention and strengthening international security in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter.  We have participated in a number of the EU-CSDP missions.  These include peacekeeping operations in Chad, Congo and Bosnia and Herzegovina, training and capacity-building missions in Somalia and Mali, and Operation Sofia in the Mediterranean.  All these operations have been mandated under United Nations Security Council resolutions, and, where required, they have been approved by the Government and D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  Given that the existing frameworks and oversight mechanisms work, the role of the D&aacute;il in such operations is clear, strong functions well.</p> <p> I also want to reassure those who continue to be concerned about the Government's policy on the use of Shannon Airport by the United States.  The T&aacute;naiste has made it very clear that this is not incompatible with our traditional policy of military neutrality.  The conditions and criteria set out by the Department for the landings of all foreign military aircraft, irrespective of the state they are from, are very clear and are designed to ensure compatibility with our policy of military neutrality.  These conditions include that aircraft are unarmed and carry no arms or ammunition, that they do not engage in intelligence-gathering and that the flights in question do not form part of any military exercises or operations are strictly controlled and imposed.</p> <p> Finally, I take the opportunity to thank all the Members who contributed to tonight's debate but, as I said at the outset, unfortunately, neither I nor the Government will be able to support this Bill.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-04-09a.517" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1317" speakername="Martin Ferris" time="22:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019040900057#EEE00200"><p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an gCeann Comhairle.</p>  <p>  At the outset, I pay tribute to Margaretta D&rsquo;Arcy, who was imprisoned for her opposition to the use of Shannon Airport to transport combat troops from the USA to the battlefield, and from the battlefield back to the USA.  When Margaretta D'Arcy was in prison, to her credit, Sabine Higgins, the wife of President Higgins, visited her.  I also wish to remember Sally O'Neill from Dungannon who was killed in a car accident in Guatemala.  She highlighted the terrible injustice of the arms being used by a proxy junta in El Salvador and being supplied by the United States of America.</p>  <p>  Much has been said tonight about America's involvement, along with France, Britain and others, in the invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq and about Syria and Libya.  Some 2 million people are dead as a consequence of the actions of these countries.  The whole area has been destabilised and destroyed by these actions to effect the change they wanted for their imperial needs.</p>  <p>  In 2017, the country signed up to PESCO.  By joining PESCO the Government has committed to increasing military spending and linking a defence policy that will be aligned to NATO's strategic aims.  It commits to funding military projects and missions, irrespective of involvement, and opens our defence budget to critique by the EU for compliance with military spending targets.  In part, pressure has been put on the EU by NATO and the USA to increase military spending.  In a vote in the European Parliament in December 2017, Fine Gael MEPs supported an EU motion on the CDSP, which called for 2% of member states' GDP to be spent on defence.  That violates any concept of Ireland's neutrality.  The fact MEPs voted on behalf of Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and others who have supported that position means they have violated any concept of neutrality.</p>  <p>  I also pay tribute to the tremendous work done by the Irish peacekeeping forces, which have been a beacon of light throughout the world for people who are most in need.</p></speech>

Our approach to the EU has evolved as the EU itself has.  However, our opposition to the emergence of a united states of Europe and an army to defend its interests has never faltered.  PESCO is another step in the direction of an EU army that would see Ireland being pushed to raise military spending and to boost the profits of arms manufacturers.  The people have shown in repeated referendum campaigns that they too see the danger of an EU army and oppose any such moves.  In 2016 a poll found that the majority of people wanted neutrality enshrined in the Constitution.</p>  <p>  A majority believe Shannon Airport should not be used for foreign military flights.  Numerous polls have found that to be true.  The Nice and Lisbon treaties were rejected by many voters on that basis.  Sinn F&eacute;in has been warning of an EU army for a long time.  Recent geopolitical events have made this future even more likely.  Political leaders at the heart of the EU are now talking more brazenly and more than ever about this.  Macron, Merkel, Jean-Claude Juncker and many others recently made pronouncements on the virtues of an EU army.  Unfortunately, recent polls have shown that a majority of the French people back this position also.  Germany's justice minister, Katarina Barley, said recently that Germany was ready for the next step in arriving at an EU army.  A recent deal between France and Germany was described by both premiers is an important step towards an EU army.  Merkel said the pact aims to build a Franco-German common military culture and contributes to the creation of a European army.  Merkel even boasted that the army would complement NATO.</p>  <p>  Given the lack of any care shown to Ireland, Greece and Portugal in recent years, and the bully-boy tactics of the EU towards anyone who dares to oppose its neo-liberal and anti-democratic policies, they have a great deal to fear from this move and should do everything their power not to be part of, and to oppose, it.   We had 800 years of an imperialistic army and that did not work, so why do we want another European army?</p></speech>

Some who contributed to this debate insinuated that this Bill would in some way undermine the role Ireland has played and can play in future EU and UN peacekeeping missions.  This is a red-herring and is another reflection by the crawlers in Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael.  Are they so blinkered that they cannot see the writing on the wall or is it that they do not want to see it?  On what the T&aacute;naiste said earlier, I am seriously worried if he believes what he read into the record, especially where he said that we impose conditions on military airplanes landing in Shannon Airport and where said that the EU was indispensable to the preservation of peace.  I appeal to Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael to take the blinkers off and to see for themselves exactly what is happening.  </p>  <p>  Deputy Jan O'Sullivan asked what has happened and what changes dictate us having this debate at this stage.  Since the last time we had a vote here, when the Labour Party indicated it would support the Bill, the Government has signed up to PESCO.</p><p>Since then, the PESCO policy has been signed up to by Government.  The EU military headquarters has been agreed on and acted on.  The European defence fund has been set up.  The NATO and EU status of forces agreements have only recently been signed up to by this Government.  The European Defence Agency has added to its work and, lately, the Government has sought to send the Army Ranger Wing to Mali, a place where there are already 20 Irish soldiers without any backing from the D&aacute;il despite the supposed triple lock.  These changes demonstrate that we need to allow the Irish people to have a say on this.  What is the Government afraid of?  We should put the wording to the people.  I can guarantee that we will have a proper debate.  I can also guarantee that, based on the polls to date, the people will overwhelmingly support the wording we are suggesting.  Nothing in this legislation would prevent Ireland from defending itself in future, as some in the House have tried to insinuate tonight.</p> <p> The T&aacute;naiste said our neutrality was fully respected at EU level.  The EU laughs at Ireland every time this comes up.  They know that, like a good poodle, the Government will roll over for a tickle when the time comes and will capitulate as it has done since 1997, when Fianna F&aacute;il signed up to the Partnership for Peace.  It is the NATO Partnership for Peace, not that of the EU.  Mention of the triple lock was made and has been flaunted in the House.</p> <p> We should put this to a vote and allow the people to have their say.
