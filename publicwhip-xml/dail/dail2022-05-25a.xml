This year's report is entitled Profiting from Pain and it shows how billionaires have, quite literally, profited from the pain of ordinary people.  One thing the report highlights, which the Government does not like to talk about, is the fact that while energy bills are going through the roof for ordinary people, contributing to a massive cost-of-living crisis, the five largest energy companies have made $2,600 in profits every single second.  That means that in the time it takes us to have this debate, those energy companies will make a profit of over &euro;2 million.  The Government refuses to tackle the profiteering of energy companies and refuses to introduce what both we and Oxfam have called for, which is a windfall tax on the super war profiteering of these energy companies.  We call for price controls to stop the energy rip-off and the Government rushes to the defence of these poor, defenceless billionaires.  That is why we need a left Government that fights for socialist policies and defends workers, not billionaires.  The report reveals that the nine billionaires in Ireland increased their wealth by &euro;16 billion in the last two years.  That is absolutely obscene.  While ordinary people were struggling to get by, people like Larry Goodman and Denis O'Brien were making a killing.  The Irish oligarchs increased their wealth by 55% during Covid but there was not a single new tax on this vast wealth.  What more evidence does the Government want that this economic system is rigged?  It is rigged by the 1% for the 1%.  We agree with Oxfam.  We have been calling for a tax on the wealth of these billionaires for some time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-25a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1478" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="09:12:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022052500003#A00600"><p>The rich get richer and the poor get poorer.  That is a fact that is revealed yet again, as it is year after year, in the Oxfam report.  It is not just a left-wing slogan; it is a fact.  While the cost of living is crucifying and impoverishing tens of millions of people across the world, the world's billionaires and multimillionaires are getting richer by the day.  The two things are directly related.  It is not just a global picture but, as Oxfam reveals, it is also the Irish domestic picture.  There has been a 55% increase during the two years of the pandemic in the assets of Ireland's billionaires.  That is absolutely extraordinary.  It brings their wealth up to a total of &euro;51 billion.  Just nine individuals have had an increase in wealth of &euro;15.5 billion in one year.  Meanwhile, 691,000 people in Ireland are suffering from deprivation, and those figures are increasing as we speak.  The profits of energy companies, food companies, pharmaceutical companies and so on - which the report refers to specifically - are rocketing while ordinary people are impoverished.  Oxfam calls, as we have done, for modest tax increases on Ireland's billionaires and multimillionaires.  Oxfam states that a 1.5% tax on millionaires who have wealth in excess of &euro;4 million would generate &euro;4 billion a year in extra wealth.  Imagine what that would do for housing, poverty and deprivation.  This Government refuses to even think about it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-25a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1590" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:12:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022052500003#A00700"><p>I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to this discussion on Oxfam's recent global report on inequality levels.  The report draws attention to important issues around wealth and income inequality, cost-of-living pressures and how policy in advanced economies can respond to these global challenges.  In particular, the report highlights the negative effect the Covid-19 pandemic has had on equality across the world.  However, the range of supports the Government put in place in Ireland was extremely effective in stabilising people's incomes and protecting those most at risk.</p>  <p>  The Deputies spoke about the energy companies making profits.  In Ireland, the main company making a profit is the ESB, which reinvests its profits in Ireland's energy infrastructure.  Dividends or profits from that source do not go into any private individual's pocket.  The recent Central Statistics Office, CSO, survey on income and living conditions shows that without Covid-19 income supports, the at-risk-of-poverty rate would have been more than 8% higher than it was. Instead, this rate fell by about 1.5% during Covid, down to 11.6%.  We all accept that figure is far too high but it would have been 20% without the Covid measures introduced by this Government.</p>  <p>  The report also highlights the importance of progressive taxation measures in tackling income inequality.  Ireland is a very strong performer in this regard.  This discussion is about both global and domestic issues.  The Revenue Commissioners estimate that in 2022, the top 1.6% of income earners will pay 28% of total income tax and universal social charge, USC, receipts.</p> <p>Furthermore, over half of the total income tax and USC receipts will be paid by 8% of taxpayers in Ireland.  Indeed, the redistributive power of our tax system has been repeatedly acknowledged by the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, the OECD and the International Monetary Fund, IMF.  I note that the Oxfam blog post on the report highlights the increase in wealth in this country in recent years and raises the issue of a wealth tax.  Of course, there are already a number of wealth taxes in place in Ireland including capital acquisitions tax, capital gains tax and local property tax.  These generate &euro;2.8 billion per annum as it stands.  I know that some people in this House object to a property tax.  I would have thought parties on the left would generally support a local property tax but quite a few in this House oppose it.  It is very important as it contributes a significant portion of that &euro;2.8 billion.  With regard to designing a new tax, Central Bank data show that the main driver of increases in wealth in recent quarters was the positive re-evaluation of housing assets.  The value of people's houses has generally been increasing from where it was after the financial shock and this has increased the bank of wealth in Ireland.  Houses are a key element in the increase in wealth in Ireland.</p> <p> With regard to the cost-of-living pressures, we are all aware that inflation has peaked across all advanced economies.  This is linked to the rebound in global demand, persistent supply disruptions and pandemic-related effects.  The war in Ukraine is further exacerbating this situation.  The Government is acutely aware of this and of its impact, especially on low-income families.  That is where we have concentrated all of our resources and the &euro;2 billion in increases the Government has dealt with since budget day, up to the most recent changes and the various increases to help people with fuel poverty.  Without these, the situation in Ireland would have deteriorated far more dramatically.  However, the causes of the current price pressures are not within the control of the Irish Government.  The Government has to balance an appropriate response to the increased cost of living in Ireland with the unprecedented level of global economic uncertainty and macroeconomic risk.  I am satisfied that the Government has been taking reasonable step-by-step measures on this issue.  Nobody thinks the Government can eliminate inflation.  All the Government can do - and it is taxpayers' money we are using - is to ameliorate the worst effects of this inflation, especially on those who feel it most.</p></speech>

I am not sure whether he noticed the Oxfam wealth report, which shows that the billionaires have got 55% richer over the course of the last two years while 700,000 people are living in deprivation.  It is not much of a redistributive power if the wealth continues to funnel upwards while inequality continues to accelerate.  When you say that Ireland is the fifth richest country in the world when measured by GDP per capita, people think there is no way that could be when they see the housing crisis, the number of people homeless, the crises in health and education, all of the other crises all around us and the epidemic of low pay.  The reason Ireland can be the fifth richest country in the world while having all of these social problems is because the wealth is controlled by the super wealthy.  It is accumulated in their hands and the Government represents their interests.  That is the answer.  The solution is to go after that wealth through both taxation and nationalisation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-25a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1478" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="09:22:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022052500004#B00300"><p>The rich in this country pay more tax because they have vastly more wealth.  It is not because it is a particularly progressive system but because there is a massive inequality in the distribution of wealth and income.  The two things are related.  There is a completely bogus argument or spin from officials that this proves we have a progressive tax system.  It does not prove that at all.  What it proves is that the rich have vast accumulations of income and wealth.  At the very minimum, we should start to gather this information.  It is very telling that we do not have a register of wealth and assets that would allow us to work out how wealth, which has gone through the roof in recent years, is distributed.  The figures on deprivation, which we do keep, show that the levels of deprivation, poverty, energy poverty and so on are rising but the companies' profits, the wealth of billionaires and the overall net wealth in the country are all going up.  Somebody has the money and it is not the working people of this country.</p></speech>

To this end, we have increased the cash allocation of overseas development aid for the last eight consecutive years, with the contribution reaching over &euro;1 billion for the first time ever this year.  With regard to the global issues, we are making a contribution appropriate or relative to our size in the world economy.</p>  <p>  There is a research paper available on the ESRI website which shows that the vast majority of wealth is in the form of non-financial assets, with the largest components of household wealth in Ireland deriving from residences and farmland.  That is what the ESRI report has said.  The Deputies just asked about that.  It did not come from our officials here in Ireland.  I am sure everybody will give equal respect to the comments of the OECD, which said that Ireland has the most progressive system of taxes and transfers of any OECD member.  I want to put that on the record.  These comments are not from Government or Department of Finance figures.  I understand the issues the Deputies have raised.  People on a gross income of approximately &euro;15,000 pay tax at an effective rate of less than 1% whereas people on &euro;100,000 pay at a rate of 38.1%.  The effective tax rate for those earning &euro;120,000 is well over 40%.  That is progressive taxation.  The higher your income, the higher the percentage of it you pay in tax.  It is very important to say that.  We have made strong efforts in respect of those areas.  I accept that we can do more.  I also accept that the Covid situation transformed world economies, that there was a transfer of wealth as a result of the pandemic and that the OECD says that Ireland has the most progressive and redistributive taxation system of any member of the OECD.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-25a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1549" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="09:22:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022052500004#B00500"><p>I welcome the opportunity to raise this matter.  There was a debate on it in the immediate aftermath of the great surge in prices.  I expected that there was going to be a set of proposals from the Government to help people to respond quickly to the challenges they faced.  I will point towards a number of things that could be done immediately.  I would like to see the Minister of State, Deputy Joe O'Brien, take these up with his colleagues.</p>  <p>  The first relates to the 1.5 million homes that will not be reached by the retrofitting programme in the next ten years.  We should ensure that all of those houses, or as many of them as possible, get heat controls installed if they have inadequate attic insulation and if the cavity walls can be done.  The 80% grant is welcome but we need a serious wave to confront this issue.  We should extend the 80% grant to heat controls.  The reality is that we could save up to 25% of the energy use in these homes.  For these poorly insulated and poorly heated homes, this would represent 2 tonnes of carbon per home per year.  That is an exceptional opportunity for us and we are not grabbing it with the determination I believe is warranted.</p>  <p>  The second thing I will mention is that we have rolled out, at public expense, 750,000 smart meters and intend to have another 1 million installed by the end of this year.  They are not being used to cut the cost of electricity for those who have them.  That is simply not happening.  There is an offer to homes but it is not being taken up.  We need to move again with a sustained campaign to get that opportunity taken up.  I reckon that could result in very significant savings.  Even if only 10% of energy consumed, which is 4,500 kWh, was switched from fossil fuel-generated energy to renewable energy, the impact on our carbon footprint would be very significant.  We would be switching from a kWh that costs 500 g of carbon to one that costs 0 g.</p>  <p>  The third thing relates to electric vehicles, EVs.  From the latest figures, we see that 20% of people are now buying electric cars.  This figure has doubled in the last 12 months.  That trend is going to continue but there is an obstacle standing in the way, which is the roll-out of public chargers.  Despite three years of access to a &euro;5,000 grant, the councils have not installed one EV charger in a public place.  </p> <p>They should be targeting areas, like those in all of our constituencies, where people do not have their own driveways.  They should install chargers in the lamp poles and parking kerbs to allow those people to buy EVs.  Even if that led to only a 2% increase in the number of cars sold, each one of those is 3 tonnes less carbon.  This is low-hanging fruit.  It is a real opportunity we could seize.  Such chargers do not have the complication of a deep retrofit and they are available to very wide groups of people.  They would be visible and tangible evidence this is something that needs to be done now and not put off until a one-stop shop comes to town.  These are things that can start the momentum and give communities a chance to build from the bottom up.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-25a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1563" speakername="Joe O'Brien" time="09:32:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022052500005#C00200"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising this important topic.  I will begin by outlining recent price developments and the Government response and then I will discuss smart metering, EV policy and the Government's Reduce Your Use campaign.</p>  <p>  The most immediate factor affecting electricity prices in Ireland is the continuing upward trend in international gas prices, where we are a price taker.  Gas prices have been rising steadily since March 2020 and were further exacerbated following the invasion of Ukraine by Russia.  This feeds directly through to retail electricity as the wholesale price of electricity correlates strongly with the price of gas.  The Government is very aware of the impact on households of increasing electricity costs.  In addition to measures taken in budget 2022, the Government has announced a &euro;505 million suite of measures to mitigate cost-of-living increases, including a credit payment to all domestic electricity accounts, additional fuel allowance payments amounting to &euro;225, a new targeted &euro;20 million scheme for the installation of photovoltaic panels for households that have a high reliance on electricity for medical reasons and a reduction in VAT from 13.5% to 9% on gas and electricity bills from May to October.  In addition, response 6 of the national energy security framework charges the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, with implementing a package of measures to enhance protections for financially vulnerable customers and customers in debt by quarter 3, ahead of the next heating season.  Furthermore, in this fuel allowance year recipients received a total of &euro;1,139 compared to &euro;735 in 2020-21 and &euro;756 in 2019-20.  This includes the &euro;5 weekly increase announced in budget 2022 and an additional &euro;225 announced in 2022.</p>  <p>  I turn to smart meters.  Citizen participation in the clean energy transition is essential to meeting our ambitious climate targets.  The infrastructure needed to empower citizens to become active energy consumers is smart metering.  Action 22 under the national energy security framework, led by the CRU and ESB Networks, aims to leverage the roll-out of the smart metering programme by providing electricity customers with access to their data, thus enabling greater citizen participation.  The CRU will also examine charges within its remit to ensure the differential between peak and off-peak tariffs provides the opportunity for electricity customers to save money by moving some consumption to off-peak hours.</p>  <p>  On heat controls and reducing consumption, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, operates a number of energy-efficiency upgrade schemes on behalf of the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.  Support for heating controls is available under the better energy homes scheme.  All homeowners whose homes were built and occupied before 2011 can apply for the &euro;700 grant to upgrade their heating controls.  The Government has also launched a new nationwide public information campaign, Reduce Your Use, to promote and encourage energy-efficiency and highlight the range of government supports that are available to households and businesses to help to lessen the impact of rising costs.</p>  <p>  The Government is deeply committed to its climate action plan goal of having nearly 1 million EVs on the road by 2030.  The Government's draft EV charging infrastructure strategy 2022-25, which is currently out for public consultation, promotes the roll-out of publicly accessible charging points for EVs.  It focuses on meeting the needs of EV owners who are unable to charge their vehicles at home, as well as offering top-up charging at destinations and on major routes.  Work is currently being progressed to expand the EV home charger grant to include shared parking in apartment blocks and similar developments.  The Department of Transport is working closely with the SEAI and expects a scheme for apartments to open in the near future.</p></speech>

With regard to EVs, he is saying work is under way to look at the needs of estates that do not have driveways and multiple units that do not have charging points beside their car parking areas.  This has been an obvious defect.  We have had a grant in place for three years for the councils to put them into lamp poles or onto the side of the road, but not one council has taken it up.  There needs to be a sense of urgency that councils have a responsibility for climate action plans.  They are all producing plans but they are sitting on their hands when it comes to these practical measures.</p>  <p>  The heat controls are not accessible through the 80% grant, even though a manufacturer I know claims a 25% reduction in heat use can be achieved in any home - no matter what the household is using, it can achieve that reduction.  That is real, tangible change.  I reckon, just on the back of the envelope, that if we rolled out a significant programme to those homes and reached even a third of them we would save 5 million tons of CO2.  That is not far off 10% of our total carbon emissions.  That is something we could target.  We could do the same with the 1.75 million smart meters.  If they even took 0.3 megatonnes off their electricity - if they reduced it by 0.3 megatonnes - you would have another 3 million tonnes by activating just half of those smart meters.</p>  <p>  The same is true of pushing up the EV purchasing rate.  They now pay for themselves over their lifetime, so we are not asking people to incur a big penalty by going to EVs.  They are actually saving money for themselves.  I ask the Government to look at these easier measures that are more accessible to wide numbers of people.  To confront the climate crisis, we need everyone to have the sense that they are part of it and not waiting five or ten years for the big project to come to town.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-25a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1563" speakername="Joe O'Brien" time="09:32:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022052500005#C00400"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising this important matter and for introducing increased urgency into our challenge.  The Government accepts that consumers are currently facing volatility in energy prices due to a particular spike in international gas prices.  It has taken action to address this by using the tax and social welfare system.  This includes measures such as the fuel allowance increase, a credit payment to all domestic electricity accounts and a reduction in VAT on gas and electricity bills, as mentioned.</p>  <p>  Other measures include the wider package of energy-efficiency supports, including from the SEAI, that make it easier and more affordable for homeowners to undertake home energy upgrades for warmer, healthier and more comfortable homes with lower energy bills.  Changes to the warmer homes scheme involve a significant increase in the number of free energy upgrades for those most at risk of energy poverty.  For those not eligible for free upgrades, grants for cavity wall and attic insulation have more than tripled.  These are highly cost-effective upgrade measures that can be deployed rapidly and at scale this year.  It is expected that these works will pay back in between one to two years in most houses.  However, the best long-term approach for Ireland to reduce consumers' exposure to volatility on international wholesale energy markets is to invest in energy-efficiency, in renewable energy and in interconnection with the UK and the EU to deepen the internal energy market.  I understand planning permission was agreed yesterday for the interconnector between Ireland and France.</p>  <p>  I will finally outline the role of the CRU.  The CRU was assigned responsibility for the regulation of electricity and gas retail markets under the Electricity Regulation Act and subsequent legislation.  The CRU is responsible for the co-ordination of the smart meter programme.  The Deputy will note the CRU is accountable to a joint committee of the Oireachtas, not the Government or the Minister, for the performance of its functions.  He may also wish to note the CRU provides a dedicated email address for Oireachtas Members as well.</p>  <p>  On local authorities not taking up the grant on EV chargers, I thank the Deputy for highlighting that.  They are certainly not doing it in adequate numbers.  In my own area, the local authority is putting in EV chargers.  They may not be accessing the grants but they are putting them in.  They are not putting in enough of them but there is some action happening on the ground in my area at least.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-25a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1488" speakername="Pa Daly" time="09:32:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022052500005#C00700"><p>It may not be an ongoing strike anymore, but in any event it is hard to think of a more blatant example of unfair and unjustifiable work practices and workplace situations that exists in our hospitals.  Qualified scientists who worked through Covid, dealt with the cyberattack and accepted extra work are paid 8% less than colleagues who did the same work and who sit by side with them in the lab.  Some earn less than those they supervise and others' wages decrease if they qualify.  Whatever about pay, many hospitals, like University Hospital Kerry, have introduced compulsory on-site rosters on-call.  This in effect is mandatory overtime.  </p> <p>Staff must work obligatory overtime of 12 to 36 hours extra per week.  Many staff at the hospital in Crumlin work 24 hours of extra overtime.  In Kerry, the Monday to Friday staff must work the daytime as well as the night which means, in effect, a 20-hour shift, and from 8 p.m. they are on their own covering two departments and they get no proper break.  On Saturdays, Sundays and bank holidays in Kerry, there used to be a 24-hour shift but that changed last year to a 12-hour shift so staff are working on twice as many weekends.</p> <p> I spoke to one scientist who has worked for 30 years and never had a strike day.  In fact, I understand that the last industrial action was 50 years ago.  Medical scientists have waited decades for this pay inequality to be resolved because clearly their pay and working conditions are not fair or reasonable.  As a result, as the Minister of State may know, an increasing number of staff have become unwell due to burnout and are leaving.  When trainees are about to qualify, they see the work pressure that staff must undergo.  As a result, pharmaceutical companies are mopping up newly qualified staff.  Whatever about the history of what has gone on - the expert group's recommendation for restored pay and for pay levels to be the same as the biochemists was accepted by the Minister for Health and Children at the time, who is now the Taoiseach - and whatever about benchmarking and procedural errors, I know that exploratory talks have begun or are due to begin today but I believe the Government must intervene and the HSE must engage properly.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform must be involved.  The HSE must enter meaningful discussions, provide a timeline and not look over its shoulder at any other workplace situations.  The Government must resolve this inequality and the two-tier pay system that continues to exist.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-25a.26" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1484" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="09:42:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022052500006#D00200"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue, which I am taking on behalf of the Minister for Health.</p>  <p>  Firstly, I wish to acknowledge and pay tribute to the dedication, professionalism and commitment of all medical scientists throughout the country.  As the Deputy has quite rightly said, medical scientists play a valued and vital role within our health service.  They worked tirelessly during the pandemic.  Their efforts in testing Covid-19 samples were and remain very significant.  It was not just during Covid that they have worked tirelessly.  They work tirelessly at other times, as the Deputy has outlined.  The Government recognises the extraordinary contribution made by those working in our health services, which is evidenced by the decision taken earlier this year to provide a pandemic bonus payment.</p>  <p>  I am fully aware of the ongoing and long-standing claim for pay parity between medical scientists and clinical biochemists.  Health management has been engaging with the Medical Laboratory Scientists Association, MLSA, on these issues at the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, under the terms of the current public service agreement, Building Momentum.  As the MLSA is part of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the association is bound by the terms of the agreement for the remainder of its lifetime.</p>  <p>  Building Momentum includes the process of sectoral bargaining to deal with all outstanding claims across the public sector.  The bargaining fund equates to 1% of basic pensionable pay for each bargaining unit set up under the agreement.  The MLSA requested, and was facilitated, with its own bargaining unit in the sectoral bargaining process in order to progress its claim for parity.  As such, the MLSA has at its disposal a fund equivalent to 1% of basic pay of all medical scientists.  While this fund is insufficient to resolve its long-standing claims, it can partially resolve them and the remainder could be addressed in a future public service agreement as per the terms of Building Momentum.</p>  <p>  As I have previously stated, the MLSA and health management have been engaged in talks over the last number of months with the aim of finding a way to advance the claim through the sectoral bargaining process.  Several options were explored during these talks but to date but none have satisfactorily resolved the claim within the terms set out under Building Momentum.  As this matter could not be resolved, it has been referred to the Public Sector Agreement Group, PSAG, which is the dispute resolution mechanism that was set up under Building Momentum, twice since January.  At the latest meeting on 11 May, the PSAG recommended that the matter be immediately referred to the WRC and that industrial peace be maintained in the meantime.  Health management met the MLSA under the auspices of the WRC on 17 May but, unfortunately, no resolution was reached.</p>  <p>  The parties have accepted an invitation from the Labour Court today for an exploratory engagement in order that the court might establish whether, and how, it might assist the parties in finding a resolution to the matters in dispute.  I welcome the decision by the MLSA to lift its strike action to attend this Labour Court engagement.  The Government recognises that all of the State&rsquo;s industrial relations machinery should be utilised to resolve the matter.  As the Deputy has clearly said, all parties need to be at the table to find a mechanism that will prevent further strike action.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-25a.27" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1488" speakername="Pa Daly" time="09:42:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022052500006#D00300"><p>The Minister of State has said that health management has engaged with the association.  I am not sure it has engaged in a meaningful way because the offer of 1% is neither here nor there nor going to the creamery.  I have spoken to a scientist who feels that the training of new graduates is soul-destroying because she does her best to bring them up to speed, but when most graduates are exposed to the full workload, they choose not to work in the public system and are lost to private industry.  As the pharmaceutical industry is booming at the moment, it has the resources to offer better pay and conditions.  That is all the more reason for the medical scientist issue to be ironed out as soon as possible.  As part of the graduate work, those who choose to work as laboratory aids are not required to be qualified.  When they see that they will receive a pay cut, they are scared off to a large extent.  Even though one of the people to whom I spoke is close to retirement, she now works more hours than she has ever done.  That is a significant problem because there are staff shortages in the laboratory.  There is no immediate prospect of any of those vacancies being filled, which is no wonder because all of the graduates are choosing not to enter the public system.  That situation is in addition to what has happened over the last few years.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State has paid tribute to the work that medical scientists carried out during Covid and the cyberattack.  I accept that they have received a bonus payment.  Let us not go down that road again because there are people working side by side and some of them are not getting it either.  Something must be done about this issue.  One cannot be looking over one's shoulder.  The current situation is clearly inexcusable, unjustifiable and unequal.  Again, the representative body has decided to enter exploratory talks.  I hope meaningful negotiations can take place during those talks.</p></speech>

I welcome the fact that there is a meeting today and that all sides have decided to participate.</p>  <p>  I do not know whether the Deputy listened to RT&Eacute; Radio One yesterday morning when Tony Canavan, the CEO of the Saolta Hospital Group, was interviewed.  He gave a fantastic interview that clearly explained the work done by medical science laboratory practitioners in all of the hospitals.  I say to anybody who thinks that their role just concerns patients within hospitals that they play an integral part in our health services.  Not only do they do essential work for hospitals, but they also do essential work for GPs who need tests done on blood samples and so the impact of their work spreads right into the community.  Yesterday, the CEO talked about the Saolta group, which concerns the area where the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, myself and our constituents live.  He said that 400,000 procedures would have to be halted as a result of one day's strike.  Therefore, we cannot afford not to have negotiations.  The Deputy is right that we clearly need representatives of the HSE, the MLSA and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform at the negotiating table.  I welcome the intervention and I am glad they are meeting now.  However, meaningful negotiations must take place to prevent a repeat of what happened over the last two days.</p></speech>

I am very grateful because I know he has a hectic schedule as a constituency Deputy and as a Minister of State.  I do not have anything against him but I am not too happy that the line Minister is not here to answer my Topical Issue.  For three consecutive weeks I have tabled this Topical Issue and I only got an email as I sat in my seat here to inform me that the line Minister is not available.  I would have pulled my Topical Issue if I had known that earlier this morning.  Notwithstanding that, I appreciate the Minister of State being here and I hope that we can cobble out a good outcome to all of this.  </p> <p> Last June, the Cabinet announced that sites run by Shannon Heritage in the mid-west would be transferred to local authorities, including Clare County Council.  This announcement was warmly received and many in Clare felt immense hope that it would breathe new life into iconic tourism and heritage sites, such as Bunratty Castle, Knappogue Castle and Craggaunowen Bronze Age park.  Following the Cabinet's decision, Clare County Council was instructed by the Government to commence discussions with Shannon Group on progressing this transfer.  All parties, especially the Shannon Heritage workers who have hung onto their jobs by a thread throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, hoped that this process would wrap up in advance of the 2022 tourism season.  Frustratingly, it has not.</p> <p> The transfer of the sites is somewhat convoluted.  At national level it requires a transfer of responsibilities from the Department of Transport to the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  I believe the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform will also have a major function in this process, as will the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media.  Clare County Council management has met several Ministers and has undertaken due diligence, which has been very extensive.  This has encompassed the realms of operational, financial and business performance, technical due diligence to include property and asset surveys and also human resources.</p> <p> The due diligence process exposed a number of problems, with one of the key ones being the poor structural state of many of the iconic buildings in Bunratty and Craggaunowen.  The roof of Bunratty's 15th century castle is in a poor and dangerous state of repair, the thatched and cottage roofs are falling away and the once beautiful walled garden at Knappogue has been utterly neglected.  Clare County Council is seeking a national funding commitment of &euro;5 million per annum over three years.  This funding request relates to operational costs, initial set-up and conservation and maintenance works.  From the perspective of Clare County Council, the transfer of Shannon Heritage sites cannot be a financial burden on the county council's budgeting process and the provision of statutory provisions or impact negatively on Clare's ratepayers.  As a result and in order to move forward, a nationally-funded financial package is required.</p> <p> The current state of play, as I understand it, is that Clare County Council has met Department of Transport officials and is also engaging with the other associated Departments.  An interdepartmental working group has been set up to consider the funding request.  Representatives from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media along with the Office of Public Works, OPW, have been invited to participate in this group, but no clear timeframe has been set regarding when it will conclude its work and report back to the Government.</p> <p> I reiterate that everybody in the region wanted this to happen this summer.  Clare County Council and Shannon Group must agree on a schedule and a transfer date to remove all ambiguity, particularly for the 140 workers whose morale has been very low given that this situation has dragged out and become quite a saga.  I hope the Minister of State can give a glimmer of hope today that this will conclude, the funding will be provided and this can be a success.</p></speech>

A number of challenges had arisen, including the lack of expertise in maintaining the sites in the group, the capital investment required to maintain the heritage sites and the impact of the onset of Covid-19.Since the previous update given by the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, to the House on the transfer of Shannon Heritage sites, King John's Castle successfully transferred to Limerick City and County Council on 4 April.  Shannon Group and the council worked together with extensive preparation to ensure the successful transfer of the castle, and the Minister of State wishes to acknowledge this effort today.</p><p>The Shannon Heritage business of Bunratty Castle and Folk Park, Craggaunowen, Knappogue Castle and the Cliffs of Moher retail outlet remain to transfer to Clare County Council.  I will provide an update on the progress of this transfer.  Shannon Group is continuing to engage with Clare County Council on the transfer of the Shannon Heritage business and key sites.  Officials in the Department of Transport met Clare County Council on 5 May and were provided with an update on the preparations for the transfer, in particular on the due diligence process under way in the council.  The departmental officials met the council again last week to further discuss the work that remains to be done for the transfer to progress.  As part of the due diligence process, the council identified a number of issues, including issues with funding both in the short term and in the long term to ensure the sustainability of the business.</p><p>The Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, has advised that she believes the most appropriate way to consider these funding requirements and to bring this matter to a successful conclusion is through the establishment of an interdepartmental working group comprising key stakeholders.  The Department of Transport had previously engaged bilaterally with other Departments on the matter of the transfer.  By bringing the relevant Departments and other stakeholders together through this group, the Department aims to comprehensively address the issues remaining for the successful transfer of the business and sites.  Representatives from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the OPW and the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media have been invited to participate in this group.  The group held its first meeting on 19 May and will meet again shortly.  The agreement of the Ministers for Public Expenditure and Reform and Housing, Local Government and Heritage will be required to execute the transfer of the business and sites to the council.  The Department of Transport is engaging with both Departments in this regard.</p><p>The Minister of State has also advised that she is continuing to engage with the OPW and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage regarding the conservation of Bunratty Castle.  As the castle is a national monument, the OPW has responsibilities relating to its conservation and maintenance.  In preparation for undertaking this role, the OPW has been carrying out the necessary assessment of the castle to inform the programme of works needed and the associated costs.</p><p>While all parties are working towards a successful transfer of the business and sites, until the transfer takes place it remains the responsibility of Shannon Group to operate and manage the Shannon Heritage business.  This must be carried out in line with its commercial mandate, fiduciary best practice and with awareness of the group's accountability for the proper management of the company.  Shannon Group had made the decision to close Bunratty Castle in September 2021 for the winter season.  However, the extension of the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, enabled the site to remain open, although with reduced opening hours.  The castle is now fully reopened for the summer season, which is welcome.</p><p>As previously outlined to the House, Covid-19 had a huge impact on all tourism and heritage sites from its onset in early 2020.  However, there are grounds for optimism, including a welcome increase in visitor numbers, and we are hopeful that numbers will continue to increase significantly as 2022 progresses.  I assure the Deputy that this Government will continue to support Shannon Group to ensure that the transfer of the Shannon Heritage business and heritage sites will proceed as planned.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-25a.33" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1519" speakername="Cathal Crowe" time="09:52:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022052500007#E00300"><p>I appreciate the Minister of State's reply.  The problem for everyone in County Clare at present is that this is very much in a state of flux.  When the Government announced that these were going to be transferred to Clare County Council, it was like the announcement of a divorce or a relationship split.  Immediately, Shannon Group took its eye of interest off the Shannon Heritage sites.  They have been neglected.  I do not mind saying that here because that is the sad reality.  The roof of the iconic 15th century castle is in a poor state of repair.  The castle has withstood siege and fire, but it will have to close at some point to undergo essential repairs.</p>  <p>  The county council just needs a timeframe.  There are 140 employees and they are hanging onto this with bated breath.  They have had the uncertainty of the pandemic and now they have the uncertainty relating to the transfer.  Last week, I met the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, to find out where everything stood.  It has not yet reached his desk and, for me, that means the sign-off of the financial aspect of it has not yet gone before the Department.  What may be the problem here is that there are a number of Departments involved - the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, the Department of Transport, the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform - and I am sure each Minister does not want to take a &euro;15 million hit to his or her budget.  However, if we break it down, what Clare County Council is asking for is &euro;5 million per year over three years.  If we break it down further, perhaps, each of the four Departments could fund &euro;1.25 million each in this first year.  That would allow this to happen successfully.</p>  <p>  The entire region depends on this and I see the split from Shannon Group as positive.  It allows Clare County Council, which has a proven and successful track record of running tourism sites, such as the Cliffs of Moher, to take the helm, brings certainty for workers and brings tourism back to the region.  However, all this requires a pathway and a plan.  It is great to hear that interdepartmental meetings are taking place, but we need a timeframe and to know that the end game for which everybody is aiming is to fund this, make it happen and see it become a reality.</p></speech>

During the Covid-19 pandemic the Government showed its commitment to Shannon Heritage through the provision of supports, allowing the sites to remain open when restrictions permitted.  Even with these supports, the impact of Covid-19 has been enormously challenging for Shannon Heritage, but I am advised that since the easing of public health restrictions, the increase in the number of visitors to heritage sites has been considerable.  Almost 500,000 visitors visited Shannon Heritage sites in 2021, up from just over 300,000 in 2020.  Although the sites were closed due to public health restrictions in the early months of 2021, these visitor numbers show a strong performance once restrictions were lifted.</p> <p>This increase in visitor numbers will, hopefully, continue into 2022, particularly in light of the removal of all public health restrictions.  There are welcome developments also in international travel with the increase in transatlantic flights.  Given these positive signs we are hopeful that in 2022 the tourism and heritage sectors can begin to recover from the impacts of Covid-19.</p> <p> As I mentioned, an interdepartmental working group has now been established to consider the funding requirements identified by Clare County Council and this work is ongoing.

They are very welcome.  It was not too long ago that we were all clapping for them, but the Government has forgotten to clap for them in relation to pay and retention of staff.</p><p>It is 21 years since a report of the expert group on medical laboratory technician grades recommended pay parity between medical scientists and clinical biochemists.  The HSE and the Department of Health accepted that recommendation 21 years ago.  It is an established fact that MLSA members are paid on average 8% less than their colleagues doing the same work.  This is only the second time the association has taken industrial action in the 60 years of its existence.</p><p>Medical scientists are sometimes the workers we do not see but they play a vital part in our health service.  Never was this more evident than during the continued fight against Covid-19.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, will share my view in that regard.  They are the hidden heroes among front-line staff.  They process test samples to make sure medical procedures go ahead.  Despite this, one in five medical scientist positions remains vacant.  In November last year, 98% of MLSA members voted in favour of industrial action.  For medical scientists it feels as though the Government, the HSE, the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform have all absolved themselves from responsibility on this issue.  In addition, our motion calls on the Government to rebuild the testing capacity in the public health service system and end the outsourcing of testing to the private sector.</p><p>I put it to the Minister that no set of workers should be in this position of pay discrimination.  Yesterday, when most of us were on the picket line, there was a huge outpouring of public support for the workers.  The workers did not want to be there.  They wanted to be in their workplace.  They were forced, however, by this historical legacy of pay parity injustice.  I am aware that the dispute has gone to the Labour Court but the issue must be resolved, not only for the workers themselves, but also for staff retention in the general public health system.  We must keep professional staff in the health system.  If we do not, we will keep haemorrhaging staff and returning to this issue year after year.</p><p>That the situation has been allowed to get this far is pretty shambolic.  As I said, a number of months ago we were all clapping for front-line staff in the pandemic.  That reflected a genuine feeling for these workers who were going into their workplace each day, sometimes in fear that they might catch the virus or bring it back to their families.  These workers were at the front line of Covid-19 as regards testing and capacity.  It is shambolic that this was allowed to happen and workers are on strike.  I hope the dispute will be resolved very soon.  The workers do not want to go back out on strike.  They want to be in their workplace.  We have gone beyond platitudes.  This strike and dispute need to be resolved immediately so the workers can go back to the job and continue to play their vital role in the health service.</p></speech>

It is interesting that our motion and the Government's countermotion refer to the medical scientists as the "hidden heroes" of the health service.  No matter what happens, after the vote tonight, the D&aacute;il will officially recognise these workers as hidden heroes.  This is what they are, as was demonstrated, above all, during Covid-19.  Yesterday, workers in Tallaght hospital told me that during Covid some of them had to work for 14 and 15 days without a day off.  That causes incredible pressure and stress.  These workers suffer from pay inequality and burnout because a number of positions remain unfilled.  They also suffer as a result of a lack of clear and appropriate career progression for the vast majority.  While I am sure these workers will welcome being described as hidden heroes officially by the D&aacute;il, I am also sure that, like clapping for the health service generally, they would like this type of rhetorical commitment to be matched by an actual commitment to pay them for the work they do and treat them equally with their colleagues, the biochemists, who do very similar work.  This is what they and we want to see.</p>  <p>  Obviously, there have been many changes since we announced our plans to introduce the motion.  The MLSA and HSE are now in the Labour Court with the strike has been called off for the time being.  We hope the political pressure from the strike and from Opposition parties, including People Before Profit, has helped the workers.  We hope the motion has also helped them.  We intend to keep up the pressure to ensure these workers get the pay equality they deserve.  Too often, however, and this has been the experience of the medical scientists again and again, workers have been promised something only for those promises to be forgotten.  In this case, the workers were promised talks.  The workers are engaging in that very genuinely, but there is a need to keep up the pressure.  It is only action and pressure that have brought us this far.  It is crucial that we keep up the pressure until the point that pay parity is achieved, and we commit to doing so.</p>  <p>   In participating in debates during Leaders' Questions last week and listening to Leaders' Questions again yesterday, as I presume I will do again today, I have been frustrated by the fact that the Government speaks about this as if it was someone else's fault.  I presume we will also get this from the Minister today.  We will hear words of sympathy and he will speak of "hidden heroes" and so on but that somehow this is someone else's fault and it is not within the Government's gift to resolve this matter right now with a relatively small amount of money and to say these workers deserve pay equality.  When we look at the history of this, that is evidently clear.  Back in 1997, the then Labour Relations Commission recommended the establishment of an expert group for medical laboratory technicians and technologists as part of a set of proposals to settle their pay claims.  The expert group recognised the increasingly scientific and clinical role of the profession and the increased educational requirements for the role.  The continuous professional development required for medical scientists came across again when speaking to the workers.  The expert group recommended restructuring the profession of medical scientists based on an existing grade in laboratories, namely, that of clinical biochemist.  Clinical biochemists work in one section of the laboratory.  They provide a service interacting with clinical pathways and furthering scientific influence on patient care.  The vision for laboratory medicine was to extend that to all sections.</p>  <p>  In 2001, the then Minister for Health and Children, the Taoiseach, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, received the expert group report proposing pay parity for the medical scientists.  It was a promise made to these workers 21 years ago but 21 years on these workers are still paid 8% less, on average, than biochemists.  The medical scientists have fulfilled their end of the bargain.  They have done everything the report suggested.  The HSE and successive Ministers for Health have broken their promises.  There can be no more kicking the can down the road.  There can be no more washing their hands of the issue.  The then Minister for Health is now the Taoiseach.  The Government should simply pledge that it will provide the funding for pay parity so this wrong can be righted.</p> <p>Let us look at the impact of the years of austerity and the damaging public sector agreements on the medical scientist workforce, as well as the impact in terms of the public sector testing capacity.  Speaking yesterday, some of the workers said they thought there are currently 25 vacant positions in the Mater Hospital.  That is incredible.  Across the country, one in five positions is unfilled.  That means extra pressure on those in work.  Services have reached a level where staffing is no longer sustainable.  There is not the throughput to replace those positions, in terms of the number of people who are coming through the three college courses.  Then we have a situation of pay inequality.  Workers say to me that they want to work, they want to contribute to the public health service but if they want to get better pay, there are jobs they can move to in private industry.  These workers would like to contribute to the public health service, but they also have to pay the bills.  They have to try to move out of home.  They have to try to pay rent and groceries in the context of the cost-of-living crisis, yet medical scientists continue to be paid at least 8% less than promised when the recommendations of the expert group were agreed.  All medical scientists ask is to be paid the same as other scientists carrying out identical work side by side with them.</p> <p> An interesting point emerged yesterday when I was speaking to the workers.  It is very clear when on the picket line that it is an overwhelmingly feminised workforce, with about 80% women.  Is it an accident that the group of workers to whom they do identical work but are paid 8% less is a workforce that is 50:50 men and women or slightly more men?  It raises the question again of the undervaluing of the work of women, which is a consistent feature right across society in terms of care work generally being undervalued and underpaid and a predominantly feminised profession.</p> <p> Medical scientists were put in an impossible situation.  None of them wanted to withdraw their services but they were faced with a situation where again and again the can has been kicked down the road and they had no choice but to engage in action.  A sign of their resolve is that 98% of members voted for industrial action, their first since 1969.  They deferred it in order to accept an invitation to talks but again satisfactory progress was not achieved and industrial action began and got us to this point.</p> <p> The Government's counteraction says a lot about the Government.  The MLSA has been seeking a breakdown of the numbers of medical scientists' grades for 18 months, but it took this D&aacute;il motion from People Before Profit finally to get the figures from the Government.  The total number of medical scientists remains virtually unchanged since 2011 when the core working day was increased.  It goes from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., which is longer than most other grades.  Since then, the workload and complexity of work has increased exponentially but, again, the workforce has remained stagnant.</p> <p> In the amendment, the Government talks about the review by Dr. Colm Henry, but the MLSA was told in March 2021 that the report would be done within three or six months.  The working group was only formed in February 2022 with no representatives of the MLSA.  The Government cannot be allowed to use such reviews to kick the can down the road or to dodge political responsibility.  The workers are very determined.  They have very broad public support.  They have our unstinting support.  I encourage the Government to act to settle this dispute to grant pay equality.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-25a.40" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1478" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="10:12:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022052500009#G00200"><p>People Before Profit is extremely proud to present this motion in support of medical laboratory scientists.  I commend them for taking the action they did not want to take, but felt compelled to take, in order to force the Government to listen to them and engage with them.  The only reason we are here debating this is not because of People Before Profit or anybody else, it is because the medical laboratory scientists made the decision to strike after trying every other avenue available to them.  They engaged with the WRC, the HSE and others.  After waiting for 20 years and being reasonable, they were finally forced to take industrial action.  It took that for the media, the Government and politics to listen to them.  That is why we are here.  If anything positive comes out of the new round of engagement, it will be because of their action.</p>  <p>  People need to understand just how important the medical laboratory scientists are to the health of people in this country.  It is not just a clich&eacute; about being the hidden heroes.  It is absolutely critical, as medical science and technology advances - it is advancing all the time - and as the role of testing and the analysis of tests are ever-more important to the accurate diagnosis and treatment of illness.  We do not have enough medical laboratory scientists, given that 20% of posts are not filled, or worse in many laboratories.  When I was at St. Vincent's Hospital the other day I spoke to people in the various laboratories and in some of them the staffing rate was as low as 50%.  That results in an unsafe situation, because people have to work excessive hours to cover for those who are not there.  Their workload is increasing all the time, as is the importance of the work they are doing, but it is the same number of people doing it and the posts are not adequately filled.  That puts the health and safety of patients - the public - in danger through no fault at all of the medical laboratory scientists, but through the fault of the Government, the HSE and the Department of Health who think because they are hidden nobody really notices what is going on.  In a sense, the Government and the HSE have taken advantage of the fact that they are among the hidden heroes.  We had all the clapping during Covid but, in reality, these people, who are critical to the functioning and quality of the health service and therefore to the health of people who need that service, were taken for granted.</p>  <p>  The medical laboratory scientists have again gone into discussions, but when we look at the Government's amendment, which I strongly recommend the medical laboratory scientists do, frankly it is an insult to the medical laboratory scientists because there is lots of praise but then it states: "there was extensive engagement between health management and the MLSA on the use of the sectoral bargaining fund in the last number of months, however, there are insufficient funds to fully or partially resolve this matter to the satisfaction of the MLSA".  That is just not true that there are insufficient funds, but that is what it is about, namely, penny-pinching on the part of the Department of Health and most importantly on the part of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which has been asked repeatedly to engage in this process.  Quite honestly, the Taoiseach and Government representatives, in responding to the questions about this dispute, did not own up to their own responsibility in all of this.  Some of us were raising this issue before the strike and appealing to the Government to prevent the strike from having to go ahead by listening to, engaging with and responding to the legitimate demands dating back 20 years, where the pay parity sought had already been recommended and the Government just did not listen.  It did not engage.  The Government did not own up to its own responsibility in all of this, but somehow claims that the very small amount of money that is involved in reality is unavailable when it was just not willing to go there.  That is why we are here.</p>  <p>  It is the Government's fault that we are here: that the medical laboratory scientists had to go out on the picket lines and that the public health services were impacted in recent days as a result of the strike.  The medical laboratory scientists did everything to engage.  They deferred strike action earlier this year in order to engage again, but the Government did not listen and it did not respond because it is penny-pinching on giving these people what it was already accepted they deserved, namely, pay parity with the clinical biochemists.  The urgency from the point of view of the health service is based on being able to retain these people and prevent them going into the private sector where they can get decent pay.  It is the Government's fault.  It is still dragging its heels, even in the amendment claiming it does not have the money when it clearly has.  That is one thing we learned about Covid.</p> <p>We were told for years that we did not have the money for this or that but then billions were found, and rightly so, to respond the Covid pandemic, money that we were told previously did not exist.  The money does exist.  The economy continues to grow.  We had an Oxfam report this week showing that the nine billionaires in this country saw their wealth increase by &euro;15 billion during the two years of the pandemic.  Some people are doing extremely well but apparently we do not have the money to pay the medical biochemists who are so critical to the quality of our health service.  It is absolutely disgraceful.</p> <p> The Government needs to step up to the mark and stop saying that has to work in tandem with the partnership process.  The medical scientists in the MLSA are proof of the failure of the partnership system because they got left behind.  For 20 years, they were left behind because of this convoluted benchmarking system involving relativity and so on.  The Government must engage with the people themselves.  It must value and respect these workers for the work they do for all of us.  In a way, they are fighting for many other workers in the health service who are also undervalued.  We are understaffed across so many areas of the health service because we do not treat our health workers with the respect they deserve.</p></speech>

the HSE is leading a project to progress advanced practice in the National Health and Social Care Professions, which encompasses developing an overarching framework incorporating all the key factors, including an agreed definition and approach across the professions, core competencies, a planned approach to meeting educational requirements, governance and regulatory considerations which can inform policy development in this area; <br /><br />&mdash; a strategic decision was made, arising from recommendations of the Report by Dr Gabriel Scally in 2018 entitled 'Scoping Inquiry into the CervicalCheck Screening Programme', to develop a National Cervical Screening Laboratory (NCSL), which is due to open in the coming weeks, building capacity and resilience into the public element of the laboratory services required for the National Cervical Screening Programme in Ireland, and will enable the National Screening Service (NSS) to reduce its dependency on third party providers to meet the needs of the CervicalCheck programme;<br /><br />&mdash; the new NCSL is designed to become the principal provider of cervical screening laboratory services for the NSS over time, and it will also serve as a national base for training, education and research purposes, with &euro;20 million having been committed for construction, fitout and staffing of the NCSL, and a workforce plan is currently being developed to address the workforce resilience;<br /><br />&mdash;

and  </blockquote> </blockquote>calls on all sides to use the established dispute resolution mechanisms of the State, including the WRC and the Labour Court, and to suspend industrial action while this process is ongoing.&quot;  </blockquote>  <p>First, I join colleagues in acknowledging and paying tribute to the dedication, professionalism and commitment of all medical scientists around the country.  Medical scientists perform a valued and vital role in our health service.  Their testing of samples during the Covid-19 pandemic was, and still is, a critical and essential part of our response to the pandemic.  Their professionalism and dedication must be acknowledged.  The daily testing of samples is crucial to the running of our hospitals, community healthcare organisations, CHOs, and general practitioner, GP, services in every part of the country.  This was very evident on 18 May when medical scientists engaged in a day of industrial action and their presence in clinical settings across the country was suspended.  While derogations were granted to allow for the continuation of dialysis and some cancer services, thousands of other inpatient and day-case elective procedures and hospital outpatient appointments were cancelled with a direct impact on patients around the country.</p><p>I thank the Deputies for tabling this motion and raising this matter in the House but I urge the House to support the Government's amendment.  I am very aware of the ongoing and long-standing claim for pay parity between medical scientists and clinical biochemists.  On that basis, health management, in conjunction with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, has been engaging with the MLSA at the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, under the terms of the current public service agreement, Building Momentum.  The MLSA has been clear that medical scientists and clinical biochemists should have pay parity due to the fact that they both carry out similar work, roles and functions.  </p><p>Parity of pay with clinical biochemists was given to medical scientists via the expert group report in respect of medical scientists in 2000.  However, the first benchmarking process in 2002 broke the link between the two grades and, consequently, eliminated that parity.  As this is a long-standing claim, it is understandable that the MLSA seeks to raise it as an issue to be addressed under Building Momentum.  As colleagues will be aware, Building Momentum includes the process of sectoral bargaining to deal with all outstanding commitments, recommendations, awards and claims across the public sector.  It must be acknowledged that the MLSA voted against Building Momentum but as a member of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, it is bound by the terms of this agreement for the remainder of its lifetime.  As set out under section 2.1.2 of Building Momentum, the sectoral bargaining fund equates to 1% of basic pay for each bargaining unit set up under the agreement.  Therefore, under Building Momentum, sectoral bargaining is the mechanism through which the MLSA can advance its claim for pay parity.  The MLSA requested, and was facilitated with, its own bargaining unit in the sectoral bargaining process to progress this claim.</p><p>On the not unreasonable interpretation Deputy Boyd Barrett has taken of &quot;insufficient funds&quot;, I must be clear that the Government's amendment does not suggest that within the Exchequer there are insufficient funds.  Obviously, that would not be true.  The point the Government is making is that within the parameters of Building Momentum there is not the level of flexibility that would be required to fully address pay parity.  That is why these talks are needed and why they have been complex.  It is important to provide clarity to the House and, more important, to the people affected, the workers themselves.  The point we are making is that within Building Momentum, the 1% increase is insufficient.  That agreement does not carry sufficient flexibility for full pay parity of 8% and hence, we need these talks.</p><p>As previously mentioned, the MLSA and health management have been engaged in talks over the last number of months with the aim of finding a way to advance the claim through the sectoral bargaining process.  The HSE has provided the MLSA with the cost of its outstanding claim for pay parity with clinical biochemists and it is substantially more than the bargaining fund available, which is the point made in our amendment.  Several options for moving medical scientists to the biochemist scale were explored during these talks, including some that would partially resolve the claim within the agreement.  To date, no proposal has been identified which satisfactorily resolves the claim within the terms set out under Building Momentum.  Any options that were put on the table have been taken seriously and respectfully by both sides and were discussed, costed and verified in good faith by the HSE and the Departments of Health and Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p>Section 5 of Building Momentum sets out the principles regarding resolution of disputes and ensuring industrial peace is maintained within the lifetime of the agreement.  Should an issue remain unresolved following discussions at local level, it can be referred to the public service agreement group.  This group is the oversight body for Building Momentum and is comprised of trade union and Civil Service representatives with an independent chair.  The group recommended that the matter we are discussing today be immediately referred to the WRC and that industrial peace be maintained in the meantime.  Following this recommendation, health management met the MLSA under the auspices of the WRC on 17 May, but, unfortunately, no resolution was reached.  While the MLSA agreed to engage at the WRC, it did not lift its industrial action.  We all recognise the significant disruption caused by these strike days and the impact they have had on patients.  I recognise unconditionally that not one medical scientist who has stood on a picket line wants to be there and there is not one medical scientist who does not understand the implications of being there.  I fully appreciate and acknowledge that medical scientists are doing this as a last resort.  They have been engaging for two decades now on this issue.</p><p>The Government also acknowledges that current price pressures are a source of concern for public service workers, including medical scientists, and right across the board.  Nevertheless, Government must manage the public finances in a way that addresses the multiple challenges facing the economy and the Exchequer, including the impact of rising inflation and the conflict in Ukraine.  Since December 2021, almost &euro;560 million worth of additional expenditure measures have been introduced to support citizens and businesses with increased costs, including an energy credit payment, an increase in the fuel allowance, a reduction in the threshold for the drugs payment scheme and a temporary 20% reduction in public service transport fares.</p><p>On 14 March, ICTU advised the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform of its intention to seek a review of Building Momentum.  The Minister has directed his officials to arrange entering into exploratory discussions with public service unions and representative staff associations on an agreed way forward on public service pay issues.  These will be complex discussions against a difficult backdrop of the hangover effects of Covid, the disruptions, the increase in demand and its impact on consumer price inflation, the war in Ukraine and many other international issues that have been driving up prices.  Discussions must be cognisant of the multiple challenges Ireland is currently facing, including increases in prices right across the board.</p> <p>As set out in the Government amendment to this motion, the Department of Health must operate within the public service agreement, and all of the State's industrial relations institutions must be used to prevent further disruption to patients and to find an acceptable solution to this matter for all sides.  I was pleased to hear the parties have accepted an invitation from the Labour Court for exploratory engagement.  I believe parties will be engaging in the coming hours.  It is for the court to establish whether and how it might assist the parties in finding a resolution to the matters in dispute.  I very much welcome the decision by the MLSA to lift its strike action and to attend this Labour Court engagement.</p> <p> Health management, in conjunction with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, is committed to continuing to engage with the MLSA while acknowledging that all parties must continue to adhere to the provisions of the public service agreements.  We will continue to make every effort to find a resolution to this issue.</p> <p> I thank the Deputies again for tabling the motion.  It is an important topic and it has been going on for too long.  We can all accept that.  We all understand the source of the claim for pay parity with the biochemists.  A process is now under way.  I hope we all agree that the best way for this to be resolved is through the established dispute resolution mechanisms.  I very much welcome all sides going to the Labour Court today.  It is my sincere hope an agreement can be found through the mechanisms of the Labour Court, the Workplace Relations Commission, if necessary, and through formal and informal talks.  I hope an outcome that is satisfactory to all sides can be found.  We all know strike action has a significant impact on patients.  I reiterate that the work of the medical scientists is highly valued and acknowledged, and we want to find a settlement that works for all sides.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-25a.44" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1522" speakername="Mick Barry" time="10:32:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022052500011#J00200"><p>What is this dispute about?  It is about equal pay for equal work.  Medical scientists and biochemists do the same work in the same laboratories in the same public hospitals.  More than 20 years ago, it was agreed there would be pay parity and, more than 20 years on, there is still no pay parity.  Medical scientists are paid at least 8% less.</p>  <p>  In the National Health Service in the UK, there is a grade of clinical scientist.  It is a natural career progression for medical scientists to move to the grade of clinical scientist and to develop their career path.  That is not available to medical scientists here although it could and should be.  That is an important part of the issues in this dispute.  It is no wonder there is a brain drain to the private sector, that 20% of posts have been left unfilled and that there has been an industrial dispute.  The dispute has caused disruption, which is entirely the responsibility of those who have refused to deliver on pay parity, that is, the Government.</p>  <p>  I heard the point the Minister made about his definition of insufficient funds and Building Momentum.  However, people cannot help but look at this situation and see that the Government does not believe there are insufficient funds to give developers subsidies of up to &euro;140,000 for building apartments.  The Minister for Defence does not believe there are insufficient funds to increase defence funding in this State by up to &euro;1 billion, primarily spending it on extra guns and weapons.</p>  <p>  The injustice that has been done to these workers is illustrated well by the fact that some other laboratory workers, when they receive a promotion to the grade of medical scientist, do not receive a pay increase but instead receive a pay cut.  That is a bizarre situation.  The T&aacute;naiste receives a salary of &euro;195,000 per annum.  The Taoiseach receives a salary of &euro;211,000 per annum.  How would a T&aacute;naiste feel if he or she were to receive a promotion to the post of Taoiseach and receive a pay cut?  Of course that would never happen.  The political establishment would never allow it to be the case.  It is a double standard.  It is allowed to happen in our public hospitals.</p>  <p>  The example I just gave illustrates another part of the problem.  Government politicians, who pay themselves enormous salaries, cannot begin to understand the problems of working people who are forced to live on a fraction of those wages.  Many of the medical scientists who have taken to the picket lines last week and this week spend a big proportion of their salaries on paying rent to put a roof over their heads.  Some of them to whom I spoke cannot even afford to do that.  They have been to college and got degrees, and some have masters degrees, and yet some of them are still forced to live at home with their parents.  It is a different world from the world of the Ministers who have perpetuated this injustice.</p>  <p>  At least 70% of the State's 2,100 medical scientists are women.  Is there a connection between this fact and the fact an injustice has taken place here?  It is a fact there has not been equal pay for equal work for decades.  The Minister, of course, will deny it but I cannot help thinking that such an injustice might not have been left to fester for quite so long if the majority of the workforce were not female.  There is a long history of second-class citizenship for women in our health services.  They have been treated as second-class citizens.  I wonder is that being reflected, to some extent, in this situation.</p>  <p>  The role performed by medical scientists is vital to our public health services.  Never was this seen more clearly than in the course of the Covid-19 pandemic when they played a key role in the roll-out and implementation of the testing programme.  This country could not have got through the pandemic in the way it did if not for these workers.  That makes it all the more scandalous that they are being treated the way the Government is treating them.  Their vital role is also shown by the strike.  Without their labour, the public health service slowed to a virtual standstill last week and again yesterday.  These workers got a taste of their own power on the picket lines.  If the Labour Court does not deliver justice and pay parity, it is power that can and should be used again, if necessary.  I hope the Minister is fully aware of that.</p>  <p>  Reference has been made to Building Momentum.  There are different kinds of momentum.  The Minister and the political establishment are aware of the fact this strike had built momentum.  There was unity and solidarity on the picket lines.  There was considerable support across the board from fellow workers in the hospitals.  There was massive support from the public.  You only had to stand on a picket line and listen to the sound of the horns blaring as cars passed.  I have no doubt, despite all the sweet-talking we have heard today, that there are some in the Government and in the Department of Health who hope the Labour Court talks might be used to slow or break the momentum of this strike.  We have seen it before.  The Government is the master of this approach.  It wants to spin out the dispute for weeks and weeks, letting the momentum of the strike fall off.  The workers are then back to square one with perhaps a tiny bit more.  They are left to start all over again.  I say clearly to the workers in the Gallery and to the workers in the MLSA that if the strategy of the Department of Health and Government is to try to break the momentum of the strike by spinning out these talks for weeks and weeks, do not let them do it.  The workers absolutely should go before the Labour Court to talk, negotiate and engage.  They should see if justice and pay parity are on offer.  However, if they are not on offer relatively quickly and the Government tries to spin out talks, I say to those workers not to let the Government break the momentum of the strike.  The workers have power.  It was used last week and this week, and can be used again.  The Minister needs to be clear about that.</p> <p> Every worker in this country deserves a pay increase.  I hope a victory for the medical scientists will spur other workers to press for cost-of-living pay increases.  The trade union movement as a whole must get behind the medical scientists and see a victory for them as a signal that justice for all workers through the protection of living standards in this inflation crisis needs to be fought for now.  I will conclude by saying, victory to the medical scientists, equal pay for equal work, pay parity now, an injury to one is an injury to all, and a victory for the medical scientists will be a victory for every worker in this country. </p></speech>

I welcome the medical scientists who are in the Public Gallery.  I too was on the picket line yesterday with my colleague Deputy O'Rourke at St. James's Hospital, and many of my colleagues have been on picket lines throughout the State over recent weeks.  We know this is a very long-standing issue that needs to be resolved.</p>  <p>  I read the Minister's speech very carefully - we got a copy as he was making it - but it does not really tell us anything we do not know.  He said he was aware of the ongoing, important and long-standing claims for pay parity.  He acknowledged this goes back to the year 2000 and that pay parity was achieved then but was broken in 2001.  He said that sectoral bargaining through Building Momentum is the way to resolve this issue.  He went on to say medical scientists have been given their own bargaining unit and then outlined the constraint in that process, which is a 1% pay increase that we know will not achieve the objective of pay parity.  He talked about engagement in talks over recent months.  In fact, as we know, it goes back more than 20 years.  He said several options have been put on the table over the past while.  I do not know what those options are.  Have any of them gone beyond 1%?  That negotiation is ongoing between the organisations.  He then went on to say "the parties have accepted an invitation from the Labour Court [yesterday] for exploratory engagement".  We are far beyond "exploratory engagement".  We know what the issues are.  We do not need more exploratory talks.  We need the HSE and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to come to the table with real, practical proposals that will resolve this issue.</p>  <p>  I do not believe medical scientists will back down, nor should they.  The principle of pay parity is something I hope the Minister supports and can resolve.  I agree with previous speakers, and I have listened to the Taoiseach and others from the Government speak on this issue, that they have been almost Pontius Pilate-like in washing their hands of responsibility by stating this is something the industrial relations machinery of the State alone can resolve.  Of course, they are the bodies that bring people together, but the paymaster here is the Government.  It has the ability to resolve this issue, as does the Minister.  They need to be creative, and if sectoral bargaining is not going to be the way to achieve the 8% pay parity, which is what is needed, they will have to look at options such as career pathways and recognition of the medical scientists grade, because this is not simply a pay increase issue but one of pay parity, which is different issue from my perspective.  The Minister will have to be creative.</p>  <p>  I very much hope, as the previous speaker said, these talks are not kicking the can down the road.  We need this issue resolved.  We all know how fundamentally important medical scientists are to every facet of healthcare.  Consultants and doctors cannot do what they do without the support of medical scientists.  I ask the Minister to resolve this issue as quickly as he can.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-25a.47" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="10:42:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022052500012#K00300"><p>I thank the Deputies who tabled this motion because it gives us a very welcome opportunity.  I also welcome the medical scientists who are in the Gallery watching this and those who are tuned in.  I pay tribute to them for their patience and determination.  It is patience because, as we know, this issue has been going on for decades.  When an industrial dispute can be characterised in terms of decades, that shows the people with responsibility for its resolution have not been stepping up to the plate.</p>  <p>  I well recall that in 2006 medical scientists were among the first to sign up for extended working hours under Towards 2016.  There has been a lot of talk about working hours in the health service but when what might be called reform or more time spent away from families, whatever words you want to put on it, was proposed, they signed up to it.  As we know, the Government of which the Minister's party was a part walked away from that wage agreement.  It got the productivity and trousered that, but was off when it came to giving pay increases in response to that.  The flexibility the medical scientists have shown is to be admired.  Like my colleagues, I was on the picket line with them this week and last week.  They will tell you about how the job, the hours, the demands and the pressures have changed.  The only thing that has not changed is the pay.  The only thing that has substantially changed is that the inequality between those with whom they seek parity is getting worse.</p>  <p>  This dispute is fairly easy to resolve.  I get a little concerned when I hear people are going to the Labour Court for exploratory talks.  I venture to suggest there has been quite a substantial amount of talking about an issue that is relatively straightforward.  I have some experience in industrial relations and sometimes things are genuinely very complicated but sometimes they are just about a straightforward pay equality claim.  We need to separate the two.  I am very hopeful a resolution will come out of the Labour Court.  The person who is our current T&aacute;naiste, when he was campaigning for the leadership of his party, cited that in some instances he wanted Labour Court recommendations to be made compulsory.  I am very relieved he has not quite got around to that.  We know it has not gone away.  As I said at the time, I know a good, old-fashioned, Thatcherite, no-strike clause when I see one.  That is in fact what it was.</p>  <p>  The good news for the MLSA and its members is a recommendation will, it is hoped, come from the Labour Court.  At that stage, they will have a chance to have their say because it will not be down to us as politicians to interfere in that part of the process.  They will have a chance to ballot on whatever that recommendation is, to decide if it satisfies their very long-standing claim and if is something they can live with.  At that stage, should they reject that recommendation, they know they will be back onto the picket line.  I know from talking to them that if that is the place they have to go, they will, but they do not want to.</p>  <p>  It is a tactic of the Government that has caused this delay and this dispute to be protracted.  The Minister cannot walk into this Chamber and say this is a desperate situation that has been going on for 20 years, as if successive governments have not had a hand in this.  It is a tactic.  It was a tactic when I was on my tools, and it is a tactic now, to only send people to the debating or discussion forum of the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, or the Labour Relations Commission as was, who do not have the capacity to resolve the dispute.  People are sitting across the table with officials from the Minister's Department, who I know have done their best, and officials from the HSE who want to resolve it.  They do not want to be running in and out.  They have other work to be doing, as have the medical scientists.  They are saying they want this resolved but then everyone looks around and says, "Who is here with the chequebook?  Nobody."  Everybody then goes home.  It is an absolute tactic because it could not be happening as often as it is unless it was.</p>  <p>  I sincerely hope the message has come from the Government, not specifically from the Minister's Department, but from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, that the resources will be there.  Nobody is disputing this will require resources to settle.  There is no point in people going to the Labour Court if the resources are not going to be there because otherwise we will just be back in the Chamber in a couple of weeks' time having the same debate.  That does not do anyone any favours.  It does not do the people in the Gallery, patients and the process of industrial relations any favours.  In fact, it is disrespectful to the process of industrial relations to come to the Chamber, as the Minister, the Taoiseach and others have done, and say we must leave this up to the industrial relations mechanisms of the State, as if it is some sort of magic Aladdin's cave where we go in and come out with a resolution.  There is no point in going to the WRC or any negotiating forum unless people are sitting across the table eyeballing the person with the chequebook.  It is a waste of everybody's time otherwise.</p>  <p>  I very much hope the Minister will use his good offices to prevail on the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to ensure this dispute is resolved and make that clear by ensuring officials from all relevant Departments and agencies are represented at the Labour Court, so the message goes out the Government is minded to settle this dispute and does not want to see medical scientists back on the picket line.</p> <p>I have been involved in more than one dispute, and the Minister should believe me when I say the members watch these disputes very closely.  They watch the body language and see what it means for a potential resolution to their own disputes.  They see when the Government is serious and when it plays for time.  With the greatest of respect, 20 years is enough playing for time.  I sincerely hope the tactic, which is what it is, of sending only half a team to ensure a dispute is not resolved will be suspended and that real and genuine efforts will be made to settle this long-running dispute, which we all want to see settled.</p></speech>

We had some of the team in the audiovisual room last Tuesday, before the first day of strike action.  Most of all, I commend medical scientists from right around the country on the resolve they have shown.  Others have talked about the fundamental issues at play here, including pay parity, the 20-year claim and the expert review.  The present Taoiseach was the Minister responsible at the time.  Others have pointed to the addition of insult to injury among laboratory aides.  I do not think there is a medical scientist in the country who would deny laboratory aides the wage they get.  It is a recognition of the valuable contribution they make.  It is, however, a further indication of the contradiction within the system that the people to whom they are answerable get paid less than them.</p><p>I welcome the fact there is an engagement at the Labour Court but, as my colleagues have said, it must be a meaningful one and must come with an understanding of the issues and a willingness and an ability to find solutions.  I implore the Minister to engage with the Minister, Deputy McGrath, and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to find those solutions and to be creative.  There is huge opportunity to be creative here and it needs to extend beyond 1%.</p><p>I will touch on two major issues.  I worked as a medical scientist and, looking now from the outside in, I wish to reflect on my experience of that profession and to touch on two issues: dedication and excellence.</p><p>Many Members have talked about dedication.  This is a 24-7, 365-day service, including Christmas Day, New Year's Day and bank holidays, whether 3 o'clock in the morning or 3 o'clock in the evening, and harsh winters, including those of 2013 and 2017.  Some colleagues mentioned staff working 15 days straight during Covid.  At times, including during Storm Ophelia, medical scientists have not left the building for up to a week without thinking twice about it, such is their level of dedication.  It is mainly women who do this work, including during Covid.  Where was the support for childcare at that time?  It was not there.  That was another example.  When I started work as a medical scientist, some of my colleagues had lived with the marriage bar.  I think it is no coincidence we are in this position with a profession dominated by women.</p><p>I wish to touch on the issue of excellence.  We do not see it in very many places.  In medical science there is a culture of excellence driven by the staff's dedication and commitment, which has not been for reward, because the Government has introduced a glass ceiling for them.  As colleagues have said, they are an essential part of practically every clinical decision.  They have degrees, including masters degrees.  Some have multiple masters degrees, PhDs, FRCPaths and MRCPaths.  The internal journal is called <i>Converse</i>.  I remember reading an article in it about colleagues who had done MRCPaths and PhDs and who talked about their experience.  They obtained those qualifications for personal development and to contribute to and to improve the profession, not for personal gain, because the Government has introduced a glass ceiling.  There is huge opportunity there in respect of advance practice if the Government has the creativity to realise that opportunity.</p><p>This is pioneering science, not off-the-shelf stuff.  In many cases staff build these assays from the ground up.  We have seen during Covid-19, in practically every lab, staff do their own basic science, pure science, building the assays, including the most high-tech of molecular science, from the ground up.  These are fully accredited laboratories.  It was the Joint Commission when I started; now it is INAB 15189.  There is an obligation on transfusion labs.  The other labs do it because they want to maintain the highest standards.  The recruitment and retention crisis the Government has created is putting those standards under pressure.  There is a spectacular opportunity here.  These are the best of public services.  We should be putting them up in lights and rewarding them, and that is what the Minister needs to do.</p></speech>

D&eacute;ile&aacute;lann s&eacute; le rud an-mh&iacute;fh&eacute;ar&aacute;ilte at&aacute; ag dul ar aghaidh le blianta fada.  I thank the Deputies on my right for bringing forward this very important motion.  I also welcome the medical scientists who are here today and who are witnessing this discussion.  I commend them on their strength and on standing up for what is right.  I hope the Minister and his Government will also stand up for what is right.</p>  <p>  As the Minister will know, the Medical Laboratory Scientists Association is the union representing 2,100 medical scientists.  Something the Taoiseach said struck me yesterday during Leaders' Questions, so I will give a little background to this.  Prior to this industrial action, the MLSA had just one official strike in its 61 years of existence.  That was back in 1968, a year of great global upheaval.  There was the Prague Spring, student protests all over the world and so on.  The limited action the MLSA took that year was therefore hardly out of step with mainstream current events.  The Government of the day was a Fianna F&aacute;il one with Jack Lynch as Taoiseach, and a fair deal was reached with the union.  I hope we will see a fair deal and a recognition of these workers again now.</p>  <p>  I wish to comment on something the Taoiseach said yesterday, which was that the medical scientists should engage in the process.  It is very clear the medical scientists have always been willing to engage in every single process and that they have been extremely patient and conciliatory, but they have been left with no other option.  It is now more than two decades since the report of the expert group on medical laboratory technician and technologist grades.  As part of that, the Health Service Executive and the Department of Health agreed to recommend pay parity between biochemists and medical scientists, but that was undone only months after it seemingly being resolved.  The first public service benchmarking process ended up tying those grades to different markers, so there has been ample time to sort this and it is extremely unfair.  As others have mentioned, medical scientists find themselves working in medical laboratories alongside clinical biochemists and medical laboratory aides, yet such a significant pay differential exists despite them conducting similar work.  It is an incredible source of frustration to them, as it should be, that they are not getting that same wage or a higher one.  I could ask the Minister how that is fair.  It is completely unfair.  I wonder how it was ever allowed to come to pass.  Medical scientists essentially perform the same function as clinical biochemists but have completely different pay scales and are paid on average 8% less for the work they do.  They also have fewer career development opportunities and less support for education and training.  We know that workers are facing burnout.</p>  <p>  One thing that has been quite interesting in the media coverage over recent days - it is found whenever there is strike action - is that everybody suddenly has come out and said we cannot do anything if we do not have these workers.  That is why those workers are there.  They perform an extremely important function.  Those of us who, unlike an Teachta O'Rourke, did not come from this background might not know all the intricacies of the work they have been doing.  It is, however, very clear from the media coverage we have heard over recent  days that people from various hospitals have come out and talked about the extremely important work being done.  They have been, as I said, extremely patient but they need to be listened to at this point.</p> <p>It is incredibly frustrating.  They have met with the Department of Health but the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has not engaged.  As my colleague Deputy O'Reilly said, you need to make sure that the finances are there.  There has to be action from the Government here and now.  We know the extremely important work being done by the medical scientists.  We need to ensure the money is there to make sure they get fair pay and equity.  I urge the Minister to speak to his Cabinet colleagues and put the pressure on the Government to make sure there is fairness here.  We know the incredible work that has been done.  We all stood up and clapped for front-line workers during the pandemic.  Now we need to follow that up with action.</p></speech>

It was submitted last week.  It could have been resolved last Thursday or Friday and this matter might have been recent history but the proposers knew that would not be the case, as we all did.  Even if it had been resolved, the proposers know that brining it forward also relates to wider issues in how the State engages with workers.  I acknowledge that and I welcome the workers to the Visitors Gallery today.</p>  <p>  As others have noted, the dispute is not complex.  In the context of industrial relations this case is relatively simple.  We have said it has been going on for 20 years but it has been going on for much longer because what happened in 2021 did not just drop out of the sky.  It was the result of more than 20 years of campaigning.  When I was on the picket yesterday, I spoke to medical scientists who work in Temple Street hospital.  They said that when they came out of Kevin Street college, the union was fighting for two things: the move to the Mater hospital and pay parity with the biochemists.  That was in the 1970s.  They came out of Kevin Street with their bench experience while the biochemists came out with their degrees, and that is where this all began.  This goes back many decades.  It is not just 20 years.  That is obviously a huge amount of time but this goes back almost 50 years.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach said a number of times yesterday, in a rather patronising way, that the union and workers should engage with the full apparatus of labour relations machinery in the State.  That is what they have been doing for years.  They have been the good girls and boys in class.  They have been engaging through their union with the Government for many years and it has got them nowhere until some months ago when they pulled back from industrial action to go back to the WRC.</p>  <p>  Industrial action has been suspended and it gives us a moment's pause to speak about what has got us here rather than doing so in the white heat of the picket.  Deputy O'Rourke's experience as a medical scientist is important to bring to the D&aacute;il.  The Republic has around 32,600 clinical scientists working in 43 publicly funded hospital labs.  The services provided by medical scientists are vital to the functioning of the healthcare service, from blood transfusion and transplantation science to medical genetics, molecular diagnostics, haematology, microbiology, virology, cellular pathology, point-of-care testing, immunology, endocrinology and clinical chemistry.  As one medical scientist told me on the picket line at Beaumont Hospital last week, they do a lot more than just Covid testing.  Covid was a double-edged sword.  Yes, it put a lot of the spotlight on the vital role they play, but it is only a small fraction of the vast array of highly complex functions they perform and the unseen front line of our health service.  Medical scientists are highly educated and skilled individuals with level 8 degrees and have had specific multidisciplinary medical training to work in a clinical diagnostic laboratory setting.  Over 70% of medical scientists have masters degrees or other postgraduate qualifications, including PhDs.  They work alongside clinical scientists and biochemists.  Biochemists make up 2% of Ireland's clinical scientists and medical scientists 98%.  The Association of Clinical Biochemists in Ireland has had far more success in developing and delivering advanced and extended practice roles for the 2% of clinical scientists in Irish laboratories whom it represents than has its counterpart body which represents the remaining 98% of clinical scientists in this country.</p>  <p>  Entry level criteria are similar for both professions, although medical scientists must complete one of three Academy of Clinical Sciences and Laboratory Medicine, ASCLM, approved biomedical science degrees where the syllabus is tailored toward the needs of a clinical laboratory to be considered qualified while biochemists can enter their profession with any science degree and little bench experience.  Crucial to this dispute is that medical scientists and biochemists have markedly different career pathways, markedly different opportunities for career progression, markedly different reporting structures and markedly different pay scales despite having very similar responsibilities and despite there being no difference in the quality or scope of services delivered by laboratories that employ biochemists and those that do not.</p>  <p>  At the top of his or her profession a publicly employed medical scientist can expect to earn only 60% of the wage of a publicly employed biochemist at the top of his or her profession.  Biochemists across all grades are better paid and have far more opportunities for progression than their medical scientist counterparts.  Over a 40-year career in the public service, a biochemist can expect to out-earn a medical scientist by as much as &euro;1.5 million.  The markedly different conditions of employment between medical scientists and biochemists are discriminatory. Medical scientists seek a unified career structure, equal opportunities for career advancement, equal pay for equal levels of responsibility, and equal pay for equal work.  Put simply, they seek equality.</p>  <p>  In addition to the disparity with their clinical scientist colleagues, medical scientists now earn a lower starting wage than colleagues who report to them.  Medical scientists will stress the importance of lab aides to the health service.  This is another anomaly that needs to be resolved.</p>  <p>  Like many others, I want to highlight the work of medical scientists in responding to the Covid-19 pandemic and providing new diagnostic services for a new virus expertly, rapidly and on a nationwide basis during a global pandemic.  As I said, it shone an overdue spotlight on the work that is done by medical scientists and its excellence, the word used by Deputy O'Rourke.</p>  <p>  Yesterday the Taoiseach spoke grandly of the plans for expanding the number of medical scientists we have and a recruitment plan, but it is not an expansion but rather a refilling of staff.  It is replacement of staff because we are struggling to retain medical scientists in publicly funded laboratories throughout the country.  There are more vacancies in labs than there are graduates to fill them.  That has been the case for some time.  It does not take a lot to realise there has to be a breaking point.  That has now been reached.  The two days of strike action and today's suspended industrial action are testament to that.</p>  <p>  The shortage of staff has led to outsourcing much of our testing capacity in the country to the US and the UK.  We only have to look at the cervical cancer scandal to see what happens when we outsource such a vital service away from the excellence we know and trust in this country to somewhere where we do not have the same levels of trust.  People in this country have been let down to the extent of losing their lives as a result.  That is not an exaggeration or hyperbole.  It is a fact.</p>  <p>  I will conclude by expressing my admiration for the resolve of the medical scientists.  Anyone who has spoken to them over the days of their industrial action so far can see there is a continuity, steeliness and determination not only to see this through but to get back to work.  However, they will not get back to work unless there is meaningful engagement with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform at the table and they can get what they deserve and is their right, which is true equality.</p></speech>

It is very timely and important.  It deals with a group of people who are absolutely critical to our health service.  They work behind the scenes in a very quiet way.  In many ways they have been too quiet in recent years.  They have now reached breaking point.</p>  <p>  It is important to note at the start that since the inclusion of the motion on the D&aacute;il schedule, strike action for today was averted with the intervention of the Labour Court.  That is a very positive development.  However, it should never have come to this.  Medical scientists have been extremely patient and have exhausted all avenues to resolve this dispute before resorting to industrial action.</p>  <p>This is a failure of the Government in my view.</p> <p> I met a substantial number of medical scientists at Beaumont hospital yesterday.  I got a sense of their utter frustration and annoyance with the way they have been treated.  They are highly qualified people who want to work in the public health system but because of the disrespect that has been shown by the Government over many years, they are finding it increasingly difficult to do that.  It is becoming a much more difficult job owing to serious recruitment problems.  There is also a very deep sense of disrespect on the part of medical scientists.  We should not be treating any of our healthcare workers like that.</p> <p> It has been over two decades since an expert group report recommended pay parity for medical scientists with their colleagues in biochemistry and yet their pay remains approximately 8% less.  It is difficult to fathom how successive governments have failed to implement this recommendation from 20 years ago when the current Taoiseach was Minister for Health and Children.  That recommendation was accepted by the Department of Health and the HSE.  It is even more difficult to fathom how a procedural error in 2002 seems to be the cause of this long-standing dispute.</p> <p> Once again, it would appear that an unnecessary level of bureaucracy was the stumbling block.  We have had more than 20 years to correct this situation, but successive Ministers have sat on their hands and allowed this issue to reach a crisis point.  This strike action has not only brought this dispute to public attention but it has also shown us the importance of medical scientists.  They are essential front-line workers and without them the delicate fabric of our health service would fall apart.  Why is that?  It is because the health service operates on the basis that if you produce it, they will test it.  That is a critical role that is played and a key cog in the operation of the public health service.</p> <p> Routine tests such as those for Covid and those of blood and urine samples, to name but a few, cannot be processed without them, in effect causing havoc in public hospitals, emergency departments and GP surgeries throughout the country.  As a result of one day's strike action, approximately 14,000 procedures were cancelled in hospitals last week.  Of course, much more work in the health service was delayed, deferred or could not happen as a result of the strike action.  While emergency cover was offered, this only amounted to out-of-hours or Christmas Day levels of service.  This was nowhere near the level needed to keep routine hospital and GP services even ticking over, never mind tackling our unacceptably long waiting lists.</p> <p> Last week the HSE chief executive, Paul Reid, told the Joint Committee on Health that the plans to cut these waiting lists by one fifth this year were under challenge.  One of the reasons highlighted was legacy issues and this pay dispute is undoubtedly one of those legacy issues.  In fact, it is a microcosm of one of the root problems in our health service - the difficulties with recruitment and retention.</p> <p> People are fleeing the public health service, or refusing to enter it, in the pursuit of better pay, improved working conditions and better work-life balance.  This is a common thread across healthcare professions from nurses to consultants to medical scientists and so many others.  Unless we address these concerns which have reached a tipping point because of Covid, we will continue to face staff shortages and even industrial action.  We know that 20% of medical scientists' posts are unfilled in public hospitals.  For example, ten medical scientists left last year and they have still not been replaced.  Who must shoulder that burden?  It is the remaining medical scientists as is so often the case but there are difficulties with recruitment.  It is already a pressurised job but where posts remain unfilled that stress and pressure only increases.</p> <p> To add insult to injury, laboratory aides who report to medical scientists earn more than them meaning that people take a pay cut for getting a promotion.  You simply could not make it up.  Is it any wonder that our medical science graduates are bypassing the public health system and being swallowed up by the private sector, particularly in the pharmaceutical sector?  Of course, it is patients who suffer most from this brain drain.  The Government along with every political party signed up to Sl&aacute;intecare, which is all about enhancing patient experience in a strong public health system with well-respected public health workers throughout the system.  However, this will never become a reality unless we deal with the deterioration in job quality and pay disparity in healthcare professionals.</p> <p> As we speak, tens of thousands of patients are anxiously awaiting new dates for cancelled appointments with many having already waited months or even years in some cases.  The HSE, the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform must put a meaningful proposal on the table to prevent a repeat of this.  While I am glad to see that the apparatus of the State is being utilised, a sincere and meaningful proposal must be put on the table to address medical scientists' legitimate concerns; it cannot be more of the same.  Without this it is difficult to see how further strike action can be averted and this would have very far-reaching implications for patients and the public health system at large.</p> <p> How can the Government ever expect to honour its commitments to repatriate CervicalCheck samples if it cannot recruit or retain staff?  It is ludicrous that we are still outsourcing to private laboratories at enormous financial cost and potential risk to patients while doing little to attract the staff needed to build up our own capacity.  This, along with the overriding need of patients, must be the impetus for an early resolution.  Positive platitudes about front-line workers will no longer cut it.  Our healthcare professionals deserve better.  They will not stick around unless they are respected, not just by words but by action over their pay and conditions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-25a.55" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1603" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="11:12:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022052500015#N00200"><p>As Deputies, we are frequently contacted by patients or their families about the latest medicine for a specific illness that can transform the life of a patient.  They are looking for approval under the drug reimbursement scheme.  This is all part of the rapidly expanding area of healthcare known as personalised medicine.  This means that medical care is based on the patients' own genes and specific disease.  We know that genes are the information that tells cells in the body how to grow and develop.  For example, many cancers affect or involve specific genes.</p>  <p>  Through investment in health research, we can target treatments towards these genes in an approach known as precision medicine.  This can be more effective at treating or managing the disease with far fewer side effects than other types of treatment leading to more successful and quicker recovery which is far better for the patient, reducing the overall long-term cost of the delivery of our healthcare.</p>  <p>  This type of precision medicine is built on two key elements.  The first is technology.  Identifying specific genes and how they are expressed through an illness encompasses the whole field of genomics which plays an important role in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases, including cancers and rare diseases, enabling more efficient and accurate diagnosis and improving treatment selection.  Genomics is driving precision medicine to improve clinical outcomes for individuals impacted by illnesses and their families.  However, we can only use genetic information to develop tests for cancer and other diseases, and to prevent them, if we make the investment.</p>  <p>  Although the Government made a commitment in 2020 to develop a national genomics and genetic medicine programme, this key area of healthcare in Ireland lacks clear funding and a structure to deliver this type of innovative technology for patients.</p> <p>The second area is people.  The days of the doctor examining the patient and then sitting at the end of the bed outlining a battery of broad treatments that will be administered to the patient in the hope of hitting the right one for that specific illness are, thankfully, confined to history.  Instead, the doctor's treatment plan today is based on laboratory results from an ever-increasing and far more targeted range of tests that can facilitate the precision healthcare I just mentioned.</p> <p> Just as technology has become more precise, however, so too has the importance of laboratory staff who are now more likely to be the decision makers when it comes to a person's treatment, care and, most importantly, recovery, than the doctor at the end of the bed.  This is only set to increase in importance.  Today, more than 80% of laboratory medical scientists are educated to master's level, with many having a second master's degree, PhD or another professional doctorate.  Patients see first-hand how vital the role they play is and they have seen it very clearly over the last two days of work stoppages.</p> <p> A carer who is in chronic pain contacted me last night.  Her procedure was cancelled last January and then again on three subsequent occasions.  She was given a further date this week.  Again, it was cancelled because of the industrial action.  In this particular instance, this carer has had to source an alternative carer on five separate occasions so far this year so that she could have that procedure.  She told me last night that she understands the reason why the laboratory staff are taking the action they are taking.  She supports them in having fairer pay and career development opportunities, but she also wanted to outline the impact this is having, not just on her, but on the person for whom she is providing care.  As I said, she continues to suffer pain, inconvenience and stress and has done so over the last six months.  The uncertainty this industrial action is bringing about is making it impossible for her to plan in advance.</p> <p> There is huge frustration out there among medical scientists at the moment.  After spending five years in college and having gained professional recognition for their qualification, upon graduation, medical scientists actually supervise and are responsible for medical laboratory aids, but bizarrely, their starting pay scale is lower than the people they are actually supervising.  Once medical scientists are registered with CORU, the first reality check they receive is a pay cut.  The second more depressing hit comes when they discover that if they decide to stay for any length of time in the public service, they will work alongside their biochemist colleagues who are performing the same duties, but they will not receive the same pay or career opportunities.  Biochemist colleagues with the same qualifications but with less experience operate at consultant level whereas senior medical scientists operate at chief medical scientist level, which is the final level of progression for them.  To add insult to injury, this pay parity anomaly was rectified 20 years ago and was then rescinded.</p> <p> Medical scientist stepped up to the plate during the pandemic and the cyberattack, taking on additional duties and working additional hours, even though the workforce was seriously understaffed prior to Covid-19.  The refusal by the HSE, Department of Health and Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to move on these issues has been a clear slap in the face to these particular staff members.</p> <p> This situation whereby these staff are now leaving in droves is a missed opportunity to develop this profession and the whole area of medical science.  It is a missed opportunity to bring about the type of precision healthcare we need in this country that ensures people are given the most appropriate treatment and discharged back into the community as quickly as possible or alternatively, that they are treated in their own home or community.  The investment in the laboratory services and laboratory staff is key to achieving these objectives.  It is imperative that we address as a matter of urgency the severe recruitment and retention problem we have in the service today.</p></speech>

They have played their part.  This dispute and issue was settled 20 years ago and then, for some reason, some people in the HSE decided to overturn it and now we have this problem again.  I welcome the fact that the pickets were withdrawn today and that there is room for talks because picketing is the last word, especially in the congested and failed health system we have and of which the Minister of State is in charge.  It is failing people every minute and hour of every day.  This vital component, the very important diagnostic people, are being mistreated in this way and are fleeing the service, leaving a bigger mess behind.</p>  <p>  There is no problem getting money for Mr. Paul Reid or Mr. Robert Watt, or hiring a taxi for God knows how much out in Dubai and booking flights or anything else.  It is no problem for anything else; the Government throws money at it.  When it comes to looking after the most important key front-line people, however, the Government will not look after them.  It has failed to look after them for years.  It is time to pony up here.  It is time that the Government listened to and, above all, respected them.  I still do not know if many of the people on the front line who were promised the &euro;1,000 got it in a big blaze of glory.  The Government is good at announcements but it is not good at looking after its staff.  That is the difference with the HSE.  It should be disbanded forthwith and regional operations set up to look after the people.  Molaim na daoine a bh&iacute;onn ag obair go crua ann.</p></speech>

When we factor in that laboratory services were also withdrawn from Cork University Hospital, CUH, Mercy University Hospital and South Infirmary Victoria University Hospital, the number of affected patients in our constituency likely numbered in their hundreds from just one day.</p>  <p>  I have received many emails on this issue, one of which was from a medical scientist in the cytology laboratory in CUH.  She has worked in CUH for 17 years.  She and her colleagues were, regrettably, on strike this week because of a long-standing pay dispute.  Biochemists in the public laboratories do the same work as biomedical scientists, yet they are paid 8% more.  Two colleagues are basically working side by side and one is paid more.  This was addressed and agreed upon 20 years ago but it was rescinded very shortly after.</p>  <p>  Laboratories right across the country are at breaking point.  They absorbed all the extra work generated by Covid-19 with absolutely no extra staffing or resources.  Covid-19 laboratories were set up overnight, which took staff from all disciplines to cope with the emergency.  The laboratories are not just about blood tests.  They do vital work across blood science, cancer care, attendance at bronchoscopy procedures, fine needles, rapid access clinics, head and neck clinics and everything in between.</p>  <p>  Even if the pay parity is addressed, we are still left with a huge shortage of graduates.  They do their in-service training and run to the private sector.  I do not blame them.  Their working conditions are so stressful.  They are all asking the same thing.  They do not want us standing in the D&aacute;il clapping but instead engaging in meaningful talks with them and their unions.  The Ministers for Health and Public Expenditure and Reform and their Department heads now need to get into a room with the unions as soon as possible.  This 20-plus year farce must end now.</p></speech>

As has been pointed out to me, these medical students have gone through a five-year course and are highly trained with special skills.</p> <p>They are vital to the running of hospitals like University Hospital Kerry in Tralee, where I am sorry to say that many appointments have been cancelled in recent days.  That is not fair on the people who need procedures.  I hope that they are being carried out today.  I have friends and special people who have been waiting a long time and are hopeful that their procedures will go through today.</p> <p> I am not blaming the current Minister, but the HSE.  These people are being underpaid.  Just look at the courses they had to take and the experience they needed to gain.  Proper outcomes, and many lives, depend on them.  We must see after them.  At the heart of this situation is the increased cost of living.  They are just fighting for a chance to live, put food on their tables and support their families.</p> <p> The suspension of appointments is jeopardising outcomes for people who have been waiting a long time.  I am pleased that talks are going ahead.  They should have gone ahead long ago.  Will the Government please rectify the situation?  It should not be happening.  I am blaming the HSE, not individual Ministers.</p></speech>

The staff in our offices are important.</p>  <p>  How can any hospital function without staff and pay parity?  In University Hospital Limerick, UHL, there are seven laboratories that are struggling for laboratory staff.  There is a national shortage of medical scientists, so why not ensure remuneration accordingly?  In 2020, 130 posts were unfilled.  UHL requires medical scientists in seven departments, including biochemistry, microbiology, histology, haematology, the blood bank and the public health lab.</p>  <p>  The main reason for the dispute is that biochemists are paid 8% more than medical scientists.  Medical scientists have significant responsibilities and are more aware of the significance of the disruptions that a strike causes for their primary focus, namely, the patient.  They carry out identical work with the same responsibilities.  They have fewer promotional and career development opportunities and less support for training and education.  They have a genuine grievance with the fact that other public sector health workers have seen significant pay increases when they have not.</p></speech>

I thank them for the excellent work that they do up and down the country, including in Kerry and in Cork University Hospital.  I also thank the MLSA, the trade union representing medical scientists.</p>  <p>  There is a significant national shortage of medical scientists across the public health service, with up to 130 posts unfilled even before the additional pressures of the pandemic arose in 2020.  The reasons for this are inferior pay and conditions, poor career structures and limited opportunities for promotion.</p>  <p>  The HSE has gone straight into combat mode and warned that the strikes will lead to the cancellation of many inpatient and day case elective procedures.  The HSE is trying to blame those who are striking for these issues when the reality is that the real blame rests firmly with the Minister, previous Ministers, the HSE and the Department of Health.</p>  <p>  At the heart of this dispute is the fundamental matter of equal pay for equal work.  I have been spoken to by many people in Kerry who have been engaged in this excellent work for all of their lives.  They are upset at what I would call being forced out to strike.  They did not want to be standing out there and marching.  It is wrong to have allowed this situation to come about.  I plead with the Minister and his Department to listen to the union representing them as well as to them.  They are sincere, highly intelligent and qualified people.</p></speech>

I thank People Before Profit for tabling this important Private Members&rsquo; motion in the D&aacute;il.</p>  <p>  The intervention by the Labour Court is to be welcomed, given the key role that medical scientists play in the delivery of our healthcare, but the HSE and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform have to move to take responsibility for the situation and resolve it.  The Labour Court cannot be used to continue stalling.  The HSE and the Department must engage in meaningful negotiations.  After all, this claim dates back more than 20 years to 2001.  At the time, the claim by the MLSA was conceded by the expert group report, by what is now the HSE, by the Department of Health and by the then Minister for Health and Children, the current Taoiseach.  However, it was unintentionally overturned by a benchmarking process in 2002.</p>  <p>  I was disappointed with the Minister&rsquo;s reply when I raised the issue last week.  Like the HSE and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, he is washing his hands of this legitimate claim from these workers.  He is using the public service agreement, Building Momentum, which restricts any pay increase to 1%.  This is not a pay claim, though.  It is an historical pay parity claim.  The Minister has also used Building Momentum to criticise these workers for going on strike, saying that their action last week was contrary to the MLSA&rsquo;s commitment under that agreement.  The fact that 21 years of frustration has only now resulted in very limited strike action shows the commitment of medical scientists to doing their jobs and providing a crucial service for people&rsquo;s health.  It is the height of hypocrisy to laud health service staff as heroes on the one hand and, on the other, to treat these essential workers and others in this manner.</p>  <p>  I will briefly refer to an email that I received from a medical scientist of 17 years, all of which she has spent working in the public service.  Her working week consists of 37 routine hours and, currently, at least another 24 hours of rostered night and weekend duty.  These extra hours are not voluntary, but a mandatory roster consisting of 15 medical scientists providing the emergency out-of-hours service.  This mandatory overtime affects all of her life, including her health, home life and social activities.  She writes that, although she is not as young as she used to be, she is working more hours than she ever did.  This is because there are staff shortages in her lab, with no immediate prospect of those posts being filled.  Every year, training in medical scientist graduates has been a core part of her role and something she used to enjoy, but it has become soul-destroying in recent years because she sees how the new graduates, after four to five years in college, view the crazy working arrangements and hours and vow to never work in the public system.  All of this is in addition to the fact that she and her colleagues worked and trained through Covid and dealt with the HSE cyberattack and all of the additional work that they took on without resources.</p>  <p>  This is intolerable.  These conditions are the key factor in the recruitment and retention crisis across the health service, particularly as regards medical scientists.  This situation cannot continue.  Where there is a will, there is a way, and there is always a will and always a way.  The Department has to be creative.  Building Momentum cannot resolve this issue.  As the Minister pointed out, it can only provide a 1% increase, so he must think outside the box.  How will he deliver the other 7% that is needed as well as career progression within the grade?</p></speech>

I stand in solidarity with them.  I thank People Before Profit-Solidarity for tabling this motion.  I am not sure how the Minister could not agree with it.  It is the most basic motion that I have ever seen and makes three calls:</p> <blockquote> 	&mdash; ensure that DPER and the HSE agree to the long-standing pay parity award&hellip; <br /><br />&mdash; begin a recruitment campaign...<br /><br />&mdash; publish a plan. </blockquote>  <p>Instead, we have a response from the Minister about &ldquo;hidden heroes&rdquo;.  Medical scientists are not hidden to me, the rest of the Opposition or the hospital staff.  They are certainly not hidden to the public who rely on them, including me, who gets her blood tested like everyone else.  This is not to mention the 200,000 Covid tests that were carried out last year in Galway hospital alone.  They are not &ldquo;hidden heroes&rdquo;.  They are hard-working medical scientists who are asking for equality and pay parity.  That is it.</p><p>The Minister&rsquo;s speech should have dealt with the background to this.  It contained a heading entitled &ldquo;Background&rdquo;, and I was full of hope that he would give us the background, analyse what had happened and tell us what he was going to do.  Instead, there was nothing.</p><p>I have a report in front of me.  It has 112 paragraphs and 64 difficult recommendations written by three men.  Unfortunately, they did not number the recommendations 1, 2, 3, etc.  </p> <p>Notwithstanding that, the recommendations are clear when reading through it.  It is now time.  In May 1997, the Labour Relations Commission recommended the establishment of an expert group.  That expert group was set up in 1997 following long delays since 1981, when all of these problems emerged.  We then go forward to this report, in which the expert group actually apologises for its delay in producing it.  I do not know why but it apologises for the length of time it took.  There was more delay before we got this report in 2001.  To add more confusion, within the report it is said that some of the recommendations should be implemented by 1 April 2000.  The report was published in February 2001 but obviously there were interim reports and contact with the Department.  Perhaps the date of 1 April 2000 is the hint that nobody was serious about this.  Some of these recommendations were to be implemented by 1 April 2000 but that did not happen.</p> <p> Let us fast-forward to more than 21 years later.  We are all expected to grow up at 21 years of age.  It is the age of maturity.  What have we got?  We have an answer that is positively insulting.  I say that with the greatest respect for the Minister's role and not in any personal way.  We cannot go on like this.  The Minister must look at this report.  What happened?  Were any of those recommendations implemented?  If so, will the Minister tell us?  If not, will he tell us why not?  Why was there no review between then and now?  Why do medical scientists, whom I want to thank, have to give us all of this information and tell us how difficult it is to go on strike, which they do most reluctantly?  Why does that have to happen?  It raises the question of whether the structure in the Government is fit for purpose.  In my opinion, it certainly is not.  The Government has had any number of warnings that this was going to happen.  I spent ten years of my life on a health forum and I watched the medical science laboratories being run down and their services being outsourced to private for-profit companies.  While the medical scientists and all of their colleagues appealed for this not to be done, each Government, following the lead of the Progressive Democrats, said "No" and that privatisation was the way forward.  We then had the scandal of the cervical smear tests.  We have learned nothing.</p> <p> The Minister should be telling us why the report has not been implemented, what needs to be done and what we are going to do to stop outsourcing and to recognise the fundamental role of medical scientists so that we can rely on them for their honesty, courage and hard work.  I want to rely on them and I do.  I certainly will not rely on the Government, unless it is going to change.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-25a.67" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1608" speakername="Frank Feighan" time="11:42:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022052500018#Q00200"><p>I thank all the speakers today for their considered thoughts on such an important matter.  I reiterate what my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, said about the value we must place on medical scientists in our healthcare service.  I pay tribute to the dedication, professionalism and commitment of all medical scientists throughout the country.  They worked tirelessly during the pandemic and their efforts in testing Covid-19 samples were, and still are, very significant.  The Government recognises the extraordinary contribution made by those working in our health services, which is evidenced by the decision taken earlier this year to provide a pandemic bonus payment to Covid-exposed front-line workers.</p>  <p>  The strike has led to serious disruptions across the sector, including the cancellation of urgent elective surgeries such as time-sensitive surgery for patients with cancers and other very serious conditions.  I welcome the decision of the Medical Laboratory Scientists Association to lift its strike action and to attend today's exploratory engagement at the Labour Court.  The Government recognises that all of the State's industrial relations machinery should be utilised to resolve the matter.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge the extreme pressure that this cohort of staff has been under due to staff shortages.  It is true that recruitment difficulties for this role exist.  The current medical scientist workforce stood at 2,135 whole-time equivalents as of the end of March 2022, with 260 vacancies.  It is important to note that there is a clearly defined grade structure with promotional opportunities for medical scientists within the HSE.  While the number of basic grade medical scientists has indeed reduced since 2019, the numbers of senior and specialist grade medical scientists have increased.  Overall, since 2019, there has been a 6% growth in the number of medical scientists employed by the HSE.  Each hospital group is progressing recruitment on an ongoing basis and utilising strategies to attract and retain staff, which includes a focused approach on the attraction of new graduates to careers in the public healthcare service.  The HSE plans to undertake a national recruitment campaign to promote the role of medical scientist both nationally and internationally.  The focus of this recruitment drive will provide additional candidates for national vacancies across the system and for priority services.</p>  <p>  In the context of recruitment and expansion, I will briefly reference Dr. Gabriel Scally's scoping inquiry into the CervicalCheck screening programme in 2018, which included the examination of the laboratory services used by the CervicalCheck programme.  Arising from recommendations of Dr. Scally's report, a strategic decision was made in 2018 to develop a national cervical screening laboratory, NCSL.  This is due to open in the coming weeks, building capacity and resilience into the public element of the laboratory services required for the national cervical screening programme in Ireland.  It will enable the National Screening Service to reduce its dependency on third-party providers to meet the needs of the CervicalCheck programme.  The new laboratory is designed to become the principal provider of cervical screening laboratory services for the National Screening Service over time.  It will also serve as a national base for training, education and research purposes.  Some &euro;20 million has been committed for construction, fit-out and staffing of the NCSL.  A workforce plan is currently being developed to address workforce resilience.  This new laboratory will require trained medical scientists, along with many other trained professionals.</p>  <p>  At present, qualification and registration to become a medical scientist involves a four-year programme at undergraduate level.  There are currently 105 training places annually across the universities in Ireland to produce graduates for both the public and private sectors.  In recent years, on average, over half of these graduates have joined the HSE.  The HSE is leading a project to progress advanced practice in the health and social care professions in Ireland.  It encompasses developing an overarching framework incorporating all the key considerations and factors, including an agreed definition and approach across the professions, core competencies, a planned approach to meeting educational requirements, governance and regulatory considerations which can inform policy development in this area.  The work carried out as part this project aims to help address staffing shortages in the health services, including in the medical scientist profession, and to support retention of health and social care professionals who might otherwise be lost due to lack of opportunities for career progression in clinical roles.  HSE projections for future years indicate a requirement for an additional supply of qualified graduates from the Irish labour market.  This could be achieved through an increase in the number of undergraduates taken on the relevant colleague courses, a specific graduate entry programme or both.</p>  <p>  I will briefly address the issues surrounding the current public service pay agreement, Building Momentum, and its impact on the MLSA's claim for pay parity between medical scientists and biochemists.  As the Minister stated, the MLSA is part of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  This means that it is bound by the terms of Building Momentum for the remainder of its lifetime.  Under this agreement, sectoral bargaining provides that long-standing and outstanding claims can be fully or partially resolved using funding provided under the agreement.  As advised, discussions have been ongoing for many months with the aim of finding a resolution to this matter.  Unfortunately, the sectoral bargaining pot available to the MLSA is not sufficient to resolve the issue in full.</p> <p> As an agreement could not be reached at local level, the MLSA was invited to attend a meeting of the public service agreement group on 31 March.  At that point the MLSA called off strike action which had been scheduled for late March or early April.  The suspension of the strike was welcomed by health management and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  On 31 of March, the public service agreement group agreed that the MLSA and health management should return to local engagement to attempt to find a solution to the matter.  All parties involved wanted to see a resolution to this matter and the parties were, therefore, given more time to find a solution.  New, alternative proposals were considered but unfortunately none could successfully resolve the matter.  As no agreement on resolving the claim could be reached at local level, the public service agreement group met again on 11 May to reconsider the MLSA's claim.  It was at this point that it recommended that the matter be immediately referred to the WRC and that industrial peace be maintained in the meantime.</p> <p> I reiterate the extremely valued role of medical scientists within the health system.  The Department is fully cognisant of the current recruitment challenges in the profession but, as stated, tangible campaigns and projects are under way to address the issue.  We acknowledge the medical scientists' claim for pay parity.  We acknowledge the significant impact of industrial action on patient care across the health system and we will continue to engage on the issue through the Labour Court.</p></speech>

They have come from the picket line to the D&aacute;il.  That is how democracy should be.  We are delighted to have their issues aired here.  I hope the debates will help MLSA members understand how the system works and better equip them to be able to argue against what they are hearing.</p><p>There is an idea in ecology of a keystone species, that is, a species that occupies a niche in the whole ecological system and when that species is damaged or removed it has profound effects on the entire environment and ecology.  Members of the keystone species of the health service are in the Chamber watching this debate.  If we fail to treat the scientific laboratory workers properly by failing to give them justice, fair play and equality, our health system will start to implode from the centre.  Removing any group of workers or impeding them from operating in the system has a profound effect on all of us, right across the board.  It is similar to the way the failure to retain psychiatric nurses in the Linn Dara CAMHS unit is having a profound effect on the most vulnerable in our society.  Behind the scenes these unsung heroes, whom we have all acknowledged, are absolutely essential.</p><p>I first became aware of the MLSA and the work it does several years ago during the CervicalCheck scandal.  I was hugely impressed by the evidence its members gave before the committee hearings into what happened in that crisis.  It is worth remembering, because it tells us a great deal about the role of such workers, how political decisions based on ideology have a profound and negative effect on people's lives.  In 2008, the MLSA and its members warned the State of the dangers of outsourcing the CervicalCheck programme on the basis of competitive lower costs.  The heartbreaking result of that political decision, which is obvious to all of us, affected many women.  What is less clear is that the result of that decision to contract out the testing capacity to the US also meant we lost university courses, qualified graduates and hundreds of skilled staff who had intended and hoped to work in our public health service.</p><p>The warnings of the MLSA and other workers on the front line of laboratory testing were ignored because of a political decision and philosophy.  In many ways this dispute for the past 21 years is similar in that we are ignoring warnings from front-line workers about what is happening at the heart of our health service.  We hear of great investments in the children's hospital, the national maternity hospital and the new testing facility at the Coombe.  The figures are in the billions of euro and are mentioned as proof of the seriousness with which the Minister and the State take the provision of services.  Who will work in these buildings?  Who will ensure these shiny new buildings operate and people get the services they need?  It will be workers, nurses and laboratory staff such as members of the MLSA.  Without them we would have only very expensive shells.  If we cannot retain and recruit workers and keep them in a public system, the chief goal of which is not profit but public service, it will not matter that we spend billions on buildings because we will not have workers to do the job.</p><p>The usual suspects tell us we cannot treat one group of workers differently from others in the health service.  No doubt we will hear commentators warn about the need to be prudent with State money.  I heard the same about nurses during their dispute some years ago.  We need to remember when one group of workers, such as nurses or MLSA staff, is disrespected and treated badly it is not a victory for prudent management of the State coffers.  It is not a win by saving the State purse a few shillings.  It is a defeat for all of us who rely on and need public services and a defeat for workers everywhere.</p><p>It is deeply ironic that this week we have heard so much talk about whether it is time to remove the cap of &euro;500,000 per year on top bankers' pay because it is restrictive.  The poor cr&eacute;at&uacute;rs must live on that much, yet we are being urged to be realistic when it comes to how we treat our public sector workers.  We need to retain the best banking talent, we are told.  I say we need to retain the best scientific talent.  I have read the Minister's remarks carefully and it is interesting that he mentioned the Building Momentum deal eight times.  However, he goes on to explain that within a particular section of that agreement, there is a mechanism for increasing pay by only 1%.  He also alluded to the fact the MLSA rejected that deal.  I am not surprised.  If it has had a claim of 8% for the past 20 years to bring its members' pay to parity and Building Momentum has a mechanism for only a 1% increase in pay, it is no surprise the MLSA rejected the deal.  The Minister cannot keep referring to the deal over and over again without recognising it will not go anywhere in settling this dispute.  That 98% of workers voted to take strike action is startling.  They did not do that lightly.  As the Minister of State outlined, they have called off their action again and again in order to facilitate talks.  This issue is going nowhere unless the Minister and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform sit at the table and try to find a solution.  The Minister said the money is in the coffers but he is restricted by Building Momentum.  In that case, he must find a way around those restrictions.</p><p>I will say a few words about the hopeful message in the Minister's remarks and his amendment regarding what will happen with the new testing centre at the Coombe and how it will provide a plan to address workforce resilience, development, training and all the rest of it.  I received a reply from the HSE to a parliamentary question yesterday which indicates that when this new building opens we will continue to rely on a back-up from a second provider for several years.  How many years that will be is not spelt out.  It does not say two years or ten.  We are still going to outsourcing CervicalCheck until we bring the service up to standard.  The Minister should not give false hope that the situation MLSA members are in will change because a new facility is to open in the Coombe.  That is not the case.</p><p>The Minister also mentioned the conflict in Ukraine twice.  When the scientists first faced this lack of parity 20 years ago there was a worse conflict taking place in Iraq.  What does that have to do with the price of beans?  I do not see why the Minister mentioned Ukraine.</p><p>The amendment also calls on the MLSA to call off its strike.  That is disgraceful.  Every Deputy with any self-respect and respect for these workers should vote against the Minister's amendment should it go to a vote tonight.  It is outrageous.</p><p>Victory for these workers will be a victory for all workers because it will mean we can build a decent health service in the future by correcting the historical wrongs done to workers which are having profound and negative impacts on all the key services on which we all rely.</p></speech>

I also thank the MLSA members in the Gallery for attending to hear what Teachta&iacute; D&aacute;la from the Opposition and the Government are saying about their workplace.  We again thank them for their continued work in their jobs.</p><p>I will cut to the chase.</p> <p>If there was an anomaly in Deputies' pay it would not have taken 20 years to fix.  It would have taken 20 minutes.  Let us be honest that Deputies are overpaid and if this situation had involved them it would have been fixed.  There are pay anomalies across the board in the public sector involving teachers, FEMPI cuts, workers in section 56 and 59 organisations and school secretaries.  There are different sets of rules.</p> <p> I want to go back to the historical context for this issue.  It is 21 years since the recommendation was made.  Since then there have been five general elections, numerous health Ministers, a financial crisis and a pandemic.  The pandemic changed everything about public health.  Medical scientists were and continue to be at the forefront of public health.  They have been waiting in the wings for this issue of pay parity to be fixed.  It is ludicrous.  It is absolutely shambolic that medical laboratory scientists have been on the picket line in the past two weeks.  It is ludicrous.  Think about it.  They are the very people who have been trying to save people.  They are looking for a very small pay increase.  The health budget is approximately &euro;22 billion.  I am guessing that if tomorrow they were given the 8% they seek it would be an absolute fraction of this.  I guess it would cost less than &euro;7 million or &euro;8 million per year.  It does not make sense.</p> <p> With regard to the retention and recruitment of staff there is an existential crisis in the health service.  As politicians we see it on a daily basis.  Health staff are burned out.  They love their jobs and they are absolutely passionate about their work but they tell us and their colleagues that at present the circumstances they are in are extremely difficult.  Some are leaving the country because they are burned out.  This is not sustainable.  It will have an effect not only on the health service but on the workers who keep it going.  I appeal to the Minister and other Ministers present to resolve this issue and give these workers the 8% increase they deserve.</p></speech>

Is ag filleadh ar pholasa&iacute; Fhianna F&aacute;il a bhris an c&oacute;ras tith&iacute;ochta at&aacute; an Rialtas seo agus ba ch&oacute;ir deireadh a chur leis.  We have had three reports in recent weeks that highlight in the sharpest way the failure of the Minister and the Government to get to grips with the housing crisis.  Extortionate rents continue to soar with the number of rental properties now at an all-time low.  Off-the-wall house prices have increased again beyond the reach of ordinary workers and families.  The scourge of homelessness is returning to the shameful pre-Covid-19 levels.  We now hear the Minister's targets for housing are under serious threat due to spiralling construction costs.  By any objective measure the Minister's approach is failing and he is failing spectacularly.  The housing crisis being created by Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael is defining the life of an entire generation.  On the Minister's watch things have gone from bad to worse.  Is it any wonder that newspapers now refer to the housing crisis as a decade of shame?</p><p>Amid this social catastrophe what do we get from the Minister with responsibility for housing?  Is it a ban on rent increases and evictions?  No.  Is it a serious ramping up of direct delivery of genuinely affordable homes?  No.  Is it an initiative to cut rents?  Not on the Minister's watch.  What we get instead is a bonkers scheme whereby he will gift &euro;450 million of taxpayers' money to developers to build apartments with no reduction in the prices that will be charged to home owners.  It is absolutely off the wall.  The Minister will pay these developers out of the public purse to build apartments that only those earning the highest salaries will be able to afford.  The question needs to be asked again as to what planet the Minister is living on with this type of scheme.</p><p>It gets worse because the Minister is not being entirely honest about his madcap plan.  Last week in the D&aacute;il he quoted purchase prices of &euro;250,000 for the apartments to be delivered under the scheme.  According to an unpublished document circulated between developers and the Housing Agency, the anticipated open market value of a one-bed apartment is &euro;320,000, a two-bed apartment is &euro;390,000 and a three-bed apartment is &euro;445,000.  Where is the Minister getting the &euro;250,000 he spoke about in the D&aacute;il last week?  All he has to do is take a look at <i>daft.ie</i>.  Apartments for sale in the city of Dublin command average prices of between &euro;400,000 and &euro;500,000.  This is on the Minister's watch.</p><p>Why is the Minister raising the hopes of people looking to buy a home when he knows his scheme will only dash these hopes once again?  The truth is his scheme will not deliver affordable housing for people.  Is this not the truth?  The Minister knows it and we know it.  Why does he not tell the people straight?  It is straight from the old Fianna F&aacute;il playbook that destroyed the housing system at the start when it was previously in government.  It is big handouts to developers and home ownership only for those who are the wealthiest.  I urge the Minister to come to his senses and scrap this scheme.  I am asking him instead to invest the &euro;450 million to fund local authorities and approved housing bodies to deliver affordable homes that ordinary families and workers can buy.</p></speech>

Our thoughts are with their families and their communities.</p>  <p>  Maidir leis ann gceist shonrach tith&iacute;ochta a thagair an Teachta d&oacute;, t&aacute; an plean is l&aacute;idre agus is t&aacute;bhachta&iacute; n&aacute; riamh de &euro;4 billi&uacute;n ann d'infheist&iacute;ocht ar thith&iacute;ocht s&oacute;isialta agus ar thith&iacute;ocht inacmhainne freisin.

Is &eacute; an plean at&aacute; ag Sinn F&eacute;in n&aacute; a bheith in aghaidh gach rud.  The Government has a housing plan that is working.  It has &euro;4 billion of investment and &euro;1.2 billion per annum more than Sinn F&eacute;in proposed in its 16-page policy document, eight pages of which are pictures of cups of coffee and its spokesperson on housing.  We are very serious about increasing supply and supply is increasing.  There are affordability issues no question.  This is why we passed the Affordable Housing Act, the most comprehensive legislation on affordability that has ever come before the House.  Sinn F&eacute;in supported it and did not come up with alternatives to it.  There are a number of measures within it, particularly on the delivery of affordable housing through local authorities, which we are doing.  This year we will see homes sold at &euro;166,000 and upwards throughout the country.  For people stuck in the rental and affordability trap we will open the first home shared equity scheme.</p> <p>It will help thousands of young, and not so young, people bridge the gap between the finance they have and the finance they need by the State taking an equity stake, not by getting a second mortgage as Sinn F&eacute;in and its housing spokesperson claimed last year.  Sinn F&eacute;in supported the Act and I welcome that.  It is about supply and activating dormant planning permissions that exist.  The Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe cities fund is a targeted measure to ensure people can own apartments in the five major cities in the country on an open book basis where the support goes to the purchaser, not the developer.  Sinn F&eacute;in knows this but it does not suit its narrative, which is to oppose measures on every issue and say the measures are not working.  We have had the highest number of commencements in the year to March 2022 than there has been since 2007.  We also have had the highest number of first-time buyer mortgages in the 12 months to March 2022 than there has been since 2007.</p> <p> We will support people in owning their own homes because we believe in homeownership.  While doing that, we are also delivering more social homes this year than have ever been delivered before, in any year since the foundation of the State.  We are doing that even though the Deputy and his colleagues across the Twenty-six Counties continue repeatedly to object and cause delays.</p></speech>

Here are a couple of home truths.  He has been in the Department for a couple of years.  House prices are going through the roof.  Entire generations have been locked out of homeownership under his watch.  Rents are spiralling out of control.  They are increasing dramatically in many counties, which means people are becoming homeless.  Homelessness is nearly back at record levels.  That is the Minister's plan and it is not working.</p>  <p>  I have the confidential document to hand about Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe that he has not been published.  It is not about reducing the market value for the buyers.  The cost of a three-bedroom apartment is to be &euro;445,000.  What planet is the Minister living on?  Which families, workers and ordinary people can afford that amount?  To whom is the cheque written to?  It is written to the developers, to the amount of &euro;144,000.  It is straight out of the Fianna F&aacute;il playbook during the times of the Galway tent.  We know who the plans are working for.  They are not working for ordinary families and workers.  They are not working for renters or the generation who are locked out of homeownership.  What the Minister needs to do is come to his senses, scrap that plan, invest the &euro;450 million into local authorities, approved housing schemes, and build affordable homes for workers and families.</p></speech>

It is clear gun violence in the US is out of control, and there is ever-diminishing hope it will lead to much-needed change.</p>  <p>  Last week, a family once again had to resort to telling their story to RT&Eacute; to vindicate the constitutional right of their children to an education.  When our leader, Deputy Bacik, raised it with the Taoiseach last Wednesday, he apologised to the family.  We are glad the Milne family have now been given a commitment of local school places.  However, it should never have come to this.  For years, the Milne family had to fight for educational access.  Ryan and Kyle Milne have lost six years of schooling.  Their mother, Gillian, said, "We've basically been punished for having children with special needs.  You feel almost to blame.  Did we not fight hard enough?"  No parent should have to say those words.  No parent should have to put themselves in that position of opening up their private lives just to get access to education for their child.</p>  <p>  We on the Opposition benches are constantly told that it is not for the want of resources or Government action that there is more than &euro;2 billion in the education budget for complex needs but there are still many outstanding issues that must be addressed.  The Minister will issue section 37A notices and open special classes, but we still do not have all the information.  Many families throughout the country are still waiting for a place.  There is an acute shortage of places everywhere in this country.  Only last night, our spokesperson, Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, and Councillor John Walsh met with parents to discuss the acute shortage of secondary school places for children with autism in Dublin 15.  Last week, the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, was unable to reveal how many children are waiting on a place.  We need to know how many are waiting.  Schools throughout the country are still waiting on their special needs assistant, SNA, allocation for next year.</p>  <p>  These are complex issues that involve huge public investment.  Clearly, it is a problem where there is not sufficient planning for special class places.  The legislative framework is also clearly out of date.  The Government and the Minister have said they are reviewing the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs, EPSEN, Act and the Education Act.  In his article yesterday, Fergus Finlay rightly highlighted that for 17 years, key EPSEN provisions have not commenced, including the granting of individual educational plans.  A review at this stage will not help parents who are struggling now.  It will not address the right of children with additional needs to an education.  We know the law must be updated, but that will take time, and that proper planning can address these issues.  We know the Department has nearly all the information it needs to determine where places are required.</p>  <p>  What I want from the Minister today is clarification.  How many children are waiting on a special school place?  Will he provide the numbers with a regional breakdown?  We are now at the end of the school year.  Will he guarantee that every child will be guaranteed a special school place for the next school year?  Will the Minister commence the EPSEN Act and fast-track a review?</p></speech>

I know from working with him in my constituency, Dublin Fingal, that it is a very important issue to him and, indeed, all Members so that we make sure we provide special education places and supports for those kids who need it.  That is why the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, has been so vociferous in her work to ensure we increase the number of available school places.</p>  <p>  This year, the Department of Education will spend &euro;2 billion, which is more than 25% of the Department's budget, on providing additional teaching and care supports for children with special needs, and rightly so.  It remains an absolute key objective within Government.  We have 287 additional special classes with 1,700 new places provided for in 2022-2023.</p>  <p>  On the issue involving the Milne family, I agree with the Deputy that no one wants parents to have to raise those issues publicly.  The Minister of State is in constant contact with the family.  She has met with them and continues to keep them briefed.  This evening, she will meet a group of families in the Dublin 15 area about their concerns.  This is a real priority for us.</p>  <p>  There are an additional 1,665 SNAs in place to provide supports for children with special needs.  That brings the total number of SNAs to more than 19,000.  As our population grows, we will need more, which is something the Government continues to prioritise.</p> <p>There are 980 new teaching posts in special education and three new special schools have been opened in Cork and Dublin.  That is important.  Over &euro;40 million has been made available to fund the summer education programme for pupils with complex special educational needs.  We manage the numbers on waiting lists and assess how many people in each area need the supports that they get through our network of special educational needs organisers, SENOs.  The work on the SNA allocation for each specific area will be completed by the end of this month.  I fully understand why the Deputy is asking for numbers.  The numbers change on a daily basis as kids enter the education system.  The Deputy will be aware of that.  The Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, and the Department of Education are focused on continuing to improve the services there.  Many of the special educational needs that people have are complex.  Each child needs to be assessed individually, as the Deputy knows.  I assure the Deputy that we will continue to prioritise the issue.  The work on the SNA allocation will be concluded by the end of this month.  We should be in a position to be able to give more details once that work is concluded.</p></speech>

We need figures that are as accurate as possible on an ongoing basis.  We do not know how the Department will adequately enforce section 37a notices to ensure that every child who needs a place is granted one.  An AsIAm report showed that one quarter of parents of children with autism feel that they do not have an appropriate school place.  While we wait for a review, I also wish to ask the Minister whether the Special Educational Needs Act 2004, the EPSEN Act, will finally be commenced.  It is a key question.</p>  <p>  We also raised the delay in announcing SNA allocations last week.  The Minister has said that that work will be completed by the end of this month.  It should have been completed by the end of last month, if not earlier, as it has been in previous years.  It is extraordinarily disruptive for SNAs, principals and parents that it is delayed to the end of this month.  It really disrupts their ability to plan for next year.  The Minister stated it will happen by the end of this month.  We will have to take him on his word.  We need definitive dates and ongoing planning.  We need to know how many special school places are required on a regional basis.</p></speech>

It is important that we are able to raise matters as important as this here today.  The EPSEN Act review group met yesterday evening.  The group will commence its work on this and will report to the Minister within a matter of months.  The Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, will keep the House advised on that.</p>  <p>  On the specific numbers, the number of children who require supports is recorded on a regional basis and a per-county basis.  We could provide the Deputy with a figure today.  However, today's figure will change tomorrow.  It is important that we have the supports in place to make sure that kids are not waiting any longer than they need to to get the supports that they require and deserve.  Going back to what I have said previously, looking back over the last 15 years and the improvements made in the mainstreaming of special education both at primary and secondary levels, we have made vast strides in that space and we continue to do so.  It is a real priority within the Government's objectives on education.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-25a.125" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1482" speakername="Se&aacute;n Canney" time="12:22:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022052500022#U00400"><p>First, I want to associate myself with the remarks made on the atrocity that happened in Texas.</p>  <p>  I wish to raise an issue in relation to farmers.  Last Monday at 7 p.m., I met with over 300 farmers at an event organised by the Galway Irish Farmers' Association, IFA, in my own parish in Corofin.  It was organised by Mr. Stephen Canavan, chairman of the Galway IFA.  The mood of farmers at the event was one of genuine concern and fear for the future of farming as a result of the unprecedented increase in input costs, such as that of fertiliser, feedstuff and fuel.  Farmers are also aware that they have no control over the price they will get for their products at the end of the day.  They are price takers.  The feeling among farmers is that they are extremely concerned that they have to endure these increasing costs.  They are worried.  There is an acknowledgement that supports have been provided by the Government and some of these supports have been very welcome.  However, there is a delay in the rolling out of the silage support scheme, which is causing farmers to be stressed.  One of the questions that at least 15 farmers asked me last night was where they apply for the scheme and what criteria apply.  There seems to be no information available to them.  They also raised the issue of the European crisis reserve fund.  There is no clarity and farmers have told me that it is just another announcement without money actually being provided.  The message from farmers is that there is a crisis.</p>  <p>  We are almost finished the month of May, which is the best growing season for grass.  What is happening is that farmers have bought their fertiliser and inputs.  Credit is very tight for all involved.  Effectively, farmers are not seeing the result of these supports coming to them.  It is important that farmers get that support now.  Farmers need the support to come directly to them.  This is an issue that will affect every citizen in the country, because farming is all about food production.  If we cannot produce the food efficiently and make it available, everybody will be affected by it.  If there is a shortage of food at the end of the day, if we do not have the feedstuff to feed our stock at the end of the year, what will happen?  What will farmers do?  I have met farmers who have not bought any fertiliser this year.  They are relying on nature to grow grass for them to feed their stock.  What will happen next winter?  I am not so sure.  It is a crisis.  It is okay to have announcements.  However, we need to take effective action and ensure there is clarity for farmers so they know where they are going to get the money, and when they will get it.  The exceptional temporary support scheme was announced last week which talks about bringing money forward from Europe to pay it out.  However, effectively, payments will not be made until next year.  Farmers and agriculture contractors cannot wait that long.</p></speech>

I can assure the Deputy that protecting farm family incomes is a priority of Government.  Close to &euro;10 billion in total, between EU and Exchequer funding, will support around 120,000 farm families over the next CAP period between 2023 and 2027.  We have a farming and food sector that we should be proud of.  It is an indigenous business and supports family businesses.  We must ensure that continues, and it will.  Budget 2022 provided &euro;1.9 billion for the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  That is in addition to almost &euro;1.2 billion in EU funded direct payments received annually.  The Deputy is absolutely right.  There is no question that the war in Ukraine has exacerbated issues for farmers.  The Deputy mentioned the cost of fertiliser.  Farmers were previously paying between &euro;250 and &euro;300 per tonne of fertiliser.  That cost is upwards of &euro;1,000 per tonne now.  We are acutely aware of the impact that those cost increases have on our farmers and indeed our farming community.</p>  <p>  The Deputy mentioned certain announcements.  We will see these announcements being implemented.  I engage with farmers in the horticulture sector in my own area of north Dublin on a regular basis.  They require support.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine has announced a number of measures amounting to around &euro;35 million in very targeted supports, including &euro;20 million in two packages to the pig sector worth up to &euro;90,000 per farm family, &euro;12 million for the tillage sector and an initial &euro;3 million for the horticultural sector.  I absolutely recognise the difficulties that our farming families and communities have.  The Government will continue to support them.  We want to ensure that the close relationship between farming organisations and the Government remains and that we work very closely together through this period to see us through the other side of it.  The jobs that are supported in this sector are crucially important for our regions and for rural Ireland, in particular.  To be fair to the Government, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine is engaging on the issue and was in Brussels earlier this week for a meeting of agriculture ministers.  He has been very open and has been bringing forward targeted schemes.  We are not saying that those schemes will initially resolve all of the issues there, but we are open to looking at other areas where we can help.  That is why the engagement between the farming organisations, the sector, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and Government is crucially important.  I assure the Deputy that we will continue to do that.  I know the Deputy has been a very strong advocate on behalf of our farming communities and organisations.</p>  <p>  Officials from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine are continuing to engage with officials from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on funding of the fodder scheme, for argument's sake.  We envisage the terms and conditions of the scheme being finalised shortly.  It will then be published and rolled out.</p></speech>

Farmers have the problem that the announcements have been made over recent months but the call for the funding and the application process is still not in place and this is the biggest concern they have.  In looking forward to the end of the year, we need to ensure as a matter of urgency that we have a detailed inventory on what fertiliser, feedstocks and fuel are in this country.</p>  <p>  Funding is required to support the growing of catch crops and the spreading of lime, which is a replacement fertiliser and is a great deal cheaper, but incentives are needed to do that.  Excise duty on agri-diesel and liquid petroleum gas, LPG, for farm relief use should be brought into place.  We should also reduce the VAT rate for agri-contractors.  We have done that for the hospitality sector and it is important we also do it for the agri-sector.  Agri-contractors do not get any credit from Revenue when they are carrying out their work and have to pay over the VAT when they get it.  We therefore need to give that flexibility and margin these contractors need, in the interests of food production and of agriculture.  This is an emergency we need to deal with now, not in September and October.  We need to ensure money is injected into the farmers&rsquo; pockets now and not to leave it until the end of the year.</p></speech>

I wish to give the Deputy the comfort that the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, is meeting and continues to meet regularly with stakeholders to discuss the impacts, particularly of the Ukraine crisis and the increases in costs associated with that.  He has tasked a national fodder and food security committee with the preparation of a response to the emerging crisis in feed fodder, fertiliser and other inputs.  He is developing contingency plans and advice to assist farmers in managing their farm enterprises.  Within the Department the Minister has also established a rapid response team because when we announce packages of support, we obviously want to see them rolled out without delay.  That is happening.  Farmers can also plan on the basis of knowing what schemes are there.  Teagasc has been doing a great deal of work directly on the ground with farms across all sectors to assist where we can.</p>  <p>  I assure the Deputy of the paramount importance of the agriculture, farming and horticulture sectors to us to support jobs, farm incomes, our rural communities and our regions.  We will continue to do that.  I encourage the farming organisations to continue their very constructive engagement with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine on this issue.</p></speech>

The housing crisis is worsening and immediate emergency measures are required to prevent more and more families from becoming homeless, to assist those who have already become homeless, and to give our Irish citizens a fair chance at homeownership.</p><p>The crisis in Tipperary is deepening, and despite the efforts of Tipperary County Council, which I salute, to meet its housing targets, these measures are simply insufficient to deal with the scale of the problem.  Today, just nine properties are listed on <i>daft.ie</i>as being available in the for-rent category in the entire county of Tipperary.  This is a huge county from Carrick-on-Suir right up to Lorrha with a population of 159,000 people.  In the south of the county, just three properties are available to rent with nothing larger than two-bedroom apartments available for &euro;1,000.  It is just desperate.</p><p>Housing is now beyond the reach of most Irish people and this will have a very serious long-term impact on Ireland&rsquo;s social fabric.  Tipperary County Council&rsquo;s recent analysis of household affordability found that 21.2% of households in Tipperary are experiencing affordability issues in keeping a roof over their heads, while Tipperary has not been included in the Housing for All plan to build affordable houses on State-owned land between now and 2026.  This is an awful situation.</p><p>A shocking new report now confirms that first-time buyers will now need an income of &euro;77,000 to buy a home, which is almost &euro;30,000 above the average national wage.  This means the housing market is closed to the majority of first-time buyers in Ireland.  The report also shows that those first-time buyers who can get a mortgage approval, mainly couples, are drawing down an average of &euro;254,000 on new homes, which is &euro;17,000 above the &euro;237,000 figure at the height of the boom.  Something is badly wrong here.</p><p>This means the Government&rsquo;s housing policy is trapping even those who can get onto the housing ladder in a mountain of debt that will take a lifetime to repay.  The Government&rsquo;s housing policies are a catastrophic mess and the only winners are the banks and the multinational-type developers and investment funds.  Ireland housing problems are rooted in the high cost of construction, which has driven up our sale and rental prices and is compounded by lack of supply and a growing population.</p><p>The Government&rsquo;s plans to give between &euro;120,000 and &euro;144,000 per apartment to large multinational developers is outright insanity in our and my opinion.  The move will only add to the costs and will drive up the unaffordability gap that is already there for everyone.  This is a crazy and daft idea.</p></speech>

That is one aspect of how we deal with affordability.</p>  <p>  The second one, which is open to all 31 local authorities in the Republic of Ireland, is the First Home shared equity scheme.  I referred to this earlier and I will launch this scheme on 1 July of this year.  This will be a game changer for thousands of young and not-so-young people who heretofore were not able to buy their own home.  This will bridge the gap between the finance they have and the finance they need by the State taking an equity in that.  That will be available to potential homeowners in Tipperary and, I inform Deputy Healy Rae, in Kerry.</p>  <p>  I also refer to what we are doing in respect to vacancy.  The Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe towns and villages scheme, which we will launch shortly, will provide assistance to people to take vacant property that is in our main streets, right through Tipperary, Kerry and across this country, to be able to bring vacant properties back into use and to enable people to buy them.  We will provide support for those homes to be renovated on the basis that they are bought by owner-occupiers, because I believe in homeownership.</p>  <p>  I also believe in providing social homes for people who need them.  That is why this year we will provide 9,000 new-build social homes.  This will be the highest number of such new builds in any year since the foundation of the State.  I thank the Deputy for his support for the Affordable Housing Act, and the plan is taking hold now.  Unlike what others will say, which is that this situation can be resolved overnight, it cannot and the people know that too.  We are making progress, however, in that space.  We have seen approximately 5,700 commencements on new homes in the first quarter of this year.  This is the highest amount since 2011.  We have also seen more than 46,000 homes purchased to February 2022.  There are still issues and I am not saying the situation is resolved - nothing close to it - but we have the most targeted plan to deliver affordable, social homes, tackle vacancy and drive down homelessness throughout this country that any government has brought forward.</p></speech>

He talks the good talk but we were told that we are out of that plan.  The catastrophic dysfunction means that all small builders are not even able now to tender for building houses that are bound to fixed-price contracts.  This is just not happening and they have given up the ghost because they cannot get prices from suppliers.</p> <p>Before the most recent general election, the Fianna F&aacute;il leader and now Taoiseach promised that under his party in government, councils would be given the tools to deal with this, but those tools have not been given.  The Government talks the talk but that is all.  I will bring the Minister to any main street in any town in Tipperary tomorrow and show him the situation.  There is a song called "It's a Long Way to Tipperary", but we will have a long good day in Tipperary and he will see the dereliction and the vacant properties.  We are hearing about this being dealt with for 15 years but it has not happened.  The Minister will be a hero if he gets it going and gets those places restored.  In doing so, he will do two things: he will provide accommodation for Irish people and he will create living town centres, which is very important.</p> <p> The Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland told Deputies today that the cost of delivering a three-bedroom semi-detached home on a new estate was &euro;330,000 in 2016 and had risen to &euro;371,000 in 2020.

I have been all across the country, including to Waterford with the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, where 72 apartments have been built in St. Joseph's House, a converted old school and convent, and are now providing permanent homes for people.  I was in Crumlin earlier this week with colleagues, where 103 one-bedroom new-build apartments for seniors are being provided.  New builds are happening but it will take time to feel the effect.  There is no question about that.</p>  <p>  In Tipperary, there is a very strong pipeline for the delivery of social homes.  I commend the director of services for housing in Tipperary, to whom I spoke last week, on the work being done there, not only in providing homes for those who already are on the social housing list but also in providing assistance in response to the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine.  I look forward to meeting the Deputy in Tipperary tomorrow.  Yes, it will be a long day.  I look forward to him accompanying me and my being able to talk directly to people in the council.  To be very clear, the affordable housing fund is open to all local authorities to make applications.</p></speech>

They have waited and waited for a just scheme - one that is fit for purpose and that allows them to start to rebuild their lives.  The defective concrete blocks grant scheme, which has been in operation since 2020, has, by the Minister's own admission, fallen far short of what is required.  It is almost a year since thousands of people came to the street outside this building to protest and appeal for justice and fairness.  They should not have to do that again.</p>  <p>  I know the Minister is in discussion with representatives of the homeowners.  When will he publish the legislation for the updated scheme?  Will he ensure there is proper scrutiny of it, including pre-legislative scrutiny?  Will the scheme deliver genuine, 100% redress for these families?</p></speech>

I have met with homeowners from Donegal, Mayo and other affected counties on a regular basis and my team continues to engage with them.  The Bill to address this issue is in its final stage of preparation and I intend to bring it to the Government very shortly.  I asked all parties in the D&aacute;il, including the Deputy's party, to make submissions.  I wrote a detailed letter to Sinn F&eacute;in asking for Deputies' input into the scheme.  Even though the party's housing spokesperson said publicly that he would respond in detail, we never received a response.  Deputy Gould can shake his head but it is a fact.</p>  <p>  We have engaged directly with homeowners on the matter.  What I am interested in is helping people to get their homes and their lives fixed.  The scheme we bring forward will be a substantial improvement on the scheme that was in place from January or February 2020.  I expect the legislation to come to the Government very soon.  I will be seeking the co-operation of all parties across the House to make sure the Bill is passed before the summer recess in order that there be no further delays.</p></speech>

When I was a councillor, I worked to have an objective included in the county development plan calling for the delivery of public swimming pools, ideally including one in Balbriggan and another in Swords.  Unfortunately, Swords has the unenviable title of being the largest town in Ireland without a primary care centre, a rail link or, indeed, a public swimming pool.  What is the Government doing to drive the delivery of public swimming pools in areas like Swords, Balbriggan and elsewhere in the country where they are badly needed?</p></speech>

The town has now grown to the size of a city and it is a fantastic community.  In both Swords and Balbriggan, there are two very strong campaigns in place for municipal pools.  My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, recently launched a new initiative in the Donabate area providing for a temporary pop-up pool, as is happening elsewhere.  Of course communities want to see permanent facilities in place.  I will continue to advocate for that on behalf of the residents of Dublin Fingal and people right across the country.</p></speech>

The scheme is designed to cater for people in the highest income brackets - the top 15%, according to analysis by the <i>Business Post</i>.  Will the Minister tell us whether the provision of &euro;450 million in State subsidies for developers complies with European Union state aid rules?  Has the Government applied to the European Commission for an exemption to the state aid rules in respect of the scheme?  Why has he announced and launched the plan without an exemption being in place?</p></speech>

It is about activating dormant, inactivated planning permissions.  We want to see good, compact urban growth in our five major cities.  The difference is we are doing something about it.  What I want to see in this space is that we target the delivery of 5,000 apartments for homeowners.</p></speech>

The purpose of the scheme is to support people into home ownership.  That support goes directly to the homeowner and can be used in conjunction with the affordability measures, which, by the way, the Social Democrats voted against.

The use of test cases to determine the employment status of large groups of workers by the Social Welfare Appeals Office has facilitated this abuse.  There is no legal basis for categorising employment status purely based on occupation.  We are now reaching the end of the line for the denials by the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, that test cases are being used by the Social Welfare Appeals Office.  It is reported in the <i>Irish Examiner</i>today that a musician has refused to attend his appeal with the office on the basis that it uses test cases.  Instead, he will take a case to the Circuit Court.  It is similarly reported that an RT&Eacute; worker will do likewise.  Can we now have an admission by the Government and the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, that test cases have been used by the Social Welfare Appeals Office, and a commitment to end their use?</p></speech>

In both north Wexford and south Wexford, we do not have a full complement of staff in CAMHS.  In recent weeks, as I have raised in the House before, the clinical nurse specialist, who has 13 years' service, moved to the Wexford north service.  There was no proper handover and no transfer of his computer or any of the other things he requires.  I had a very distressing telephone call this morning from the mother of a patient with anorexia who cannot be seen because of there being no handover, which meant the clinical nurse specialist has no files.  A total of 400 patients in north Wexford CAMHS were placed with one clinical specialist while two acting clinical nurse specialists were sent to south Wexford CAMHS, where there are 170 patients.  If this is the extent of the planning in CAMHS and the HSE, it is no wonder there is a recruitment and retention problem.  Can the Minister of State tell me when this patient with anorexia will be seen?</p></speech>

As I said to her then, the HSE manages operational issues.  It is not unusual for staff in multidisciplinary teams to be moved into different areas, whether it is from Cork south Lee to Cork north Lee, or from south Wexford to north Wexford.  I am not able to comment on the young girl in question but if the Deputy send me on the details, I will look at them.</p></speech>

We do not have a single long-stay bed in the entire county, which extends from Carrick-on-Suir up to Lorrha.  A Vision for Change promised so much.  We lost St. Michael's psychiatric unit, St. Luke's Psychiatric Hospital and much else.  Kilkenny hospital is full and cannot accommodate patients from south Tipperary while those from north Tipperary have to go elsewhere.  I ask the Minister of State for an update on the crisis.  We need long-stay beds for people who are down on their luck and at times down, and who, for different reasons, are suffering ill health and mental illness and need to be supported.  We do not have the services.</p></speech>

Many young people are suffering with psychosis.  We see it especially among those aged between 18 and 25.  There are strong links between the consumption of cannabis and psychosis.  We have several very good teams on the ground.  We have fantastic pilot programmes under way in Cork and Sligo and I hope to extend them.  A bed capacity review is under way and I am due to have the report by next week.  It has been promised for a while.

That followed a consultation period during which 900 submissions were received.  All of the important State and non-governmental organisations were in agreement that trawling within six miles of the coast was unsustainable on every level - in terms of biodiversity, the destruction of sprat and sustainable fishing.  Unfortunately, on one aspect the High Court found that the Government was wrong.  That was in regard to the consultation process.  Since then, this case has gone on and on.  We have had an appeal, delays and no announcement from the Government.  The important point is that it is totally unsustainable for vessels over 18 m to continue fishing unsustainably in different seasons, notwithstanding that we have declared a biodiversity crisis.

There have been regular reports of delays for passengers going through security screening, which have sometimes resulted in them missing their flights.  Over the weekend, there were worrying reports about the airport failing the European Aviation Safety Agency audit and last night, we saw reports on social media of a brawl in the departure lounge.  I know staff on the ground are doing their best in difficult circumstances but we were promised by the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, that 300 new staff would be employed by the end of June.  Will the Minister request an update from the DAA?  Will he engage with it about the management of the airport?</p></speech>

I know many of the people who work there directly and there is no question that they do a very good job.  I absolutely condemn the thuggish behaviour that happened in Dublin Airport last night.  I commend the Garda resources and airport police who had to respond to it on the work they have done.  I know the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, has been holding regular and ongoing briefings with the CEO of the DAA and other senior DAA staff.  Recruitment and training of approximately 200 new security staff are under way.  That is needed.  There is no question that Dublin Airport needs to make sure it has the capacity to ensure that passengers arriving or leaving the airport are able to do so in a prompt manner.  In terms of the importance of Dublin Airport for our country, 3% of GNP comes from the airport campus.  The airport provides some 20,000 direct jobs and 114,000 indirect jobs.  That is without mentioning the importance of the connectivity issues.   To be fair, the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, has been in regular contact with the DAA and is driving it forward on its recruitment campaign for new staff to increase capacity.</p></speech>

We seek that within the HDNA.  The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, and I have worked directly on this.  We have five specific designs in place.

Despite representations and interventions by occupational therapists, physiotherapists and a medical social worker, the response from the local authority to date has been that there are no properties available but that the family qualifies for homeless housing assistance payment, HAP.  This family is not homeless.  Tragic events have resulted in a long-term medical need that requires adapted housing.  The reality now is that a family is separated by the loss of a parent from the family home.  Mr. Murray is missing out on proper recovery from his stroke.  His recovery is stalling because the nursing home cannot provide the therapies he urgently needs.  I ask the Minister to intervene in this case.  Mr. Murray wants to go home.

We have approximately 127 special schools.  There is a progressive disability network and I know the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, has been working intensely with stakeholders on that.  It is an issue in special schools.  We need to make sure that children have adequate speech and occupational therapists and all of the professionals they require.  I am working very closely with the Minister of State.  If the Deputy lets me know the details of a particular case, I will liaise with the Minister of State on it.</p></speech>

That means that 8% of providers have not signed up to it.  We do not know how many childcare places those 8% represent.  It means that many are forcing parents to pay increased fees.  Some in my constituency have nowhere else to go.  It is the only childcare provider in the area.  Some working parents are paying an extra &euro;500 a month.  Can we establish how many childcare places 8% of providers represent?  What will we do to alleviate the hardship for parents who are being forced into this situation when we do not have a proper universal childcare system?</p></speech>

As she is aware, a new funding model, or core funding, was adopted by the Government in December and will be in place from September.  The purpose is to support quality provision, to improve pay and conditions for staff and to manage fees.  As part of that core funding, about &euro;221 million was provided to the sector.  A transition fund is in place between 2 May and 31 August.  This will be paid to all participating providers to ensure no increase in parental fees from the September 2021 rates.  Some 92% of early learning and care and school age childcare providers have agreed to operate a freeze on parental fees by coming into the contract under the transition fund, which is effective between 2 May and 31 August.  I will ask the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, to update the Deputy directly.</p></speech>

An important part of that is the installation of electric vehicle charging points across different parts of Ireland.  A specific fund has been set up, the electric vehicle public charging point fund, for local authorities to avail of to install these electric vehicle charging points.  I was astonished to learn, in response to a parliamentary question I tabled to the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, that Cork County Council has installed no electric chargers under this fund and it has applied for none.  It will be an important part of our future, particularly for peripheral areas such as peninsulas that rely heavily on tourism.

The provision of homes is dependent on us having the requisite services in place.  I have worked directly with Irish Water on that.  For the first time, we have published a capacity register that covers every town, village and city across the country, so we can clearly see the capacity in each area.  We have a &euro;6 billion capital plan between now and 2026 for Irish Water to deliver the water infrastructure that we require.  The Government has, through the Housing for All plan, asked utilities to focus on ensuring we are able to raise the housing targets that we have set.  That is crucially important.  That is regularly reiterated to them.  We work with our partners in the utilities to ensure that is done.  We have seen some improvements on the water side over the last months.</p></speech>

It is a good, progressive step.  There is a major anomaly in what the Government has done previously compared with now.  I do not think it has the stomach to tackle drug use in Ireland.  The citizens' assembly on drug use has been delayed, nearly two years into the term of this Government, which is incredible.  I do not get a sense of urgency or that this is an important issue.  At the same time, people are dying because of the failed policy relating to drug use in Ireland.  Somebody should say that it has failed.</p></speech>

On 14 January, &euro;815,000 of recurring funding was announced for a HSE initiative to address harm associated with the use of cocaine and crack cocaine.  The Deputy brought those emerging trends to our attention.  At all times, the resources and funding are there to work with all stakeholders to address these issues.  Two citizens' assemblies are ongoing and work is happening to enable a citizens' assembly on the use of drugs.  I suspect that it will be completed early in the new year.</p></speech>

I fought for funding and we were told by the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, that funding would be provided for a ferry service while the cable car was being repaired.  The devil is in the detail.  The ferry service that the Minister provided funding for only runs on three days a week.  On top of this, it only runs for two hours a day, leaving islanders and landowners on the island with little time to look after their cattle or to get to a clinic or to do shopping in Castletownbere and back again.  I said at the beginning that the Department should have sat down with the local authority to draw up a plan, but all I got in the D&aacute;il was one person saying one thing and another person saying another.  The people of Dursey Island and Castletownbere have been treated disgracefully by this Government, which has funded a three-day ferry service, when they need a proper seven-day ferry service and a cargo ferry service.  Will the Minister sit down with the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, and get funding for a full, seven-day, temporary ferry service for the people of Dursey Island and Castletownbere?</p></speech>

Tabor House sent a letter to the HSE in 2019 and while there has been a response, it was not the letter that we want, namely, a letter of promise that the HSE will fund the day-to-day running of the centre, which is about &euro;284,000 a year.  It has the plan, the building and everything in place bar this letter of promise.  Imagine the difference it would make to families and those in broken homes to be able to deal with 48 women a year in secondary addiction.  It is a matter of urgency that this letter is provided as soon as possible so that Tabor House can give it to the local authority and the funding can be released.</p></speech>

It is vital that we examine all possible approaches to deal with this issue.  Transport is particularly dependent on imported fuels.  What plans does the Government have to increase the use of biodiesel, biomethane and ethanol as fuels?  What plans does it have to produce as much of those as possible from within the country and not to be importing them?  There are significant opportunities for biomethane production in this country but we seem to be moving very slowly.  It has two major gains, climate and security.</p></speech>

The agreement was endorsed by 94% of people here and 71% of people in Northern Ireland.  It was endorsed by 85% of those voting across the island as a whole.  It was a transformative moment for the island.  I remember the day vividly, as I expect most in this House do.  Maybe for a younger generation, who do not remember at first hand the importance and emotion of the vote, it was captured in dramatic form in the final episode of Derry Girls last week.</p>  <p>  The referenda gave democratic legitimacy to the Good Friday Agreement.  The agreement itself gives us the frameworks to end violence, build cross-community representative government and manage the relationship in Northern Ireland between the North and South and between these islands on the basis of partnership, equality and mutual respect.  Right now, the Good Friday Agreement is under strain, along with the spirit of partnership that underpins it.  It is under strain from unilateral action already taken and threatened.  It is under strain from those who refuse to operate its institutions.  It is under strain from those who wrap their actions in the language of defending it but whose actions do not match those words.  That is why we are here this evening.  I thank this House for facilitating this debate.</p>  <p>  At present, the British&ndash;Irish relationship seems to be lurching from announcement to announcement and stand-off to stand-off.  With so much going on, there is a risk that we will normalise crises.  It is worth stopping to reflect on the operation of the agreement and its wider context.  Since the elections on 5 May, the DUP has refused to allow the formation of an Executive or even the election of a Speaker to get the Assembly up and running.  This is at a time when Northern Ireland has so many bread-and-butter political challenges to face.  Participation in the North&ndash;South Ministerial Council is one of the essential responsibilities attached to ministerial office in the Northern Ireland Executive.  The DUP has boycotted the council since the autumn of last year.</p>  <p>  Along with others, the DUP has real concerns over the operation and impact of the Northern Ireland protocol &ndash; I readily acknowledge that and will return to it later &ndash; but those concerns are no reason not to stand up and operate the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement that we all say we are committed to.  Elsewhere we have heard how the balance of the agreement must be protected and that east&ndash;west must match North&ndash;South.  One of the key east&ndash;west institutions of the agreement is the British&ndash;Irish Council.  The agreement provides that the British&ndash;Irish Council will meet at summit level twice per year.  The council does meet but the current British Prime Minister has yet to attend.</p>  <p>  Then there are those for whom the protocol is a stalking horse.  They can move seamlessly from criticism of the protocol to calling for the agreement itself to go.  By and large, these are those with no political mandate who never supported the agreement in the first place and who seek to damage it from the outside.  Treating the agreement lightly plays only into those hands.  The Good Friday Agreement is not a flag of convenience; it is a solemn responsibility endorsed by our people and it is a shared responsibility.</p>  <p>  From the outset, it was always clear that Brexit would profoundly impact Northern Ireland and relationships on this island.  At an early stage, both the EU and UK agreed that a unique solution was required for Ireland as a whole.  Reaching that solution required a long, detailed and difficult negotiation, with a shared focus on minimising disruption and a great spirit of compromise.  The solution agreed jointly by the EU and UK became known as the protocol.  However, given the misinformation about the protocol in recent weeks, it is important that we recall clearly and truthfully what it actually achieves and was designed to do.  This solution, arrived at jointly, protects the Good Friday Agreement and the gains of the peace process.  It fully and expressly recognises Northern Ireland&rsquo;s constitutional status and the principle of consent protected in the Good Friday Agreement.  It avoids a hard border on the island of Ireland, protects the common travel area and North&ndash;South co-operation and provides for no diminution of rights, safeguards or equality of opportunity for the people of Northern Ireland.  Importantly, for thousands of businesses it gives Northern Ireland unique access to both the UK and EU internal markets.  Despite all this and the fact that the British Government negotiated it, it now claims that implementing the protocol that we agreed together is incompatible with the Good Friday Agreement.  This is disingenuous and dangerous.</p>  <p>  I find it deeply disappointing that the British Government has said it intends to table legislation in the coming weeks that would unilaterally disapply elements of the protocol, which is now international law.  This action is contrary to the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement, in respect of which genuine trust and partnership between both Governments have time and again proved crucial to shared progress.  As the protocol is an integral part of an international agreement, such action would amount to a serious violation of international law also.  I have urged the British Government to reconsider, weigh the risks that would flow from unilateral action and step back from this course of action, as it has done previously.  Unilateral action is contrary to the wishes of the majority of people and businesses in Ireland; that is a fact.  They can see the potential for jobs, growth and foreign direct investment in the period ahead.</p> <p>This month the UK National Institute of Economic and Social Research found that Northern Ireland's economy was outperforming the rest of the UK and that this is attributable, in part at least, to the protocol.  This corresponds with the clear message I hear in my engagement with Northern Ireland businesses, which have no desire to be caught up in the politics of Brexit or the protocol.  They want stability and certainty so they can plan for the future.  Unilateral action or the threat of it does not deliver this, but the opposite.  I spoke to Foreign Secretary Truss last Friday, when I made clear Ireland's opposition to the UK breaching international law and said the UK needs to get back to talks with the EU.  </p> <p> There are genuine concerns about the protocol and I want to speak directly to the unionist community in that regard.  The EU has consistently negotiated to reach an agreed outcome to address concerns held in Northern Ireland but we need a partner to do that with.  The ball is in the UK's court and the onus is on it to indicate if it will move away from unrealistic demands it knows the EU cannot deliver and focus on the issue of greatest concern to the people and businesses of Northern Ireland, which is the movement of goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland and removing barriers to that trade.  The EU has put a creative package on the table to address these issues.  These are bespoke solutions for moving goods and for greater engagement for Northern Ireland around the protocol.  The EU remains ready to explore these ideas in depth and move beyond where we have previously been, but we need a partner to do that with.  Without the British Government's co-operation and willingness to try to make it work, it will not work and the stand-off will continue.</p> <p> This Government, through my office and others, is already working with the European Commission to try to ensure we respond to legitimate concerns in Northern Ireland, particularly on the issue of making a significant differentiation between goods we know are staying in Northern Ireland to be purchased and consumed there and those at risk of travelling into the EU Single Market, crossing the Border moving south.  We can take a significant step forward in meeting the demands of many in the unionist community who want to see unnecessary checks gone on goods staying within the United Kingdom but, without a partner, it is hard to find a way forward.</p> <p> On legacy, last week the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland introduced to the House of Commons the Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Bill.  The Bill had its Second Reading yesterday.  The drafting, publication and introduction of the Bill is a unilateral act repudiating the painstakingly negotiated 2014 Stormont House Agreement.  That agreement had the support of most parties in Northern Ireland and the two Governments, along with civil society buy-in.  Dealing with the legacy of the Troubles was always going to be difficult but we had broad agreement on how to move forward together.  We signed a treaty with the UK to aid with information recovery and brought in legislation in this jurisdiction.</p> <p> The British Government now wishes to go it alone.  When it flagged this intention last year in a command paper, we urged it to engage in good faith and find a way forward together, with the parties and the voices of victims and survivors at the centre of that process.  It is regrettable that it has abandoned a collective approach.  If it wishes to move away from what we agreed at Stormont House, it should do so by agreement with the parties, with representatives of those most directly affected by cases and with the Irish Government, which is a partner on this and many issues.  Many families are upset by the publication of this Bill, including those waiting for inquests or pursuing civil litigation.  Many will understandably feel that immunity, conditional or otherwise, is about protecting perpetrators instead of pursuing justice.  Those concerns need to be heard.</p> <p> There are serious questions to be asked about the draft legislation.  Many in the political parties, civil society and academia have deep concerns.  There is a fundamental question as to whether the legislation as drafted is properly compliant with the European Convention on Human Rights, ECHR, and, by extension, the Good Friday Agreement, which committed to the full incorporation of those rights into Northern Ireland law.</p> <p> The British Government, in a memo published alongside the draft Bill, states that it is an open question as to whether the court in Strasbourg would find an amnesty to be compatible with Article 2 obligations under the ECHR.  To progress legislation while that remains an open question is an extraordinary approach.  The proposed system of case review seems to be a significant step away from the Article 2 compliant investigations committed to at Stormont.  On initial reading, I have concerns about the independence of the processes outlined in the Bill.  This is in direct contrast to what was agreed at Stormont House, where we sought to guarantee the independence of the investigations and information recovery arrangements.  In order for truth recovery and investigations to be trusted by both communities, they have to be seen to be independent.  If they are not, they will not work, which is the biggest problem of all.</p> <p> The legislation appears to give wide powers to the UK Government to subsequently change or end this process after only a few years in operation, while also ending legacy investigations and information recovery by any other route, including the PSNI, the Police Ombudsman, inquests and new civil cases.  Any new system will be taken to the courts and tested.  If it fails there, it will have done nothing to resolve these issues or progress reconciliation and justice.  It will have added further years of limbo and heartache for families who have had far too much of both.  The process for dealing with legacy cases should be about building, rather than eroding, trust and confidence.  This Bill and its unilateral process does not do that.  I strongly urge the Secretary of State to reconsider this approach and offer our team a partner in terms of looking at real alternatives.</p> <p> Electronic travel authorisation has become a contentious issue.  Provisions set out in the recently enacted UK Nationalities and Borders Act raise difficulties and cause us to question the British Government's commitment to borderless travel on the island of Ireland.  Plans to establish an electronic system for travel authorisation, ESTA, that would apply to non-Irish and non-British citizens who wish to travel from South to North threaten to undermine the fluid nature of movement on the island and numerous areas of North-South co-operation, including tourism and cross-Border health service provision.  As I have set out previously in this House, we have been engaging with our British counterparts for some time on this issue.  I welcome recent announcements by UK ministers that they are keen to continue to engage with us in order to find a way forward.  I assure Deputies that we will continue to prioritise this issue.</p> <p> In the Queen's speech, the British Government outlined its intention to replace the Human Rights Act with a new bill of rights.  By incorporating the European Convention on Human Rights into Northern Ireland law in line with the Good Friday Agreement, the Human Rights Act fulfils an important role in Northern Ireland.  It has been essential in creating confidence in Northern Ireland's political, policing and judicial structures over the past 24 years.  Any diminution of the scope or efficacy of that incorporation would be a source of deep concern, North and South.  I welcome the assurance in the earlier command paper that any reform will keep the ECHR rights incorporated into Northern Ireland law.  We will watch that closely.  We are concerned that the command paper includes a range of proposals which may result in the rights in the bill of rights being given significantly different meanings from the corresponding rights in the European Convention on Human Rights, such that the bill of rights may not fully incorporate the convention into Northern Ireland law or ensure access to courts and remedies for breach of it.</p> <p>I am also concerned that the proposed introduction of a permission stage for human rights claims and the proposed restrictions on the availability of remedies for rights violations will undermine the commitment in the Good Friday Agreement to ensure direct access to the courts and remedies for breaches of the European Convention on Human Rights.  I have written to the Secretary of State and I also raised these issues of concern when we met in March.  There is time to work with our UK colleagues to get these issues right.<br/><br/>What I have outlined indicates a distinct shift away from partnership by the British Government in respect of Northern Ireland.  This is a new and difficult context for the bilateral relationship, creating risk for our relations on and across these islands.  I firmly believe that, in the longer arc of history, we are moving in the right direction, less bound by the conflicts and differences of the past but, right now, we are in a challenging place and it is important to call that out bluntly.  The programme for Government underlines the importance of the bilateral relationship.  Our relationship with Great Britain is unique.  Our two islands are deeply intertwined.  Away from politics, the relationship is thriving, through ties of kinship, commerce and culture, but in the political arena, things are far from where they should be.  We knew that Brexit would present challenges.  The Government has sought to pursue strong partnership as the basis for the new post-Brexit relationship with the UK.<br/><br/>While, of course, Brexit and the form of Brexit the UK has chosen have had a negative impact, the Government has been working to enhance the operation of the core east-west institutions of the Good Friday Agreement.  These are, as outlined in the text of the agreement, the British-Irish Council and the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, to both of which the Irish Government is absolutely committed.  I also commend the work of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly which in its former iteration is also referenced in the text of the Good Friday Agreement.<br/><br/>Through the past two years, my Department has continued to invest in our diplomatic footprint in Great Britain.  Our expanding Embassy in London, our newly launched consulates in Cardiff and Manchester and our new joint co-operation frameworks with Scotland and Wales demonstrate real commitment on the ground.  We have also managed to protect long-standing common travel area arrangements post Brexit.  We do this carefully, working together with the UK to avoid any inconsistencies between our obligations under EU law and the common travel area.<br/><br/>Ministers right across Government have prioritised engagement with the UK in the past two years.  It is Government policy to do so.  The T&aacute;naiste brought our first trade mission since the start of the pandemic to London and, more recently, the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, and the Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, undertook St. Patrick's Day programmes in Great Britain as a priority.  The Government will continue to pursue the kind of partnership we need.  We will continue to engage with a wide range of political stakeholders right across Great Britain.  The work of Members of the Oireachtas is also important in this.  The next meeting of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, due to take place in Cavan in October, is an opportunity to invest in partnership and mutual understanding on many of these issues.<br/><br/>However, recent actions by the UK give us cause to reflect.  We are not where we want to be.  Our focus should be on developing new collaboration in areas such as green energy and international affairs.  We should be renewing our partnership for the post-Brexit era.  Those are the goals we set in the programme for Government and they are where I want us to get to, but the current stance of the British Government constrains us.  That is the truth.  We are fire-fighting rather than looking to the future.<br/><br/>At this challenging time we, along with our nearest neighbours, need to step back and reflect on how far we have come since the 1990s.  We need to recall the value the peace process is about and what it has achieved.  As John Hume stated in his Nobel lecture in 1998:</p><blockquote>	We are two neighbouring islands whose destiny is to live in friendship and amity with each other.  We are friends and the achievement of peace will further strengthen that friendship. </blockquote> <p>The Good Friday Agreement and its values remain our bedrock.  Partnership and commitment remain the only basis on which we can move forward together.  This requires compromise on all sides and hard work between our two Governments.  Most of all, it requires trust.  Trust takes years to build up and can be undermined overnight.  I caution that care needs to be taken in this space.<br/><br/>I wish to touch briefly on a couple of issues before closing.  In the heated atmosphere of the past few weeks, leading up to and following the Northern Ireland election, I was accused of threatening violence in the context of Brexit.  Nothing could be further from the truth and I challenge anybody to show otherwise.  I have warned about unravelling the fabric of the agreement because I remember what went before.  To remember those days is not a threat; it should be seen as a motivation.  We must not forget the urgency of peace that brought us to the Good Friday Agreement.  In fact, I was subject to the direct threat of violence when I was delivering a speech in Belfast in March - a speech about reconciliation and generosity between communities.  A van driver was hijacked at gunpoint and forced to drive to where I was speaking with what he believed was a viable explosive device in the back of his van.  I feel for that driver and his family.  It is hard to imagine the trauma that he must feel.  There is no room for violence or the threat of violence from any quarter in Northern Ireland right now.  There is no place for the glorification of the violence of the past either.<br/><br/>Today, the delegation of the United States Congress is in Northern Ireland.  I met the delegates in Dublin yesterday and they visited Leinster House.  I wish to record my appreciation for their interest and their visit and what it represents.  The United States has been a steadfast supporter of efforts to secure and, as important, to sustain peace on this island.  That support is bipartisan in Congress and has extended to every administration for decades.  While the peace process belongs first to the people and parties in Northern Ireland, that consistent support from the US has helped make it possible.<br/><br/>I know the Good Friday Agreement is a priority for every Member of this House and every political party.  While we may differ on points of emphasis and detail, the Members of this House will never let domestic politics get in the way of securing sustainable peace and prosperity in Northern Ireland, or in the way of implementing the Good Friday Agreement itself.  An earlier generation of political leaders gave us the Good Friday Agreement.  They gave us the structures and mechanisms to embed the peace and to deliver functioning representative politics in Northern Ireland despite all the complexity and challenges they faced.  They have entrusted its implementation to us.  All parties, including the two Governments, need to subscribe to the values, the principles and the institutions of the agreement and not just refer to them.  Northern Ireland needs functioning institutions and it needs them now.  It needs an assembly and an Executive in place to address the issues of regular politics, issues that are challenging enough already, like healthcare, the cost of living, housing and so much more besides.  It needs the mechanisms to deal with &quot;practical politics, not visionary vapours&quot;, to borrow a phrase from David Trimble.  The people of Northern Ireland need more than debate on constitutional questions, whether raised as threat or motivation.  They face other immediate challenges.<br/><br/>The protocol is compatible with the Good Friday Agreement if it is implemented appropriately.  It was designed to be.  We can address any challenges its implementation represents with patience, partnership and real and honest negotiation from both sides.  The same is true for legacy and the other challenges to the British-Irish partnership in Northern Ireland.  Northern Ireland is our common ground, where we must work together to find shared solutions.  In the past 30 years, the British-Irish partnership has delivered so much for Northern Ireland and the island of Ireland as a whole.  I hope we can rekindle that partnership.</p> <p>I believe we can and must do so.  We owe it to a future generation to do that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-25a.212" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1625" speakername="John Brady" time="13:47:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022052500031#JJ00200"><p>It is unfortunate, but unavoidable, that as we debate the issues of the Irish protocol and the proposed flawed legacy legislation being floated by the British, that the common thread that binds the two issues in respect of the approach and actions of the British Government is an attitude of disdain, most certainly for the people of this entire island.  There is also an attitude of disdain for the EU and, indeed, the US Government, which very much identifies itself as a stakeholder and protector of the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement.  The actions of the British Government are precipitating the most serious political crisis in the post-Good Friday Agreement era.  The British Government is threatening to break international law through signalling its intent to abandon the Irish protocol and effectively ride roughshod through the Good Friday Agreement.</p><p>The people of the North voted on 5 May to make politics work.  Some 70% of voters voted in support of parties in favour of the protocol.  Two thirds of the MLAs elected to Stormont want the assembly up and running now.  Boris Johnson&rsquo;s actions are giving succour to the anti-democratic instincts of the Democratic Unionist Party, DUP, which is refusing to honour the democratic wishes of the people of the North to form the Stormont Executive.</p><p>We now have a situation where the entire basis of power sharing is being threatened by the actions of the DUP and the British Government, in particular, the toxic alliance which has emerged between the British Foreign Secretary, Liz Truss, the economic research group and the DUP.  Their actions are depriving the people of the North of an Executive, which is needed to address a crippling cost-of-living crisis where inflation is at its highest point in the past four decades.  Yet, because of the DUP actions facilitated by the British Government, the assembly cannot meet to deliver badly needed support for workers and, indeed, families.  There is &pound;400 million in funding available to address the cost-of-living crisis, but it cannot be allocated until the Executive is formed.  Further funding of &pound;1 billion is there to help to address the crisis in the health service in the North, to hire more doctors and nurses and to fund cancer and mental health services.</p><p>The British Government has falsely claimed to be acting to defend the Good Friday Agreement, when in fact it is acting to support a party that is actively attempting to undermine the agreement.  The actions of the British Government and its unilateral approach to proposed changes to the protocol act to undermine the conditions that have fostered peace on this island for almost 25 years.  The British Government is legislating intentionally to break international law.  It is amplifying the record of bad faith displayed by the Johnson Government on Brexit since his election as Prime Minister.</p><p>The economic reality is that the economy in the North has been outperforming the economy of Britain since the protocol agreement has been put in place.  The protocol has placed the North in a unique and, in some respects, an envious position, in that it has access to both the British market and an EU market of 500 million people.</p><p>I also want to acknowledge the support that the US has offered to Ireland for the protocol and in defence of the Good Friday Agreement.  Last week I visited the US and met with US lawmakers from both parties, Democratic and Republican, who assured me and the cross-party delegation there of their continued and unfailing support of the Irish peace process.  The reality is that there would not be a Good Friday Agreement without the valued support of the US.  I also want to welcome the comments by Congressman Richard Neal, the chair of the House of Representatives' ways and means committee, who said that the Good Friday Agreement also belongs to the United States.  He said the US is firm in its commitment to continue to provide bipartisan support for the Irish protocol and the Good Friday Agreement.  In addition, US lawmakers have also stated that they will not support a new trade agreement between the United States and Britain if the Tories go ahead and scrap the protocol, effectively tearing up international law.</p><p>It is interesting to note that the British Attorney General stated that she will not publish the British Government&rsquo;s advice in full, which the <i>Financial Times</i>has reported to have come from a former lawyer for Donald Trump, which in itself says a lot.  Further to this, the British are offering a grotesque rationale that they intend to act unilaterally to prevent violence from loyalists, including that which was threatened against the Minister, essentially rewarding or even encouraging illegal behaviour from loyalists.</p><p>Much of this crisis takes place against the backdrop of English politics, the seemingly eternal internal power struggles within the Tory party, and attempts by the DUP to assert itself as the dominant force within unionism.  The British Government and the DUP must not and cannot be allowed to continue to drag us all into this crisis.</p><p>The EU and the US must continue in their support for the Good Friday Agreement, which must remain the primary concern.  They must continue in their view that the British must not be allowed to tear up international treaties and discount international law at will.  There cannot and should not be any consideration given to a renegotiation of the protocol or the Good Friday Agreement.  The British Government must listen to the voice of voters in the North, 70% of whom voted in favour of candidates in support of the protocol.  It must listen to the voice of civic society in the North.  The Irish Government must step up its efforts to advocate on behalf of the people of the North.  It must be seen to be unequivocal in its support of the Good Friday Agreement and, indeed, the protocol.</p><p>I want to turn to the issue of the British Government&rsquo;s plans to introduce flawed legacy legislation in the North.  Boris Johnson is certainly lending truth to the axiom once offered by Brigadier Frank Kitson, that the law is only another tool in the arsenal of the state.  Once used in the North for the disposal of unwanted members of the public, it is now intended to be used to dispose of unwanted and unpalatable truths.  The Achilles&rsquo; heel of the record of Britain&rsquo;s dirty war in Ireland, its counterinsurgency campaign against Irish nationalists, has been and will remain the hidden truth of its role in the murder of Irish civilians.  The British Government will do anything to prevent this truth from emerging.  It is simply an appalling vista too far for the British establishment.  In this vein, once again we witness the British attempting to manipulate the law for its own ends with the indecent haste with which is attempting to drive through the flawed Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Bill, against the wishes of victims and their families.</p><p>When I use the term &ldquo;flawed&rdquo;, I am merely echoing the findings of a damning report by the Human Rights Commission, which has branded the British Government&rsquo;s legacy legislation plans as &quot;totally flawed&quot;.  The commission has also found that the British legacy Bill is incompatible with Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights and will breach the Human Rights Act.  I want to welcome the opposition of the Irish Government to these plans, along with that of other political parties on this island.</p><p>This flawed legacy legislation is a flagrant attempt by the British Government to protect the agents of the British State who prosecuted the war in the North on its behalf.  It is an attempt to introduce an amnesty through the backdoor for members of the British army, the RUC and the intelligence services who murdered and colluded in the murders of Irish citizens during Britain&rsquo;s dirty war here on this island.  There is also an attempt to shut citizens out of the courts, to deny families inquests on the deaths of their loved ones and to deny access to judicial reviews and to civil courts.  They ride roughshod over the needs of victims and their families.</p> <p>Some of those have been waiting for more than five decades for justice.  In 2014, agreement was reached by the parties in the North and both the British and Irish Governments at Stormont House to address the issues of truth, justice and reconciliation, and this agreement must be implemented in full.</p></speech>

The Minister will be aware I have made a number of speeches in his presence about that case and the Minister is familiar with it.  I will focus on the case of Councillor Eddie Fullerton again here today to illustrate what I believe is the serious bad faith by the British Government and the British state and how I think they are trying to protect themselves from accountability and responsibility for their central role in the conflict and in the assassination of an elected representative of the people of Donegal.</p>  <p>  We know from Operation Greenwich, and the Police Ombudsman report from earlier this year.  That report came after 15 years.  It was an exhaustive report that followed from a complaint in 2006 from the Fullerton family.  It was a remarkable investigation.  I commend those who carried it out.  They were honourable people.  They themselves were shocked at what they discovered.  Indeed, we learn in the report, Operation Greenwich, that they had submitted a file to the PSNI in 2016 with details about a person involved in multiple murders who should be of interest to the PSNI.  That person is Person K.  I will not name him here today.  I will reserve that to a future decision based on the actions of the British state.  Person K was a mass murderer.  He was clearly a British military agent.  He was the person overseeing the assassination of Councillor Fullerton.</p>  <p>  Other persons involved in Councillor Fullerton's assassination are identified as Person J and Person P in the report.  Both Person J and Person P were British soldiers.  I believe Person P was a British military agent acting inside the Ulster Defence Association, UDA.  What I am saying to the Minister is I believe British military intelligence acting on behalf of the British state directed its agents, including a serving British soldier, to assassinate an elected representative in Donegal 31 years ago today.  It could not be more serious than that.</p>  <p>  I would like to name Person K here today but I am not going to.  I may do in time.  I have that right under privilege in this House if I believe that justice has not been served.  Person K will not be able to hide forever.  Person K is a mass murderer.</p>  <p>  Person K went on to oversee the massacres at Castlerock and Greysteel - the murders of 12 innocent people.  He is a psychopath and a mass murderer, a British military agent with a licence to kill.  Even after Greysteel, even when a person who was believed to be a police agent was convicted of being involved in Greysteel, he was still protected even though the evidence of his involvement in Greysteel was absolutely overwhelming.  One of the persons convicted of Greysteel identified Person K as overseeing the entire operation, from securing the vehicle that was used as the getaway car to providing the weaponry to making sure they practised the route and tested the weapons.  He could not have been more involved.  When the deed was done, he was not present but he oversaw the entire matter.  His fingerprints were caught on a plastic bag with the weapons used in Greysteel in the holdall.  Even though a witness, a person involved in the murder, said he was completely involved, even though his fingerprints were found on a plastic bag with the weapons used in Greysteel, a mass murder of eight people, he was not convicted.  He will be brought to justice.  The problem for the British state is, when he is brought to justice, so will those who gave him the orders, and that goes right up to, I believe, Whitehall and 10 Downing Street.  I believe they were carrying out a series of targeted assassinations of republicans from Pat Finucane to Sinn F&eacute;in councillors, including Councillor Fullerton.</p>  <p>  There is even more to it, if that was not enough.  It is astonishing.  This is all down to the investigation of Operation Greenwich, an astonishing report that I appeal to the officials in the Department to examine in detail.  I am happy to meet with them and divulge the information, thanks to the Fullerton family, that we have unveiled.</p>  <p>  Person J had recently left the British Army just before his involvement in Councillor Fullerton's murder.  Person J was found in possession of hundreds of intelligence files on republicans in early 1991 prior to Councillor Fullerton's assassination.  Within those files, there were two names that stand out: Sinn F&eacute;in Councillor Bernard O'Hagan and Sinn F&eacute;in member Mr. Tommy Casey.  Both those men would be murdered later on in 1991.  Even though Person J, who had left the British Army just before 1991, was out on bail for being in possession of all of those documents, we believe he was involved in the assassinations of Councillor Fullerton, Councillor O'Hagan and Mr. Casey.  He was then convicted and sentenced to six months for possession of those files, even though two of the names in the file were subsequently murdered after they were found in early 1991.  It is astonishing what has been revealed in this report, beyond what we ourselves even would have thought possible.  What one is looking at here is a British military agent who becomes a mass murderer of innocent people, oversees these operations, is protected all the way, is taken away from the scene after the ceasefire and lives a life.</p>  <p>  Person J and Person K are still alive today.  They may think that they can hide from justice; they cannot.</p>  <p>  I want to send a message to the British state and the British security services that might think they can cover up all of this.  We know what they did.  We know those who carried out these acts for them.  They may try to hide.  They might try to close down their Facebook accounts, which these two people and one other person directly involved in the murder have, but they will not hide from justice.  The family of the late Councillor Fullerton and the other families will have justice and the British state will tell the full truth about its role in the conflict in the North.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-25a.215" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1501" speakername="Rose Conway-Walsh" time="13:57:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022052500032#KK00300"><p>I too want to send my solidarity to the Fullerton family.  I welcome the opportunity to speak on this issue here today, on the protocol, on legacy issues and the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  It is important to name exactly what is happening here.  The British Government is attempting unilaterally to smash an international legally binding agreement.  The Good Friday Agreement and subsequent agreements are the architecture that hold the peace on this island and that set the pathway for true reconciliation and transformation.  Most people on this island are horrified by the recent actions of the British Prime Minister, but most British people are embarrassed and deeply concerned about the implications for Britain's global reputation.</p>  <p>  The mechanism for dealing with any issues arising from the protocol is the joint committee, as we have said time and time again.  Already, problems with medicines and with sanitary and phytosanitary, SPS, goods have been dealt with.  Other issues can be dealt with in the same way.  The truth is that the protocol made necessary by Brexit is being used and abused by the Democratic Unionist Party, DUP, ably abetted by the British Government in an attempt to hold back the tide of equity and change within the North of Ireland.  They just cannot accept the democratic outcome of the recent election.  They cannot accept that the days of the sectarian mantra that no nationalist need apply are over.</p>  <p>  The inclusive vision of the First Minister-designate, Ms Michelle O'Neill MLA, and her team of Sinn F&eacute;in MLAs is a threat to no one's identity.  Those who are secure in their own identity, be they Irish, British, both or other, just want to live on a prosperous, thriving and progressive island where everybody can fulfil their true potential.</p>  <p>  A quarter of a century later, we are still awaiting the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and the subsequent agreements.  It is unconscionable that the bill of rights is still being resisted.</p> <p>I welcome that Acht na Gaeilge has been finally introduced at Westminster today, 16 years after it was committed to in the St. Andrews Agreement.  I commend those who have relentlessly pursued the right to their own language, including the thousands of people who took to the streets of Belfast last Saturday.</p> <p> I will turn to the recent legacy and reconciliation Bill.  I commend the work done by the Committee on the Administration of Justice and its partners.  They consider the Bill unworkable, and in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights and the Good Friday Agreement.  They indicate it is incapable of delivering for victims and survivors and it is a unilateral solo run by the British Government, which is seeking to sideline the devolved institutions.  They rightly query the timing of the introduction of this Bill.  It is hard to argue against the analysis that the existing mechanisms are working too well in exposing past human rights abuses, with the citing of the historical clarification and information recovery achieved by the recent legacy inquest and the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland reports.</p> <p> The Stormont House Agreement gave victims and their families access to truth, justice and reconciliation.  The visit of Congressman Richard Neal and his delegation from the US Administration here yesterday was welcomed by all parties and none in this House.  The chairperson of the House Ways and Means Committee, supported by President Biden, has made clear the consequences for Britain of unilaterally damaging the Good Friday Agreement.  The Irish Government must step firmly up to the mark and adopt an unequivocal position against the destructive behaviour of both the Democratic Unionist Party, DUP, and the Tories.</p> <p> The cost-of-living crisis and issues with the health service are severely affecting workers and families across this island.  People in the North can no longer afford to wait to have the institutions back up and running.  They deserve better and they need better.  Stagnation is not an option.  Being held to ransom by the DUP, aided by the British Government, is likewise not an option and it is downright cruel, particularly for those most severely affected by the highest inflation we have had for decades and those ground down by poverty and exclusion.</p> <p> I know the Minister gets this and he knows what is happening.  My colleague, Deputy Mac Lochlainn outlined the case of Mr. Eddie Fullerton, which is just one case in the uncovering of truth.  It is often bandied about that we must not rewrite history but it is not about rewriting history but telling the truth.  This is about getting to the truth and the attempts being made to cover up the truth are absolutely despicable.  They are recognised right around the world, including in the deepest parts of Britain.  People are beginning to wake up to what really happened and why.  We must stop the cover-ups and the protection of the people involved.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-25a.217" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1620" speakername="Brendan Howlin" time="14:07:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022052500033#LL00200"><p>At the beginning of this month, the people of Northern Ireland voted in Assembly elections but as the Minister rightly tells the House, they are no closer to having a functioning government because the largest unionist party is now absenting itself from the very institutions that were so carefully and painstakingly crafted.  Just as they are here, people in Northern Ireland are suffering from a cost-of-living crisis.  The same issues that needed solutions in February, when the DUP left the Executive, are now even worse and crying out more to be addressed.  These are questions of health and housing, education and normal bread-and-butter matters in politics.</p><p>The unresolved fallout from Brexit continues to cast a long shadow and the British Government is exploiting the issue of the protocol, abetted by the DUP for its own political purposes.  For the first time, a nationalist party has won the most seats in the Northern Ireland Assembly but the overall votes cast for either designation did not substantially change.  The electoral earthquake has been the growth and consolidation of the centre ground around the Alliance Party, which nearly doubled its number of seats from nine to 17.  This has come at the expense of two seats from the DUP and mostly gains made from other centre-ground parties, such as the SDLP, the UUP and the Greens, which all lost seats to the Alliance Party.</p><p>We must consider what this will mean for the future of Northern Ireland.  I hope it can deliver a more progressive form of politics but there is also a challenge for us to consider the basic structure of power-sharing, which was last significantly altered in the discussions that led to the St. Andrews Agreement.  What will happen if the largest or second-largest party does not declare itself as representing either community?  It is an eventuality that must be addressed.</p><p>The result also complicates the often binary discussion on a border poll or unity referendum.  The Labour Party aspires to a united and shared island but we also recognise that very detailed work involving difficult choices is needed in advance of presenting any referendum, and groundwork is needed for the approach to be put to the people ultimately.  Calls for a border poll will not bring about a fundamental focus and analysis.  Calling on the Irish Government to establish a citizens' assembly is also an incomplete idea if it is not matched with some similar process in Northern Ireland.  Getting such an initiative approved by Stormont will require engagement with the growing centre ground there, which by its definition steers clear of constitutional issues.  Simplistic slogans are no substitute for a detailed analysis of the institutional and constitutional compromises that will be required for the fundamental change that many of us aspire to on this island.  However, the growth of the Alliance Party has created a real prospect of normalised politics emerging in the North and we must consider how to accommodate the growing non-aligned groupings of the centre.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Conservative Party Government in the United Kingdom is intent on imposing its political solutions on the North.  The introduction of cultural legislation today in Westminster that will officially recognise the Irish language is long overdue and welcome.  It will help towards building trust.  However, it does not excuse the political games now being played with the protocol and with legacy matters.  What is being given with one hand is being taken back in spades by the other.  It is no coincidence the British Government is threatening legislative action on the protocol just as the British Prime Minister comes under renewed political pressure over the so-called &quot;partygate&quot; and the report of Ms Sue Gray on it, which was published today.</p><p>Invoking unilateral legislation on both the protocol and the legacy question is a clear breach of the Good Friday Agreement and will cause immense damage to the peace process and the space so painstakingly created for political negotiation and compromise.  The British foreign secretary has a self-serving opinion piece in today's <i>The Irish Times</i>on proposals to disapply the protocol.  I say as an aside that one of the suggestions she makes is that the mandate given by the European Commission to Vice President Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efčovič is inadequate.  If Mr. &Scaron;efčovič or the Minister in the Chamber said the mandate given to Ms Truss is inadequate and she should get a different mandate in Westminster before we dealt with her, what would be the reaction from Tory backbenchers?  What would they think if that was the Minister's view or that of the European Commission?  This is lost sometimes on some members of the current Tory Government.</p><p>If the UK Government put as much effort into working with the EU on implementing what they negotiated and agreed 18 months ago instead of playing political brinkmanship, many of the legitimate issues that I have come across in my discussions with people running businesses in Northern Ireland could be addressed.  I sat down in Belfast and visited Belfast Port, as well as ports on the other side, such as in Liverpool and north Wales, to see what the difficulties are.</p> <p>They can all be overcome with an open mind and a willingness to negotiate.  It is ludicrous to claim the internationally binding agreement it willingly entered into is now threatening the Good Friday Agreement.  As has been made clear by all parties here, by the EU and by the US, pragmatic and flexible solutions can be found.  Moving unilaterally to simply wipe away or alter fundamental agreements is neither sustainable nor consistent with the British Government's role as co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement.</p> <p> The approach of the DUP must also be called out.  It claims the protocol is a breach of the principles of consent and consensus.  Throughout Brexit it sought and advocated the hardest possible deal.  As Mark Durkan pointed out yesterday, the DUP flatly rejected calls for a devolved consent on the terms of Brexit.  It was explicit in its demands that the consent of the Northern Ireland Assembly was to be avoided to prevent a case for invoking cross-community support.  It opposed the Good Friday Agreement originally and now claims it requires parallel consent for decisions, which is simply not the case.  It is holding the assembly hostage over the protocol when the outcome it now opposes is a result of the very approach it had to Brexit when it failed to provide leadership or find solutions.</p> <p> Three months ago in February we spent significant time in the Chamber debating the many issues of legacy and the New Decade, New Approach deal.  We are no closer to delivering solutions on these outstanding issues.  The Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Bill had its Second Reading in Westminster.  It has been deemed by academics and the Committee on the Administration of Justice as unworkable, in breach of the Good Friday Agreement and international human rights law and incapable of delivering for victims or survivors.  All parties in Northern Ireland have condemned the Bill as it would deny victims closure and access to justice.  In my long parliamentary career one of the very few meetings I ever attended was a meeting last August in City Hall in Belfast.  An agreed approach on the issue was signed by every political party on the island, including Sinn F&eacute;in, the DUP and every party represented in this House, to oppose the original legacy Bill and command paper.  Something similar is now being presented.  It is quite clear the British Government must rethink its approach to these fundamental issues.  Those of us who have worked very hard to bring about a decent relationship, as is appropriate and proper between the governments and parliaments of these islands, must redouble our own efforts to change this attitude of mind.</p></speech>

He and the Government, and all of us in the House, must make every effort to ensure Ireland remains at peace and the agreement signed almost 25 years ago is put into full fruition and comes to its full strength.  In this respect, tomorrow the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement will meet Mr. Tim O'Connor, one of the civil servants who was the architect of the work, to learn from him.  The committee is composed of members of all parties and none and is ready, willing and able to ensure that the lessons for the future of the island are properly and fully examined and that we will learn from the politicians and everybody who was involved in the Good Friday Agreement.</p>  <p>  I welcome the initiative led by Mr. Richard Neal, a member of the US Congress.  The visit by Mr. Neal and his colleagues has been extremely helpful to me and my colleagues in the Oireachtas.  I hope his visit to Northern Ireland today will go well.  He has been to Europe and he has also met the British Foreign Minister.  The Good Friday Agreement is not just about what we in the South and the North think; it is about what was agreed.  It is guaranteed by the British and Irish Governments.  The interest of the United States is critical as is the continuing support and efforts from Europe to find a solution to the issue of the protocol.  I do not think anybody cares whether it is a green or red lane when people bring goods into the North.  The key issue is that in whatever practical solution is found, goods intended for the North stay in the North and no goods will illegally enter the European Union by breaking the rigid application we must have.</p>  <p>  There has been a lot of talk about a border poll.  The trouble with a border poll is that it is all very well to call for one but unless we prepare the ground for it and have a practical plan and buy-in from the minority in the North even a successful border poll will not work.  It will not cut the mustard.  If there is to be a border poll, and I favour one, how it can be brought about must be clarified.  The Good Friday Agreement is weak in this respect in that it leaves it to the British Administration, or its man or woman in Belfast for want of a better phrase, to look into his or her heart and decide that time has arrived.  We need to look at this issue and identify and clarify the reasons and process by which such a poll would be called.  It is part of the Good Friday Agreement.  It is as much a part of it as it is to be British and remain British.  Being Irish or nationalist is also a core part of it.  We need clarity on this but we need to prepare for it.  It will not work if it is lost.  If there is a border poll and it is lost, it will be lost for more than the seven years it is stated there would have to be before another one.  An awful lot of work must be done.</p>  <p>  I agree with the comments on the DUP.  It is failing in a duty of care to engage with us on the Good Friday Agreement.  Of the 18 Members of Parliament elected from Northern Ireland, ten of them attend our committee.  The majority of Members of the Houses of Parliament in the United Kingdom attend our meetings and speak at them.  This is very important.  It is time the DUP and the unionists join us in this regard.  I am ready willing and able, as are all members of the committee, to meet them wherever it suits to negotiate and speak about the future.  Unless we bring the unionists on board, the border poll will not work.  The new Northern Ireland we all want will not happen.</p>  <p>  If there is one place I have been in the North that has shown me how power-sharing works, it is in the city of Derry.  I met members of my own party and I also met Mr. Graham Warke, the DUP mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council.  There is power-sharing in Derry.  It has a nationalist majority and a DUP mayor.  The openness with which Mr. Warke welcomed us to his city and gave us the benefit of his views is a new generation of thinking.  It is something I find very attractive.  The DUP is coming forward with new faces and new ideas.  They are all part of the same city of Derry.  With the DUP and nationalists, we can all be part of a new Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  It would be remiss of me not to welcome the repeal of the Administration of Justice (Language) Act (Ireland) 1737 passed many centuries ago.  I am sure it brings joy to all of those who marched in Belfast.  It also brings joy to me.  It is not a revolutionary act by any stretch of the imagination but it is very welcome and necessary.  Progress has been made but the biggest problem of all is the poor relationship that continues between the British Government and us on this island.  It is very unhelpful.  The British Government needs to listen and learn.  It has been involved in Northern Ireland for a hell of a long time.  It is part and parcel of the Good Friday Agreement.  For short-term political gain, as my colleague from the Labour Party has said, it is neglecting its long-term duty of care to peace on this island and using short-term strategies to create significant serious and ongoing problems, which we do not accept.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-25a.220" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1552" speakername="Se&aacute;n Haughey" time="14:27:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022052500035#NN00100"><p>It is fair to say that British-Irish relations are not particularly good at this time.  It all started with Brexit in 2016 and things have got steadily worse since then.  The Brexit decision, in which the UK decided to disengage from the EU and go its own way, was a shock to the international community.  The <i>modus operandi</i>of British Prime Minister and the governing style of the Conservative Party have been difficult to accommodate.  The move towards unilateralism as opposed to multilateral diplomacy in regard to Northern Ireland and the protocol, legacy issues, immigration and the Nationality and Borders Bill, and even the Good Friday Agreement, have made things very difficult for Ireland and the EU.</p><p>There is an apparent unwillingness by the British Government to recognise that it is a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement and that the Conservative government seems to be more focused on domestic political objectives.  There is an unpredictability about the actions of Boris Johnson's government.  It appears the UK has no qualms about breaking international law, such as the withdrawal agreement.  Trust between the EU and the UK and, more recently, Ireland and Britain, is in short supply.  The Minister spoke about the absence of partnership.  So here we are.</p><p>I appreciate that listening to these concerns is probably not very helpful.  It must also be recognised that relations between Ireland and Britain have come a long way since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement.  Ireland and Britain are friendly neighbouring countries and the need to interact constructively in order to resolve the various problems that confront us is apparent.</p><p>As to the sensitive issue of addressing the legacy of the past in Northern Ireland, as we know the British Government published and is in the process of enacting the Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Bill.  The Bill is complex and requires careful analysis.  It amends a previous proposal on this issue and allows for immunity to be granted for those coming forward with information, among other things.  On the face of it, the measures proposed constitute a <i>de facto</i>amnesty and are not in accordance with the Stormont House Agreement.  Any proposals on this sensitive matter should be considered in consultation with the Irish Government as a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, taking into account subsequent agreements, and the political parties in the North, all of whom have opposed this Bill.  Most important of all, consultation should take place with the victims and their families.</p><p>The Northern Ireland Assembly elections took place earlier this month.  It is very important that the assembly convenes and an executive is formed without delay.  As we know, the DUP is not facilitating this due to its concerns about the protocol.  It is very hard to get one's head around the fact that, in a democratic society, a parliament has not been established after the people voted.  Normally after a democratic election, the assembly meets and an executive is formed.  Members then get down to dealing with the issues and problems raised in the election.  However, in this case, it seems the DUP wants the issues and problems resolved first before the assembly and government is up and running.  This is turning democracy on its head.  The assembly elections resulted in Sinn F&eacute;in becoming the largest party in the assembly, and the middle ground made its voice heard as seen by the success of the Alliance Party.</p><p>The Good Friday Agreement provides for mandatory power sharing, an obligation to designate, as well as the petition of concern.  Questions have been raised about these provisions and calls for political reform have been made in order to promote normal politics.  The DUP has a veto which it used.  Obviously, any moves towards reform would have to get buy-in from the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in.  This will have to be addressed in the coming years.  I accept that the immediate priority must be to get the institutions up and running again under the current arrangements as soon as possible.  In addition, any future consideration of the Good Friday Agreement must take account of the circumstances surrounding the calling of a border poll.  This should be addressed and clarity should be brought to the matter.</p><p>The British Government has signalled its intention to bring forward legislation to set aside parts of the Northern Ireland protocol.  Here again, it is acting unilaterally.  As we know, the people of Northern Ireland voted against Brexit and the protocol was agreed in the withdrawal agreement to deal with the problems arising from Brexit, in particular to avoid the creation of a hard border on the island of Ireland.  These are legitimate concerns as to the implementation of the protocol and they have to be addressed.  The European Commission Vice President, EU Commissioner Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efčovič, is a very patient man.  Last October, following extensive consultation with all stakeholders in Northern Ireland, he brought forward a flexible package of measures to help resolve these problems.  What is needed now is for flexibility and pragmatism to be shown by both sides in the negotiations.  These problems can be resolved.  The last thing anyone wants is a trade war between the EU and the UK.  It must also be remembered that the protocol presents Northern Ireland with genuine opportunities, in that Northern Ireland can be part of the EU Single Market as well as the UK internal market.</p><p>This has gone on for too long.  The EU and the UK, as well as the USA, have much bigger problems to deal with at present, the war in Ukraine being one example.  It is hard to understand why the UK is not shutting down this issue given overall global problems and the challenge facing us at this time.</p><p>I welcome moves by the British Government to introduce an Irish language Act.  It is perhaps the only positive thing we can talk about today.</p><p>I welcome this debate and hope it will contribute to resolving the many issues that confront us in the British-Irish relationship and the situation in the North.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-25a.221" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1607" speakername="Martin Kenny" time="14:27:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022052500035#NN00200"><p>I recently listened to a representative of the DUP speaking on the radio.  The point he made very strongly was that the North of Ireland should be treated no differently to any other part of the United Kingdom.  He kept reiterating that point.  It brought me back to the days at the very beginning of the negotiations on the Good Friday Agreement.  Everyone recognised at the time, and it was the reason an agreement was needed, that this part of the United Kingdom - as they call it - is on a different island; has a border with another country; a border with the European Union; had a conflict that went on for almost 40 years, in which thousands of people were killed, that needed a negotiated settlement; and has a legacy of colonialism that goes back a couple of hundred years.  The recognition of all of that brought us to a place where we had to come to an agreement and find a way out of and settle those differences.</p>  <p>  The recent issue of the protocol and the demand by a small section of unionism within the higher echelons of the DUP, that is pushing this agenda very hard, is basically to try to wind back the clock to a time before the Good Friday Agreement existed.  That is what is very dangerous about this.  When we weigh it all up, what we want is a situation in which we can find agreement with everyone.  The co-operation that we have had up to now across both governments and all parties, to try to find a way forward, has been the way to do things.</p>  <p>  The recognition of the Good Friday Agreement throughout the globe has been an example of how a peace process can be built.  The recent visit by representatives from the United States is an example of that.  They came here because they recognise that what we have done in Ireland is unique.  It is a unique example to the world of how to build a peace process.  Yet, Boris Johnson and elements of the DUP and a certain group of Tories want to unwind that and kick it out the door.  That is what flies in the face of logic, good common sense and trying to move things forward.</p>  <p>  A few days ago, I spoke to a senior person in the dairy industry, who lives in the Border region, about the amount of milk produced in the North that comes South to be processed.  If this protocol is taken away and we are back to a situation in which there would be checks on the Border, it would destroy that industry.  So many other industries would be destroyed because of it.  Yet, the tiny minority in the higher echelons of unionism insist that they want their way, and it is their way or the highway.  That brings us to a situation in which we have to work with everyone involved.</p>  <p>  I welcome the Minister's speech earlier.</p> <p>I see he is with us in the House.  I commend the work that has been done to try to build alliances and move forward on this.  It not just about the protocol, but the legislation the British Government is proposing in relation to legacy.  All of these things seek to undermine the Good Friday Agreement, which has been underwritten by the US and the EU.  The Irish Government has work to do with the US authorities, including the US President, to get them on board.  While it is welcome that a delegation from the US Congress is visiting Ireland, we need to go to a higher level in the US to put pressure on the British Government to take a different track on all of this.  It is similar with the EU.  We must build international alliances to protect the peace process, which has been an example to the world, and the Government has a huge part to play in doing so.</p> <p> The British Government's Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Bill is passing through the House of Commons.  I believe it has had its Second Reading and may reach Committee Stage in a number of weeks.  It will be passed very quickly.  This Bill has angered thousands of people across the North in all communities.  They see what it is about.  It is about getting away from that which we have always been told is vital, namely, the rule of law.  The British Government wants to set aside the rule of law and introduce immunity for certain people under certain circumstances.  The view of many academics who have looked at the legislation is that this immunity will basically be available to everyone.  That is what the British Government wants to do.  It completely flies in the face of all the agreements that have been concluded until now, including the Good Friday Agreement, the St. Andrews Agreement and the Stormont House Agreement.  When we settle down and look at all of this, we must recognise that the work that needs to be done has to be done for all of us to have a better future.  We must ensure the Irish Government puts maximum pressure on US and European authorities to put pressure on the British Government.</p> <p> I will make a small final point.  Many Deputies spoke about a border poll and the move towards Irish unity.  It is true that as republicans, we want to see Irish unity.  I believe the vast majority of Deputies in this Chamber want to see Irish unity.  The only aspect that we differ on is how we go about achieving it.  However, I think we agree on one point, namely, that there cannot be a border poll in Ireland similar to the Brexit vote held in Britain.  It has to be worked out.  We have to know what we are voting for and what the outcome would be.  To do that, we need to put in place structures.  We need to establish citizens' assemblies, Oireachtas committees and other committees to bring together, in every way possible, the people on both islands, particularly this island, to work out what kind of new Ireland we want to build.  I believe we can all do that together without fighting about it.</p></speech>

They are all very live and important issues that are deserving of our time in this House.  It is important that as we talk about the issues facing Northern Ireland, we ensure that we place the people living there front and centre.  The North of Ireland has experienced so much pain.  It is still reeling from a bloody conflict arising out of the partition of this island and the inequality and division that followed and are maintained today.</p><p>While the Troubles continue to dominate the narrative and paint a very dark picture of Northern Irish life, they are not all that defines the North of Ireland.  While we reflect today on the peace process, the Good Friday Agreement and its institutions as well as the ongoing problems with the protocol, the fallout from Brexit and the challenges now faced regarding power-sharing arrangements, we must move away from considering the North of Ireland as a political state alone, as a problem to be solved.  It is vital to understand and remember that the North is much more than a multitude of complex legal arrangements.  It is a beautiful place, rich in history and culture, with one of the most stunning coastlines you will ever see anywhere in the world.  It is a place dotted with picturesque towns and villages, rolling countryside, beautiful mountains, rivers and lakes and some incredible, buzzing cities, all offering great food, great experiences and extraordinary people.  It has heart and passion; it is more than complex political arrangements.</p><p>We acknowledge that Northern Ireland is a post-conflict society.  We recognise that all traditions and communities have suffered.  Intergenerational and unresolved trauma have been allowed to become embedded and to harden.  The North of Ireland remains a place that is divided by religious and national identity.  In today&rsquo;s Northern Ireland, we have many more communities than we had in the past, including young people who have never experienced the Troubles in their lifetimes, as well as a thriving civil society.  They, too, deserve a place at the table that is deciding their shared future.</p><p>Peace, as we all know, was hard-won and finally came to pass in 1998 with the Good Friday Agreement.  Despite this, the North of Ireland&rsquo;s economy and the Border counties that surround it have not been able to adapt and develop at the same rate and in the same way as other states in the EU, including here in the Republic.  They have, by any measure, had extraordinary barriers put in their way.  Many of these remain, while new issues continue to create even more difficulty.  The North of Ireland remains one of the poorest economic regions of the UK or Ireland.  It has always experienced persistently higher levels of unemployment, low levels of economic investment, lower wages and precarious jobs.  Just before the global pandemic struck, one in five people living in Northern Ireland was living in poverty.  That figure is one in four for those living in the Border counties.  Such numbers will almost certainly surge as a result of rapidly increasing inflation, fuelling one of the worse cost-of-living crises in living memory.  When people went to vote in the Assembly election, those bread-and-butter issues were to the fore of their considerations.</p><p>The decision by the UK to withdraw from the European Union in 2016 came as a shock to us all.  Some 56% of the people of Northern Ireland voted to remain part of Europe.  As is often the case, the voice and concerns of the people of Northern Ireland were neither heard nor listened to during the referendum debate.  Brexit, they warned, could threaten the very integrity of the Good Friday Agreement, stability, peace and any chance of economic growth within the North of Ireland.  A return to a hard border brought with it the fear of a return to the past, to the dark days we all thought were long behind us all.  At a time of great political upheaval arising from Brexit, the Northern Ireland protocol, an arrangement arrived at in large part due to the flexibility of the EU and only put in place in an effort to help maintain stability and peace, offers significant competitive advantages to enterprises in the North.  It is there to avoid a hard border or any kind of border infrastructure across this island.  It does so by providing a customs and regulatory border in the Irish Sea, retaining Northern Ireland's access to the EU Single Market that other parts of the UK do not have.  The unionist parties have insisted that the Northern Ireland protocol damages the North of Ireland, with Jeffrey Donaldson proclaiming that it is costing Northern Ireland &pound;2.5 million a day, or &pound;850 million a year.  It remains entirely unclear where these figures have come from.  A fact-finding article published in <i>The Journal </i>concluded that they may have come from an op-ed written by economist Dr. Esmond Birdie in the <i>Belfast Newsletter</i>last year.  </p><p>I want to touch on some of that research, because it is important to scrutinise these claims as they are being made.  It would appear that this op-ed was based on the data of just four businesses, which Dr. Birdie concluded had incurred an increased cost of 6% in bringing in goods from the UK to the North of Ireland.  This was then extrapolated to the entire Northern Ireland economy, which anyone who has ever conducted research will know is wrong for many reasons.  Most important, Dr. Birdie only looked at the cost of doing business between Northern Ireland and mainland UK, and estimated this generalised 6% increase to be a cost of &pound;650 million.  The DUP has also included potential opportunity costs of another &pound;250 million, which Birdie suggested have been incurred.  The DUP has not clarified where these figures have come from or why it would include alleged opportunity costs which do not arise from the Northern Ireland budget, as it is being paid directly from Westminster, to help support businesses in the North of Ireland with increased costs.  There is no evidence to suggest that this money has been taken away from other Departments in the North of Ireland, such as the Departments of Health and Education.  Even being kind, and it is hard to do so in this case, it is clear that the data and conclusions are unreliable and potentially misleading.</p><p>The DUP has a responsibility to be honest with the people of Northern Ireland.  If quoting figures and data, these should be tested, true and factual.  To do otherwise is misleading and wrong.  It is to the detriment of the people the party claims to represent.  Even if it these figures were true, or even partially true, what Dr. Birdie and the DUP have failed to consider and include are the advantages the protocol has brought to the people of the North of Ireland and businesses trading with countries within the EU.  Data sets on trade between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK are not great.  It is something we should be asking to be improved when dealing with such matters with the UK Government.  The Irish figures are clearer.  The Central Statistics Office, CSO, tells us that during the first 11 months of 2021, for example, imports from Northern Ireland to the Republic increased by 64%, while exports to the North of Ireland rose by 48%.  Those figures do not include figures from any of the other 26 member states.  Despite this, the protocol continues to remain under threat, with the British Government discussing the possibility of unilateral action being taken on the issue in order to placate unionist parties.  It is being triumphalist with the peace that we fought so hard for.</p><p>This is an affront to democracy and to all people in the North of Ireland.  The failure of the unionist parties to accept this arrangement at face value, as an economic edge, and instead to see the protocol as a threat and one that undermines the union, shows us the challenges still faced by the people there today.  The failure of unionist parties to allow Northern Ireland to move on, prosper, become stronger and grow is frustrating to many.  They manufacture concerns and create illusions.  They create monsters and tell people the monsters are to blame.  Perhaps if they held up a mirror to themselves, they would see more clearly where the problem lies.</p> <p>The recent Assembly elections demonstrate very clearly that change is afoot.  For the first time in the Assembly&rsquo;s history, the First Minister will not be a member of the unionist community.  Sinn F&eacute;in has taken the majority and I congratulate the Sinn F&eacute;in MLAs who are present and the party in general.  We have also seen a surge of support for the Alliance Party, which I also congratulate on its performance.  It represents those who do not identify under the two traditional banners and it has more than doubled its seats.  This is an historic moment for the North of Ireland.  Yet again, however, it seems the democratic will of the people of Northern Ireland is being ignored. </p> <p> It is clearer than ever that proper discussions on the future of the island of Ireland, a shared future in which a true republic, one that looks out for the public good, its people and public services and that will prioritise peace and stability, is the only way forward out of what seems to be an almost unsolvable political problem.  We must do everything we can to protect and implement the Good Friday Agreement despite Brexit and all it has brought with it.  We can only hope the UK Government remembers that this is a shared responsibility and one that must be taken seriously.</p> <p> In the meantime, the people of the North of Ireland are watching, waiting and hoping for brighter futures.  The North is not the problem.  In many ways, it is the politicians who are the problem.  Let us do all we can to remedy that by helping to put in place the necessary truth and reconciliation mechanism, to restore trust, preserve peace and move towards a thriving economy and a state that puts its people first.</p> <p> In the brief speaking time remaining to me, I want to add my voice to those of other Deputies from across the Chamber and the political divide in objecting to the Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Bill that seeks to provide an amnesty to people who have murdered.  There is no truth without justice.  I listened to Boris Johnson in Westminster call for vexatious prosecutions to be stopped.  These people, who took the lives of innocent people, including children and people who were shot in the back, must be brought to justice.  We must oppose this proposal at every step of the way.</p></speech>

It should be remembered that from the outset, it was recognised that it was necessary to work at the Good Friday Agreement.  This required all of the constituent bodies to work at it to ensure that it prevailed, regardless of what obstacles came their way.  Unfortunately, at different times and for different reasons, parties decided to withdraw their support.  That was not a good idea and while precedents may be set and various reasons may be put forward as to why this was necessary, it is not good for the agreement or the establishment of trust.  Trust is one of the things that is necessary in the pursuance of the Good Friday Agreement and of the protocol, which I will come to later.</p>  <p>  If we do not have trust, we cannot go forward and work at the agreement but can only work to undermine it.  If we cannot have or get trust, there will be a weakening of the agreement, which is not in the interests of any side on the island of Ireland or in Northern Ireland.  The work of US Senator George Mitchell who was involved in the agreement, as well as the various constituent parties in Northern Ireland, the Irish Government and the British Government at the time, will all be to no avail unless a check is done as to what we need to do from here on in.</p>  <p>  The time is not yet right for a border poll and, by its inference, it would appear to be a threat, although it may not be, to one side in Northern Ireland.  That should not be the case.  That is why the establishment of trust is necessary.  We have to re-establish that trust and try to remember that as we work towards the fruition of what the Good Friday Agreement was supposed to mean, it will mean that responsibilities fall on all sides.  I know some parties in Northern Ireland are doing their best in that regard.  Some are not, but far be it from me to advise them.  I am sure they would say they know best.  We must not forget that Senator George Mitchell was not local and his influence was major and crucial in respect of the Good Friday Agreement because he did not have baggage.</p>  <p>  We now turn to the question of the protocol.  The protocol has been shown as undermining the good relations between the European Union and the UK.  It is not the protocol but Brexit.  For heaven&rsquo;s sake, why can everybody not recognise that?  The protocol is not the problem.  It was put in place to ease the problems created by Brexit, not to create a problem in itself.  It does not create a problem but over time people saw fit to see it as the difficulty.  Let us not forget that the previous UK Prime Minister had introduced a different system that was no threat to anyone but it was rejected.</p>  <p>  Returning to the question of trust, there is no sense in having an international agreement in any way, shape or form unless there is respect and trust.  Where now stand international agreements and what can be said about such agreements if one or other side wants to walk away from them?  If one or either side walks away now, it is a matter for the other side to walk away also.  There is no establishment of trust.  The establishment of trust has to be addressed as a matter of great urgency.</p>  <p>  I am very disappointed that the UK and its Prime Minister have seen fit to embark on a unilateral response to what is an international agreement to which the UK signed up.  This was not accidental.  The UK signed up to the agreement in good faith, as did all of the other constituent bodies, and the expectation is on the UK as well as everybody else.  It goes without saying that if international agreements are to mean anything in the future, trust and respect for international agreements must re-emerge.  If there is no respect for international agreements and no trust, then everything fails.  It would be an appalling tragedy on the island of Ireland if, on the one hand, that trust does not re-emerge and, on the other hand, international agreements are not recognised as such, as indicated in the language used.</p>  <p>  In whatever way we can, we should try to ensure that all of the different constituent bodies are brought together in such a way as to ensure that nobody is a threat to the other and that whatever differences have arisen can be worked out, without rubbing anybody&rsquo;s nose or face in the grit.  This is to recognise that it is in everybody&rsquo;s interest to bring this issue forward and stand by the Good Friday Agreement and the protocol, which was also worked on very hard by the European Union and all involved.</p>  <p>  Future generations will look very harshly at those who cause a problem and walk away from it.  It is not possible to walk away from a solemn international agreement and expect nothing to happen.  It is irresponsible.</p></speech>

Trust is a precarious thing.  It is earned and is not a given.  Unilateralism directly undermines trust.  Diminished trust and faith in our UK counterparts only serves to impinge potential progress on a breakthrough or potential solution.  We have to acknowledge that there are genuine concerns around the protocol and we all need to challenge ourselves to come up, within the overarching protocol agreement, to find innovative, workable, common-sense solutions.  Pragmatism must win out and common sense solutions must be sought out.  Unilateral action does not contribute to solutions.</p>  <p>  We in Ireland are lucky that our EU counterparts have stood by us in our dealings with the protocol and its implementation.  Vice-President &Scaron;efčovič has indicated that he and his team are ready to deal with the UK at any time.  He has indicated that he is open to discussing solutions and has stated that he sees further potential in exploring additional flexibilities around trade, customs and SPS arrangements, for example.</p> <p>A joint EU-UK solution is the only resolution to this impasse, particularly in the areas around trade and to protect the Good Friday Agreement and its institutions.  The protocol clearly recognises the constitutional position of Northern Ireland and the principle of consent under the agreement.  In the immediate aftermath of the northern elections, it is clear a majority of MLAs support the protocol.  We must now see an early resumption of the Executive in order to ensure an efficient application of the protocol's principles.  Ultimately, any calls for reopening of negotiations around the protocol are unrealistic.  Ireland continues to engage with EU partners and institutions and with all stakeholders on the island to work through the withdrawal agreement and the protocol itself.</p> <p> Regarding the Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Bill, it is disappointing to see the UK Government introduce and press ahead with it despite the clear misgivings across all stakeholder groups.  Government parties have been speaking to victim groups to hear their views.  The message from those groups, which represent people affected by State-sponsored violence, is clear.  They have fundamental concerns regarding the powers of the commission for information recovery, for example, and the status of the reviews proposed in the Bill.  Last week, we marked the 48th anniversary of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, which was a reminder of the justice that was not served for all the families affected.</p> <p> Cuirim f&aacute;ilte freisin roimh an mBille teanga a bh&iacute; curtha s&iacute;os i Westminister inniu.  Bh&iacute; s&eacute; d&iacute;om&aacute;ch le feice&aacute;il go dt&iacute; seo go raibh cosc ar chur chun cinn an Bhille seo i Stormont ach anois, mar a bh&iacute; leagtha s&iacute;os in &oacute;r&aacute;id na banr&iacute;ona na seachtaine seo caite, t&aacute; Rialtas na Breataine f&eacute;in chun an dl&iacute; seo a bhogadh ar aghaidh.  Cabhr&oacute;idh s&eacute; seo le f&aacute;s na Gaolainne agus leis an meas at&aacute; uirthi sa Tuaisceart.  T&aacute; s&eacute; f&iacute;orth&aacute;bhachtach go mbeidh an ceart sin ag daoine sa Tuaisceart &oacute; thaobh a bhf&eacute;ini&uacute;lachta f&eacute;in a l&eacute;iri&uacute; ina socha&iacute; f&eacute;in.  T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go gcabhr&oacute;idh Rialtas na Breataine leis an mBille seo a chur ar aghaidh chomh luath agus is f&eacute;idir.</p> <p> Fianna F&aacute;il's priority in regard to Northern Ireland is, and always has been, the protection of the Good Friday Agreement and its institutions.  As a party of government, we need to support all parties in the North and work collaboratively with our British counterparts to ensure we have a functioning Executive.  That is how it is supposed to work.  Instead, alas, we see the UK Government acting unilaterally to introduce legislation that moves us away from this collaborative approach and away from the processes agreed under the Stormont House Agreement.  It is my view and that of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party that this is not in keeping with the spirit or motivations of the Good Friday Agreement.  It is imperative that the Northern Ireland Assembly is resumed without delay.  It is a sad reflection on any society when certain parties are intent on ignoring the democratic will of their citizens and are instead bent on institutionalising the political limbo and paralysis we are experiencing at present.</p> <p> The rationale behind the Good Friday Agreement and the entire peace process was built on both Governments working together collaboratively with all parties in the North.  The Government of Boris Johnson and Liz Truss is diverging from this approach, as evidenced in the legacy proposals and its attempt now to roll back on the protocol and disregard international, legally binding agreements.  The role of the United States in all of this must be acknowledged.  We met with a number of public representatives from that country in Leinster House yesterday, who remain steadfast in their support for Ireland, respecting the Good Friday Agreement and ensuring the implementation of the protocol proceeds.</p></speech>

That is absolutely no surprise.  In 2014, the British Government was a co-signatory, with the five main parties in the North, to the Stormont House Agreement.  That agreement was the first sign that there would be a human rights-based, legally compliant approach to the outstanding matter of victims' rights following our conflict.  The Good Friday Agreement made only cursory mention of victims and survivors, but it did mention that it was important to address the suffering of victims and survivors and it acknowledged that justice was essential for peace.  After that, we witnessed piecemeal, if important, approaches to addressing the experiences of some victims.  It was not enough.</p>  <p>  The proposals of the Consultative Group on the Past, a body appointed by the British Government, included, among a wide range of recommendations, human rights-compliant investigations.  The British Government rejected the proposals of the body it had appointed.  Victims then saw the proposals from the Haass-O'Sullivan process disregarded by unionism.  In 2014, with all the vested interests at the table, there was progress at last.  The stalling and bad faith by the British Government since that date have been a source of incredible disappointment and frustration for families, with many family members, sadly, passing away in the meantime.  It is worth noting that in parallel with this bad faith, the British Government, when reporting to the United Nations and the Council of Europe, has relied on its commitment to the implementation of the Stormont House Agreement as its vehicle for remedy of outstanding and serious human rights violations.  Last year's command paper on dealing with the legacy of the past indicated that this bad faith was now out in the open.  The British Government was willing unilaterally to abandon its intergovernmental approach on the Stormont House Agreement and, by extension, the Good Friday Agreement.  In doing so, it was willing to abandon its legal and moral obligations to victims and survivors.</p>  <p>  Yesterday, the Conservative Party passed Second Stage of the Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Bill, notwithstanding that every single political party on this island, North and South, clearly opposed its contents, and with disregard to every single victims and survivors group.  It has done so despite all legal and independent advice that the Bill is anti-law and anti-human rights.  We in the D&aacute;il must acknowledge that while the British Government might try to enter rogue state territory with its approach, victims and survivors - Irish citizens - retain their human rights.  We must strive to ensure those rights are upheld.  If the mothers of children killed with impunity can stand in dignity and with resolve, like Marian Walsh, the mother of 17-year-old Damien, who was killed at his work in 1993, did yesterday, with complete determination, outside the Northern Ireland Office's shiny new building in Belfast, then we must stand with them.  If Alana McShane, the sister of 17-year-old Gavin, who was killed while going to school in 1994, only weeks before the ceasefire, could leave her mother Maria's month's mind yesterday to travel to Downing Street to hand in a letter to Boris Johnson, then we can amplify her voice.</p>  <p>  The British Government thinks it can do whatever it wants to citizens in this country.  It thinks it can be responsible for killings, collusion in killings, cover-up of its nefarious practices and perpetuating impunity, and then pretend to be neutral.  It thinks it can introduce an amnesty for all actors to the conflict with a veil of truth exchange that is of no value and that debases the very concept of truth.  It thinks hurt, pain and trauma can be swept aside.  The British Government does not care for these victims at all and it does not know them.  It does not know their courage, determination or, indeed, their resolve.  These families are saying they will never give in.  We all, to a person, must join them.</p></speech>

Liz Truss said recently: &quot;We will not rest until those responsible for atrocities, including military commanders and individuals... have faced justice.&quot;  I deliberately left out four words, namely, &quot;in the Putin regime&quot;.  What type of hypocrisy is this coming from the mouth of the British Government?  The Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Bill does the opposite of Ms Truss's declaration in respect of her Government's legacy in Northern Ireland.</p><p>The Relatives for Justice group has reacted very strongly to what has happened, and correctly so.  Those with the memory and pain of decades of fighting for justice and truth, on both sides, are hugely insulted and will continue to campaign.  Relatives for Justice stated:</p> <blockquote> 	We need to remember this is the very same Tory Government that fought families in courts to prevent disclosure and discovery of information, including locking down files for a hundred years in some cases.  And now they are locking down the courts and have the audacity to tell victims the process they propose will deliver and is in society's best interests.  The only interests served are those of the British establishment. </blockquote>  <p>The Tories are speaking to their base with this Bill, at the expense of all the people impacted by the legacy of the so-called Troubles.  Much of that legacy lies at the door of British imperialist policies that covered up and facilitated extreme sectarian murders and collusion, whether directly through regiments of the British army, such as the Parachute Regiment, or through its own creation, the Ulster Defence Regiment, UDR, which was most recently exposed by research, entirely compiled from official British Government records, carried out by the Pat Finucane Centre.  I am proud to say that my nephew, Miche&aacute;l Smith, is the author of <i>UDR: Declassified</i>.  He clearly illustrates that the legacy he reveals in the book is not his opinion but is reflective of facts from the horse's mouth, based on the files the British Government has released.  We should not tolerate hypocrisy of this nature from that government.  Instead, we must support the families in continuing to seek truth and justice for all who have been impacted so cruelly by the legacy issues.</p> <p>It was correctly named last week, on an RT&Eacute; programme I was on, by a representative of the Northern Ireland haulier's association who said the protocol was a logistics issue, not a political issue.  However, it has been cynically used - these are my words, not his - by the DUP and the Tories to whip up a constitutional crisis that they hope will mask the crisis in unionism.  Democratic unionists who opposed the protocol because it makes trade in goods easier with the Republic of Ireland than with the rest of the UK claim it has raised retail prices by 27%.  This is not backed by any publicly available data.  Findings from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research pour cold water on the Tory and DUP claims that the protocol requirement for EU checks on British goods arriving in Northern Ireland has undermined business opportunities.  The opposite is in fact the case.  From the same source, the post-Brexit trade protocol is helping, not hurting, growth and profitability in Northern Ireland because of its advantages for access to the EU markets.</p> <p> It is fascinating to see how the DUP proposes no border in the Irish Sea for trading in goods, but that is exactly what it wants in reaction to women's rights and abortion in its recent statements.  It wants a border in the Irish Sea for women accessing reproductive rights but not for goods trading.  We should not pander to this bigotry.  Once again, the DUP and the Tories are using the protocol to introduce a Thatcherite nightmare of unbridled free trade.  The reality is the DUP is in severe crisis and is using the protocol to block the formation of a Stormont government and ignore the democratic outcomes of the recent Northern Ireland elections.  It has failed to achieve an outcome that would suit it, rather than the outcome that the people of Northern Ireland completely democratically voted for.  There is a great irony in the DUP's title.  It is the so-called democratic unionist party that is doing everything to block democracy.</p> <p> Trade and business statistics may be a bit healthier north of the Border, according to the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, but - this is a big but - the lives of ordinary workers and families have deteriorated, as they have south of the Border and, indeed, across the water.  There have been crushing price hikes in energy, food and transport and a considerable deterioration in wages, incomes and public services.  The cost-of-living crisis affects both north and south of the Border and throughout these islands.</p> <p> On 18 June, an action is being supported and promoted by the Trades Union Congress, TUC, throughout Britain.  We are building for a similar action here in the Republic to get the response of ordinary people to demand that what is needed is done and that the governments on these islands, crucially, do much more to alleviate the hardship on workers and families.  It is not just to make the political establishment account for itself in terms of that economic hardship.  It will also help to undermine the dinosaurs of the DUP and the Tory Party who dominate the political establishment.  I urge everybody to put their shoulder to the wheel and get involved in that action.</p></speech>

I will comment on the Tories' legacy Bill and two of the industrial disputes currently taking place in Northern Ireland, and then I will see as to whether I might squeeze in another point.  The legacy Bill was well summed up by Suzanne Breen, writing in the <i>Belfast Telegraph</i>, when she wrote:</p> <blockquote> 	The Tories bill includes not only an effective amnesty for perpetrators, it also shuts down all new civil cases by victims' families and Police Ombudsman investigations as well as inquests which haven't yet opened.  This goes far beyond preventing the odd Army veteran standing in a dock.  It is the State shutting down all avenues for the public airing of its squalid little secrets. </blockquote>  <p>Ms Breen also notes that this involves cases that involve British state collusion with loyalist paramilitaries and increasing allegations of the British state protecting its own high-level informers involved in killings by the IRA.  This illustrates an important point that the Socialist Party has made, that not only can we not rely on the British state for justice, we cannot rely on any of the sectarian forces in the North to subject their own role during the Troubles to real scrutiny.</p><p>I will use this Chamber to condemn the threat by Ulster University management effectively to lock out teaching staff if they engage in a marking boycott as part of legitimate industrial action to protect pay and pensions and to challenge the increasing casualisation of employment.  I recently visited Belfast and spent some time on the Unite picket lines organised by striking Caterpillar workers.  These workers are seeking a decent pay increase from a company that describes itself as a dividend aristocrat.  It has paid increased dividends every year for 28 years.  These workers have now been left out on the picket lines without any give from this dividend aristocrat for six weeks.  While the company continues to enjoy business relations with data centres in the Republic, including some of the biggest tech names in the world, these workers are left outside for six weeks.</p><p>These big tech companies like to project themselves as being mindful of their social responsibilities.  Maintaining business connections with a company that is playing hardball against strikers does not seem very socially responsible to me or to others.  Those companies might do well to urge Caterpillar to treat its workforce more fairly and with more respect.  I intend to return to this issue in the near future if this dispute is not solved on the basis of justice.</p><p>I would have liked to make some points about the protocol but I cannot deal with that issue in a serious fashion in 40 seconds.  That is another issue to which I hope to return quite soon.</p></speech>

Once again, we are debating Northern Ireland issues, legacy issues and the need to implement the protocol and to deal with outstanding issues relevant to it.  It is most disappointing that the institutions established by the Good Friday Agreement are not in place or working on behalf of the people at present.  In recent days, we celebrated the 24th anniversary of the referendums North and South, where 94% of the electorate in this State and 71.1% of the electorate in Northern Ireland voted to accept and adopt the Good Friday Agreement.  That is the mandate that all of us have, as politicians in the North and South of this country.  We should be implementing that mandate and working the institutions that were established by the Good Friday Agreement.</p>  <p>  We should take the opportunity to pay tribute to the Government leaders such as Mr. Blair and Mr. Ahern, as leaders of their respective Governments, and the political parties in Northern Ireland who contributed to and brought about the agreement that won the support of the international community.  As we know, the Irish and British Governments are co-guarantors of the agreement which is an international agreement lodged in the United Nations.</p>  <p>  It is just not sustainable or acceptable that the people of Northern Ireland elected their representatives to an assembly that is not meeting and cannot function.  What the Democratic Unionist Party has done is anti-democratic in every respect.  The assembly and the people selected by the electorate should be there working on behalf of their constituents and in the best interests of all.  It is most disappointing we have the Good Friday Agreement and its institutions not operating at present.  The British Government has to bear responsibility in that respect as well.</p>  <p>  We can talk about what is not working in Northern Ireland or for the benefit of all of this island, which are the institutions established by the Good Friday Agreement such as the assembly, the Executive and the North-South Ministerial Council.  Thankfully, however, in the meantime we all continue to enjoy the benefits of the Good Friday Agreement in this country.  We often ignore the powerful development of the all-Ireland economy that has evolved since the signing and endorsement of the Good Friday Agreement 24 years ago.</p> <p>As a representative of two of the southern Ulster counties, I see the great growth in cross-Border trade.  I see businesses that may only have been located in our jurisdiction now having good, profitable enterprises north of the Border.  Similarly, businesses that only had a presence in Northern Ireland have a presence in our State now.  That happens daily.  That would not have happened if not for the Good Friday Agreement.  There are deficits, with the institutions not working at the moment, but we should remind ourselves we have the benefits of what has come from the Good Friday Agreement and the new political dispensation of which all of us in this country are beneficiaries.</p> <p> With regard to the protocol, when any of us who represent Border counties interact with businesses north of the Border, due to the likelihood of them having a presence in our State, they say they want any obstacles to trade removed and for the protocol to be dealt with.  They also see the benefits from the protocol, with equal access for businesses to the British market and the European Single Market of 450 million people.  A message has to go constantly to the British Government that the European Union wants a practical solution to the implementation of the protocol.  Those issues can be worked through by negotiation, not by any government taking unilateral action.  The Taoiseach has been clear when answering questions in this House that the EU will be flexible when dealing with issues that are of concern to businesses, individuals or communities in Northern Ireland.  It is important the protocol is dealt with as soon as possible.</p> <p> I refer again to the legacy issues.  A week ago on Talbot Street in Dublin, we marked the awful tragedies of 17 May 1974, 48 years ago, when 33 innocent people were killed and hundreds were injured and maimed for life, in some cases, in Monaghan and Dublin.  It is deplorable that the British Government has not responded to the unanimous requests of the Houses of the Oireachtas from 2008, 2011 and 2016, asking for an independent, eminent legal person to be given access to all papers and files pertaining to the Dublin-Monaghan bombings.  It is reprehensible there has not been a response by the British Government.</p> <p> The same goes for other terrible atrocities.  I have often spoken in this House about the murder of two innocent young teenagers in Belturbet on 27 December 1972, when Geraldine O'Reilly and Patrick Stanley lost their lives to a bomb that was brought across the Border from County Fermanagh.  Almost two years ago, I put on the record of this House information that had come to me through research at the University of Nottingham which disclosed, through British state papers and archives, that there was collusion in that bomb being brought across the Border from County Fermanagh to County Cavan on that night.  It was a fatal night, with the deaths of two young innocent teenagers and injuries being caused to many other people.  Families have grieved for decades and that grief goes on to the next generation.  The least they deserve is the truth about who carried out those atrocities and murders.  Sadly, the chances of having a prosecution are limited, which I fully recognise.  People have campaigned with dignity and grace about murders and tragedies that beset their families.  All they would say to us is we need to get the truth.  They are not seeking revenge or vengeance.  These issues need to be dealt with.</p></speech>

I hope it will be enacted by the summer recess at the latest.  The Dearg le Fearg march last weekend showed there is a large community of people who desire proper supports for the Irish language and for rights to be conferred on Irish speakers.  I welcome that there are separate provisions for Ulster Scots and indigenous cultures in this Bill.  We in Ireland have to learn that inclusivity is not to be feared.  Generosity and inclusivity in our dealings enrich us all and do not threaten anybody's identity.  I say that as an habitual Irish speaker.  It does not threaten me one bit if somebody is from a different country.</p><p>I am a republican and I believe that real republicanism in Ireland is inclusive and wants to see a new Ireland where decisions on this island are made in an inclusive way by all of the people of this island, whether their natural background is unionist or nationalist.  I feel at times that our approach to resolving the new issues caused by Brexit was dealt with in a slightly confrontational way rather than in an inclusive way.  I fully agree there should not be any border on the island of Ireland.  From my talks, I believe many in the DUP privately accept and know this.  It was always going to be difficult for them to have checks in the Irish Sea.  We have to differentiate between British interests and the totally different interests of the unionists in the North.  We have to take into account their sensibilities and try to find a way forward.  A problem was that neither the Irish nationalist community nor the unionist community, whether in the North or South, were actually engaged in the front-line talks.  The engagement of talks always leads to the acceptance of the final compromise.  We have never fully addressed that.</p><p>It will be vital for the UK and the EU to protect the dual position of Northern Ireland in the EU and the UK customs union and in the EU Single Market in as unobtrusive a manner as possible within the terms of the protocol and to try to make the movement of goods between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, and <i>vice versa</i>, as seamless as possible.  If one asked who did the most for the peace and security of the people of Northern Ireland out of the British Army, the PSNI and Gordon Wilson, I would say Gordon Wilson.  He did it without any guns or security apparatus by reaching across in the most difficult point of his life.  We have had relative peace for the past number of years.  The last killing associated with the Troubles was that of Lyra McKee.</p><p>I would not let complacency lull us into a false sense of security.  I have worked for years to persuade people from the physical force tradition that a much better way to realise their aims is through the political process and by persuasion.  I have also fought for their human rights in prison and outside it.  Peace will only be possible if they believe they are treated with fairness and respect.  Those who believe a more draconian security approach is the answer to defusing the perceived threat are wrong.</p><p>I have major concerns about a number of issues in the North of Ireland.  One relates to prison conditions for segregated prisoners, including strip-searching, controlled movement, isolation and lack of education facilities.  Incessant stop and search is carried out on the families of perceived dissenting republicans.  There are long remands, of up to three years, and strict bail for up to eight years before cases are brought to trial.</p> <p>There also seems to be a policy of arrest and release in certain areas.  Family bank accounts have been closed by the authorities, leaving whole families without access to welfare payments.  I and two comrades who work with me will be preparing a submission on this for the Minister for Foreign Affairs, which he asked me to do.

Last year I had the honour of meeting Maria in her home in County Armagh.  Although she was in her sick bed at the time, she was in good spirits and it was easy to see why Maria had earned the love of all those who knew her.  The best way to describe Maria McShane is that she was a typical rural Irish mammy.  She was witty, endearing and committed to her family.  Hers was not to be life of a typical Irish mammy, however, because by an accident of birth she happened to live in County Armagh rather than County Monaghan or County Louth, for example.</p>  <p>  Despite growing up and living in the Northern State which denied her her basic rights as a citizen, Maria stayed away from politics.  She just got on with her life.  She worked hard and found love when she met Matt McShane.  They got married and planned for a normal, quiet, happy life.  On 16 August 1976, Maria was in the Step Inn pub in Keady, County Armagh when a bomb exploded.  Ostensibly the bomb was planted by the UVF but we now know it was part of the campaign of terror waged by the Glenanne gang, a group infiltrated and controlled by members of British State forces.  Two people were killed in that explosion.  Up to 20 others were injured and Maria McShane was one of them.  She lost an eye in the bombing.  Her greatest concern at that time was for her unborn child.  Miraculously, that child survived and Gavin McShane became his mother's pride and joy.</p>  <p>  Gavin grew into his teenage years and by all accounts he was just a lovely young fellow.  He was good craic, he was mad into his hurling and simply enjoyed life.  In the cruellest imaginable twist of fate, Gavin was killed by the same forces that had attempted to kill his mother while he was still in her womb.  On 18 May 1994, Gavin McShane was with his friend Shane McArdle in a taxi depot in Armagh playing a computer game, when an unmasked gunman, a suspected British State agent, entered the depot, opened fire and killed both boys.  The lives of their loved ones changed forever.  For Maria, alongside dealing with the unbearable lifelong grief that comes to every parent who has lost a child in such circumstances, it also marked the beginning of a decades long campaign that continued up until the moment she exhaled her last breath.</p>  <p>  Like so many other families that were victims of British collusion in Ireland, the McShanes encountered blockages and barriers every step of the road.  Those blockages and barriers are still in place.  Just as Maria's ability to simply grieve her son was hindered by her need to campaign for truth and justice, so too have her children been unable to simply grieve for their mother in the weeks after her death.  Last week, Maria's son Caoinn was in Hillsborough to protest at the arrival of British Prime Minster Boris Johnson.  Yesterday her daughter Alana was in London on a Relatives for Justice delegation to Downing Street to protest at the British Government's despicable attempts to make official what has been always their unofficial policy, that their forces and agents should be permitted to murder Irish citizens with impunity.  Maria sadly is no longer with us but her persistent determination in the pursuit of truth and justice clearly has been passed on to another generation.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach last July agreed that he would meet with the family of Gavin McShane to discuss how the Irish Government can assist their campaign.  That meeting unfortunately has yet to occur.  I appeal to the Minister of State that he encourage the Taoiseach's office to facilitate that meeting as a matter of urgency.  I want to use this opportunity to convey my sincere sympathies to Maria's husband, Matt, to Caoinn and Alana and their families on the loss of a great Irish mammy.

Unionism is now a minority political view in the North of Ireland.  This has been the case for the past number of elections but Unionist leaders have still not realised it.  If those of a minority political view want to shape the future, they have a responsibility to work with others.  Unfortunately, Unionism has not seemed to realise this.  Unionists are still relying on a veto which is a remnant of the past.  It is the cause of major difficulties on the island of Ireland.  It is the cause of the collapse of the Executive in the North and of the political impasse we are experiencing at the moment.</p>  <p>  If Unionists want the Union between the North of Ireland and Britain to continue, they have to show Nationalists and republicans that the North works for them.  The collapsing of the Executive and the North South Ministerial Council, and the British Government murder amnesty have all shown without a shadow of a doubt that the Northern State does not work for Irish Nationalists.  Indeed, an increasing section of Unionism have realised that the state is not working for them either.  Unionist leadership is currently pushing Nationalism and some Unionists towards Irish unity.</p>  <p>  The level of political self-harm within Unionism is absolutely astounding.  The DUP has shown some of the worst political leadership in the whole of Europe over the last years.  Remember how we got here.  They campaigned for Brexit.  They ignored the result in the North of Ireland.  They refused Theresa May's deal and backed Boris Johnson in his pursuit of the protocol in the first place.  Another example of political self-harm within Unionism is this instinct always to look in the rear-view mirror when they are in a leadership position.  They have been completely distracted over the past months by Jim Allister and Jamie Bryson.  They have allowed a small section of Unionism to grasp the initiative and set the agenda of the whole Unionist political view.</p>  <p>  The major fear Unionism has is that it does not want to get Trimbled.  By that I mean that David Trimble went through the same experience; he looked in the rear-view mirror, saw Ian Paisley and saw the negativity that leadership was bringing to their politics at the time and as a result reversed into that isolation as well.  One of the major problems we have to get over is the Unionist ability to veto political progress.  It has to be finished with.  If it is left in place, we are guaranteed to see the fall of the Executive over and over again.</p>  <p>  We also have to get rid of British unilateralism.  It is causing so much difficulty at the moment.  The only way to get rid of it is to get tough with the British Government.  I will speak more on this issue later as well.  I want to refer to a kerfuffle that is happening in the North of Ireland at the moment regarding language that Congressman Richard Neal used.  He used the term "planter" and many Unionists have stated that they are offended by this use of language.  Aont&uacute; is a republican party.  Our republicanism is based on that of Wolfe Tone, of Catholic, Protestant and Dissenter being able to be who they are to their full extent without fear or favour of the State.  We believe all language should be respectful in all cases.  However, it seems to us that there is a competition to see who can be most offended at the moment, especially within Unionism.</p>  <p>  As a democrat, I think people have a right to be offended that there is no Executive.  I believe people who voted for the Good Friday Agreement have a right to be offended by the fact that there is no North South Ministerial Council at the moment.  I would even say that people have a right to be offended by the fact that there are 670,000 in the North of Ireland living in poverty right now, that there are 44,000 people on a housing waiting list and 270,000 people on a hospital waiting list for more than a year.  I would be offended that we have a political class still claiming a salary while not participating in an Executive to fix those issues.  It is an incredible situation.  The refusal by the Unionist leadership before the election to accept a Nationalist First Minister was offensive to many people.</p>  <p>  Hundreds of thousands of people will be absolutely offended today by the British decision to introduce the murder amnesty into the North of Ireland.  Hundreds of families have had loved ones murdered by British soldiers or proxies in this country, North and South.  The Southern Government has done precious little in terms of vindicating their right to justice or truth.</p> <p>We in Aont&uacute; have created a new Bill that would constitute a commission of investigation to investigate British collusion.  It would take evidence in this State and allow evidence to be taken from other states and state reports written on collusion to fill in the gaps.  People who have suffered because of British collusion are all reaching a certain age and many of them are approaching the end of their lives, so achieving truth and justice for them is urgent.  I would welcome it if MLAs in the North of Ireland constituted a similar Bill.  If Bills were enacted on both sides of the Border, it would be possible to compel witnesses north and south.</p> <p> There is an ongoing row between Mr. Jon Boutcher, An Garda and the Minister for Justice over the handover of State files in respect of ongoing investigations into the Glenanne gang and the murder of Mr. Seamus Ludlow.  I met the Taoiseach and members of the families of people murdered by the Glenanne gang as far back as Christmas.  They were discussing a resolution in respect of some of these files but the files are still not being handed over by An Garda to the people carrying out the investigation.  That is a matter we can resolve in this jurisdiction.</p> <p> The language used by Richard Neal was archaic.  I would not have used the word he used, but I believe unionists have used it themselves, including Mr. Peter Robinson on one occasion.  I have no doubt that Mr. Neal did not mean to offend in using the word.  The US has been a massive friend to this country economically and in underwriting the Good Friday Agreement.  The agreement would not have been delivered without the work of people such as Mr. George Mitchell at the time in question.  It is worth saying that some American investors are getting cold feet over the fact that the Executive is still suspended in the North.  Funds that were necessary to get the companies up and running are not now forthcoming, and some of them are rethinking whether to proceed with their investments.</p> <p> I want to raise the attack on the human right to life by Mr. Brandon Lewis.  The right to life is obviously the most important right that anybody has.  It is a devolved issue in the North.  Most people in the North have said over and over that it should be decided by the elected representatives there.  However, Mr. Lewis is now rolling out some of the most extreme abortion legislation in Europe in the North of Ireland.  Abortion is to be allowed for up to 24 weeks for a child without disabilities and right up until birth for a child with disabilities.  It is therefore up to 40 weeks for a child with Down's syndrome or a cleft palate.  It is incredibly heartbreaking.  We should have compassion for and offer supports and protections to both the mother and child.  This is a devolved issue, yet the British Government is forcing its measure through against the rules of the Good Friday Agreement.  The measure has the support of Sinn F&eacute;in and some elements of the SDLP, unfortunately, but nobody in the Irish Government has raised a voice about it.  This is startling, not to mention the substantive issue.  That what the British Government is doing is against the Good Friday Agreement is a major problem that the Irish Government should be pushing back against.</p> <p> The protocol is an outcome of Brexit.  The checks are a practical protection of the integrity of the two markets.  The protocol is the logistical outcome that has to be achieved to make sure Brexit functions.  Aont&uacute; believes there should be a reduction in the number of checks and they should be made only where necessary.  An important point that people forget is that if we were to reduce practically every single check tied to the protocol, a section of unionists would still oppose the protocol.  This is because it is not an economic issue for them.  They would chop their noses off to spite their faces.  For them, it is about the fact that the North is in a different place economically than the rest of their United Kingdom.  To the Irish Government, I say we need to be far stronger in defending the Good Friday Agreement and ensuring all the protections are put in place for it.  However, we also need to speak to civic society unionists.  Business and trade organisations, many of which represent unionist businesses in the North, admit that some of the checks are causing a trade difficulty, but many of them are happy that the North is now in an economic sweet spot in terms of its being able to trade with Britain and the European Union.  We need to reach out and sometimes speak over the leadership of unionism to the citizens themselves.</p> <p> F&aacute;ilt&iacute;m go bhfuil Acht um teangacha ag dul tr&iacute;d an bParlaimint thall i Londain ag an bomaite.  T&aacute; s&eacute; dochreidte agus uaf&aacute;sach nach raibh Stormont s&aacute;sta &eacute; a chur i bhfeidhm sa Tuaisceart.  Le c&uacute;namh D&eacute;, beidh s&eacute; ag dul ar aghaidh go tapa agus n&iacute; bheidh n&iacute;os m&oacute; bac sa phr&oacute;iseas sin.</p> <p> I believe the Tories and DUP have totalled the Good Friday Agreement and the democratic rights of the people of the North of Ireland.  The Irish Government is a co-guarantor of an international agreement.  I do not believe it is co-guaranteeing anything at the moment.  It is beyond time that it fulfilled its responsibilities.  It should be exhausting every single international legal route to make sure this international agreement is fully upheld.  It should be seeking the suspension of MLA salaries to ensure no MLAs who are not doing their job will be paid.  The Government must harness the full power of the White House and the EU to put pressure on the British Government.  We need to see a reconstitution of the British&ndash;Irish Intergovernmental Conference and push for joint authority while Stormont is collapsed.</p> <p> Very importantly &ndash; the T&aacute;naiste mentioned this in his speech in the North, which I welcomed &ndash; we need to look for a legally defined role for the Assembly in achieving or activating an Irish unity poll.  Currently, that role is in the hands of the Northern Secretary in Westminster.  That is not good enough.  We need a legally defined role for the Assembly, the representatives of the people of the North of Ireland, to trigger the Irish unity poll.</p> <p> I welcome the fact that the language of the Minister for Foreign Affairs has become stronger in recent weeks.  There is no doubt that the British Government certainly does not understand subtlety, but the major crisis in the North is happening over and over.  The reason, I believe, is that both Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il still see this as an issue to be managed when it is a crisis, and they still deal at arm's length with, and are still not being strong enough in defence of, the Good Friday Agreement.</p></speech>

It is such a vast debate that I will not be able to address all the points I would like to make.  I will simply focus on the latest row over the implementation of the post-Brexit agreement, known as the Northern Ireland protocol.  I welcome the fact that the British foreign secretary, Ms Liz Truss, is visiting Belfast.  I am sure she is very grateful to be away from the chaos in Westminster, given what we have been seeing on our television screens and the various reports.</p><p>I was very taken by an article by the foreign secretary this morning in <i>The Irish Times</i>.  In the article, she lays out a position similar to the one she laid out last week.  The tone of the article is welcome, which should be acknowledged, and many of the points are not too unfamiliar, but let us be frank that the article is absolutely laced with contradictions and the sort of revisionism that has sadly become all too familiar among members of a very politically driven British Government at this stage.  I would like to refer to a few of the points made.  In paragraph 3 of the article, the foreign secretary refers to the need for all three interlocking strands of the Good Friday Agreement &quot;to function successfully&quot;.  Of course, as has been mentioned umpteen times, we do not have a power-sharing government at Stormont on the basis of cross-community consent.  Indeed, this whole sorry Brexit process quite clearly does not have cross-community consent, considering that the majority of people in the North voted against it.</p><p>Strong North&ndash;South co-operation is now redundant due to the continuing unionist boycott of the North&ndash;South institutions, which the British Government did very little to stop.  In the same paragraph, the foreign secretary refers to enhanced east&ndash;west arrangements between London and Dublin.  This is farcical.  While it is a reference to something that would be welcome, how many times has the British&ndash;Irish Intergovernmental Conference met?  How many times has the British&ndash;Irish Council been attended by the current and previous Prime Ministers?  There is no point in paying lip service.</p><p>The foreign secretary states, &quot;Respecting these complexities, the Northern Ireland Protocol was agreed with the best of intentions.&quot;  When I drew down my mortgage, I did not say to my bank manager that I would sign the papers and commit to the payments with the best of intentions; I did so under a legal obligation.  It is pretty obvious what would happen if my wife and I were to miss payments.  Ms Truss uses the phrase &quot;after 18 months of trying to make it work&quot;.  Well, I tell you, 18 months of trying very little is what I have seen.</p> <p>There have been 18 months of continuous threats of unilateral action and invoking Article 16 from this British Government, involving countless ministers and former ministers.  The foreign secretary's predecessor as chief negotiator, Lord Frost, has made it his business to wreck this entire process and the agreement he agreed to, signed and said was one of the best offers.  Putting those words in a newspaper is an insult to the intelligence of all the good readers of <i>The Irish Times</i>, including me.<br/><br/>The foreign secretary goes on to talk about how some businesses have given up the trade altogether and how the protocol is presenting so many difficulties.  The difficulties presented are due to Brexit and to the fact that the British Government in its realms of political intelligence has decided to pursue the hardest possible Brexit.  It has continuously gone for the hardest and most politically based objectives through this process.  It is not necessarily the protocol that is not working; it is the fact that a party to the protocol continues to look beyond it. <br/><br/>An area where I do agree is that &quot;The fundamental basis for power-sharing remains strong&quot;.  We welcome the huge election results in Northern Ireland that pave the way for a nationalist First Minister and for the huge soaring middle.  That should be reflected on, rather than the voices of a minority of a minority.<br/><br/>Then we go into the area of degrees of concern.  Is it the biggest degree of concern for all parties?  All parties in Northern Ireland recognise it could be working better, but the majority of parties and of those elected to the Assembly fundamentally believe the protocol is a good thing.  No party in Northern Ireland, with the exception of the most extreme people, advocates for the breaking of international law in order to solve the problems.<br/><br/>Then there is a reference to:</p><blockquote>	... a comprehensive and reasonable solution to deliver on our shared objectives...  Our 'green channel' proposal would be backed by a trusted trader scheme to provide the EU with real time commercial data and robust enforcement... </blockquote> <p>The whole problem is that since the agreement came into force, the EU has not had effective access to data-sharing agreements.  With a &quot;trusted trader scheme&quot;, we are coming back to alternative arrangements and technological solutions when we see that written down in black and white.<br/><br/>The following is a stark one: the sole preference should be for an agreed solution, but the British Government says it is only a &quot;firm preference&quot;.  The possibility of breaking international law and acting unilaterally through domestic legislation needs to be taken off the table.  Every time we get a speech of warm words or an article meant to be conciliatory it always throws in that sucker punch to the effect that &quot;Well, we'll do what we have to do to get our own way.&quot;  It is unacceptable in modern diplomacy and grown-up negotiations.  The EU has been negotiating trade deals for decades.  It knows what it is doing and that responsibilities fall on both parties to all agreements.<br/><br/>In the same paragraph we hear how everything has to come back to the changing of the EU's existing mandate.  I keep forgetting because the referendum campaign is so long ago and we have gone through the ideas over and over but I am pretty sure the EU did not come up with Brexit or create this mess that has occupied the hearts and minds of far too many people and caused chaos on this island for over six years.  Yet it is always the EU that has to change position and the EU's mandate that is brought into question.  It is never the fact that the British Government has gone from winning a referendum by 52% to 48% and talking about never leaving the Single Market, in the words of the current Prime Minister, to going for the hardest possible Brexit.  No, it all comes back to the EU and without changes to this mandate we cannot fix the problems.  Of course we can fix the problems but the British Government runs away from the most obvious solution of an EU-UK sanitary and phytosanitary, SPS, veterinary agreement because it always comes back to the EU and is nothing to do with Brexit and the responsibility therefor.<br/><br/>Reference is made to &quot;drift or delay&quot;.  How is it that months on from Commissioner &Scaron;efčovič's visit to Northern Ireland and the proposition of a detailed paper containing genuine solutions, we finally have a dismissal from the British Government which demands the EU respond within 72 hours?  It is farcical to see &quot;drift or delay&quot; referred to.  <br/><br/>I could go through this article 17 times but I want to give way to my colleague.  The key point I want to make is that the threats of unilateral action are damaging the relationship this foreign secretary pretends to want to protect.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-25a.242" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1480" speakername="Jennifer Carroll MacNeill" time="15:47:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022052500043#VV00200"><p>As my colleague said, no one in this House needs reminding but perhaps some in the United Kingdom need to recall that it was the British Government that decided to have a referendum to leave the EU.  It was the British Government that decided to have a hard Brexit and to leave the Single Market in this way, that found out the impact that would have on the island of Ireland, that agreed the withdrawal treaty and the protocol, and that brought the relevant instruments through its parliament.  It is the British Government that now, in essence, tries to plead ignorance, whether ignorance of the terms it agreed, ignorance that they were likely to be applied, ignorance of the effect that would have on the crucial east-west dimension of the Good Friday Agreement or ignorance that there would be a challenge caused by those actions to the operation of that agreement.</p><p>It is not the protocol that causes the challenge to the agreement, as has been maintained; it is and always has been the decision of the British Government to choose the hardest possible Brexit.  It is caused by the decision not to explain the impact on Northern Ireland in the course of the referendum, or even, in reality, to acknowledge its existence as an issue.  It is caused by the decision to continue to push the extreme positions, as my colleague, Deputy Richmond has said.  The hardest possible position, involving the hardest Brexit possible and threats to invoke Article 16, is pushed as a first course.  The threats and theatre have brought the British Government to the desperately sad position it is in in the eyes of the international partners it has had.  It has decided to play local inter-party transient politics over the commitment of the United Kingdom to its position of co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, or to international law more broadly.  The steps taken on legacy, which have been discussed in detail in this House and on which we in the House are united, were a further reflection of this abrogation of responsibility, although we have seen positive steps today in relation to the identity and language Bill in Northern Ireland, which I welcome.</p><p>Always in politics we are reaching for dialogue, for compromise and for facilitating each other.  That was the essence of the Good Friday Agreement for all parties, and we have had an opportunity for sustained peaceful development on this island as a consequence of those steps towards each other and compromises.  Credit is due to all for that, including to the EU which has acted as a guarantor of the agreement and funded many projects of reconciliation and development for Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom.</p><p>The Northern Ireland protocol is a mutually agreed solution to the challenges posed to Northern Ireland by the choice made by the British Government as to the type of Brexit it wanted.  It was agreed after long negotiations between the EU and the UK.  It protects the Good Friday Agreement in all its dimensions and is broadly supported by people and business in Northern Ireland.  We have said that in this House and heard in the Good Friday Agreement committee from representatives of business groups and chambers of commerce from Northern Ireland who remind us that huge opportunities come from the protocol and that the practical issues can be and have been worked through. </p><p>The then DUP leader, Arlene Foster, in welcoming the trade deal reached between the EU and UK in December 2020, stated that she welcomed the successful conclusion of negotiations.  She said it was &quot;the start of a new era in the relationship between the UK and the EU and in Northern Ireland we will want to maximise the opportunities the new arrangements provide for our local economy.&rdquo;  In a further statement, she referenced this as a sensible deal that was almost the most favourable outcome for Northern Ireland<font color="#2F2F2F">.</font>She stated: &ldquo;Moving forward, we will continue to work to seize the opportunities and address the challenges which arise from the United Kingdom&rsquo;s exit from the European Union&rdquo;.  This statement is no longer available on the DUP website, in my searches in any event.  Perhaps it has been deleted.  These things do happen.  If the position has changed, we have to ask why.</p><p>The realities of leaving the Single Market remain.  The realities of trade on this island remain.  Nothing has changed, neither the rules nor the desire to make it work.  The desire to make the post-Brexit relationship work is unchanged.  The desire to work out practical problems is unchanged.  Consider how the medicines issue has been quietly resolved by the EU with little fanfare in recent weeks.  Nothing has changed except that new barriers seem to be found.  There is still space for the United Kingdom Government to change.</p><p>However, in an article published today in the <i>Daily Express</i>, Arlene Foster says the &ldquo;protocol has to be fundamentally changed.&rdquo;  As Deputy Richmond mentioned, in <i>The Irish Times</i>today foreign secretary Liz Truss says the protocol is the biggest challenge to the Northern Ireland Executive getting back to work.  She says &quot;the problems of the Protocol are baked into its... text&rdquo;.  This is the text agreed by the Government of which she has been a member.  It is hard to take seriously.  We are moving from obfuscation now to bad faith.  The threat that follows in her article today is contained in the statement that &ldquo;we cannot allow any more drift and delay.&quot;  Keep in mind that negotiations have been stalled in real terms since February.  She states: &ldquo;Without an Executive and no prospect of one until these concerns can be addressed, we need to provide reassurance to Northern Ireland that the problems with the protocol will be fixed one way or another.<b>&rdquo;  </b>She goes on to state:</p> <blockquote> 	The UK has a duty to take the necessary decisions to preserve peace and stability.  That is why I have announced our intention to introduce legislation in the coming weeks. </blockquote>  <p>It is hard to overstate how irresponsible that position is.  It is hard to overstate the bad faith that is the application of internal party politics to free trade on this island.  There is still space to change.  There is still space to, for example, come closer to the Single Market fold.  </p> <p>There is always more than one way to change.  The EU has worked to accommodate the political desires of the United Kingdom.  It has found, together, the solution to the decision to have a hard Brexit and to give Northern Ireland the opportunity to trade in the broadest and most constructive way.</p> <p> It is time now for the United Kingdom to step up to what it used to be - a respectable partner in peace and stability that worked towards the Good Friday Agreement and guaranteed its stability, and committed to the rule of law and international law.  There is the space to come back yet.  Although the British Government may not be listening, I hope there are those in Whitehall and in other parties, and perhaps Tories yet to come, who can remember and will bring the United Kingdom back into the fold of being an international partner of peace and stability.  I look forward to that day of renewed partnership, but we have to get over this day of obfuscation and bad faith first.</p></speech>

The protocol is part of an international agreement that it signed with the EU in an effort, they both stated, to protect the Good Friday Agreement.  Unilaterally altering the protocol will have the opposite effect.  It will undermine the Good Friday Agreement.  Businesses are benefiting from the significant opportunities afforded by the protocol to create jobs and attract investment through unique access to the British and EU markets.  The majority of MLAs returned to Stormont after the recent assembly election support retaining the protocol.</p><p>The British Government should stop creating further instability, end the threats to take unilateral action and work constructively with the EU to find solutions to fix any problems.  It is handing the DUP a veto on progress.  The DUP is using the protocol as an excuse not to enter power-sharing and has blocked the appointment of a new speaker to the assembly, preventing it from releasing funds already in place to help people with the cost-of-living crisis.  Abrogating an international treaty, as US Congressman Richard Neal stated yesterday, is not only bad faith, it sends a considerably wrong message.</p><p>As regards legacy protocols, it seems that international agreements do not garner much, if any, respect from this British Government.  Its most recent legacy proposals are yet another attempt to bin an international agreement to which it signed up, in this case at Stormont House in 2014.  These proposals are another cruel blow to victims and their families, some of whom have been awaiting truth and justice for more than five decades.  It is an attempt by the British state to pull down the shutters on truth and justice.  The British Government is effectively attempting to introduce an amnesty through the back door for British state forces, intelligence services and agents who murdered Irish citizens during the conflict in Ireland.  These proposals are opposed by victims, their families and political parties.  The Irish Government must stand with the families in their campaigns for truth and justice.</p><p>Looking back at the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement or, more to the point, the many aspects of the agreement that have never been implemented, should we be so surprised at the pandering of the British Government to hardline unionism and its<i>laissez-faire</i>attitude to international agreements?:  The Good Friday Agreement was signed on 10 April 1998.  It has just passed its 24th year.  That period could have been used to fulfil the significant expectations generated by the agreement and its endorsement in referendums North and South.  However, 24 years on, it is very frustrating that a bill of rights - a central provision of the agreement - has never been implemented.  A bill of rights was a central provision of the agreement.  A recent survey carried out by the Human Rights Consortium at Queens University Belfast indicated significant cross-community support for a bill of rights, with 78% of participants backing such a proposal.  Attempts to create a bill of rights, however, have been dogged by delays, as well as efforts to minimise the scope and enforcement.  In early 2020, an assembly committee was established under the New Decade, New Approach agreement to look at finally delivering on a bill of rights.  As part of this process, an expert panel of external consultants was to be appointed to advise the committee.  However, the DUP has continually prevented the appointment of the panel, effectively grinding the process to a halt once again.</p><p>Another integral part of the Good Friday Agreement committed the British Government to taking resolute action to promote the Irish language and to seek to remove, where possible, restrictions that would discourage or work against the maintenance and development of the language.  Further to these provisions, a specific commitment to an Irish language Act was to be introduced by the British Government as part of the St. Andrews Agreement in 2006.  This, too, has never been implemented.  It was again committed to in New Decade, New Approach.  With the DUP again failing to live up to what it had agreed to, the British Government promised to deliver on the commitment to an Irish language Act with accelerated passage by October 2021.  That date passed without delivery or any credible defence from the British Government.  With the DUP refusing to nominate a deputy First Minister and form an Executive, we hear once again that the British Government plans to legislate for an Irish language Act imminently.  Time will tell but if Acht na Gaeilge remains undelivered, that will represent another serious breach of yet another agreement by the DUP and the British Government.</p></speech>

The recent Stormont assembly election has, unfortunately, returned Brexit to the political agenda through a row in respect of the Northern Ireland protocol.  This comes against a backdrop of the protocol being critical to post-Brexit continuity, stability and security of business on the island of Ireland.  It is the mechanism agreed between the EU and the UK to protect the all-Ireland economy, the Good Friday Agreement and the integrity of the EU Single Market.  Its unique arrangements are designed to avoid a physical border on the island of Ireland.  It forms part of the withdrawal agreement and, as it has been ratified by the EU and the UK, it is a legally binding international treaty.</p><p>The protocol applies exclusively to the island of Ireland and came into force in January 2021.  As per the withdrawal agreement, the EU and the UK established a joint committee with responsibility for its overall implementation and application.  It is jointly chaired by Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efčovič, Vice-President of the European Commission, and the minister of state at the Cabinet Office.</p><p>All in all, this has thrown the delicate quadrangular relationship between Brussels, London, Dublin and Belfast into disarray.  Uncertainty and apprehension about the unravelling of the arrangement and what it will mean for the future of Northern Ireland is everywhere.  The most pressing question in Belfast is rightly in respect of the restoration of the power-sharing institutions.  The function or otherwise of the Northern Ireland Assembly and Executive has been firmly linked to the protocol part of the Brexit withdrawal agreement by the DUP, which blocked the appointment of a speaker in the absence of decisive action on the issue by the UK Government.  The clock is now ticking on a six-month deadline, after which the entire edifice will collapse and, in theory, a general election must be called.  The general expectation is that it will not be until we reach the business end of this deadline in the autumn that significant progress might happen, although it is hoped that it will not take that long.</p><p>That said, in the wake of the announcement by Liz Truss on Tuesday that London intends to legislate to scrap parts of the protocol unilaterally, there has been a softening of language from the DUP, which may provide the landing zone, to use the new <i>phrase du jour</i>, needed for at least a partial solution.  It is notable that when he was interviewed on BBC Radio Ulster last week, the DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson called for decisive action, which was cited as the prerequisite for re-entering the political institutions.  In full, however, he emphasised the need to first see the detail of the legislation.  That points towards the possibility of a staggered solution that would permit the election of a speaker and, therefore, the restoration of the assembly.  This would be only the starting point, however.  The North would still be without a full and functioning Executive and there is much to be done to calm tensions and repair the relationship, political and otherwise, damaged by this crisis, as well as to address the reality that a substantial section of unionism feels alienated and that its identity has been undermined by the protocol.  So far, so febrile, yet the likely next step will be &quot;unspectacular and rather familiar at this point&quot;, according to Katy Hayward, professor of political sociology at Queens University Belfast.</p><p>Throughout the Brexit debacle, the consistent cry from business has been for clarity.  There is an appetite for what would effectively be a stock-taking exercise by the technical teams from the UK and the EU to establish exactly where things stand.</p></speech>

As Deputies are aware, there is a lot at stake at present in the context of the Good Friday Agreement.  It is clear that the protocol and the legacy issues are all currently being discussed.</p> <p>All of us need to work extremely hard together and be united in ensuring that we maintain peace and protect the Good Friday Agreement.  Brexit was a fierce disappointment which upset the harmony that existed between Ireland and England.  Being nearest neighbours, Ireland and England benefited from that but, sadly, Brexit was Britain's decision and the route that was taken.  It is having an effect on our economy and the work we do.  There are severe delays and losses in bringing goods and services back and forth between Ireland and England.</p> <p> We certainly need to get the Stormont Assembly and the other institutions up and running again.  Following the recent election, the unionists are not happy campers.  We need to bring them along and ensure we do not go back to the rancour we had in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s.  We need the people in the North to work and we must allow them to do their work like any normal people.  We need to ensure the survivors and victims get satisfaction and not the amnesty being proposed by England.  We all need to thank Representative Richard Neal and the US delegation for taking an interest by visiting us yesterday and going up to the North today.  He is doing whatever he can to ensure the Good Friday Agreement and all the institutions are kept in place.</p></speech>

The people of Northern Ireland are quite bewildered.  They went to the polls a couple of weeks ago.  I met some of them at the Fleadh Cheoil Thiobraid &Aacute;rann two weekends ago and they are asking why they got up and voted.  They voted for nationalists and the Assembly is not sitting.  There is more to this than meets the eye.  There is whole clamour around a border poll.  I am well known as a republican.  My late dad fought in the War of Independence.  He spent quite some time in prison and suffered, as many people did.  We do not have any monopoly on that.</p>  <p>  The statements - even on the night of the election Deputy McDonald said we must have a Border poll &ndash; are going faster than we think.  We must make haste slowly here because we must bring the people with us.  N&iacute; neart go cur le ch&eacute;ile.  We had intransigence from the unionist side for long enough.  We now have Brexit and it seems it has not registered with some people that Brexit happened.  A sovereign people voted to leave the EU.  I remember, as leader of our group, attending late-night meetings in Government Buildings with the then Taoiseach, the current T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar.  When we asked about the Border we were told there would be no borders.  I remember asking about the hard border between Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia, which I used to pass through regularly.  We put our heads in the sand and said this would not happen.  The then Taoiseach told me there might be a border in Bali or someplace else.  These are the problems.</p>  <p>  As the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, knows, there are huge problems with industry and imports and exports.  There are huge issues to be dealt with.  The latest stalemate or crash-landing may cause damage the Good Friday Agreement.  I salute the architects of the agreement, including the late Martin McGuinness, Martin Mansergh, a former colleague of mine, Fr. Alec Reid from Nenagh in Tipperary, and the many others who worked very hard to secure it.  The late Dr. Paisley and Martin McGuinness got together.  We all have to get together and do it in the spirit of the meitheal and of forgiveness, trust and respect.</p>  <p>  My family knew Aidan McAnespie who was killed at Aughnacloy.  He worked for one of my brothers-in-law.  We cannot just wash away those events or forget the past and throw a thick cloak over it.  There needs to be reconciliation but there must be a good deal of counselling, research and respectful engagement with and listening to the people who were involved to get past the impasse and move forward.  It is of no one's benefit to have the institutions in Northern Ireland closed down.  Above all, the electorate will grow very tired of that very soon.  Some Deputies asked why MLAs are getting paid?  That is a valid question if they are not going to sit.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-25a.249" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1553" speakername="Jim O'Callaghan" time="16:07:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022052500045#XX00300"><p>One of the great advantages of the Good Friday Agreement is that it changed the way people in Northern Ireland viewed national sovereignties.  Prior to that, the majority of people in Northern Ireland viewed national sovereignties in a very binary way.  They saw themselves as being either Irish or British.  The Good Friday Agreement enabled that to be changed and with the passage of time, people in Northern Ireland saw themselves as Irish and British, others saw themselves as Northern Irish and European, or Irish and European.  That was a great achievement.  What it did, as Professor John O&rsquo;Brennan said, was it transformed national sovereignties in Northern Ireland from being something threatening to something that was viewed as being complementary.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately, Brexit changed all that.  Prior to the Brexit vote, no consideration was given to the impact Brexit was going to have on the Good Friday Agreement.  Whatever about changing the perception people in Northern Ireland had about national sovereignties, the subsequent decision by people who advocated Brexit to go for the hardest form of Brexit had very serious consequences for the workings of the Good Friday Agreement.  That was recognised in this House.  I recall we debated the issue in 2016 after the Brexit vote.  It was only when negotiations commenced between the UK Government and the European Union in November 2017 or thereabouts that the reality of Brexit met the fantasy of Brexit.  For once, there was a recognition by the British Government and the Brexiteers that this was going to be much more complicated than they had thought.  The immediate response at that time by those who advocated Brexit was to try to undermine the Good Friday Agreement.  The charge used was that the Good Friday Agreement was unsustainable or it had served its use.  One Brexiteer referred to it as being a bribe to two sides, to the extremes, in Northern Ireland.  The original policy was to try to undermine the Good Friday Agreement in order to get around the obstacle that it posed to the type of Brexit that Brexiteers wanted.</p>  <p>  Fortunately at that time, Britain had a Prime Minister, Theresa May, who prioritised peace and the Good Friday Agreement.  She put forward a deal that was rejected.  The Prime Minister was changed and the new Prime Minister told the unionist politicians of Northern Ireland he would do one thing and then did the complete opposite.  We need to appreciate that is what actually happened.  The protocol that was entered into was a reaction and an unnecessary consequence of Brexit but it was agreed to by the British Government.</p>  <p>  We now fast-forward to recent times.  The current argument being made by those who advocate Brexit is that the protocol is undermining the Good Friday Agreement.  The cynicism and irony of that charge cannot be overestimated.  The same people who in 2017 were saying that the Good Friday Agreement was unsustainable and unnecessary are now saying the protocol that was entered into is damaging the Good Friday Agreement.  Let us recognise from the outset that Brexit itself damaged the Good Friday Agreement and the consequences of Brexit probably also damaged the Good Friday Agreement.  However, that does not mean that we have to abandon and sacrifice peace on this island and all we have achieved in order to facilitate those who come to this with a Brexiteer mentality.</p>  <p>  I believe the reason the British Government has now sought to present the Good Friday Agreement as being under threat by the protocol is that it is trying to gain support in the United States for what it is seeking to do.  It knows the Good Friday Agreement is recognised in the United States as being a very important international agreement.</p> <p>It is great that the United States has allowed itself to assume the position of a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement.  However, the British Government is now trying to say the protocol it entered into is damaging the Good Friday Agreement when before that it never showed any consideration for it.</p> <p> We need to be careful in what we are doing.  We need to send out a clear message that the protocol will not be changed or renegotiated.  However, what can be done is that the manner by which it is implemented can be changed.  The Irish Government and the European Union have sought to do that but, unfortunately, that does not fit within the political agenda of the current British Government.</p> <p> What is the reason the current British Government wants to get away from the protocol or wishes to raise it as a political issue?  It is not out of concern for unionism and unionist politicians.  We know that because it threw unionists under a bus a number of years ago when it signed the protocol.  The reason it is doing this is twofold.  First, it suits the political agenda of certain individuals within the United Kingdom Government to have a situation where Brexit is still a burning issue and attacking the European Union still serves a political purpose it has.  Second, and this is probably a more legitimate purpose, maybe there is a proposal and plan to try to preserve the union because of the threat posed by Scottish independence.  I do not know but the Government needs to be clear in its response.</p></speech>

We must look back at what has happened in the peace process in order to understand where we are.  I was particularly pleased, as the co-convenor of the Irish-US parliamentary friendship group, to welcome, along with Senator Malcolm Byrne, the Cathaoirleach and the Ceann Comhairle, US Congressman Richie Neal and his delegation this week because it allows us to reflect on the peace process.</p>  <p>  The peace process is built on three fundamental principles.  The first was the statement by the British Government in 1990 that it had no selfish or strategic economic interest in the North.  That was hugely important because it allowed the communities in the North to deal with the British Government and for the Irish Government to deal with the British Government.  It allowed the second principle, the principle of consent, to emerge.  This is the idea that we in the South were willing to understand that there was a majority in favour of the Union in the North.  The principle of consent was one of the developments that allowed us to replace Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution and to believe in that principle.  The third principle was the principle of parity of esteem, the idea that both communities should be seen and respected, and that there should be no tyranny of the majority, as exercised by the previous Stormont regime.  The three principles were the ideas of no selfish or strategic interest, consent and parity of esteem.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately, the Brexit process and the actions of the British Government have torn up many of those principles.  Throughout the Brexit process, it has used its selfish and strategic interest and the North to negotiate.  The Irish Government has been good at calling that out but we need to continue to do so.  The principle of consent was clearly breached when the majority of people in the North voted against Brexit, yet their constitutional arrangements will change as a result of it.</p>  <p>  The last issue is the idea of parity of esteem.  The reason I raise it is that it brings us to the current impasse.  There was no majority cross-community consent for Brexit and there is no cross-community consent for the protocol but both came about because of the failure of the British Government to do the hard work, have a long-term plan and engage with the issues in the North in a meaningful, as previous British administrations had.</p>  <p>  Other Deputies may have been critical of or may have demonised the unionist response.  Let me take a different action because I believe the two large parties in the North should have done far more in the past 15 years to build greater community consent.  I will not demonise the unionist community.  I will do something else.  I will invite it to work with us in the South on how we share this island.  I may want that process to end in a united Ireland, whereas unionists may want to protect their traditions and remain in the United Kingdom.  In the meantime, we can work together to share this island, protect unionist traditions and ensure we can control our own destiny.</p>  <p>  Unionists are in an abusive relationship with the British Government, which has let them down repeatedly.  This week, the British Government, in tearing up another principle, has taken unilateral action in order to govern Northern Ireland from Westminster, which nobody on this island wants to see.  It has taken unacceptable action on victims and on the Protocol and while I welcome the Irish language Act, it is another unilateral action by the British Government.  The unionist community is open to work with us and I encourage it to do that through the shared island initiative.</p></speech>

Every morning, I would begin by doing a short Irish lesson.  I will give this Chamber a short Irish lesson.  The word "Tory" is a derivative of the old Irish word "toraidhe", which means robbers.  I was watching Sky News earlier and I saw the British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, grovelling.  He was on his feet defending a party in 10 Downing Street.  That is not the real issue, however.  For so many people on this island, regardless of what tradition they come from, the real issue is that Mr. Johnson is robbing the young people of Northern Ireland, unionists, republicans and youngsters with no political allegiance, of the bright-light future the 1998 Good Friday Agreement paved for them.  I will elaborate on that.  To talk of dismantling protocols, introducing legacy and reconciliation legislation and delivering on Brexit, as the British Government repeatedly does, is to continue that abusive relationship from Westminster all the way to the Six Counties in Northern Ireland and it is letting them down.</p>  <p>  Only a few weeks ago, when the election there was in full swing, Deputy McAuliffe and I, along with many colleagues in Fianna F&aacute;il, travelled up to canvas with our colleagues in our sister party, the SDLP.  We met young people on the streets of Newry who do not feel shackled to their past.  Their parents may identify as nationalist and their great-grandfather might have been unionist but they do not feel shackled to the past.  They are talking about issues such as climate change and marriage equality.  They are talking about language rights and all the issues that young people should be inspired to stand up and fight for, but every action that I have seen coming from Boris Johnson recently, insofar as Northern Ireland is concerned, robs them of a bright future that the Good Friday Agreement paved for them.</p>  <p>  I will drill down on some of those issues.  The Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Bill would offer immunity to those deemed to have co-operated with the independent commission on reconciliation and information recovery.  It would stop further inquests and civil actions relating to the Troubles.  That is wrong.  Victimhood and loss belongs to a family or an individual and to deny people the right to justice with a stroke of a pen or the enactment of legislation is unfathomable.  The British Government needs to be pushed back on that.  The message that must be voiced repeatedly by the Irish Government, in unison with our partners in Europe, is that this legislation is absolutely unacceptable.  It does the opposite of delivering on reconciliation.</p>  <p>  The objective of the Government at all times should be to support the parties.  No matter what we might say and hear and what political rivalries we have, we support parties that are willing to go into government and form an Executive in Northern Ireland to rule, govern and deliver for their people.  The objective of the Government should at all times be to uphold and defend the Good Friday Agreement.  The Northern Ireland protocol is a breach of the co-operative spirit that the Good Friday Agreement was supposed to instil in terms of both Governments working together.</p>  <p>  If I can speak on the tourism brief on which I am my party's spokesman, the measures Boris Johnson's Government is proposing to introduce to curb migration and illegal immigration into his country might work in the Dover context where inflatables land on the shore day after day but what has been designed for Dover does not work for Derry.  The British Government needs to rethink what it is doing.  A multibillion euro tourism industry is ready to flourish as we come out of Covid.  We will soon see tour buses turn around at the Border because it will not be worth the hassle for German and French tourists on a one-week tour of Ireland to cross it and they will remain down here.  That, too, will be a retrograde step.  What has been designed for Dover will not work for Derry or the border with the North.  Boris Johnson may not admit it but he is slowly trying to reimpose a border that all of us in this House have been striving to dismantle for decades.</p>  <p>  I will finish by saying that the flag behind the Leas-Cheann Comhairle is an embracing one.  The orange in the flag stands for unionism.  Many of us in this House may be from a different tradition but we are willing to cede some of our old loyalties and speak with unionists as we seek to unite Ireland in a new way.</p></speech>

It is clearly about taking access away in order to protect Britain.  The model Bill team, made up of researchers who have been looking at human rights compliance solutions to the legal and political challenges regarding Northern Ireland's past have agreed this Bill will not deliver for victims and survivors.  Not only that but they have also deemed the Bill unworkable and in breach of the Good Friday Agreement and international law.  We must take this very seriously.</p> <p> "Derry Girls" was mentioned earlier today and it seems we all watched and were moved by the series finale, which so eloquently captured the emotions surrounding and the significance of the Good Friday Agreement.  The episode was a great reminder of the importance of the agreement for many people in this Chamber and across the island who were a bit out of touch with what goes on in the North.  There is no doubt peace must be protected and advanced.</p> <p> Unfortunately, what the Good Friday Agreement fails to fully recognise is Britain's role in the hurt and the violence and trauma it caused in the North.  Watching recent debates in Westminster, it seems this role is still being ignored and denied.  Westminster seems to see itself as a neutral observer whose role is to go in and sort out the conflict in the North.  There is a serious misunderstanding and ignorance in this; those in Westminster fail to recognise the fact that not only are they not innocent observers but they are the perpetrators of much of the violence and the conflict originated from their occupation of this island in the first place.</p> <p> The British have inflicted pain after pain on the people of the North and they continue to do so with this legislation.  With help from the model Bill team in Northern Ireland, I will outline some of the ways in which the proposed Bill is a breach of the Good Friday Agreement and serves only to cause further pain to the victims and survivors in the North.  The Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Bill would end all ongoing inquests, despite the fact these inquests are delivering results.  This is not acceptable.  All promised inquests deserve the chance for legal mechanisms to discover the truth.  It is shocking that such processes, with a clear human rights approach that is delivering results, would be stopped.  In an incredible observation, the model Bill team has queried whether part of the reason for introducing this Bill is that existing mechanisms are working too well in exposing past human rights abuses.  It seems Britain is trying to protect itself from the damning findings of these inquiries.</p> <p> In place of inquiries, the Bill provides for direct Government control over the establishment and operation of all proposed mechanisms, and the delegated powers memorandum makes explicit the intention to override devolved institutions in order to achieve the delivery of this policy.  It is clear the British Government is looking for full and complete control over the narrative of what happened in the North because it does not like light being shed on the terrible crimes committed in its name.</p> <p> The proposals in the Bill for oral history and academic research on the conflict appear to be designed to provide legal and political cover rather than an accurate account of events.  This is extremely concerning and incompatible with academic ethics, independence, rigour and integrity.  We cannot let the narrative of Irish history be controlled and determined by the British the way it has so often in the past.  It is evident the British Government is egotistically more interested in its own appearance than in giving victims the information and closure they need.  Let us not beat around the bush, that is the Bill's main aim.</p> <p> The proposed Bill would also directly limit the ability of people in the North to challenge alleged breaches of the European Convention on Human Rights in Northern Ireland courts.  This is completely unacceptable and the Minister for Foreign Affairs cannot stand by while this goes ahead.  I take this opportunity to urge the Minister to do all he can to ensure this Bill does not progress any further in Westminster.  Breaches of international law must be taken very seriously and it is our job to ensure the people in the North are protected from this happening.</p> <p> In the time left I will speak about the protocol.  It is clear the protocol, like everything else, is being used to achieve British aims and Ireland is at the crux.  Everything we hear about the protocol indicates it is not a hindrance to business and that businesses will actually benefit from it.  There may be some difficulties with imports from the UK but businesses will benefit in the long run.  It seems businesses are happy enough with it going ahead.</p> <p> The British foreign secretary, Ms Liz Truss, is quoted today on the RT&Eacute; website as saying the protocol causes political instability, so it seems the British Government is more concerned about political instability rather than instability for business.  The British, once again, are using the North as a way to further their own political ends, and that is what they intend to do.  We must oppose such efforts and shine a light on them at all times.  That means standing up and fighting for the protocol and against the collapsing of the Assembly over the protocol.  That is vital.</p> <p> The American delegation has been here and there is a relationship with the British, who are trying to influence the Americans by speaking about the protocol's value and impact on the Good Friday Agreement.  The British approach to what is going on in the North must be called out and challenged.  The British cannot be allowed to get away with this.  As usual, they are using the North to further their own ends and political agenda.  We should be trying to counter that as far as possible.  We are concerned about Brexit's effects but we must keep an eye on the inquiries and the Irish language Act.  We must pursue those as well.  They are vital.  Regardless of Brexit, they will have to be put in place as well.  We must ensure they continue.</p></speech>

I am really happy the identity and language Bill has been introduced to the House of Lords.  We wish that safe and successful passage as soon as possible.  Many Deputies raised it and is &aacute;bhar an-t&aacute;bhachtach &eacute; seo.  No language is a threat to anybody.

The Stormont House Agreement is the agreed way forward to address the legacy of the past.  It is the product of difficult compromises.  The agreement was made with the intention of securing the end to violence that was delivered by the Good Friday Agreement.  These compromises were made on the understanding that all sides would adhere to the agreements reached.  As former Senator Gordon Wilson said, and he has already been invoked in the Chamber, compromise is not giving in, it is maturity.</p> <p> The Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Bill represents a unilateral abandonment of the Stormont House Agreement.  This new legislation introduced to deal with the legacy of the past is not the act of a partner.  The publication of the Bill and its contents have profoundly shocked and angered many of the families of the victims of the Troubles.  All of the Northern Ireland parties have rejected it.  Speaking in the Chamber last year, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, said the Government is committed to helping all those who lost loved ones during the Troubles and who seek truth and justice to find it.  I want families to know the commitment of the Irish Government has not wavered.  The Irish Government will continue to advocate for truth, justice, the rule of law and empathy with each other's pain.  The protection of the Good Friday Agreement and the hard-won gains of the peace process are always our primary concerns.  This is precisely what the protocol was designed to do in the difficult circumstances created by the UK's withdrawal from the EU.  It is an integral part of an international agreement negotiated, agreed and ratified by the British Government with the EU.  International agreements entered in good faith simply cannot be unilaterally disapplied.</p> <p> I remain in regular engagement with my counterparts throughout the EU and I thank them for their solidarity and support.  The European Union remains absolutely united in its approach to Northern Ireland and its commitment to peace in Northern Ireland.  My clear conclusion from my engagements with my counterparts and senior European Union officials is that the EU is focused on making the protocol work and addressing the genuine concerns that people such as Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efčovič have heard raised by people in Northern Ireland on some aspects of the protocol.  The European Union proposals introduced to ensure the continued long-term supply of medicines from Britain to Northern Ireland are a prime example of how the EU is taking a solutions-focused approach and not an ideology-focused approach when addressing the protocol.  The European Union is not trying to punish anyone.  It is not being ideological.  It is being practical in trying to deliver what the protocol promises.  The protocol does not damage Northern Ireland's economy.  Ask businesses and they will explain why.  It creates genuine opportunity, as the voices of business have been saying.  There are historically high levels of investment in Northern Ireland.  These are helping to counter some of the difficulties we acknowledge have been realised because of Brexit and the protocol.</p> <p> Unilateral action jeopardises all of these positives.  It undermines confidence in Northern Ireland's economy and is politically destabilising.  The EU stands ready to talk to the UK at any time and remains fully committed to working jointly with the UK to reach solutions for the genuine issues of concern for the people and businesses of Northern Ireland.  The British Government must step back from the proposals it announced last week.  It is the third time it has announced a version of this.  It must have further engagement with the EU in the spirit of dialogue and partnership.  The uncertainty caused by this constant stream of announcements from London is deeply damaging to investment and business in Northern Ireland.  Who has not met someone involved in business for whom certainty is the most important consideration?  This is what is required in Northern Ireland.  The British Government would do very well to look at the best interests of Northern Ireland and not any other interests.</p> <p> Other legislation being introduced by the British Government is also very disruptive to people on the island.  The introduction of an electronic travel authorisation scheme for cross-Border journeys could cause considerable disruption to tens of thousands of people who cross the Border every day who are not Irish or British.  We want to work in partnership with the British Government on this to reach solutions.  I have had meetings with my counterparts and a lot of work is going on at official and political level to solve this issue.  The UK's human rights legislation threatens to move away from the role of the European Court of Human Rights in Northern Ireland.  It is an essential component of the Good Friday Agreement.  It is tragic because the role of the European Court of Human Rights has instilled confidence in Northern Ireland's political, policing and judicial structure over the past 24 years.  Britain was one of the key voices, along with Ireland, in the establishment of the Council of Europe.  We must keep reminding our British friends of the importance of the Council of Europe, the European Court of Human Rights and the legislation that has flowed from it.</p> <p> It is vital there is a functioning Executive and assembly in Northern Ireland so the voices of the people can be heard on all issues.  The Government will support the elected members of Northern Ireland in forming a government.  The challenges are not insurmountable.  They required the British Government not to take unilateral action not only in connection with the protocol but also with the Good Friday Agreement.  It is a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement.  It is not up to one co-guarantor to make statements about the Good Friday Agreement and the problems it sees.  It is up to everybody to work together and we can solve these problems.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-25a.260" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1618" speakername="James Browne" time="16:37:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022052500048#AAA00400"><p>I move:</p> <blockquote> 	That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann resolves that the period of operation of sections I to 7 and 9 of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2021 (No. 14 of 2021) be extended for a period of 6 months, beginning on the 1st day of June 2022 and ending on the 30th day of November 2022. </blockquote>  <p>I am here to introduce a resolution to extend the sunset clause in the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2021.  The extension of this Act will allow the hospitality sector to continue to provide for the sale or supply of intoxicating liquor in outdoor seating areas.  Deputies will be aware the Act was introduced in July 2021.  The provisions of the Act were in place until 30 November 2021 and were further extended in November 2021 until 31 May 2022, with the exception of section 8 which deals with the number of ordinary judges in the High Court.</p><p>Section 9(4) of the Act provides that the relevant provisions of the Act can be extended for up to six months at a time if a resolution approving its continuation has been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  On 17 May 2022, the Government agreed the extension of the Act for a further six months.  The Government took this decision as the circumstances leading to the enactment of this legislation have not changed.  There is an ongoing demand for the provisions which allow businesses to provide, with clarity and certainty in relation to the law, outdoor dining services.  Therefore, I am now bringing forward a proposal that the Act should continue in operation until 30 November 2022.</p><p>Ireland's pubs, restaurants and nightclubs have been heavily impacted by the Covid-19 related restrictions of the past two years.  I acknowledge that the necessary public health restrictions which were required as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic affected this industry significantly.  In line with the improved health situation, Covid-19 restrictions have now lifted and the industry is on its way to returning to full capacity.</p> <p>I realise, however, that many of these business are still struggling and it is important we give them the assistance they need to thrive as the busy summer season approaches.  It is hoped that the continued provision of outdoor dining opportunities to customers will be of great benefit to the industry.  The extension of this Act would facilitate the continued operation of outdoor seating areas, many of which have been introduced during the past two years.  It would provide clarity for the pubs, bars and clubs in a position to provide an outdoor seating area to customers and members.</p> <p> The Covid-19 pandemic saw businesses adapt rapidly and effectively to public health guidance during an unprecedented time.  I thank everyone working in the industry for their collective efforts.  The introduction of the Act addressed an uncertainty in the law for licensed premises offering an outdoor seating area to their customers.  Many licensed premises availed of these outdoor spaces.  The use of these spaces gave people the opportunity to socialise safely while adhering to public health guidance.</p> <p> Summer is now here and, if we are lucky, it is to be hoped it will bring sunshine and fair weather.  We can all look forward to enjoying time with our friends and family this summer in a very different context from that which we have experienced in recent years.  We want to preserve the use of outdoor spaces by our hospitality industry for the summer period ahead.  These outdoor spaces have boosted the appeal and attractiveness of our cities and towns.  They have often injected a new energy and dynamism to local areas.  They are not only of benefit to locals but are also very attractive to domestic and overseas visitors.  Now that the tourism sector is returning to strength, we hope to be in a position to share our lively bars and restaurants with many new and returning visitors to our country.</p> <p> The Government is committed to the continued support of businesses and will do what is necessary to show this support as businesses return to normal following what has been an unprecedented period of change.  The outdoor dining provisions form one element of that support.  We have all seen how well these outdoor areas have operated in co-operation with local communities and how they have enriched the night-time culture.  It is also important to note that outdoor socialising continues to provide increased protection against the transmission of Covid-19 and, as we all strive to keep ourselves and our families protected from Covid-19, the option to sit outside while enjoying a meal or a drink is very welcome.  These measures will help hospitality to return to normality, will help towns and cities around Ireland to thrive again, and will get people mixing and socialising in life-enhancing ways.</p> <p> The need for the Act became apparent last summer, in conjunction with the health measures in place at that time.  While the existing licensing laws were well understood in the context of serving alcohol within a premises, there was a need for clarity in the serving of alcohol in areas outside a premises.  The Act was an appropriate and welcome response to remove the ambiguity that arose in the application of licensing matters to outdoor seating areas.  Providing ongoing clarity to licensed premises, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and local authorities as regards the current legal situation remains of the utmost importance.</p> <p> The enforcement powers An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has relating to outdoor dining remain the same.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will retain its current general power of direction in respect of compliance with the licensing Acts.  It is important to note that the overwhelming majority of licensees have complied with these provisions relating to outdoor seating areas.  A longer term solution in the broader licensing context is under preparation by officials in the Department of Justice, and the extension of these provisions is appropriate while a permanent solution is being prepared.  As Deputies are aware, the programme for Government, as well as the justice plan, include a commitment to modernising alcohol licensing.  This is a major priority for the Minister, Deputy McEntee, and she is committed to delivering this piece of work.</p> <p> I reassure Deputies that officials in the Department of Justice are making plans for the future by providing a licensing framework fit for the dynamic and diverse society and economy we have become.  The Government gave its approval, on 15 September 2021, for the drafting of the general scheme of the sale of alcohol bill.  I am happy to say that work on the consolidation and reform of the licensing laws and the drafting of the general scheme is advancing well.</p> <p> Obviously, this is an area on which there are many views across society, and the legislation that will be brought forward needs to be informed by careful consideration of those views and perspectives.  Last November, the Minister launched a wide-ranging consultation to seek the views of the public on the modernisation of Ireland's licensing laws.  The consultation, which ran until 21 January 2022, looked at how best to update the existing laws governing the sale and regulation of alcohol in Ireland.  I am pleased to say there was a very high level of public engagement, with more than 5,000 responses received, which speaks to the importance of this issue and the strong views held by many.  Officials in the Department are reviewing these responses and taking account of this engagement in developing the legislation.</p> <p> In addition, on 10 March, the Minister hosted a consultation webinar on the reform of the alcohol licensing laws.  It was great to be able to bring together some of the key stakeholders in the industry and provide an opportunity for further discussion of the issues of concern.  It was a lively and informative discussion, and the matters raised will be taken into consideration in developing the proposed legislation.  Deputies who wish to view a recording of the webinar may do so on the Departments' social media channels.</p> <p> The complexity of the law relating to licensing provides a real impetus for reform.  The matters being addressed by the extension of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2021 will be included in that context as part of a permanent solution in a more coherent licensing system.</p> <p> The matter before the House seeks to ensure the continued but time-limited application of legislation, which was scrutinised and passed by this House before the 2021 summer recess and extended in November 2021.  The circumstances leading to the enactment of the legislation have not changed in that there is an ongoing need for legal clarity in relation to outdoor dining provisions while a longer term legislative solution is prepared.  I commend the resolution to the House, I thank Deputies for their attention, and I look forward to hearing their observations on the matter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-25a.262" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1620" speakername="Brendan Howlin" time="16:47:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022052500049#BBB00200"><p>The motion before the House seeks to extend certain provisions of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2021, for an additional six months, to allow the sale and consumption of alcohol in relevant outdoor seating places.  Members will recall the hiatus last year when there was total confusion about the legal situations, with local authorities wondering whether they were the licensing authority and with the Garda contacting the Minister directly enquiring as to what was happening.  There was a particular difficulty in Galway about which, I have no doubt, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle was contacted directly.</p>  <p>  We have clarified the law on the matter.  I do not have a difficulty with, nor do I believe the House will have such difficulty, in endorsing a six-month extension of the provisions that worked admirably well last year.  It is demonstrably a good idea.  It is the norm in continental Europe.  While we often talk about our weather in Ireland,  I can assure Members it is no worse than the weather in Brussels.  There is no reason it cannot work to great effect, thereby turning places like Galway city or Wexford into wonderful spaces for outdoor dining and for people to mingle.  This will greatly enhance not only our tourist product but the look of our towns as well as rural areas.</p>  <p>  Obviously, it must happen within proper controls, which are set out, and be licensed by the local authority.  There is an onus on the publican to maintain good order.  People cannot bring their own booze.  It is not to be a gathering point for drinkers.  The general powers available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to maintain public order, including hours of operation and so on, will apply to these outdoor spaces in the same fashion as they apply to indoor licensed premises, as the Minister of State reaffirmed.  All of that is good and I support it.</p>  <p>  I agree with the Minister of State about the impact of Covid on the licensed trade.  It has been horrendous.  Many licensed premises simply will not recover and will not open again.  That has been compounded by the cost-of-living pressures on business.  This is an issue to which the House will have to return.</p>  <p>  I support what has been done, and my only question is to ask why a permanent solution to this is not provided now.  The Minister of State alluded to that by saying there is ongoing major reform and consolidation of the licensing Acts.  As he knows, I have been around a while.</p> <p>That will not happen.  It will not be enacted in the lifetime of this D&aacute;il.  There are 5,000 submissions.  Few things are more contentious than the licensing laws.  The Minister of State has now given leave to draft not even legislation but the heads of a Bill, which will then go for scrutiny and public hearings.  There is no prospect in the short term of it being enacted.  We will be back here in six months or earlier to extend this.  We should do it.  The Minister of State should have come in and done it today.  It is logical the Government should have used the last 12 months to get particular things done.  We can consolidate them all ultimately, but let us do what is right now.</p> <p> There are other things we can do.  One of the things that struck me during the pandemic was that older people were advised to go shopping early in the morning.  They were being facilitated in the supermarkets to go shopping early in the morning, but they could not buy alcohol.  It was like a debar in reverse.  They were too old to be allowed to buy alcohol.  There are ridiculous anomalies, including the notion that people going to a luncheon cannot buy alcohol before 12.30 p.m. on a Sunday.  These are the issues that need to be addressed.  If we are a long way away from sorting it out in a consolidated way, which I honestly believe we are, let us deal with as many of the most egregious aspects of the anomalies as we can as we move along.  I would have hoped this particular provision would have been long term rather than for six months.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-25a.264" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1607" speakername="Martin Kenny" time="16:57:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022052500050#CCC00200"><p>The issues around this all stem from Covid and the difficulties we had for the two years when the country was closed down.  It was a terrible situation for the licensed trade, the tourism industry and people involved in businesses, particularly in our tourist areas, but also in towns and villages across the whole country.  They found they had no way of making an income because of the restrictions that were put in place.  We are here now to extend this particular arrangement that has been put in place.  That is welcome and we certainly need to do it.  However, I agree with Deputy Howlin that it is time we recognised that the arrangement has worked and that we need to put something permanent in place to ensure it can work into the future.</p>  <p>  I have come across many people who have enjoyed the loveliest of sunny evenings sitting outside in towns and villages throughout the country, thinking they were in Spain or some Mediterranean area because they had an electric sun, as it were, over them keeping them warm.  The reality is it has worked.  It has been a revelation that it can work and can be put in place.  However, there are issues and problems with it.  In some cases, footpaths have been made narrower and people with disabilities have not been able to pass.  There have been issues with parking in towns and many other things.  They need to be worked out.  All of these things need to be done in collaboration and co-operation with the local authorities, local businesses and local communities, who have often found there are problems.</p>  <p>  There are issues around the licensing laws, trading hours, the consumption of alcohol in particular, and all that goes with it.  The consumption of alcohol has a negative side to it that we too often see.  Indeed, there is a video going around at the moment, recorded in Dublin Airport, that would certainly demonstrate that.  It can have a very negative side.  We are encouraging people to go back and live in the town centres and to use the space over shops as living accommodation.  If that is the case, we must ensure town centres are not places where people are exposed to the worst elements of drunken behaviour that we often see in some of our towns, especially at the weekends.  There are issues that need to be dealt with there.</p>  <p>  As the tourism industry tries to rebuild and grow again, there is an issue I have come across in a number of areas.  It is something on which the Government needs to reflect and think about how to resolve.  Many of our hotel rooms have been taken up by people from Ukraine.  That is welcome and needs to happen.  The people need somewhere to go.  However, in many towns that are depending on tourism over the summer, there is nowhere for tourists to stay or go.  That is a problem that needs to be examined and for which a solution needs to be worked out.  The Ukrainian crisis has thrown up many problems and we cannot ignore them.  I think there is a tendency to solve the problem that is in front of us and to ignore the others because there is a feeling there is too much to do.  There are knock-on effects to all of these things.  Covid has had a huge knock-on effect on the entire tourism industry and on our entire community.</p>  <p>  Covid has also changed our culture.  More and more people are going to the off-licence now, bringing drink home with them and having a party in the house or the garden or whatever rather than actually going to the pub as they used to in the past.  I think that change in culture and in how we do things will be with us for quite some time.  The Irish pub is unique.  I do not think I have been in any city or town around the world where there are pubs from different countries in the same way there are Irish pubs.  If you are in any large town in Europe, there will be an Irish pub, or perhaps two, three or four of them.  You will not find a Welsh pub, a Spanish pub or any other in such towns.  There is a uniqueness about the culture of the Irish pub as being that intimate place that people go to to enjoy a drink, the chat, the music and the atmosphere that is created within the pub.  If that is something that we can export, we need to get it right at home as well.</p>  <p>  I have no problem supporting the extension of this provision.  Indeed, I welcome it.  We need to ensure we find a way of putting it in place on a long-term and more permanent basis.  When we are doing that, we need to make sure we are doing it right.  I take Deputy Howlin's point that we need to do it as soon as possible.  However, I also think we should not rush it.  We should do it right.  We must ensure we do not do something we will regret and that will cause unforeseen consequences in the future.  Having said that, now is the time for getting our heads together, to start putting the plans in place to do that and to make it happen as soon as possible.</p></speech>

There was discussion about whether by-laws or primary legislation were needed.  I think it was obvious to some of us that it was going to need primary legislation.  I appreciate this is a stopgap measure.  I agree it would be ideal if we had a more permanent solution.</p>  <p>  Outdoor seating areas were a vital support to pubs and restaurants, and indeed to the public, during the pandemic.  Such areas are a perfect example of one of the changes made during Covid that had a benefit for more than the time they were required.  The past two years have helped us change our collective thinking about the use of public and outdoor spaces.  Some of that is about activity in places other than pubs.  We need to run with some of the changes.  We need to continue to optimise our town and city centres for people rather than just cars.  Innovative use has been made of public spaces over the past two years.  Some - not all - of that usage should be made permanent.  The pedestrianisation of Capel Street is a prime example of the innovative use of public spaces.  It was a street that people were not particularly happy to walk up and down.  The kind of passive security that comes with people being out is something we should not discount.  It opens up streets that are not otherwise available to people because they do not feel safe on them.  Very often, the streets that people feel less safe on are the quieter streets.  Let us start thinking in a wider sense about the benefit of this arrangement.  Obviously, it revives community spirit and things like that.  It also has to be reconciled with the other demands on spaces.  One of the important things is that it improves safety.</p>  <p>  When considering outdoor areas on a permanent basis, it is also an opportunity to rethink long term.  We have all been in places in different parts of the world where design is built into having an outdoor space.  There are arched aspects to the front of buildings.  This caters for the rain but also provides an outdoor space at the same time.  We must learn from the pandemic.  People actually like having the choice between outdoor and indoor spaces.  There was a good reason it was required during the pandemic.  If we are looking at street design, it is important to get local authorities to start looking at their development plans in relation to building design.</p> <p>There has been a great deal of good work done in that area on streetscapes, shopfronts and things like that.  The design of these outdoor spaces must match the objective of getting good visual street spaces, shopfronts and such things.  Some of that will occur at local government level but we should be looking at where there is good design to ensure it is replicated rather than some of the things we have seen.  There is a plethora of parasols with alcohol advertising, for example.  Some of that is not that good visually.  It was needed for a time but we should be looking at the best visual approach as well as the best way of using that space.</p> <p> We all agree on the prominent alcohol branding issue.  On the one hand, we are talking about not allowing alcohol advertising before the watershed and on the other hand, every public street has such big advertisements.  We need to be thinking about things that are a little inconsistent.  I understand that the Department is working on legislation around waiving council fees.  One will have something of a conundrum when it comes to the issue of how one rates the space provided on a footpath, and whether the business is viable in terms of the additional cost.  Some thinking needs to happen on this.  It is essential that we do not impede people who have visual or physical movement difficulties.  This has to be well thought out.  It must be catered for and cannot be an impediment.  There must be an inclusive space that people with disabilities, whatever they are, can equally enjoy.  On occasions, it has been an impediment to actually get into the physical building rather than into the outside space.</p> <p> The revaluations will be another issue.  They could take a great deal of time if there is to be a change in rates.  That is something that will need to be very carefully considered.  One could be waiving the fee on one side to allow this to happen and could be adding a commercial rate on the other side.  We must allow some time for a recovery in that sector so that we can have those kinds of choices for people in their own localities and for people who are visiting the locality also.  We have probably all become a little bit more introverted where we start losing that collective sense and it is important that we do not lose that.  I would like to see this arrangement made on a more permanent basis.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-25a.267" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1518" speakername="Michael McNamara" time="17:07:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022052500051#DDD00200"><p>I welcome this motion, which seeks to extend the remit of the 2021 Act to allow outdoor serving by pubs and restaurants for a further six months.  Like previous speakers, I question why we are doing this just for six months.  I take on board the Minister of State&rsquo;s explanation that we are going to have a consolidation of the licensing laws.  The obvious implication is that we are going to have this consolidation within six months.  However, Deputy Howlin is not optimistic that we are going to have it at all during this D&aacute;il term.  Perhaps he is suggesting that this D&aacute;il will only last for another six months; I am not sure.  I believe it was the former - that we are not going to have it at all, even if the D&aacute;il goes to 2025.  If that is the case, why are we providing for a six-month period now?</p>  <p>  I know we do not have much legislation to discuss in this term.  I will cede the floor to any of the three Opposition justice spokespersons and to the Minister of State if they wish to contradict me on that point.  We seem to be very light on legislation at the moment and very heavy on statements.  I believed that this Parliament was about legislating.  That makes me worry on two levels.  First, I suspect that we are in for a late night, or rather a late morning, when we will be here until 6 o&rsquo;clock some morning as the Minister of State rams legislation through the D&aacute;il and everything will be guillotined.  The President has previously pronounced on the concern that exists about the undemocratic nature of legislation being passed in a way that lacks analysis and the detailed discussion we are elected to do.</p>  <p>  I have a second worry.  We have discussed the licensing of outdoor bars and restaurants as a positive outcome of the pandemic and one of the positive changes in practice in Irish society.  However, there has also been a negative outcome in respect of the work rate coming out of the public sector, which seems to me to have dropped significantly.  This is something I am hearing from many constituents.  This is not an attack on public service workers, or if it is, it is not an attack on low-level public service workers.  If we are going to change work practices, and we have done so, and if we are going to change how people interact socially, how people die and how people drink, we are going to have to plan for it.  That is what this Bill is about.  If we are going to change how people work, with people working from home etc., we are equally going to have to change how this is managed and facilitated.  It is the same workload.  I agree with everybody who is saying they should be able to work from home.  Nobody is saying that people should not have to work when they are at home.  Nobody is suggesting that for a minute.  My point is that people working from home require systems and management to be put in place and that is not happening.  My personal experience is that it is very difficult to get through to Government Departments, to county councils and to facets of the public service.  I am repeatedly hearing this complaint from my constituents.  It is not the fault of public service workers and those who work in the councils, etc., but it seems that systems are not being put in place to facilitate and ensure the work gets done, albeit that people are not working from hubs.  Perhaps it is about computer systems and telephone systems but it is fundamentally about management systems and managing this significant change.  I accept that it has probably been one of the biggest changes in work practices for decades.  It is a welcome change.  It is one that needs to be managed, but it is not being managed.  If the fault lies anywhere, it is at senior management levels in the public sector.  Senior managers, like politicians, are paid enough to do a much better job in this regard.  I do not wish this to be characterised as an attack on low-level, front-of-office, public-facing public servants because it is not.  It is a criticism of a lack of systems to facilitate the work being done.  It is apparent to me and to many of my constituents that it is not being done.</p>  <p>  To recap, I welcome this legislation.  It could and should have gone a great deal further.  If it is going to be replaced by a consolidation of the licensing laws within six months, I am willing to eat my words within six months, but I rather doubt it.</p></speech>

This legislation arose out of the uncertainty that existed at the time.  Our licensing law is quite archaic and is made up of amendment upon amendment, in many cases.  The uncertainty at the time gave rise, in particular, to concerns around insurance and who was going to be responsible if anything happened.  Perhaps in the past we muddled along with the little bit of outdoor hospitality which had been happening.  This legislation has been a great success culturally and the amendments to the legislation have been very successful.  The Civil Service team who drafted it deserve great credit because it was done at very short notice but it brought a very effective long-term solution, albeit one that has to be renewed every six months.</p>  <p>  The proposal is to bring forward a very significant piece of reform around licensing law and a scheme is being worked on to that end.  That is challenging - there is no question of that.  I completed about 50 licensing applications in my time when I practised.  Licensing law is a funny area in that it takes a long time to get your head around it.  As Larry Gogan might have said, once you know it, it is easy.  It is complicated to get your head around it initially and there is certainly a lack of plain language in it.  This will take a body of work and I do not know how long that will take.  </p> <p>It certainly is being actively worked on and driven forward.  </p> <p> I agree with the Deputies who raised the issues around footpaths.  While the development of outdoor facilities is very positive, we need to ensure footpaths remain accessible to people who have mobility challenges, including those who use wheelchairs.  This extends to outdoor spaces and streets.  We must be conscious that wheelchair spaces have been, on occasion, used for outdoor dining.  That should not happen or, at the very least, alternative spaces should be provided close by.</p> <p> Deputy Howlin noted that the licensed trade sector is under huge pressure.  Coming off the back of the pandemic, the rising cost of living is now having an impact.  As we in Wexford know only too well, there is huge difficulty in getting staff to work in the hotel industry, despite its being a very well-run industry.</p> <p> I agree with Deputy Catherine Murphy's point regarding the design of our streets.  The whole question of the built environment and how it is designed is hugely important.  It has an impact on our environment and culture and on people's mental health.  We must ensure these spaces are warm and welcoming.  It is possible to design outdoor spaces in such a way as to minimise antisocial behaviour.  There used to be a unit in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that helped with those types of designs.  It is an interesting area.</p> <p> I thank all the Deputies for their contributions.  I hear what they are saying.  The provision of outdoor spaces has worked and it is great, but we need to get to a point where they become a permanent fixture.  I do not think this Government or any alternative Government will roll back on this particular development, but there are a number of issues that need to be considered.  Whatever about a scheme being ready, I do not expect legislation to be passed within six months.  I certainly hope I am still in my role then and we will see where we are at that point.</p></speech>

The House will be well aware of the challenge that sector has faced during a prolonged period of the implementation of public health measures, due to which restaurants and hotels had to be closed for so long.  I am also conscious that we are now in a position where, at the end of this month, the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, that has provided large and much-needed support to the hospitality sector will no longer be available.  Therefore, it is appropriate to give certainty and clarity to the hospitality sector on where it stands.  It is especially important to see the hospitality sector have a good summer and then a successful off-shoulder period between November and February.  I hope hotels, in particular, will be in a position to be able to give clear pricing to tour operators and that restaurants in the run-up to the Christmas period will be able to give certainty regarding the price on their bookings throughout that period.  For all of those reasons, this extension is merited.  I look forward to a discussion in the D&aacute;il on it and, I hope, the support of the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-25a.277" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1462" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="17:22:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022052500053#GGG00600"><p>These are three amendments that have been returned from the Seanad with regard to the Finance (Covid-19 and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2022.  We will support them.  As the Minister said, they provide for an extension of the 9% VAT rate for the tourism and hospitality sector until 1 March 2023.  It is worth pointing out that since this initiative was reintroduced in budget 2021, to run from 1 November 2020 until now, wherein it will now expire on 1 March 2023, it has come with a price tag of &euro;902 million.  That is a large price tag but we also have to recognise that the hospitality sector has been hit hard during the pandemic.  It has a longer tail in terms of recovery.  This 9% VAT rate will benefit a considerable number of areas, including restaurant supplies, tourist accommodation, cinemas, theatres, museums, historic houses, open farms, amusement parks and hairdressing, to name but a few.  It is there to support the sectors that have been disproportionately impacted as a result of the pandemic and to support employment and business survival into next year.</p><p>It is clear that the hospitality and tourism sectors have been considerably impacted but it should be noted that they have also received a large financial support from the taxpayer.  Accommodation and food services have received more than &euro;2 billion in subsidy payments through the employment wage subsidy scheme and warehoused nearly &euro;500 million of tax through the tax warehousing scheme.  They will now benefit from an extended reduction in the VAT rate.  While this reduction will benefit sectors and big businesses that are genuinely struggling to enjoy pre-pandemic levels of trading, it will also benefit sectors that deserve greater scrutiny, especially the hotel sector in this city.  </p><p>According to F&aacute;ilte Ireland's February 2022 hotel survey, hotel room occupancy jumped from 33.9% in January to 53.6% in February and demand is continuing to pick up due to relaxing Covid-19 restrictions.  Bed space occupancy, the proportion of available bed space sold during February, was also well above January's rate of 24.3%, at 38.6%.  However, room occupancy continued to lag behind pre-pandemic levels.  In relative terms, room occupancy was nearly 17% below February 2019.  Nonetheless, as has been the current trend, hotel room rates have surpassed those recorded before Covid-19.  We see from the consumer price index that the price of hotel accommodation went up by 8.3% in April alone.  Already in March, it had increased by 5.5% and it has gone up 20% in the past year.  As we see real-time prices in May, the price is obviously increasing again.</p><p>It is clear that Dublin hotels have bounced back from the pandemic, with prices bouncing back even higher, as has been described by Conor Pope in <i>The Irish Times</i>.  High hotel room prices have a serious impact on domestic tourists, those who need to come to the city for hospital appointments and others.  It also has the impact of discouraging foreign tourists from visiting the capital and it has a knock-on effect on the other hospitality sectors that depend on those tourists.  Given the significant State largesse distributed to the hotel sector at the taxpayer's expense, it is galling to hear some in the sector complain that hotels cannot compete with the social insurance system.</p> <p>My suggestion is they should compete by increasing pay and improving workers' terms and conditions, which is a good start.  There have been unprecedented State supports during the pandemic.  It has been a form of corporate welfare which was necessary at the time.  For the sector to call for cuts to social welfare will not cut it.  Hotels are the beneficiaries of this 9% extended VAT rate, which will cost a total of &euro;902 million since its introduction.  There is a clear need for the Minister, on behalf of the Government, to outline the expectation of this VAT extension and how it will be passed on to customers.  It is hard for many people to take.  I know one cannot differentiate between the hotel sector and other sectors involved in tourism.  I just went on to <i>booking.com</i>to look at hotel prices for the weekend after next.  One night, which is in the Shelbourne, in fairness, costs &euro;1,067.  One night in another hotel costs &euro;579.  I am reading these out as they appear.  Others cost &euro;580, &euro;516, &euro;495, &euro;499, &euro;314 or &euro;1,840 to stay in the Clarence for one night.  Others cost &euro;518, &euro;634 and &euro;441.  These are rates that nobody can pay.<br/><br/>Hard cases come to our constituency offices involving young children who may have had to go to Temple Street hospital or Crumlin hospital and people ask if we know anybody in Dublin who will open their house to them.  They cannot afford these rates of &euro;400, &euro;500 or &euro;600 to stay in hotels that have benefited massively from taxpayers' money over the past two years.  I am taking this opportunity, because I think it is appropriate, since the hotel sector will benefit from the 9% extended VAT rate, to ask the Government to intervene on the price gouging I believe is taking place in the sector.  There is no way that hotel rooms should cost that amount.  That will impact our tourism sector.  We are not even into peak season.  It will impact our tourism product and it will have a serious impact on individuals.  As I have mentioned before, many people are impacted who were considering holidaying in Ireland and looking at short stays here in the city.<br/><br/>Hotel costs are not just high in this city.  People on local radio stations have said they have gone to London instead.  A woman called Marian was on Ocean FM.  She said that on a Saturday night, she was going to be charged &euro;888, &euro;900 and &euro;999 for one night in Dublin at three hotels.  She did not go.  She went to Britain instead.  This is a trend that needs to be dealt with.  The Minister of State said the 9% extension is a two-way street.  The hotel sector needs to meet taxpayers mid-stream, because the taxpayers have supported this sector over a long time, particularly during the pandemic.</p></speech>

I differ with him about the description he used for the support for the hospitality sector.  He described it as a form of corporate welfare.  Nobody is no more aware than I am of how much support went to that sector, though I know the Deputy is aware of it too.  He is right that it is the largest beneficiary of the employment wage subsidy scheme.  It also benefited from the Covid restrictions support scheme.  It received those funds and support because it is a huge employer in our country and we asked it to stay closed.  That support was needed.  It was not corporate welfare.  It was put in place for a particular reason and at a significant cost.  When I see restaurants and hotels that have reopened and are employing significant numbers, I see that it was a support that worked.</p>  <p>  The Deputy makes a valuable point, which I communicated when this measure was announced, that we expect that the measure will be used in a way that delivers competitiveness to those who are staying in hotels and using businesses and allows these businesses to ensure that, after what I hope will be a good summer, they have a good run of trade and viability as well as being able to offer pricing that will give confidence to consumers to use our hotels and restaurants.  I also want to say that hotels in Dublin that take the period ahead to charge prices that are just too high will ultimately lose out from that.  Tourists both here at home and internationally will go elsewhere and we will end up with the kind of risks and challenges we faced in the past.  We see a risk of Dublin tourism and hotels becoming unaffordable and uncompetitive.  It is bad for them and for other businesses across our country that need Dublin as an entry point into the rest of Ireland's tourism offering.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy was speaking about Dublin, I looked at the prices of hotels, bed and breakfast accommodation, and apartments in Donegal tonight.  I can see that excellent value is available, with prices of &euro;80, &euro;95 and &euro;85 to stay in good businesses in a beautiful part of our country that needs a good summer and a successful part of the year.  Those are the businesses I have in mind when bringing forward this 9% extension.  Businesses outside Dublin need a period of certainty to ensure they can have a successful period of trading, especially as they exit the employment wage subsidy scheme.  As Deputy Doherty knows, though in fairness he did not suggest otherwise, I do not have the ability to differentiate the VAT rate between hotels, restaurants and different parts of the country.</p>  <p>  I appreciate that Sinn F&eacute;in is supporting the extension we are making here.  It is the right thing for the tourism sector overall.  I emphasise that if good value and affordable prices for hotels are not offered over the summer period, it will ultimately unravel the ability of Irish tourism to grow and make progress again after two difficult years.  It will ultimately also show why this 9% VAT rate should be temporary.</p></speech>

With respect, I do not know why the Minister took issue with the term "corporate welfare".  It was not used in a derogatory way.  Just as we have an obligation and responsibility to support people who find themselves unemployed with welfare supports, as the Minister knows, I supported measures to support the corporate sector because of the restrictions and the pandemic.  We wanted to make sure the employees were supported and that businesses were alive and able to continue to trade.  It was not said in a derogatory way but said as acknowledgement of the support provided to the sector.  The Minister made the point for me that I focus on Donegal.  I support the extension of the 9%.  That does not absolve the Government from dealing with the issue, which requires more than just the Minister for Finance telling the sector it will shoot itself in the foot by continuing to do this.</p>  <p>  This is having a real-time impact on people in the middle of a cost of living crisis.  People find it difficult when they come overnight for hospital appointments.  Tourism is affected when people come to the city for major events and so on.  I would like to see the Government be more proactive and to sit down with the industry and call it out in those meetings to make it clear.  While there cannot be differentiation with VAT, there are other tax tools.  Many other countries have bedroom taxes and so on.  I am not suggesting the Minister go down that road, but there are options relating to this industry.  More engagement with the sector is needed.  The hotels that appeared randomly on my phone cost between &euro;500 and &euro;1,000 for a Saturday night in Dublin two weeks from now.</p> <p>They are going to benefit from this measure.  The least we could expect from Government is for it to sit down with them and tell them to cut this out.  It is gouging.  I would like to see the Government call the industry in, speak to the Irish Hotels Federation and deal with the issues that are arising, particularly in this city.</p></speech>

I introduced legislation back in 2018 to cap the levels of interest that moneylenders can charge and have been campaigning for changes to the law for several years.  The permitting of ultra-high high interest rates charged by moneylenders is immoral and unethical.  Had moneylenders never existed, no one would or could justify any lender charging the level of interest they do.  That is precisely what the law does.  It permits moneylenders to charge rates of interest that trap vulnerable borrowers into vicious cycles of debt.  At present under law, under this and previous Governments, moneylenders licensed by the Central Bank have been permitted to charge annual percentage rates, APRs, of up to 187% on loans.  This increases to 288% once collection charges are included.  When compared with more affordable sources of credit such as credit unions with APRs of no more than 12.67%, there are no grounds on which high rates could ever have been justified.</p><p>Imposing a cap on the cost of credit that moneylenders can charge is fundamentally a moral issue.  For several years, the Minister and the Department of Finance have resisted any calls to restrict the cost of credit moneylenders can charge, often on dubious grounds.  European countries already have interest rate restrictions in place: in Spain on the grounds that ultra-high interest rates are excessive, in Finland on the grounds that they are unconscionable, and in Germany because they lack moral legitimacy.  All of these assessments are correct.  In 2018, the landmark report published by University College Cork and authored by Dr. Mary Faherty, Dr. Olive McCarthy and Dr. Noreen Byrne brought focus to this issue and found that 21 out of 28 European Union member states had an interest rate restriction in place.  They also called for a cap on interest rates here.</p><p>In March, my legislation to put a cap on the interest moneylenders could charge was rejected by the Government.  The argument deployed most often was that the cap on interest rates would lead to moneylenders leaving the market with borrowers being forced into the arms of illegal moneylenders.  Despite their concerns, when the biggest moneylender in the State, Provident, left the market last year, the Department did not even issue a press release to advise borrowers of what to do.</p><p>My amendment would put in place a cap that this D&aacute;il can morally stand over, one that could reduce the cost of credit moneylenders can charge, protecting consumers who are vulnerable to vicious cycles of debt, and reducing the interest they are charged.  It proposes an initial cap of 0.75% in simple interest per week up to a maximum of 36% per annum on a cash loan.  This would then reduce to 0.35% in simple interest per week up to a maximum of 18% per annum.  This provides a more ambitious restriction than the one put forward by the Government in this legislation.  The Government's proposal currently before the House would allow a moneylender to charge &euro;480 on a &euro;1,000 cash loan over a 12-month term, when a credit union would charge &euro;60 for the equivalent loan.  The Government's proposal would allow a moneylender to charge 129% APR.  I do not believe this proposal should be supported in the D&aacute;il.  It is not one the D&aacute;il can morally stand over.  We in Sinn F&eacute;in cannot stand over it.  That is why we have proposed this amendment.</p><p>The interest rate restriction we have proposed in our amendment is one the moneylending sector can bear as it moves towards a more professional and digitalised mode of business in which labour costs are substantially reduced.  Crucially, it is one the D&aacute;il can ethically tolerate, ensuring as it does that the total cost of credit a moneylender could charge would reduce from six to three times the average cost of credit of an equivalent loan from a credit union.  I hope the D&aacute;il will do the right thing and support this amendment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-25a.287" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1590" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="17:42:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022052500055#JJJ01000"><p>I thank Deputy Doherty for his proposed amendment, which we discussed on Committee Stage.  Deputy Doherty and I agree on many elements of this Bill, including the need for a statutory interest rate cap.  We are at odds here on the precise rate of that cap.  Deputy Doherty's amendment would reduce the caps in the Bill and cut the caps in three years' time to rates that would compare with mainstream lending rates.  Lower interest rates are better for consumers; I am aware of that.  The purpose of this legislation is to reduce interest rates and the Government remains open to cutting the interest rate again in the future based on evidence we will ask the Central Bank to collect.</p>  <p>  I want to explain how we arrived at the figures I am proposing in the Bill.  In 2019, the Department of Finance held a public consultation on the introduction of a statutory interest rate.  Fourteen submissions were received in favour of a cap with six against.  There was no consensus as to what the cap should look like or on the level at which it should be set.  Following the public consultation, the Department carried out further research, which was published last July and is available on the Department's website.  It showed there was an appetite for a statutory cap, that such a cap should be on a simple interest basis for cash loans, that the rate should be adjustable over time, and that care should be taken to mitigate the potential impact on supply arising from the introduction of such a cap.</p>  <p>  The research showed there is currently a concentration of loan offerings between 1% and 1.2% simple interest rate per week in the market.  An initial interest rate cap of 1% will make these loans cheaper.  It will take the most expensive products off the market and will require the bulk of products to be revised downwards.  It is also accompanied by a ban on home collection charges, which currently apply in many situations.  At the same time, the initial rates will allow moneylenders to revise their business model and reduce their margin to enable them to operate within the legislative cap.</p>  <p>  It is not every day we bring forward legislation to cut revenue of an industry.  I do not have any sympathy for the industry, but if interest rates for moneylenders are reduced too much and too quickly, some moneylenders may cease operating and the availability of much-needed credit for many people could be reduced.  The biggest market player has already left, as the Deputy has mentioned.  The moneylenders that remain would be likely to reduce their credit risk appetite and would leave a portion of their existing customers with even more limited access to regulated credit.  If borrowers' access to regulated credit is reduced, a number of things can happen.  Some will go to other regulated lenders such as credit unions.  Some will go to family and friends and some will go without.  Some will, however, end up as victims of illegal moneylenders and that is what we must avoid.  There is very little information available about the potential migration of customers from moneylenders to unlicensed moneylenders.  This makes it difficult to assess the likelihood of consumers migrating to unlicensed moneylenders if a cap is introduced that reduces or removes the supply of credit from licensed moneylenders.  Even if it is a small percentage of people who do this, that will be a very big deal for those individuals and vulnerable families especially.  It is easy to say the rates are too high, but if people are availing of them. we cannot cut these borrowers off either.  It is not an exact science nor is it the ultimate destination.  It is an appropriate place to start.</p> <p>Therefore, we are starting with the 1%, which can be reduced over time.</p> <p> The legislation sets out the principles and policies that guide the Minister when making regulations to set the specific caps, and these include in particular the financial inclusion issues to ensure people have access to loans when they need them and that there is credit available in the market.  This provides flexibility to amend the caps downwards while ensuring there is always an upper limit in the primary legislation.  The figure set in the legislation, 1%, can be reduced over time but we are starting at this point.</p> <p> The legislation also provides two separate caps: a weekly one of 1% and an annual one of 48%.  These can be adjusted either separately or together, depending on the information in the market.  This is a better approach than setting particular limits, which businesses may fail to adjust, ultimately reducing the availability of credit for many borrowers.  As already mentioned, the largest player has withdrawn from the Irish and UK markets.  We must ensure there continue to be people who can lend to those who actually need a loan.</p> <p> Including in the primary legislation a maximum rate to apply in three years presupposes without any analysis a level of reduction the market will be able to take.  The Deputy&rsquo;s amendment prescribes the rate we should have in three years.  I want to see lower rates as much as Deputy Doherty, but we have to take care not to reduce the supply when introducing the caps.  With regard to setting the rate for three years&rsquo; time at this point without any evidence as to how the market will be, the availability and the social inclusion issues that need to apply, it is appropriate to make the decisions closer to the time.  This legislation provides for that, and it can be done based on the evidence we will collect or that the Central Bank will collect on our behalf in the intervening three years rather than guessing what we will need in three years.  Therefore, it is important we start at this point with the view to being in a position to make a change as time goes on.</p> <p> This legislation also deals with what we call running accounts, which some of the catalogue operators have.  Many will be familiar with these.  They feature all year round.  Sometimes there are Christmas catalogues.  We want to ensure people have funds available without having to seek recourse to illegal moneylenders.  That is what we want to ensure here.</p> <p> I accept and have put it on the public record that Deputy Doherty has done tremendous work in this area over recent years.  He has produced information and legislation on the matter.  We agree on practically everything, including the principles of the Bill, the running accounts, the need for a cap, the need for a review and the need to set the maximum cap, but the point of difference is the particular interest rate.  We want to introduce one we are satisfied will look after vulnerable people who need access to cash.  We can review it as time goes along.</p></speech>

He said he would like to see interest rates reduce as much as I would.  I do not believe that is the case because, if it were, he would not be proposing an APR of 129%.  However, I am going to give him the benefit of the doubt.  He can vote for my amendment, which would reduce the interest rate.</p></speech>

It is needed.  We do need regulation in this area.  All Members are aware of the very good work that guardians <i>ad litem</i>do and the service they provide for children in care.  We definitely need some sort of rules or regulations attached to that, however.  The Bill is very welcome.  These are the only amendments that have been tabled to it.  In general, we welcome the Bill but we believe these amendments need to be factored in.</p><p>Amendment No. 1 proposes to insert in section 35E(1) that a function of a guardian <i>ad litem</i>shall be &quot;to represent the child&rsquo;s interests in the proceedings to which the guardian<i>ad litem</i>has been appointed&quot;.  Deputy Sherlock is present in the Chamber.  In the previous D&aacute;il, this amendment was passed on Committee Stage in 2019 but it is not in the new Bill.  At the time, we, along with Deputy Rabbitte, who is now a Minister of State, argued strongly for this amendment to be included because it is a catch-all.  It ensures there are no grey areas in respect of the role of a guardian <i>ad litem.</i>There are serious concerns in respect of a guardian <i>ad litem</i>, GAL, potentially being relegated to the status of a witness.</p><p>That leads me on to amendment No. 2, which proposes to delete section 35E(8) and replace it with, &quot;The court may hear from the guardian <i>ad litem </i>in respect of any welfare matter concerning the child.&quot;</p>  <p>There is a concern that if a GAL is characterised as a witness, it dilutes their role.  They would perhaps be called for certain parts of the proceedings and would not be present for the whole proceedings.  The big thing in all of this is that they are to advocate for the child and be the child&rsquo;s voice.  Therefore, it is very important that there are no grey areas.</p> <p> It is a minor amendment, but it would strengthen the legislation.  It something that was accepted in the past and it is somehow not in the new form.  I hope the Minister will accept these amendments.</p></speech>

As she said, the committee already adjudicated on this very issue in a previous iteration of this Bill.  I see no reason that there should not be continuity in that regard for the same reasons the Deputy outlined.  The role of the GAL should not be overly prescribed.  Should a particular set of circumstances arise, there should be a degree of latitude and understanding.  Given a particular type of scenario that might arise in respect of the child, we should ensure the child&rsquo;s interests are served in the widest possible means that is allowable.  The amendment speaks to that need specifically and I thank the Deputy for bringing it forward.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-25a.300" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="18:12:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022052500059#NNN00300"><p>I thank Deputy Funchion for these two amendments.  I will speak to both amendments because they are linked.  I thank Deputy Sherlock for his contribution.  I am not in a position to support these two amendments.  I hope I can clarify why that is.</p><p>In terms of the amendment No. 1, my concern is that the use of the word &quot;represent&quot; could be interpreted as active representation.  This would conflict with the policy position that a guardian<i>ad litem</i>is not a party to proceedings in every circumstance.  The Bill before us has calibrated the power of guardians <i>ad litem</i>to enable them to perform their functions.  The formulation of the amendment goes further than the existing functions of the guardian <i>ad litem</i>.  These are to ascertain views and make recommendations regarding what is in the child&rsquo;s bests interests.  A requirement on the guardian <i>ad litem</i>to identify the child&rsquo;s bests interests in the proceedings could go far beyond informing the court of what is in the child&rsquo;s best interests.  It could be interpreted as meaning active representation and the power of the GAL under this Bill is not in accordance with such a function.</p><p>Under the principal Act, GALs are not a party to proceedings and they do not have the status of a party.  At the court&rsquo;s discretion, they have sometimes been permitted to exercise party-type rights.  I am aware that during the discussions in 2019, prior to me becoming a Member of the Oireachtas, Deputies, and I am sure both Deputies present here, expressed concerns about the status of guardians <i>ad litem </i>in proceedings.  On foot of these concerns, when I came into office and was reviewing the draft legislation, I asked my officials to revisit this issue and explore the issue of party-type rights for GALs with the Office of the Attorney General.  As a result of that, a new section was added to this legislation, which is section 35E(11).  This subsection provides that the court may, where it is satisfied, having regard to the nature of the case, that it is necessary and in the best interest of the child and in the interests of justice to do so, order that the GAL shall have such party rights as it may specify.  This means the court can specify that a GAL can have party-type rights and what those party-type rights are.  The court my specify whether the exercise of the rights is for the entirety of the proceedings or in respect of particular issues in the proceedings.</p><p>I am satisfied that the Bill, with that addition to it, gives GALs wide-ranging powers to exercise their functions while also providing for the flexibility for the court to grant them additional party-type rights as required.  I think that is the degree of latitude the Deputy was speaking to, that it gives the court the right to give party-type rights where the situation requires it.  We do not believe they should be given as a basis in absolutely every type of situation, but we are giving the court that discretion now.  That party-type right comes from a High Court decision from a number of years ago where a judge spoke to that, and we thought we would codify that approach.  What is proposed in the legislation gives that approach and that is why I am not in the position to accept Deputy Funchion&rsquo;s first amendment.</p><p>In terms of amendment No. 2 and the issue of the witness and this idea that the guardian <i>ad litem</i>would be relegated to the status of the witness, that is not our intention.  I hope I can provide some reassurance here, but I also have a concern that by deleting the text about witnesses, as is proposed in part of the Deputy&rsquo;s amendment, we think there is a risk that what she is proposing &ndash; I imagine this is inadvertent &ndash; may result in a fact that a guardian <i>ad litem</i>cannot ever be called as a witness.  I do not think that is what anyone intends, but that would be problematic.</p><p>The amendment proposes to delete the existing section 35E(8) and to substitute text to provide that guardians <i>ad litem</i>may inform the court in relation to any matter concerning the welfare of the child.  The text that is being deleted is the text that refers to the possibility of guardians <i>ad litem</i>being witnesses.</p><p>I would like to clarify that the purpose of the existing wording is not to limit the role of a GAL to that of a witness.  There is no intention that this would be the case.  The purpose of the existing provision is to allow a guardian <i>ad litem</i>to be sworn in.  If this provision is deleted, it could potentially disadvantage situations where it is valuable for another party to call a guardian <i>ad litem</i>as a witness.  For example, a parent who is a party to a case may use the existing provision to call the guardian<i>ad litem</i>as a witness and get their sworn testimony.  I think most people would see that is positive.  </p><p>This reference to a GAL being called as a witness does not exist in isolation.  It has to be read in conjunction with other parts of the legislation, particularly Part VA.  When the new Part VA is considered in the round, we would argue it is clear that the role and status of the GAL goes far behind that of just witness.  For example, under section 35F, a guardian <i>ad litem</i>may apply to the court to procure a report on any question affecting the welfare of the child where there is no existing report or where there is a report but the information contained within it is out of date.  The GAL may also make an application to the court in relation to the provision of information from any person or in relation to any other function which relates to the guardian <i>ad litem</i>&rsquo;s functions.  The GAL may also continue to make section 47 applications.  This section, which is already in the Child Care Act, allows them to make an application on any question affecting the welfare of a child in the care of Tusla.</p><p>Those are all provisions in the legislation and they demonstrate that the role of the GAL is one that is beyond a witness.  I do not think the provision that is proposed to be deleted would restrict the role or status of a GAL to that of a mere witness.  I would also say it is a risk to delete that section and it may limit the ability of calling GALs as witness, and there are times when it may be a good thing for a GAL to be called as a witness.  I agree it is important that a guardian <i>ad litem</i>has the ability to inform the court of any concern regarding the welfare of the child to whom they have been appointed.</p><p>I believe the second point and the kind of active nature of the amendment Deputy Funchion is proposing is already covered by section 35E, and in particular subsection (2)(c) which states a guardian <i>ad litem</i>appointed for a child shall inform the court of any additional matters, relevant to the best interest of the child, coming to his or her knowledge as a result of the performance by the guardian <i>ad litem</i>of his or her functions.  That is a statutory obligation that is in the legislation at the moment.  I just contrast that with the language used in the new text that Deputy Funchion is proposing.  Her amendment states, &ldquo;The court may hear from the guardian <i>ad litem</i>in respect of any welfare matter concerning the child.&rdquo;  Deputy Funchion&rsquo;s provision is a &ldquo;may&rdquo; provision, while the existing provision is a &ldquo;shall&rdquo; provision.  Again, the existing provision is a strong statutory obligation.</p><p>We are both looking to achieve the same goal, which is that the guardian <i>ad litem</i>can input to the court about matters relevant to the welfare of the child but I believe the existing provision, section 35E(2)(c), does it better and is perhaps a stronger manifestation than the one being proposed.  I am satisfied that the statutory functions of the GAL as set out in the Bill make clear that the role of the GAL is to assist and be a resource to the court.</p> <p>The GALs cannot fulfil their statutory duties as set out in this Bill if their role was solely one as a witness and I hope I have demonstrated that is not the case.</p> <p> We have amended this legislation from the version that was discussed in the previous D&aacute;il to give the court a discretion in each circumstance if it is necessary for that particular case to give a GAL party-type rights and to specify what those party-type rights are.  That is an advancement but it does not mean party-type rights in every circumstances.  Party-type rights are not needed in every circumstance.  Recognising the work the Minister for Justice is doing regarding family courts, we will have much more specialist family courts where judges will be able to recognise when such rights are needed and when they are not.</p> <p> With regard to the second point, Deputy Funchion and myself are on the same page in ensuring GALs can input on issues relevant to the welfare of the child.  There is a strong provision in the legislation already.  We are at one in terms of a GAL not being a mere witness - that is not the case and I hope we have demonstrated that is not the case - but I have a concern about that proposal to delete the reference to a GAL appearing as a witness because that is the basis upon which the GALs can be called in cases.  I would argue it would be a mistake to remove that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-25a.302" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1449" speakername="Kathleen Funchion" time="18:22:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022052500060#OOO00200"><p>I will respond to some of those points.  Regarding amendment No. 1, I do not see what the difficulty or issue is with even the wording or language of that because it was passed and was allowed through in the legislation the last time around.  In terms of any Attorney General's advice or anything, I assume it would have gone through all of that before the previous D&aacute;il fell.</p><p>My concern is: what if one gets a court that is not <i>au fait</i>with this?  It is good, as the Minister said, that the family courts will be changed and reformed.  Everybody will welcome that but in the interim, in many cases family courts, I hate to say it, in some areas of the country are genuinely not fit for purpose.  If a court interprets something one way, I do not see what the difficulty is in giving the GAL that status.  If it is not needed, obviously, it is not needed.  Why do they have to fight for that and why is it at the discretion of the court?  I have an issue with that because of what happens, as I queried on Second Stage, if there is any sort of grey area.  There is not an appeals mechanism, as far as I understand it.  I do not see what the issue is with adding in the phrasing that we have there.</p><p>Regarding the word &quot;witness&quot;, my concern is that in a court situation one is calling somebody a witness.  Everyone's understanding of that is that he or she comes forward, gives his or her piece, and goes again, and that is it.  They are not involved.  If a particular judge or a particular family court is rigid and states that this person is described as a witness, I do not see the difficulty with the language.</p><p>We have not tabled a string of amendments, which shows we are sincere in welcoming the Bill.  These are just two minor amendments that, to a certain extent, we had discussed and had been decided upon.  I accept the times move on, D&aacute;ileanna change and all the rest of it.  Whatever about maybe them being opposed for the sake of it, I do not accept that there is any issue with the language in them because that was not flagged with us in the previous process when some were agreed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-25a.303" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="18:22:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022052500060#OOO00300"><p>I accept that all amendments have been tabled with good intent and I am responding to them as such.</p><p>I was not in the previous D&aacute;il.  My understanding was there was no reference to party-type rights in the original draft.  The Deputy tabled an amendment similar to what she is proposing here.  What we have done now is proactively recognise that the issue of party-type rights had been left hanging.  It needed to be resolved.  We have put in a mechanism that is flexible.  I do not believe party-type rights are needed in every situation.  We have put in place a mechanism that gives the court that discretion to put them in where they are needed and put in the type of party rights that are needed.</p><p>We have accepted the overall point that the Deputy and others raised in the previous D&aacute;il that there are circumstances where party-type rights are necessary.  While she is absolutely correct to bring forward an amendment, our amendment better encapsulates the flexibility that is needed in these types of situations.  The provision at present states &quot;The court or any party to the proceedings may call a guardian <i>ad litem</i>appointed for a child as a witness.&quot;, and the proposal is to delete that as part of amendment No. 2.  That is problematic.  I would like to think that I have pointed out the reasons.  It is clear that the GAL is not only a witness.  Indeed, the mere fact that in certain circumstances a GAL can have party-type rights is even further evidence that it is clear that the way in which a GAL is treated under this legislation is not as a witness.  He or she is not a witness.  It is proposed to delete that clear statutory permission to allow perhaps a parent call the GAL in as a witness and get that testimony.
