In the aftermath of Storm Doris, the ESB is working hard to ensure that people have power restored to their homes.  We wish it well in that task.</p>  <p>  What I want to deal with briefly is people who, unfortunately, do not have homes.  I am conscious that there have been many announcements and plans to deal with the challenges facing the housing sector.  We gave the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Development, who had the best of intentions and who engaged in a wide-ranging consultative process involving stakeholders - which was fed into by an Oireachtas committee - time and space.  We allowed some time to see if what was envisaged could be implemented.  Considering the abject failure of the previous plan under the same people in Government, it was always going to be about implementation and we wished it well.  It is time that we begin to engage in an honest appraisal of what is being delivered.  Records continue to be set in the context of the number of people who are homeless, the cost of rent and the gamut of factors associated with the housing construction sector and the provision of housing.  On Monday, Focus Ireland showed that last month a child became homeless every five hours.  That is a shameful statistic.  We in this House are obliged to seek to remove whatever obstacles are preventing the implementation of any plans that are envisaged.  On Tuesday, the Taoiseach waxed lyrical about the fact over 8,500 units are under construction at present.</p><p>I lost my head trying to point out to him that this was not true.  I do not want to be losing my cool but we have to impart the frustration felt by those who come into my clinic and the clinic of every other Member to the Members in government.  Of those units he referenced, only 1,829 are under construction, the rest are going through various stages of the process and the majority were approved more than two years ago.  A total of 652 units is all that was built last year.  By 2020 the majority of the houses we are talking about will not be built and, at best, the 8,500 units will be built.  Many local authorities did not build any houses last year.</p> <p> The Government seems to be obsessed with announcements in the hope that they will bamboozle people with volumes of details so that they will not see what is going on, but we all are quite aware that progress is not being made.</p></speech>

Yesterday we saw the employment figures again improving and we saw the level of unemployment being reduced to 6.8%, a figure which the Deputy's party said would never be reached, and it also said that the targets in the Action Plan for Jobs would never be reached.  That is the position from which the Deputy is coming in terms of his view of the various actions that have been put forward-----</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-02-23a.26" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" time="12:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017022300004#B02000"><p>-----but the figures speak for themselves when it comes to employment.</p>  <p>  In regard to housing, the approach to it has been spelt out clearly by the Minister, Deputy Coveney.  We have more money, more input than ever before and more detailed work with various local authorities to provide housing.  We accept the seriousness of the situation.  That is why we have a Minister with particular responsibility for housing.  The budget in that Department has increased more than the budget in any other Department in order to reflect the seriousness of the crisis.  Today, &euro;32 million will be announced to deal with the repair and leasing scheme and local authorities will work around the country to make sure that more properties are available for those in need of housing.  Also this week, the four Dublin local authorities have confirmed that we will meet a point that the Minister, Deputy Coveney, has said, namely, that children and families will not be using hotels in the Dublin area.  It has been confirmed by the four local authorities that this will be addressed by mid this year.</p>  <p>  What have a targeted social plan.  The Deputy spoke about 8,500 units.  There are 8,500 social housing units currently being built across the country, with 509 different organisations engaged in different projects delivering those houses.  That is real, it is happening on the ground and it is about providing housing.  It is about making sure that we can deal with the huge demand for housing that exists.  We have new people coming into the country and families looking for housing.  We accept the seriousness of the situation.  That is why it has been a priority for the Government  That is why the budget is there to deliver and why so many different units across the country, local authority, public and private providers, are delivering those houses.</p><p>Just as the jobs have been delivered over the past few years and the target in that regard has been met and exceeded, we will meet the housing targets which have been outlined but this takes time, as everybody recognises.  The plans are under way, the money is there, the budget has been allocated and the matter has been prioritised by Government.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-02-23a.28" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1217" speakername="Barry Cowen" time="12:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017022300005#C00200"><p>Were the T&aacute;naiste aware of or interested in the urgency of this situation, were she as frustrated as everybody else with the lack of real progress, she would ask questions at Cabinet and be aware of the matter and be in a position to answer the question I am asking her.  If 8,500 units are under construction, the majority were approved two years ago, and many of them are not even on site yet.  I am taking as an example just one local authority area where many would say the crisis is at its worst.  Why are 500 acres of zoned residential land in south County Dublin lying idle, with no specific local authority plans to deal with it?  These are State-owned lands.  Why has the Government not recognised the obstacles not allowing these lands to come to fruition much more quickly than it should?  Why will the Government not consider any authority other than the local authorities and the Department, which have failed miserably in the past number of years?  Fine Gael is depending on conventional methods that have failed to deliver a plan it said would be the greatest ever when it was in government last year.</p></speech>

It is worth looking at some of the initiatives that have taken place and have been delivered already.  In 2016, 18,380 social housing supports were provided to people, exceeding the target of 17,240, with expenditure of &euro;935 million on housing that year.

They read this morning with horror that the situation has spun so far out of control that the estimated cost has ballooned from an initial &euro;404 million in 2012 to a mind-boggling figure of more than &euro;1 billion today.  As it stands, Ireland's national children's hospital - if built - will be the most expensive children's hospital to be built anywhere in the world.  This infuriating saga is now a sorry tale of bungles, incompetence and broken promises stretching across two decades.  In that time, we have seen Governments led by both Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael make big announcements to the Irish people but deliver very little.  Today, 24 years after the idea was first proposed in 1993, the national children's hospital is still a project wrapped in uncertainty and chaos.  However, we should probably expect little else from a Government whose entire approach to health care is based on the fostering of crises, havoc and confusion.  As our health system creaks, the T&aacute;naiste's party has spent the past two weeks gazing at its navel, indulging its obsession with the question of who might be its new leader.</p><p>I have a newsflash for the T&aacute;naiste: both Fine Gael and the Government are bereft of leaders.  The abject failure to get a handle on the astronomical costs of the children's hospital and to allay the fears of parents is proof positive - if further proof were needed -of that fact.</p> <p> This week, 1,486 patients have found themselves on trolleys in our hospitals and this should rightly cause shock and outrage.  The truth, however, is that 500 people lying on trolleys daily has become normal under this Government.  We have seen through recent "RTE Investigates" programmes the horrifying stories of children as they wait in agony for vital scoliosis surgery.  On 7 March, nurses and hospital support workers will proceed with industrial action because of the stressful and unacceptable working conditions created by this Government.  Through its arrogant treatment of nurses, this Government is again putting the health and welfare of our children at grave risk.  Whether it is Deputy Varadkar or Deputy Coveney or anyone else in the hot seat, ordinary people have no faith in this Government to deliver a fair health service and accessible health care.  Can the T&aacute;naiste tell me how she can stand over the outrageous and spiralling costs of the children's hospital and indicate when the facility will be built?</p></speech>

In addition, we have a hospital design that everybody agrees is world class.  We will have a world-class children's hospital in the next couple of years.  The core estimate was made when construction inflation was estimated to be 3% and, as we know, the latter is running at higher than 9%.  The updated capital costs have been incorporated into the final project brief and submitted recently to the HSE and are under consideration.  The Minister for Health will bring forward an updated memorandum in respect of the hospital.  That memorandum will outline the new costs and full details relating to the project and will be brought forward shortly.  We must not lose sight of the vision for the new hospital, which will facilitate care for the very many sick children in this country.  It will cater for the 25% of the population comprising children.  We need that hospital because one in four citizens is a child.</p></speech>

Perhaps the chaos in both has been comparable in recent days.  The only thing that is clear here is that the T&aacute;naiste is continuing to equivocate on the matter of costs.  Is she happy that the children's hospital, if and when it is completed, will be the most expensive children's hospital built anywhere in the world?  A new children's hospital in Finland, which is a comparable jurisdiction, will cost half what our children's hospital is apparently going to cost.  What does the T&aacute;naiste intend to do about those costs?  Is the Government planning to sit on its hands again?  Will it leave it to the Committee of Public Accounts to call authorities to account for spiralling costs and to account for how public moneys are spent?  Everybody understands the need for the children's hospital.  As I said earlier, this debate has run since 1993.  The reality is that decades have passed and there is no hospital.  Now we read accounts of spiralling costs that are outrageous and indefensible.  I will repeat my questions.  What about the costs?  What does the Government intend to do about the &euro;1 billion bill that is being presented to the taxpayer?  When will the hospital be completed?</p></speech>

The Minister will bring a memorandum to the Cabinet in that regard.  There has been building inflation and that has to be taken into account.  Extra facilities that were not in the original plan are now being provided.  I refer to the educational and research centre, for example, which will be funded from elsewhere.  There will also be an input from philanthropy.  The Government is committed to ensuring the funding will be available.  On the subject of capital costs, it is quite clear that many of our major projects have had cost overruns.  When it was proposed to develop a second terminal at Dublin Airport, there was a great deal of discussion about the site, the building and the costs, but the terminal is now there and nobody is questioning it.</p></speech>

Two reports that were published recently by PricewaterhouseCoopers and Morgan McKinley show that the gender pay gap in this country is widening.  Interestingly, the figures show that the pay gap between the earnings of men and women has increased dramatically while Fine Gael has been in government.  The gap was 8.3% in 2012, but it increased to a high of 15.2% in 2015.  The cost of child care in this country, which is one of the most expensive in Europe, is one of the factors contributing to this.  It is supposedly planned to deliver a proper child care plan for female workers, 40% of whom are in low-paid, flexible or part-time contracts precisely because of the cost of child care.  The reports I have mentioned show that 3,000 women are being driven out of the workforce each year because of the cost of child care.  Another interesting fact set out in these reports is that in the last year or two, profits in the retail and hospitality sector have soared to over 40% above pre-crash levels.  The workers in this sector are predominantly women.  Equally, it is predominantly women who are on low pay, which is connected to low hours.  It cannot be denied that as women work fewer hours on lower levels of pay, they are driven further and further into poverty and therefore the gender gap widens even further.  There are scientific studies to show that this is the case.</p><p>This drives women further into poverty so the gender gap opens in this way.</p> <p> I know the T&aacute;naiste is not responsible for all those areas but she is responsible for dealing with the question of equality, and this indicates a large and growing equality gap affecting women in this country.  As well as enduring discrimination in pay, hours and contracts through working life, women who are now retiring are finding their contributory pension is being cut drastically because of banding and averaging of hours.  I know a couple, Paul and Pauline, who are related.  Paul has half the contributions of Pauline but she earns 30% less from her contributory pension.  Both of them have worked all their lives.  The T&aacute;naiste is presiding over inequality as Minister for Justice and Equality.  Therein lies the injustice.</p> <p> What will the T&aacute;naiste do about the growing gender equality and pay gap?  What will she do about the visible discrimination against pensioners, which is known to the Department?  When they retire, they are discriminated against on two grounds: age and, mostly, gender.  Women are primarily the homemakers and have been so through the years.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-02-23a.80" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" time="12:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017022300008#F00200"><p>The first point is about gender equality.  I saw the details of the report mentioned by the Deputy and they need examination.  There were quite a number of areas where it was highlighted how well Ireland is doing.  In terms of child care, the Government is investing more than has ever been invested in child care.  The Deputy quite rightly states that for women combining work and family life, we need access to high-quality, affordable and accessible child care, and that is what the Government is committed to doing.  We have introduced the second free preschool year and we have also dealt with the very important issue of young children in preschool who need access to special needs services.  For the first time, the Government has ensured those children will have access to special needs supports and assessment, which is very important.  Primarily, this is about increasing the number of affordable places, and that is happening with the second free preschool year.  There are more children than ever - approximately 120,000 - availing of those two free preschool years.  That will be rolled out in September.  There is also the matter of after-school places and the Minister, Deputy Zappone, has been doing much work in ensuring more child care is available.  That will help reduce the gap that the Deputy mentions.</p>  <p>  I refer the Deputy to another survey on income and living conditions, which indicates income inequality decreased last year.  That has been going absolutely in the right direction as a result of the decisions taken in recent budgets.  It is a fact that income inequality has been decreasing and one would have to go back to 2009 to see that difference.</p></speech>

Perhaps that is a statistic that should be focused on.  It makes a difference to people's lives if they have an opportunity to be in a job and supporting their family.  Most people want the opportunity to work.  Tens of thousands of people have gone back to work, so the Deputies might occasionally acknowledge that this makes a difference to the quality of people's lives and household incomes.  The evidence is that income inequality has been reducing in this country and we are becoming a more equal society, albeit with much work still to do.</p></speech>

Not if they are Tesco workers on pre-1996 contracts, most of whom are women.  Their contracts have been arbitrarily torn up by the Tesco bosses, which is breaking the law.  Will the Minister for Justice and Equality bring the Tesco bosses in here and tell them they cannot break contract law and that given that she is in charge of legislation, they are not going to rip up legislation under her nose?  Will she defend those workers who are out on the picket line daily, in lashing rain, standing steadfast in solidarity with those 250 people, mainly women, who are being discriminated against?  Again, I call on everybody who gives a damn about justice, equality and solidarity to get down to the picket lines at Tesco on Saturday at 12 noon to support the workers and insist that Tesco will not get away with breaking the law, as it is doing, on the Minister's watch.</p></speech>

By this series of actions, we will arrive at a point when there is more equality on the gender pay gap.  Many things can be done.  Reversing the cuts to the minimum wage makes a difference.  Promoting wage transparency by requiring companies with more than 50 employees to complete wage surveys and giving a strengthened role to the Low Pay Commission regarding the gender pay gap all make a difference, as well as what I said about child care.</p>  <p>  Regarding Tesco, we appeal to, advise and encourage the parties to use the offices of the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, and Labour Court.

Despite that not much investment is needed, diabetes treatment seems to be left idle.  We spend &euro;1.3 billion per year on diabetes treatment, &euro;800 million of which is spent on treating the complications of the illness.  This &euro;800 million could be significantly reduced with proper management of diabetes care.  It is not often that savings can clearly be made in health spending.  Proper care of diabetes is one of these opportunities.</p><p>In Donegal, of 666 adults with type 1 diabetes, only 20 attending Letterkenny University Hospital have access to an insulin pump.  This week, I received a letter from a constituent who, after living with diabetes since he was eight years old, was approved for a pump.  However, Sligo University Hospital is the only place adults from Donegal can have a pump fitted.  Letterkenny University Hospital does not have staff to fit pumps.  My constituent was delighted to get a quick appointment for Sligo hospital and even more when he was told his pump would be fitted before the end of January this year.  Given that he was due to start a new job in Scotland on 1 March, the timing could not have been better.  However, ten days ago he received a call from Sligo telling him the diabetes nurses hours had been cut by 15 hours per week and that they could not now fit his pump.  There are seven insulin pumps in Sligo that will not be fitted and that are gathering dust at a cost of &euro;4,700 each.  In his letter, he said:</p><blockquote>I can go to Dublin and have a pump fitted privately, but I won't, and it's not because of the money.  I should not even have to go to Sligo.  These services should be provided here in our local hospitals where they have all our history and the staff know us.  I have now lost a great career opportunity in Scotland because of this, as I need the security of the insulin and the blood glucose sensor before starting my job and this opportunity is now gone.</blockquote><p>As the T&aacute;naiste knows, there is little hope of this man getting a job in Donegal.  The Government has made many claims that health spending is at record levels.</p><p>No doubt the T&aacute;naiste will quote that back to me in response to this question.  Despite this, we see the hours of diabetes nurses in Sligo University Hospital being cut, meaning that insulin pumps that would save the health services money are not being fitted and, due to staffing shortages, the pumps cannot be fitted in Letterkenny University Hospital either.</p> <p> What will the T&aacute;naiste say to Ciaran, the writer of that letter, and to the six other patients who have not had their pumps fitted?  Why is it, when savings can clearly be made in the health service through proper management of diabetes care, the Government will not make the resources available to ensure the proper management of this disease?</p></speech>

The Minister will be able to give a detailed reply on the particular local issues in Donegal and Sligo for those cases highlighted by Deputy Pringle today.</p>  <p>  The goal is to provide high quality service to patients, such as those the Deputy has described, in their own homes or with local services and local GPs where possible, as opposed to having to travel farther to get those services.  The Government has made a commitment to ensure those services are available and this is reflected in the highest health budget that has ever been agreed, at &euro;14.6 billion.  This demonstrates the Government's commitment to ensure patients, such as those described by Deputy Pringle, will have those services available to them.</p>  <p>  There are issues around recruitment.  The Deputy highlighted the subject of the nurses in the area and every effort is being made to recruit more nurses.  The initiatives being undertaken by the Minister, such as the bed capacity review which is under way, the increased budget, the new GP contract and the recruitment campaign, are to make sure we have the kind of local health services that are needed.  We also have the all-party committee working on the ten-year plan for the health services and this is due to be received in April this year.  Additional funding of &euro;18.5 million has been given to primary care centres, including enabling the support of various paediatric cases and the type of situation specialist intervention that is needed for diabetes.  Clearly, every effort has been made to make sure services are available locally for specialist conditions such as diabetes.  The new GP contract will ensure there is an even more flexible service available to people in local areas and given by GPs.</p>  <p>  I will ask the Minister for Health to liaise directly with the Deputy on the situation in Donegal, but with regard to the overall approach to development and making sure people have the very best health services, I have outlined to the Deputy the various initiatives the Minister is taking to arrive at that situation.  There is ever-increasing demand on our health services, as the Deputy knows, but equally there has been an ever-increasing budget to meet that demand.</p></speech>

The T&aacute;naiste has outlined the record spending, and I anticipated this response to my question.  The issue, however, is not about staff in Sligo University Hospital but about the hours of the staff being cut.  It is not a recruitment issue but rather bad management, bad planning and complete neglect by the Government and the HSE in dealing with these issues.  Installing the pumps for patients will save money.  It is clearly outlined.  Some &euro;800 million per year is spent on dealing with problems from lack of treatment and lack of management.  All these problems can be prevented by proper management and treatment.  This is what is necessary for people.  The T&aacute;naiste's response about the record levels of spending will ring hollow to those who are without diabetes pumps.  They rely on the pumps, which means they do not have the security to be able to get a job when they are without the pumps.</p>  <p>  In 2017, there will be 11 children in Letterkenny University Hospital who will transition into adult services for diabetes care.  There is a waiting list of 21 months for an appointment to see a consultant.  This is unacceptable.  All the T&aacute;naiste's talk of extra funding makes no difference to those people's lives.</p></speech>

While I do not have the details, I will ask the Minister to link with the Deputy.  Clearly, the focus is on recruitment and there has been a change in regard to trying to recruit more staff on permanent contracts as opposed to agency staff.  That may account for the situation the Deputy has described concerning nurses in the local area.  I will ask the Minister to come back to the Deputy about that change in regard to the nurses because I do not have the details.</p> <p> I want to assure the Deputy that the focus is on recruiting permanent full-time nurses who will be in a position to deliver the kind of services he has outlined.  Every action is being taken.  It is an international problem in terms of trying to recruit and retain nursing staff.  The Minister has taken every action possible and has shown as much flexibility as he can in the context of ensuring that we can recruit new nurses.</p></speech>

The Department recently received a report from Professor Alan Reilly with a range of recommendations about how this issue should be addressed.  The report examined the oversight and co-ordination of the laboratory activities, the reorganisation of the structures and functions within the central laboratory complex and options for the future development of the regional laboratories with a view to improving disease investigative and surveillance capability with the overriding imperative of maintaining and enhancing services to farmers.  The Department is considering this issue.</p></speech>

One of those photographs was of Marsia Lieghio, who was tragically killed in a hit and run on Fonthill Road in our constituency in 2005 aged just 16.  Will the Government commit to bringing forward legislation to reform sentencing for offenders and will this legislation include a sentencing council that will provide guidance to judges as to the appropriate sentence for an offence such as this?

There is no such service available at present and people who need to avail of this service must wait for a minimum of nine months and must seek this treatment outside Kildare in Dublin.  This is causing many problems for people who need to access this service and for families in general.  If the T&aacute;naiste cannot answer today, she might ask the Minister to let me know when this service will be provided in Kildare.  It is currently not in place and has not been for some time.</p></speech>

The Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, is working on a new national drugs strategy that will ensure the kinds of treatment raised by the Deputy are available.  There is also increased investment to ensure people can access treatment.  I agree it is essential that people can access rehabilitation treatment quickly when they are in a position where they are willing to accept that.  I will ask the Minister to link directly with the Deputy about the specifics.</p></speech>

How is the health (transport support) Bill progressing?  I understand this Bill will provide for a scheme to make individual payments as a contribution towards transport costs to people with severe disabilities on a low income who cannot access public transport.  Does this Bill offer a means of addressing the transport needs of the St. Michael's House seven?</p></speech>

I met the senior management of St. Michael's House recently to discuss funding and the amount of funding that has gone into the social care disability service plan for 2017.  The budget for transport within St. Michael's House is taken from its own budget.  On the broader issue of the motor transport Bill, I am trying to finalise Second Stage of the Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016 in the D&aacute;il today and hopefully Members will get that done and dusted.  The Government is near completion in respect of the motor transport Bill on funding people with disabilities who have transport problems.  As I said in response earlier, I hope to have that in the next couple of weeks.  At the moment, I am trying to get the Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016 over the line.  I am also trying to move quickly in the next couple of days on the Grace cases but I guarantee there will be movement.</p></speech>

My question is on JobPath and how I and people in the community services believe that JobPath is undermining the viability of other schemes such as community employment and local employment services.  My colleague, Deputy John Brady, has called on the Minister a number of times to have an immediate review of JobPath.  Is the Minister prepared to do that?  JobPath is a private company.  It excludes people from other activation schemes, such as community employment schemes.  Community schemes are not able to deliver services.</p></speech>

It is about getting people into jobs.  We are having enormous success in that regard.  The Deputy will note from yesterday's figures that the quarterly national household survey shows that long-term unemployment in Ireland is now below 4%.  Everything we are doing, whether Intreo services or JobPath services, is now being proven to be enormously successful in getting people into employment.  The Deputy is right to say that community employment, CE, schemes and others are having difficulty filling posts.</p><p>They are having difficulty because the number of schemes and services has almost quadrupled, while the number of people unemployed has reduced by half.  I will deal with that by broadening the pool of people who can qualify for CE and T&uacute;s schemes.  I will be making an announcement on that in the coming weeks.</p></speech>

The sixth phase of the programme is to be announced this year.  It was due to be announced last year, but we are still awaiting clarification on that.  At a time of such competition for talent in the country in the wake of international events, this is a critical part of our attraction.  It seems to fall between two stools in the Departments of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, and Education and Skills.  Clarity on when the sixth phase will be announced and available to research institutions would be very welcome.</p></speech>

As we know, there are huge inequalities between people living in rural and urban areas.</p><p>I watched the debate on television last week about religious denominations in schools and how people in Dublin are having such terrible problems getting children into schools.  Where I live in Aughavas there are 60 children attending the local school.  The school over the road from it in Cloone has a similar number.  If there are no more families in our region in the next while, those schools will be under threat of losing teachers and closing.  In Kiltyclogher in north Leitrim, the rural school is under threat of closing this year. <font color="#FF22FF"></font>The issue of inequality that exists in this country is really an issue of ensuring people can live in rural Ireland.  To have people living in rural Ireland, we have to have infrastructure in rural Ireland and a development of jobs and opportunity.  Opportunity can only come if a person is on a platform where they can reach that opportunity.  It is true to say that everyone has access to education and all of these things but for many people living in rural areas across the length and breadth of Ireland, they are not in a position to reach the opportunity that may exist.  It is a huge problem for an awful lot of people in our society.  If we institute laws and different things in this Parliament, we end up doing them but in the vast majority of cases, we see that they only look after the people that live where there are large populations.  <br/><br/>The motorway network in Ireland was brought to the attention of many people in this assembly over the past number of weeks by the chambers of commerce in Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim and various areas.  If one looks at the map of the road network, it does not go near the north west at all.It is similar with the rail network - it blocks out huge areas of the country.  If we are going to invest in the regions and ensure there is opportunity for people living in the regions, we have to make sure we do it everywhere.  We have to invest in places where there are low populations at present.  If we do not do that, there will never be people living in these areas.  <br/><br/>We see the same thing in our health services.  At the moment, the health service in the north west is particularly under stress.  I raised the issue here the other day of the CAMHS service in Sligo.  We have a service in place for children and adolescents looking for mental health services but there is no child psychiatrist in place.  The child psychiatrist keeps changing because they keep leaving because nobody wants to come and stay and live in rural areas.  That is the problem we have everywhere in the country.  We have the same situation with our ambulance service.  At the moment the target is supposed to be that the ambulance is at the scene of an incident within 15 minutes.  Where I live, an ambulance would find it hard to be there within 40 minutes.  People are at serious risk of losing their lives because we do not have the infrastructure in place.  The Rural Equality Bill attempts to ensure that whatever laws we pass in this Parliament make sure that people in rural areas get equal access to everything.  It does not mean that people who live in Tallaght will be discommoded.  It means that people who live in Leitrim, Donegal, Mayo, rural parts of County Clare or anywhere else can have a fair and equal service with everyone else in every other part of the country.  Bringing in this Bill will ensure we do that and that we look at the impact of anything being done on rural Ireland.  Will we ensure that rural Ireland is a place that can prosper and where there will be a future for people because at the moment there is no sense of future for many people living in rural areas?  Many of them are young people who are forced to emigrate, if not out of the country, certainly to the larger, more populated areas.  <br/><br/>We want to make sure we service everyone in every part of the country.  That includes those who live in rural areas.  I particularly think of older people who live in rural Ireland, many of whom have absolutely no access to public transport.  They have very little access to an adequate health service.  To put that in place, we must ensure that everything we bring through Parliament has the concept of rural equality built into it.  That is what this Bill is about.  I commend it to the House. </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-02-23a.227" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1363" speakername="Kevin  Moran" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017022300017#P00900"><p>I move:</p><blockquote>That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to provide that adequate consideration be afforded to the principle of proportionality in the context of proceedings which are directed at the repossession of a mortgaged property in which the mortgagor ordinarily resides, and for that purpose to amend the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009; and to provide for related matters.</blockquote><p>This Bill is about keeping people in their homes.  Its purpose is to ensure the correct application of EU law by the Irish courts when dealing with repossession.  Central Bank of Ireland statistics from September 2016 show that of 738,506 mortgage accounts relating to principal dwellings, 79,562 accounts were in arrears, of which 56,350 were in arrears of over 90 days.  The figures also show that 43,543 principal dwelling mortgage accounts were in arrears of over one year while 34,500 had arrears over two years.  On the week before Christmas there were around 25 repossession cases in Kerry, 50 in Tipperary, 85 in Athlone and more in Waterford.  A total of 421 homes were repossessed in the third quarter of 2016 according to the figures from the Central Bank.  All this has created real fears of repossession among those in the most vulnerable situations.  This has the potential to put unprecedented strain on the housing sector.  </p><p>The programme for Government of May 2016 states that the Government wants to keep families in their home and avoid repossession in so far as possible and that it will protect the family home and introduce additional long-term solutions for mortgage arrears cases.  The Bill provides a viable solution which is completely consistent with the Government's stated objectives and the desire of the Independent Alliance to address these crises.  There is no current legislation specifically aimed at providing a framework of evidence to be considered by the courts.  In a great many cases, there is no detailed consideration of the debtor or his or her individual circumstances required by EU law.  This has led to a situation whereby there is no existing means in the courts to examine on its merits the essential fairness or unfairness of the repossession order.  This Bill addresses the gap in the law.  While Irish courts give the court registrar a wide discretion, EU law already obliges domestic courts in the EU, including Irish courts, to examine customer contracts, including mortgage contracts before them, of their own motion, for unfair contract terms, although this does not take place in all cases.  While the Irish courts have a discretion in granting, adjourning, varying, postponing, suspending or executing possession orders, EU law already requires consideration of additional matters.  Once EU law becomes applicable in mortgage cases, under the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights the Irish courts can consider the proportionality of granting, adjourning, varying, postponing, suspending or executing possession orders.  This proportionality test is based on proposed legislation.  Essentially it means if there is a choice between several appropriate measures to achieve such an objective, rightly pursued by legislation, the courts must adopt the least onerous one and the disadvantage caused must not be unreasonable to the end pursuit.  </p><p>Everyone in the House knows from people calling to their constituency office and attending their clinics that there are families, mothers, fathers, and children suffering in the nightmare scenario of losing their home.  The phone calls, the letters and the court appearances are never ending for them.  Many are still working, although not earning as much as they once did, and still are trying to play some part of the mortgage each month.  However, they are still hopelessly falling into arrears.  There appears to be no end to the stress and grief that has engulfed these families.  In many cases there has been gross interference with the right to a quiet and dignified family private life but very little is being said on their behalf because they are embarrassed into silence.  They remain afraid and alone as they dread the prospect of a new letter falling through the letter box each morning, not to mention the trauma and the repetition of the court appearances that take place in unfamiliar surroundings.  In many cases, families are afraid to seek help.  Very often they attend court without legal representation.  They expect a legal system that vindicates their rights.  Sadly in many instances this is not happening.  It is incredible that nine years after the crash we are still talking about mortgage arrears in this House.  The problem remains real and we have been elected by the people to solve the problem.  We must act now.  The mortgage arrears crisis can and must be resolved.  In more recent Irish court judgments, the courts are increasingly turning their attention to the issues I have just raised.  The legacy of the housing price crash remains to bear witness to the silent suffering citizens.  It is suffering that must be brought to an end and we must show the political will to do so.</p><p>I would like to put on the record the names of the people who have helped me with this Bill in addition to my colleagues here.  They are Padraic Kenna, Julie Sadlier, Eugene Deering and Sarah Clarke.</p></speech>

A number of measures in the Bill are to be welcomed.  I went through them so I will not repeat them.  However, in many other respects, if I may put this as baldly as it deserves to be put, the Bill is an insult to people affected by disability.</p>  <p>  People have waited unnecessarily for ten years because of the unwillingness of successive Governments, most recently those led by Fine Gael, to ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities when there was no legal impediment to doing so.  A red herring argument was put forward about the need to get the legislative ducks in a row to effect legislative equality across a range of areas as a prerequisite to ratification.  I put it to the Minister of State that this is and remains a complete red herring, a con job and a ruse to avoid ratification, which was promised but which we are still not getting.  We were supposed to get it by Christmas.  This is a deliberate delaying tactic by Fine Gael.  Tragically, the Minister of State, who has a record on this, is being used as the mudguard to continue these delaying tactics.  In this respect, the Bill is an attempt at a cosmetic glossing over of the continued refusal of the Government to ratify and its delay in doing so.  Fine Gael, probably as well as Fianna F&aacute;il before it, has been worried about what it sees as the cost and political implications that would flow from ratification.  Ratification would result in the relevant UN monitoring body standing over the Government, issuing reports year after year showing how successive Governments have failed and continue to fail people with disabilities, fail to vindicate their rights and fail to establish full legal and social equality for them.  There is absolutely no doubt in my mind but that this is the case.  When one considers what has happened to people with disabilities under the impact of austerity, many of the measures taken, far from improving the rights of people with disabilities, substantially worsened their situation.</p><p>The Government was well aware that it would have had serious problems implementing those austerity cuts if it had ratified the UN Convention because it would been called out on them and would have been many times over in serious breach of its commitments under the convention.  One can see the list of attacks affecting people with disabilities in recent years: cuts to the motorised transport grants, to the mobility allowance, to medical card entitlements and to millions of hours in home help.  Thankfully the attempt to cut personal assistance services failed but only because of the direct action protest by people with disabilities outside this House which forced the Government to row back on that.  There have been other cuts across a range of services that have affected people with disabilities disproportionately, most obviously the cuts in housing and the lack of adapted social housing, as well as multiple cuts to the health service, public transport and social protection such as the exceptional needs payment, the fuel allowance and the Christmas bonus.  In education there have been caps on special needs assistants, SNAs, and resource hours.  There are cuts in the domiciliary care allowance and so on.  This carries on now.</p> <p> The mooted plans to take the staff out of DART stations affect people with disabilities.  This affects the Minister of State's constituency.  He should get on it.  We will have a protest in a couple of weeks' time and we hope there will be protests up and down the DART line about this.  It has very particular pertinence to disability rights and the question of access to public transport, the right to independent living and so on.  Access to the DART is already inadequate.  We had meetings in our area with the representatives of the DART on how to improve accessibility.  The representative gave us commitments and promises to improve the situation.  At the moment one has to give 24 hours' notice which severely limits people's freedom to travel especially if there are any hitches or delays.  Critically, the ability of the DART service to respond to and improve that situation depends on having staff in the stations.  Does the Minister of State know there is a plan to remove staff from DART stations?  How the hell will they improve or even maintain access for people in wheelchairs if they remove staff?  Sandycove-Glasthule and Grand Canal Dock are the first on the hit list.  How will people phone the DART stations?</p> <p> One of our suggestions to the DART representative was to have a direct line to the DART station or a text mechanism whereby the person could quickly, and at short notice, notify the DART stations that people with wheelchairs want to use them.  That is not going to work if there are no staff in the DART stations, not to mind all the other health and safety issues or accidents.  It will be bad for a range of people in terms of DART services but it will further degrade and deteriorate the access of people in wheelchairs and with other disabilities to DART stations.  The Minister of State should start ringing the alarm bells that this will not be acceptable. There will be protests.  I urge anybody who is on a DART line to start mobilising their community to ensure staff are not taken out of the DART stations as planned.</p> <p> Several public service routes have been degraded in our area and all over the country.  That will disproportionately hit the rights, freedoms, liberties and so on of people with disabilities.  If we ratified the UN convention, we would be called out on such issues.  Questions would be asked about that and a range of other things.  That is why Fine Gael has not ratified it and does not want to ratify it.  It is delaying it.  I have been informed by a lady who is in the Public Gallery that the Government wants derogations on several areas in order that when it does ratify, it can slip out of some of its commitments because it does not want to do what is necessary in terms of resources and legislation to copperfasten the rights in the convention.</p> <p> I smell a rat.  The proof of this is to arrive with a half-written Bill.  It is quite extraordinary.  Some of the key areas that have been drawn to my attention include deprivation of liberty, the use of restraint in schools, involuntary sectioning and so on.  We need a great deal of input on these and other issues from people with disabilities and those who advocate on their behalf.  The point of the legislative process, when done properly in several stages, is precisely to have real buy-in from those affected.  If that is true in general, it is all the more true when it comes to disability, and the convention specifies that people with the lived experience of disability must have a key role in the monitoring and preparation of the legislation.  We are doing this the wrong way around, for cynical reasons.  Where is the real consultation on the range of legislative areas that affect people with disabilities?  It is all crammed into a little Committee Stage for last minute half-baked legislation that will be rammed through, instead of time being taken over that legislation with real buy-in, involvement, consultation and it being driven by people with disabilities.  It should be done properly and the ratification should be happening now which would put pressure on the Government to get the legislation right and to be called out on it when it fails to vindicate the rights of people with disabilities and to establish the equality they deserve.</p> <p> I am hearing frustration, anger, fury and justified cynicism about what is going on here.  At best this is cosmetic at worst, a con trick being played on people to make it look as if we are doing something, because the truth is the Government was put under pressure before Christmas, and has been for many years, by disability advocacy groups demanding this ratification.  There has been an indefensible ten year delay, yet still there are delaying tactics and this half-baked Bill.  If the Minister of State were on the other side of the House, he would be saying what I am saying now.  He knows what is going on.  It has to be called.  We need the ratification, not more excuses.  The Government should just do it.  Then let us prepare the legislation properly with the involvement and buy-in of, and indeed driven by, people with the lived experience of disability.  Amendments will flow on Committee Stage but this is being done in the wrong way.  We need ratification.  The chorus of voices demanding that will increase when the inadequacy or cynicism of the way this legislation is being dealt with becomes more apparent over the coming weeks.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-02-23a.243" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="14:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017022300021#T00100"><p>The debate on this Bill is extremely important.  The digest that has been produced to accompany this legislation confirms that approximately 600,000 people in this country, or 13% of the population, have a disability.  The exact figure depends on the definition of &quot;disability&quot; that is used.  The figure is much higher if a broader definition is used.  The digest continues:</p><blockquote>Of people aged 15 and over with a disability, 21% were at work.  This compares to 50% for the overall population aged 15 and over.</blockquote><p>Those figures are damning.  The system is set up to disable people who have a disability all the more.  When we passed the universal declaration in Galway a long time ago - I think it was in 2002, which is 15 years ago - we tried to change the language to facilitate universal design.  The mantra at the time - it was more than a mantra - was &quot;good design enables and bad design disables&quot;.  The exact same point can be made in the context of the Government's failure to introduce legislation to empower people, which is what the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities sets out to achieve.  I do not need to preach to the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, because he is fully aware that the UN convention represents a paradigm shift from the medical model to a rights-based approach under the social model.  This involves a move away from regarding people with disabilities as people who require assistance due to their impairments to regarding them as holders of rights who are entitled to social integration under the social model.</p><p>The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission has welcomed the general approach to promotion, protection and monitoring that is signalled in the Bill before the House.  It is a reflection on us and an indictment of the political system that in 2017, well into the 21st century, we are still arguing about what should and should not be contained in legislation of this nature.  Ireland started off on a very good footing in this respect ten years ago when it was one of the first countries to sign the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  I want to pay tribute to the various civil groups, including the Centre for Disability Law and Policy in Galway and the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, that were instrumental in shaping the language of the convention.  Our record since then has been appalling, however.  While I accept the bona fides of the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, and acknowledge his experience in this area, I agree substantially with what my colleague, Deputy Boyd Barrett, has said about this Bill.</p><p>There is absolutely no legal impediment preventing the Government from signing the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities on behalf of Ireland.  I suggest it has been decided as a matter of policy not to sign it.  When we sign it, a greater level of responsibility will be placed on our shoulders to do things we have not done, such as the rolling out of facilities and the championing of the word &quot;equality&quot;.  I am inclined to agree with Deputy Boyd Barrett that we should ratify the convention now.  We signed it ten years ago.  There is absolutely nothing to stop us ratifying it, other than that it would leave us open to exposure before UN committees for our failure to bring in the appropriate legislation.  I am not referring solely to this legislation.  For example, the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 has yet to be fully enforced.  To a certain extent, we are playing a game here.  There is a certain amount of cur i gc&eacute;ill and hypocrisy i gceist here because we do not wish to be exposed.  I suggest that our exposure as a country would be a small price to pay for the much more important forcing of the situation that would come from ratifying the convention.</p><p>Some aspects of this Bill are welcome.  Clearly, it is welcome that deafness will not be a barrier to serving on a jury.  I welcome the removal of archaic language, particularly in respect of people of unsound mind.  I am pleased that the quota that applies to the Garda is being extended to the civilian side.  While there are some positive provisions in the Bill, I have serious concerns about how it is progressing.  My concerns are one thing, but the concerns of the Centre for Disability Law and Policy in Galway, which has substantial experience in this area, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, Inclusion Ireland and various other civil groups are much more important.  My voice and the other voices in here are simply speaking on behalf of organisations that have accepted the bona fides of each Government with which they have worked, only to find themselves now looking at a Bill from which significant segments have been omitted.  I refer, for example, to the need to introduce legislation pertaining to the deprivation of liberty.  I am aware from my previous life in the law area of the shocking gap that exists.  We have protections for people with mental illnesses going into psychiatric hospitals, protections for prisoners and - theoretically - protections for children being taken into care.  However, we have absolutely no protections for people with disabilities or older people with Alzheimer's disease going into nursing homes or other institutions.  There is a complete gap in our law in such areas.  We have compounded that by leaving it out of this Bill.  I understand it will be introduced on Committee Stage, along with other sections.</p></speech>

I remind the House that Article 33 of the UN convention enshrines the right of people with disabilities to participate in the decision-making process entirely separately from the organisations that represent them.  Sections of great importance have been omitted from the Bill and will not be discussed until Committee Stage, with all that entails in terms of restricting people's rights.  It is worth noting in this context that the word "equality" has been left out of the name of this Bill.  I have no idea how the Minister of State could stand over the omission of the word "equality" from a Bill of this nature.  Similarly, we do not know what reservations or derogations the Government intends to seek.  That is extremely important, but it has been completely left out.</p>  <p>  The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission is being partly given an independent monitoring role.  It is being given a general monitoring role, but not a specific role in monitoring the implementation of this legislation.  I wonder if we have learned anything from the debacle that followed the publication of the wonderful A Vision for Change document in 2006.  We are still awaiting the promised review of A Vision for Change, which ran out in January 2016.  It was a very positive document that set out just about every possible action that should be taken.  The people who came forward to work with the Government of the day were very sceptical because it is easy to produce a good document.  An essential part of A Vision for Change was the independent monitoring mechanism that sat for two periods of three years.  Those involved did a very good job.  Unfortunately, they had to highlight that the progress being made was slow, tardy and insufficient.  Rather than praising and cherishing the independent monitoring body and giving it more resources, we abolished it.  We learned nothing.  Over a year has passed since A Vision for Change ran out and we are still waiting on the independent review.  If we are serious about monitoring this legislation after it has been passed, it is absolutely vital for us to give the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission the fullest possible role in the independent monitoring mechanism that is being provided for in this Bill.  Concern has been expressed about the decision to make the Department of Justice and Equality the focal point in this context.  Clearly, responsibility in this area should not lie in that Department.  I am open to suggestions on where it should lie.  It has been proposed that it should lie at the heart of the Government in the Department of the Taoiseach.  A similar approach has been taken in the case of the Irish language, although I will not comment on how helpful or efficient that has been.  It was theoretically a very good idea.  We should be going in a similar direction in this case.</p>  <p>  I have mentioned the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015, which was introduced with great fanfare.</p><p>It remains substantially unimplemented, so will the Minister of State comment on it?</p> <p> Very specific questions have been asked by civil society but I will not read all of them into the record.  Practically every Deputy has read them, which is testimony to the work on the ground of the various groups that are so concerned about this.  They have not gone on a party political basis but have done their best to educate each and every Deputy in the Chamber.  The Deputies have the questions that have not been answered.  I was watching the Minister of State's reaction intently when the questions were put about what structured communication had taken place, as civil society feels there has not been a structured approach.  The Minister of State shook his head vehemently and I presume he is arguing there has been such a structured approach.  I accept his bona fides but if the organisations on the ground tell each of us that it has not happened, there is a problem somewhere with the understanding of what "communication" means.</p> <p> There are other questions that we were specifically asked to read out.  I will not read all of them but I will refer to them.  The first, as I noted, related to a formal structured consultation process, which the groups argue has not taken place.  The groups have asked specifically about what reservations or derogations will be sought and the absence of specific legislation relating to the deprivation of liberty.  I have mentioned some of these issues and the groups put them in a question format.  All of those questions should be answered in written form immediately and before this Bill progresses.  These are just practical questions and we must acknowledge work on the ground from people who are challenged every day not just by a disability but by the utter failure of all of us to provide a society that allows them to participate.  We are all responsible for that, although the Government should have the majority of this responsibility.  Similarly, with the recent McCabe issue, specific practical questions were asked that were not answered.  It helps people to come on board if they see questions being answered when they are asked.  I ask that this be done immediately.  It must be important to the groups if they have asked every Deputy to read these questions in the D&aacute;il.</p> <p> I hope the Minister of State will have listened to all of us and taken on board the serious concerns we have all expressed.  Nobody has played politics with this.  I hope the Government will consider ratifying the convention immediately if we are truly sincere about what we want.  There is no legal obstacle to ratifying it so let us do it.  We can then have a true roadmap for the implementation of the necessary legislation that will allow us to go proudly before a United Nations committee and say that not only have we signed and ratified it but we have done our bit with legislation.</p></speech>

To be frank, when Fine Gael came to office, the economy was imploding to such an extent that this issue was not progressed as speedily as was warranted.  It should also be stated that whereas other countries have ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, we in Ireland are always conscious of having our domestic house in order before we do such things.  There would be little point in ratifying the convention and introducing legislation to rectify errors or gaps afterwards.</p>  <p>  At this point I offer words of appreciation to a Galway native and world expert in disability law, Professor Gerard Quinn of the National University of Ireland, Galway.  He was instrumental in the drafting of the disability convention, both as part of an international group of disability non-governmental organisations and as part of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.  Anybody familiar with the history of the convention will know what an enormous contribution he made.  With regard to the legislation, there are a number of areas that the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission would like amended or have greater emphasis put upon.  The same applies to various disabilities representative groups.  I know the Minister of State will take due cognisance of these as the Bill goes through the House, as there are other issues not included in the published Bill that will be taken as amendments.</p>  <p>  I will clarify one issue.  There has been a discussion about Ireland having obligations under European Union, EU, law because the Union has for the first time signed up to the international human rights treaty.  That is only partially true.  The EU has oversight in terms of existing competencies and this treaty does not create any more.  I very much welcome this legislation and look forward to its speedy passage through the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-02-23a.248" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1332" speakername="Declan Breathnach" time="14:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017022300022#U00300"><p>Since entering the D&aacute;il 12 months ago this weekend, I have mooted that this D&aacute;il should be a champion for those with disabilities.  We should speak of varying abilities rather than disability.  During my 35 years working as a primary school teacher I viewed children with a disability as young people of varying abilities and always focused on their abilities rather than their disabilities.</p>  <p>  As has been said, this is half a Bill and it is being rushed through without being fully drafted to be ready for enactment to honour the ratification of the United Nations convention.  We in Ireland signed the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 2007, and Fianna F&aacute;il broadly supports the provisions of this Bill to address the remaining legislative barriers to Ireland&rsquo;s ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  There is an urgency here as the convention followed decades of work by the United Nations to change attitudes and approaches to persons with varying degrees of abilities.  We must move away from viewing persons with disability as "objects" of charity, medical treatment and social protection towards viewing persons with varying degrees of disabilities as "subjects" with rights, who can claim those rights and make their own decisions for their lives, where possible, as well as being active members of our communities.  The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission has been very strong on this point.</p>  <p>  That the Bill is incomplete, with at least another six sections planned for introduction on Committee Stage, significantly limits the potential for a detailed analysis and debate on those sections, upon which meaningful commentary may be provided by relevant stakeholders, including the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.  Fianna F&aacute;il is committed to the removal of barriers that prevent people with disabilities from fully participating in society and exercising their rights and entitlements as citizens.  In this regard, why is it taking the Government so long to replace the motorised transport grant that was discontinued in February 2013?  At that time people were told an alternative scheme was being devised to replace it and we are now nearly four years on from then.  It has been raised in this House on numerous occasions over the past 12 months by many Deputies.</p>  <p>  The primary medical certificate scheme relates to a certificate issued by the Health Service Executive, HSE, which certifies that a person is a severely disabled and permanently disabled person for the purposes of Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994.  Some of the benefits of this certificate are that one may qualify for a refund of vehicle registration tax, value added tax, VAT, and excise duty if one buys a new or second-hand car.  A person may also qualify for exemption of road tax and a refund of VAT on motor fuel up to certain limits.  However, the criteria used to determine entitlement to this certificate are severely restrictive and should be re-examined.  At least three Deputies raised the issue last week under questions about promised legislation, mentioning its application to blind people and those with various difficulties not covered by the scheme.  With regard to disabled persons' grants, such as the housing adaptation grant, a formal national policy must be designed to standardise the administration of the grants throughout the country and their interpretation by local authorities.</p>  <p>  Section 4 deals with the duty put on employers and some service providers to accommodate reasonably the needs of people with disabilities.  Inclusion Ireland has indicated it is deeply regrettable that Ireland will enter a reservation with regard to reasonable accommodation and different levels of reasonable accommodation, such as "nominal costs" for private services and "disproportionate burden" for public services in employment law, will operate in tandem.</p><p>I welcome section 5, which deals with civilian staff in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, bringing this sector back within Part 5 of the Disability Act, providing a 3% quota of employment for people with disabilities.  Regarding other workplace schemes for people with disabilities, I want easier access to the EmployAbility scheme and more assistance for people to retain and keep jobs in the long term.  Too many of these schemes are short-term work placements and do not serve the needs of many people with disabilities who want to reside and work in their communities.<br/><br/>As Deputy Catherine Connolly said, the 2011 census found that 13% of the population had a disability, and only 21% of those people aged 15 and over were working.  I want to see a much higher percentage of places on work schemes ring-fenced for people with disabilities within their communities where they feel they are making a contribution.  A similar figure of 3% or more would allow people who normally would not be able to get permanent work to feel they are making a valuable contribution.  They should be allowed permanency on those work schemes where work is not available.<br/><br/>I am dismayed that some extremely important aspects of this Bill are being delayed and will be introduced only on Committee stage.  These include deprivation of liberty issues, fitness for trial and tax matters on behalf of incapacitated persons.  The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, has said, &ldquo;In the absence of published draft legislation, it is difficult for the Commission to discharge its function to examine legislative proposals under Article 10(2)(<i>e</i>) of the 2014 Act and to make concrete recommendations which can be of utility to the Legislature, particularly in relation to this aspect of reform.&rdquo;  This concern is also shared by Inclusion Ireland, which is concerned about legislative clarity on the issue of deprivation of liberty.  The Centre for Disability Law and Policy also has grave concerns about important aspects of the Bill being introduced only on Committee State.  In light of these concerns, Fianna F&aacute;il proposes that it may be worthwhile for the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Equality to hear in public from interested parties when the amendments are published and before Committee Stage.  I respectfully ask that this proposal be considered.<br/><br/>Ireland is in the process, albeit very slowly, of moving from institutionalisation and congregated settings to community living.  Adequate supports and services are required if people with disabilities are to live independently, become a part of the community and have a value within the community.  I want to see the removal of barriers that prevent people with disabilities from fully participating in society and exercising their rights and entitlements as citizens.<br/><br/>I commend the Minister of State's visit to Drogheda, where he viewed the WALK PEER programme and the work being achieved under the programme by students in St. Brigid's school in Ard Easmuinn and St. Ita's special school in Drogheda.  The House has constantly called on the Minister of State to enhance and mainstream the programme.  Anybody who was there to witness the 100 students, their manner and approach to the programme and the values they achieved from it would know it is a no-brainer to ensure the programme is enhanced.  I refer to the issue of a particular situation at St. John of God's in Drumcar, where more than 100 people with long-term intellectual disabilities are in danger of losing access to the property due to HIQA's evaluation of it.  This shows the lack of investment for people who may not be able to participate fully in society.  We must address the financial issues associated with it.<br/><br/>Many years ago, under the old health board system, it was proposed that an advocate for people with disabilities would be promoted for those who do not necessarily have a voice for themselves through their family or otherwise.  People in State employment or otherwise would offer themselves to match with people with disabilities to ensure they get correct access and advocacy.  It is worth considering this, even in terms of those who step up to the mark getting something in return for putting the voluntary effort into assisting people.<br/><br/>Deputy Catherine Connolly referred to the Barcelona declaration on accessibility and design.  The Minister of State's Department must work particularly hard with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and the local authorities to address car parking and footpaths in poor repair.  In Dundalk, a number of organisations have asked local authority members, Deputies and others to see what it is like to have a disability and see the impact of poor infrastructure.  I compliment the voluntary bodies and State organisations too numerous to mention which daily help enhance our disability services.<br/><br/>Many years ago, my local authority was the first to introduce the concept of an age-friendly county.  This has been extended across a number of counties.  A concept can be difficult to realise and financial constraints do not necessarily allow everything to be achieved.  However, if the D&aacute;il were to take on disability and the issues surrounding it, and if it were the focus of every Deputy who is constantly being bombarded at clinics and over the phone by people looking for services, we would be a much better society for it.  Integration benefits not only people with disabilities but those who have a greater ability.  The effect in terms of understanding disability is probably twice as valuable as the integration that happens regarding education provision.<br/><br/>Fianna F&aacute;il will support the legislation.  We would like a lot more to be done.  Personally, I believe actions speak louder than words and where there is a will, there is a way.  I would like the House to deliver on disability during this Government and beyond.  This is my first opportunity to wish the Minister of State well in that regard.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the role the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, played for many years fighting for people in the disability sector.  Long before I became a Member of the House I was aware of his fight for people with disabilities.  As Minister of State, he has a serious responsibility.  He is linking up with many groups up and down the country.  Like my colleagues, I welcome the Bill.  While there are shortcomings in it, we are on the right road and we must move as quickly as possible.</p>  <p>  As has been pointed out, Ireland signed the CRPD in 2007.  Since then, successive Governments have emphasised Ireland's commitment to proceed to ratification as quickly as possible, taking into account the need to ensure all necessary legislative requirements under the convention are met.</p><p>The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and its optional protocol were adopted on 13 December 2006 at the Headquarters of the United Nations in New York and were opened for signature on 13 March 2007.  I disagree slightly with my good friend Deputy Boyd Barrett, in that Fianna F&aacute;il does not have a difficulty with this and never tried to hold up the signing of the convention.  It is extremely important and we must put it into its proper position as soon as possible.<br/><br/>There were 82 signatories to the convention, 44 signatories to the optional protocol and one ratification of the convention.  This was the highest number of signatories in history to a UN convention.  It is the first comprehensive human rights treaty of the 21st century and is the first human rights convention to be open for signature by regional integration organisations.  The convention entered into force on 3 May 2008.<br/><br/>Some points have already been made, but I will make a few general points that I consider to be important.  It is good that the Bill is before the House but I believe it is incomplete in some areas.  The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission is worried that a significant number of provisions in the Bill are due to be introduced on Committee Stage as amendments, which significantly limits the scope for a detailed analysis upon which meaningful commentary can be provided by the commission.  The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission has stated this problem is especially acute in respect of the deprivation of liberty aspect of the Bill.  It went on to note:</p><blockquote>The human rights and equality implications of how deprivation of liberty is regulated are highly dependent upon the processes and safeguards which will accompany the provision.  In order to carry out a meaningful analysis of the adequacy of safeguards from a human rights and equality perspective, it is necessary to consider the particulars of the proposal; including for example, the scope of the reform [which is critical], how detention will be reviewed, the particulars of an appeal mechanism together with the remedies proposed to allow a person to obtain appropriate redress and reparation.  In the absence of published draft legislation, it is difficult for the Commission to discharge its function to examine legislative proposals under Article 10(2)(e) of the 2014 Act and to make concrete recommendations which can be of utility to the legislature, particularly in relation to this aspect of reform.</blockquote><p>This concern is also shared by Inclusion Ireland, which states:</p><blockquote>Legislative clarity is required on the issue of deprivation of liberty.  Persons can only be detained in accordance with law e.g. prisoners, involuntary mental patients but in Ireland, persons may be de facto detained not in accordance with law.</blockquote><p>These are some of the concerns and others already have been mentioned.  I hope the Minister of State will be able to address those matters in the Bill.  Fianna F&aacute;il's spokesperson on disability, Deputy Margaret Murphy O'Mahony, also will bring forward amendments on aspects of the Bill.<br/><br/>I will now turn to Fianna F&aacute;il's involvement in standing up for people with disability.  We all must acknowledge that more could have been done by everybody but our party has always been committed to creating a more inclusive society and to dismantling barriers across a range of sectors that prevent people with disability from fully participating in society.  We all must accept that those barriers have been there for many years.  We are now in the process - and getting on well with it - of breaking down those barriers.  We need to ensure that people with disabilities are given equality of opportunity so they can participate in society to the best of their wonderful abilities.  Fianna F&aacute;il has always been committed to fighting discrimination in all forms.  When in government, Fianna F&aacute;il brought forward policies and legislation to advance the rights of people with disabilities.  Our vision and proactive approach in government has made a positive impact on the lives of people with disabilities.  I will not go into some of the procedures and laws we brought forward but they are there to be seen.  They were not enough but they certainly were of help and brought forward this debate over many years, especially when Fianna F&aacute;il was in government.<br/><br/>On a more general point, I have a serious issue with members of the public taking up parking spaces that are allocated for people who have a disability.  The facility is abused all over the State.  In some towns the law may not be able to deal with it but I would hope that somewhere in the Bill we would look again at parking spaces that are for people with a disability and that the spaces are not abused by other members of the public.  It is horrendous.  I witnessed such a scene in my town recently where a person with a disability came around to use such a space and it had been taken up by a car, which was driven by a person without a disability.  What was worse, the person who had a severe disability had to park almost 400 yd. away, down off a main street, and had to come back a distance in order to conduct her business in the town.  I saw this scenario in action and it is deplorable.  I condemn those members of the public who willy-nilly drive into these spaces that by law, are there for people who have a disability.  I appeal to those of us who do not have a disability to never, ever take up those spaces.<br/><br/>There is an issue with waste refuse services when people have disabilities, both for older people and families who have children with autism.  If incontinence is an issue there are disposable nappies and the refuse charges are enormous in this regard.  Obviously, people must look after their sick family members.  The Minister of State should consider a scheme that could help those people.  It is an enormous financial cost on many families and I hear about it a lot in my clinic.  I would love if we could do something about this.  I do not know if anything could be done in the Bill, but perhaps the Minister of State could discuss it with his Cabinet colleagues and consider a scheme that might, in some way, aid people who are under severe financial strain because of these costs.  Maybe action could be taken, in conjunction with local authorities, to help these people.<br/><br/>I will conclude by paying the highest compliment possible to those parents, brothers, sisters, sons and daughters of people who have a disability.  In general, Irish families are outstanding in looking after people with disability.  We also must acknowledge the generosity of members of the wider public, who constantly annually fundraise for so many causes that support people with disability.  Without their effort we would not have many of the services that are in place.  While acknowledging the State's role, grant assistance etc., where would we be without those volunteers? Many of those who are involved in the voluntary sector do not have a family member with a disability.  This is a tremendous testament to the people who do such work in a voluntary capacity, as well as to the many businesses nationwide who give so much to local community groups who try to help with facilities for people with disability.  I think of all the groups in my native town of Strokestown, in Castlerea and in the Roscommon area with the Hub group, the Brothers of Charity services among others, as well as St. Christopher's Services in Longford, of which I am sure the Minister of State is aware.  There is huge voluntary effort going in to all of these groups to make life better for those who have a disability.  I salute those people here today and congratulate them.  I urge more people to come on board to assist in whatever way they can in making life better for members of society who have a disability and to help their families.

This is a matter on which we have overall agreement.  There was a strong focus on the rights of the person with a disability.  I recognise the valuable and constructive ideas put forward by Deputies Murphy O'Mahony, Breathnach, Eugene Murphy and Boyd Barrett.  I also welcome Senator John Dolan, who is involved with the Disability Federation of Ireland.</p>  <p>  Let me first clear the decks on a number of issues.  I will respond in more detail in respect of them on Committee Stage.  First, on the lack of consultation, since I took over as Minister of State I have met over 4,500 people, including disabled individuals, voluntary groups, professional groups and service providers.  I have an open door and, if there is anybody I did not meet, my door is still open.  Let us get that clear.  There is no question of me not being involved in consultation.  I see myself as a Minister of State who listens.  When I get constructive ideas, as I did in the past few days, it is important that I listen to them.  We will return to each of these issues on Committee Stage, when I will be able to put detailed, point-by-point responses on the record.</p>  <p>  I want to deal with a number of the key matters that have been raised.  I would have preferred to include all the necessary provisions in the Bill, as published, but I want to get things moving.  It was always the intention, even when the general scheme was approved by the previous Government, that the deprivation of liberty provisions would be advanced by means of Committee Stage amendments.  This was, and is, a simple acknowledgement of the complexity and importance of the issue.  However, these heads will be published as soon as they are finalised and before the Office of the Attorney General settles the final detail of the text.  The heads will be presented to the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality, which, as Deputy Murphy O'Mahony suggested, will be free to conduct hearings on this specific part of the Bill, if it so wishes.  Let us have hearings if Members want them.  There will be time for analysis and commentary, as requested by Deputy Murphy O'Mahony, on this aspect by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission or disability interests in advance of Committee Stage.  Those are some of the issues I am taking on board before we get into the nitty-gritty.</p>  <p>  In regard to the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission&rsquo;s role, the view in the Department and in the Attorney General&rsquo;s office is that we already have the independent mechanism that is required for this convention, namely, the commission itself.  The commission is fully compliant with the Paris Principles and it is simply a question of giving it a specific disability function.  That function should be a wide one and it need not mention the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities specifically.  The form of words used in the Bill is broad enough to cover this and any other future international instrument that may be relevant.</p>  <p>  During the debate, several Deputies asked about the involvement of persons with disabilities in monitoring the conventions.  Sections 3 and 6 of the Bill set out the monitoring process as envisaged by the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, supported by the National Disability Authority, will carry out this role.  If Deputies look closely, they will see that the Bill provides for the establishment of an advisory committee and that at least half of the members should have, or have had, a disability.  The facilitation of the participation of all members of the committee will be ensured by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.  A number of Deputies mentioned the constitutional difficulty in regard to reasonable accommodation.  The details are set out in the roadmap published in October 2015.  We have gone as far as we can, while keeping within the interpretation of the Constitution delivered by the Supreme Court.</p>  <p>  If the proposed anti-discrimination directive published in 2008 by the European Commission is adopted, we will be bound by that and can apply, across the board, the "not exceeding a disproportionate burden" standard contained in the UN convention.  In the meantime, the House cannot recommend provisions for the Bill that are unconstitutional.  The Supreme Court decision hinged on the protection of private property rights catered for in the Constitution.  The Deputies opposite and I might wish for a different interpretation but, in our system, the Constitution is interpreted by the Supreme Court and the other branches of Government - the Executive arm and the Oireachtas - must accept that.  For those who quoted from the analysis in the submission of the Disability Law Centre in Galway, they might ask the centre how exactly it is that a Supreme Court decision on private property rights is overturned by High Court decisions on entirely different issues.</p>  <p>  A number of Deputies mentioned our proposed declarations in respect of Article 12 and Article 14.  I want to make it clear that we fully accept and will conform to both of these articles.  The problem arises due to the misinterpretation of said articles, in an extremist way, by the UN committee, which we and other countries, such as Australia, Norway and Canada, cannot accept as a valid interpretation of the convention.  I look forward to setting out a detailed explanation in respect of this point on Committee Stage.  Essentially, the committee is of the view that persons with mental illness or intellectual disability who commit criminal acts should be treated as criminals.  Our law does not allow a person to be found guilty of a crime if that person does not have the capacity to understand that the act was wrong.  Instead, the person can be found not guilty by reason of insanity and, if appropriate and necessary, detained for treatment.  This approach is much more humane and in accordance with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities than the quite strange misinterpretation put forward by the UN committee.</p>  <p>  I want to mention juries, an issue raised by Deputies Pringle and Murphy O'Mahony.  We are proposing to remove inappropriate restrictions on eligibility to serve on a jury.  I am willing to look at issues in regard to reasonable accommodation again.  However, let me be clear that there are competing constitutional rights here.  The right to a fair trial takes precedence over the right of any person, with a disability or not, to be eligible to serve on a jury.  That is the way it has to be and that is what we need to keep in mind.</p>  <p>  Deputies Brady, Martin Kenny, O'Brien and others made the point that other countries ratify without changing their legislation and asked why we cannot do the same.  They raise a very important issue on which people have different views, and even within Government there are different opinions.  I am not in the business of making meaningless gestures.  I want this to be fully compliant with the UN convention and the Government is fully behind me on that, as is the Opposition, which is fantastic and a very important help to me.</p>  <p>  Another issue raised is that the word "equality" needs to be included in the Title.  I accept that point very strongly and I will ask the Attorney General to ensure we that fix this on Committee Stage.  I can confirm that we will remove references to unsound mind where these remain in Acts that are still in operation.  The Companies Act is being addressed separately by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and will be amended.  These are important issues.</p>  <p>  I want to raise some final points on consultation.  I emphasise that if I left out somebody, my door is open and I am ready to talk.  We have had genuine consultation with disability interests on the development of the new national disability inclusion strategy and this ratification process.  The Department of Justice and Equality held two rounds of public meetings in Dublin, Cork, and Tullamore, at which issues in regard to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the wider disability strategy were discussed.  The Disability Stakeholders Group and the national steering committee for the strategy, which I chair, also provided opportunities for input by disability interests.  Therefore, we have had consultation but, if anyone has been excluded, we will definitely listen to them.  As noted earlier, the justice committee has the authority to bring them in on Committee Stage.</p><p>I am looking at putting the word "equality" back into that legislation.  Deputy Jonathan O'Brien was one of the first people to mention it during the debate.  I am a listening Minister and I look forward to constructive ideas.</p> <p> I conclude by thanking all the Deputies for their contributions.  I hope to return on Committee Stage soon.  There is a lot of work to be done, particularly in respect of the deprivation of liberty.  There will be no delay as far I am concerned.  I was annoyed by the way events last week in the D&aacute;il meant that Second Stage of this Bill was delayed until this week.  It would be wrong to underestimate what remains to be done.  We can resume our examination of the Bill on Committee Stage.  In response to Deputy Jonathan O'Brien's question during the previous debate, we will resume when we have all the remaining pieces of the Bill available and when we have adequate time to consider them, including adequate time for Deputies to consult with stakeholders.  I will take on board any views.  If any particular group has contacted Deputies in recent weeks that we might have left out by accident, the door is open and I will meet it.  I have met many groups.  I was criticised by some Deputies.  When I visited the Centre for Independent Living in Galway before Christmas, a meeting that was attended by 300 people, they told me that they knew I was under pressure to ratify the UN convention but that I should bring in a strong Bill and that if it took time to do it properly, I should take that time rather than bring in a flawed Bill.  That was the advice I got from them.  I was disappointed by the delay.  I set myself a target of the end of December 2016 but we are back in business and, hopefully, we will complete Second Stage today.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-02-23a.266" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1307" speakername="Catherine Byrne" time="15:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017022300026#Y01200"><p>I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>  <p>  I am pleased to introduce the Misuse of Drugs (Supervised Injecting Facilities) Bill 2017 to the House.  This is an issue that is very close to my heart.  Like many Deputies, I have worked tirelessly for many years in my local community.  I have seen at first hand the destructive power of drugs and drug addiction.  I have seen what it does to people, to their families and to whole communities.  It is truly awful and heartbreaking.  This Bill is one part of a much bigger piece of work that needs to be done and is being done to reduce the impact of drugs, drug abuse and addiction in Ireland today.  The soon to be completed national drugs strategy will seek further to shape this approach.</p>  <p>  There is a problem with street injecting in Dublin and other cities and towns in Ireland.  I have seen it on my own doorstep and I know many Deputies will have witnessed it themselves.  It is unhygienic and unsafe.  Street injectors are at risk from diseases such as hepatitis C and HIV.  They risk getting ulcers and other infections.  Ultimately, they risk death from overdose.  The wider community and the general public are also at risk due to the discarded syringes left behind on streets and in alleyways.  Nobody chooses to inject drugs on the streets, down an alleyway or behind a bin.  This is where the most desperate in our society have been driven.  We must reach out to help those who find themselves in this most chaotic stage of addiction.</p>  <p>  The establishment of supervised injecting facilities is one way of reaching out to these people.  An injecting room is a controlled environment where drug users may inject drugs they have brought with them.  These facilities have proved to be effective in reaching out to these marginalised groups, those who use drugs on the streets or who have little interaction with existing services.  In an injecting centre, drug users can get access to clean injecting equipment.  There will be trained staff to provide emergency care if they suffer an overdose and there will be an opportunity to have minor health issues treated by a doctor or a nurse.  They can access other health and social care services where previously their addiction or their personal situation meant they were unable to do so.  An injecting centre can be a way back from the desperate situation in which a lot of street injectors find themselves.  As a result, the injecting centre will also help with other problems associated with injecting on the street, including drug-related litter and the local amenity.</p>  <p>  We are not alone in considering this course of action.  There are around 90 drug consumption rooms operating around the world.  They are in cities such as Luxembourg, Copenhagen. Barcelona, Sydney and Vancouver.  Last autumn, the first centre in France opened in Paris.  Two more are planned.  Last year, Lisbon approved a proposal to open up a centre as soon as possible.  Glasgow is also working towards opening a centre, the first of its kind in the UK.  Evidence from the long-running sites demonstrates a reduction in fatal overdoses and the risk of transmitting blood-borne diseases.  They show a decrease in the amount of public injecting.  There are significant reductions in drug-related litter.  A fourfold reduction was seen in Barcelona with an almost 80% reduction in Copenhagen.  Drug consumption rooms have been operating for over 30 years and nobody has ever died as a result of an overdose in any of them.</p>  <p>  First and foremost, injecting centres are a form of harm reduction.  I know that the idea may seem strange at first and I can understand people's initial reaction to the idea of an injecting centre.  I was sceptical when I first stepped into this role but I have read the evidence and met with doctors and counsellors who work in them.  I have spoken with police officers who worked in the area.  My officials and I have visited centres in Europe.  The evidence is very clear.  Injecting centres do not promote drug use.  They do not create, cause or permit drug crime.  An injecting centre is not a free-for-all for those who want to inject drugs.  It simply works to prevent injury and death and connect people with health services.  The evidence shows injecting centres do not cause an increase in the use of drugs or drug-related crime.  There is no evidence for the so-called "honey-pot effect".</p>  <p>  This Bill and injecting centres will not be the solution to the drugs problem but drug use and drug addiction is a complex and difficult problem.  We have to try something different to help these people who are marginalised because of their addiction.  An injecting centre cannot work in isolation.  It must be part of a wider framework of services.  It should only be one part of a range of harm reduction measures that we should be able to use to address the issue.  Injecting centres can also only succeed through co-operation and engagement between key local stakeholders - health care workers, the garda&iacute;, local authorities and, importantly, local communities.  This legislation is only the first step on that road.  I have asked the HSE to establish a working group to identify the practical issues of setting up a pilot service in Dublin city centre.  I reassure Deputies that no decision relating to a final location has been taken.  As part of this work, the HSE will be undertaking a process of consultation, including with local stakeholders and communities.</p>  <p>  In A Programme for a Partnership Government, we committed to supporting a health-led rather than criminal justice approach to drug use.  The programme reaffirmed this Government's commitment to legislate for injecting rooms and this Bill is a priority for this D&aacute;il session.  This Bill will not establish the location of the facility.  It simply provides enabling legislation where currently it is illegal to provide or use such a centre.  However, it is intended that the first centre will be a pilot to determine the suitability and effectiveness of injecting rooms in an Irish context.</p><p>I know many people have concerns about where the first pilot facility will be located.  I assure the House that no decisions have been made.  First, we must bring forward this enabling legislation before those steps can be taken.</p> <p> Under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 it is currently an offence to provide an injecting centre.  Service users would also be guilty of several offences.  A change to existing legislation is required to facilitate the introduction of these centres.  The previous Government approved the drafting of heads to provide for injecting centres.</p> <p> The Bill contains 13 sections.  I will proceed to explain each section in turn.</p> <p> Section 1 deals with interpretation.  The provisions it contains are standard and they include a number of new definitions for the purposes of the Bill.  The section includes definitions for "drug", "licence" and "supervised injecting facility".  The definition of "drug" will include controlled drugs and psychoactive substances, sometimes referred to as "head-shop" drugs.  The type of injectable drugs that service users bring in to the centre will not be restricted to heroin, for example.  To do so would not assist in reducing the harm associated with these newer head-shop drugs.</p> <p> Sections 2 and 3 cover application for a licence and the granting of a licence.  Section 2 provides for the information that should be included in an application.  This will include the name and relevant experiences of the person applying for a licence.  The address of the proposed premises and the details of the proposal to be put in place for the operation as well as clinical governance of the centre must also be supplied.  Should any application not contain enough detail, the Minister is enabled to seek further information.</p> <p> Section 3 provides the criteria by which the Minister may be satisfied to consider granting a licence.  These include, but are not limited to, consultation with the Garda, the HSE and others, as the Minister considers appropriate.  It also includes the matters the HSE will consider when advising the Minister on the appropriateness of such an application.  The HSE is best placed to assess the clinical governance and operational protocols proposed for a premises and to ensure that it is fit-for-purpose.  In addition, there will be consideration of whether the location of a proposed centre is appropriate given the level and nature of drug use in any area.  The HSE will advise the Minister accordingly.</p> <p> Section 3 also grants the Minister the authority to attach conditions to a particular licence.  These conditions shall be informed by consultation with the Garda, the HSE or others.  Such a licence will be for a fixed period.  However, it may be surrendered by the licence holder, or suspended or revoked by the Minister.  The licence may also be extended by the Minister following consultation with the HSE and the Garda.</p> <p> Sections 4, to 6, inclusive, deal with the surrender, suspension and transfer of a licence.  These sections provide for a licence holder to be able to surrender or to seek to transfer a licence for a particular centre.  However, written notice of a fixed period must be provided to the Minister before a centre can be closed.  These provisions ensure that adequate service provision continues should the effectiveness of a centre remain positive.</p> <p> Section 5 provides for the Minister to revoke or suspend the licence based on the input of the Garda or HSE with immediate effect should there be a serious and immediate risk to life.  Under this section, the conditions attached to a licence may be amended or added to, as the Minister sees fit, and may take into account the views of the HSE, the Garda and others.</p> <p> In Section 6 the licence for a particular premises must be transferred to another licence holder to maintain continuity of service, should this be considered necessary.</p> <p> Section 7 includes the definition of an "authorised user".  It also provides the authority of a licence holder to permit a person to be in an injecting centre.  An "authorised user" will be an individual who is on the premises of the injecting centre in accordance with the conditions of the licence and with the permission of the licence holder.  A person cannot be an authorised user outside of the centre.  To become an authorised user, advanced, overwhelming and complex registration with the service will not be required.  However, the status of authorised user will depend on the premises of the licence holder.  Therefore, a service user who has been asked to leave the premises, or who will be in breach of the conditions of the licence, will not be afforded exemption from certain offences under the Misuse of Drugs Act.</p> <p> Section 8 relates to the obligation of the licence holder to provide information.  Section 8 provides for unidentified data to be shared with the Minister or the HSE for the purposes of evaluating the centre.  Personal records cannot be shared.</p> <p> Section 9 relates to the liability of the licence holder.  This section provides an exemption for the licence holder from liability for providing an injecting centre and any assistance, advice or care given to an authorised user.</p> <p> The Bill has been carefully drafted to address the health-related harm associated with public injecting while ensuring that the misuse of drugs legislation remains undiluted.  Section 10 provides that certain sections of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 will not apply under certain circumstances.  Section 3 of the 1977 Act makes it an offence to be in possession of a controlled drug.  The offence of possession of a controlled drug would not apply to an "authorised user" as defined under section 7 of this Bill.  Section 19 of the 1977 Act makes it an offence for the occupier, controller or manager of any premises to permit the possession, manufacture, production or preparation of a controlled drug on the premises.  The licence holder for an injecting centre will be exempted from such an offence.  Finally, section 21 of the 1977 Act provides that it is an offence to contravene or fail to comply with the regulations made under the Act.  This section of the Bill ensures that authorised users will not be in breach of the relevant regulations.</p> <p> Section 11 relates to provision of access for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This section provides for a member of the Garda to enter an injecting centre without a warrant for the prevention or detection of offences.  It is normal practice for police in other countries to call into injecting centres on a regular basis.</p> <p> Section 12 provides for the Minister for Health to make various regulations for the purposes of the Bill and section 13 covers the Short Title, collective citation and commencement provisions.  These are standard provisions.</p> <p> I am pleased to bring forward this legislation.  It is a compassionate and practical response to the chilling reality of drug users injecting and overdosing in public.  Injecting centres create a safe harbour for chronic drug users.  The centres will provide a controlled place for people to inject, but they will be far more than that.  I believe in a health-led and person-centred approach to the drug problem.  This is also about people and looking after the most vulnerable and marginalised in our society.  The human cost of public injecting is clear and keeps adding up.  The cost includes lack of dignity and the effect this activity has on people's health, well-being and safety.  We know these facilities are not the solution to the drugs problem.  Many other steps are needed.  However, I am committed to do everything I can to help those who need it most.  I hope and expect that all in the House will fully support the Bill and help to ensure its smooth and speedy passage through the Oireachtas.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-02-23a.268" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1255" speakername="Jack Chambers" time="15:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017022300028#AA00100"><p>As my party's spokesperson on the national drugs strategy, I am pleased to contribute to the debate on the Bill.  I and my party are always open to considering new and innovative ways to tackle drug abuse and help those who suffer with drug addiction.  The nature of, and problems associated with, drug-taking are very different today from what was happening over 30 years ago so, as legislators, we have a responsibility to respond and to be open to new and more nuanced approaches as required.  Fianna F&aacute;il supports this Bill as we are of the view it will help to reduce the incidence of drug-related deaths.  We believe a supervised injecting centre in Dublin should be introduced on a pilot basis, as provided for in the legislation.  There should be regular reviews to measure the success of the centre.  Input from stakeholders, the Garda and local groups will be important in this regard.  How this policy is implemented will be crucial to its success or failure.</p>  <p>  I am equally of the view that the introduction of such facilities will not solve or end the scourge of problem drug taking in Ireland.  A supervised injecting centre should be viewed as just a part of a range of measures and services to address this problem.  It more important that the Government acts to fund and deliver more detoxification centres, more support services for those who want to tackle their addiction, more emphasis on education and prevention and more focus on treatment and rehabilitation.  It is disappointing that the programme for Government formally proposes few other measures.  This centre is one of the positive measures proposed in the programme but we must outline further measures that could positively assist in addressing many of the issues with drug abuse in Ireland.  The national drug strategy is due to be published later this year and I hope the Minister takes on board the submissions made by my party, other parties in the House and the many interest groups to prioritise these measures.</p>  <p>  Ireland has the highest rate of intravenous heroin use in Europe.  Consequently, the rate of drug-related deaths here is three times the European average, which is shocking.  Two people die from drug related deaths every day in Ireland.  This is simply unacceptable.  Everybody should reflect on those figures.  The Minister referred to the many other morbidities associated with injecting, such as hepatitis C and HIV.  There is a direct correlation between those and allowing addicts to be left on our streets, without intervention or harm reduction.  The positive aspect of the Bill is that we can provide people with access to a wraparound service when they are in such a vulnerable position.</p>  <p>  We must ask how we allowed this situation to develop and, more importantly, what we must do to address it.  Since being appointed party spokesperson on drugs I have been visiting and engaging with stakeholders in the area of drug treatment, prevention and rehabilitation.  I have met with relevant groups and many of the task forces in Dublin and across the country.  We cannot fool ourselves that this is just a Dublin or urban problem.  It is a problem for every household on every road across the country.  Drug taking is a problem that affects every family.  I have visited the Tiglin residential treatment centre in Wicklow and the Rutland Centre and I have met with local and regional drugs and alcohol task forces.  I visited the Ais&eacute;ir&iacute; Aislinn centre in County Kilkenny, one of the country&rsquo;s few adolescent treatment centres, which has struggled to get the proper level of funding to provide its excellent service for vulnerable adolescents.  In Dublin city, I visited Merchants Quay Ireland and the Ana Liffey Drug Project, to name just two.  All of these groups are doing admirable work, in the most testing of environments with the tightest of budgets.  The latter two have recommended the introduction of a supervised injecting facility.  Both of the groups see and experience daily how drugs destroy lives and devastate families.  They are well placed to offer input in this area.</p>  <p>  A supervised injecting facility can only be successful if it is considered the start point for recovery, not the end point for shooting up.  Injecting facilities must be a pathway to effective treatment and rehabilitation.  That is the constant challenge.  The level of services the HSE provides is not enough, and the level of funding is always difficult in the context of the health budget.  It is hard for people who do not have a voice to get the funding they deserve.  If we enact this legislation, and I hope it will progress quickly through the Oireachtas, we must then discuss how we give hope and proper intervention and treatment to people in such a vulnerable situation.  The real challenge is how we match this approach with the services they deserve.  The injecting room should be part of a network of services housed in the same centre to facilitate this.  If successful, this centre has the potential to become a broader, viable public health measure.  At the very least, it has the potential to provide individuals with some dignity and a safe place while we work to help them overcome addiction.</p>  <p>  I understand the concerns that have been raised about pursuing this measure.  However, we must have an evidence based approach.  Injecting facilities are a relatively new development and much of the research is still in the early stages.  Studies by the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction indicate injecting centres can be successful in reducing drug related deaths and morbidity.  There have also been reported decreases in drug related litter in many of the cities where they have been introduced.  Overall, the evidence does not support the contention that injecting centres lead to an increase in drug-related crime in an area.  We must adhere to an evidence based approach to this discussion, not a mythical approach that is put forward by stakeholders who do not have the interests of the vulnerable people concerned in mind.  They must focus on the evidence, not the mythology.  There are now approximately 90 injecting centres across Europe and nobody has died in any of them.  Staffed by trained health care professionals, the safety of these centres should not be questioned.</p>  <p>  There is also an economic argument for injecting centres.  When drug users are using the same facilities, it frees up health and other resources considerably.  When an injecting centre opened in Australia, there was an 80% drop in ambulance call outs.  Paramedics were no longer having to deal with overdoses or related incidents, which meant they were better able to respond to emergencies and ultimately save lives.  When considering other areas of health care, including community based health care, we are focusing on primary care and making interventions before people end up in an acute situation.  The same should apply for the vulnerable addicts who are on our streets.  They should have a place where they can access harm reduction, so an acute situation does not arise for them and they do not overdose and end up in hospital for a period of time.  A wraparound intervention and treatment for them is what this Bill seeks to provide.</p>  <p>  To return to the programme for Government, I am pleased there is now a recognition of the need to promote the health aspect of dealing with drug addiction.  As I said in my party&rsquo;s submission to the national drugs strategy, tackling the country&rsquo;s crippling drug problem requires major reform in our overall approach.  Every day we hear stories of individuals, families and communities around the country that have been devastated by drugs.  The renewed focus on this area is welcome, as is the development of the new national drug strategy which will shape our policies in trying to tackle this problem in the coming years.  The passing of the Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Act last year highlighted clearly how legislators must stay on top of a constantly evolving environment where clever and ruthless drug dealers use every loophole, grey area and opportunity they can to intimidate and prey on vulnerable people and make profits from the victims of drugs.</p>  <p>  Drug-related harm consistently clusters in communities marked by poverty and social inequality.  Research shows that this situation was allowed to develop by the policies of many Governments and year-on-year funding cuts.  We must be mindful of this.  The economy is growing at present but if it should decline, we must ensure that the core services for the most vulnerable people are maintained and that there is a proper funding model for the services to continue the level of intervention they are currently providing.  That is the importance of harm reduction.  Equally important is the need to develop proper treatment, rehabilitation, therapeutic and aftercare services.  In this regard, we have proposed in our submission the roll-out, on a pilot basis, of therapeutic communities within prisons to help offenders overcome drug addiction.  The Joint Committee on Justice and Equality, under its Chairman, Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, is trying to engage in a better way on penal reform and on how to provide the level of intervention in our prison system that is not currently being provided.</p>  <p>  As work gets under way on the new national drugs strategy, more emphasis should be placed on prevention and education.  This should start with our younger people.  Greater emphasis must be placed on the teaching of social, personal and health education, SPHE, in schools and informing children about the dangers of drugs.</p><p>Former users, as well as health care professionals and garda&iacute; and inter-agency collaboration, are crucial in this regard and can play an important role in educating and preventing young people from going down the road of using drugs.</p> <p> Ultimately, I am trying to highlight the need for a multifaceted, multi-agency approach which is properly resourced to tackle drug addiction.  The injecting centres in this legislation, if correctly introduced and managed, can be an important step on the road to tackling this problem once and for all.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-02-23a.270" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1280" speakername="Jonathan O'Brien" time="15:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017022300029#BB00200"><p>I warmly welcome the introduction of this Bill.  I have been calling for this legislation for a number of years and, at the outset, it is only appropriate to mention Senator Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, the predecessor of the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, because he was a champion of this legislation in the previous D&aacute;il and faced some stiff opposition to it.  Had it not been for his doggedness in trying to get this issue moved on, I do not think we would be here today.</p>  <p>  I will get to the Bill in a minute but I want to touch on some of the falsities that are being put about, and also some of the negative press and commentary around the provision of an injecting centre.  People will ask if there is a need for one.  We should consider in that context that 13 million people worldwide inject drugs every single day.  In this State alone, the latest figures we can work off, which are old figures from 2014, show nearly 10,000 people receiving treatment for opiate use.  In 2014, more than 16,500 people entered treatment for a drug problem.  Of those, 4,500 were opiate users or opiates were their main choice of drugs.  There were 943 new cases in 2014.</p>  <p>  What Deputy Chambers said is interesting, that this is not a Dublin issue, and the figures bear that out.  Of the 4,500 opiate users to whom I referred, only 2,100 were resident in Dublin.  The rest were outside Dublin.  Almost 3,000 of them were men.  Only five are registered as being under 18, but we all know that there are many more people under the age of 18 who are using heroin and other opiate-based drugs.  Only five are captured in this particular research.  More than 2,500 of them were aged between 18 and 34, and in excess of 2,500 used opiates with other drugs, so they were multi-drug users.  Some 640 people used it between two and six days per week, 294 used it once a week and, what is astonishing, in excess of 2,000 people in this State were using heroin every single day.  If that does not highlight the need to provide an injecting centre, even if only one on a pilot basis, then I do not know what does.</p>  <p>  On the number of people who have lost their lives as a result of drug use, again the figures are slightly behind where we are.  Between 2004 and 2014, more than 6,600 people lost their lives through drug use.  Nearly 4,000 of those deaths were due to overdose.  Over 40% of them were due to non-poisoning, which is non-overdose, causes.  A quarter of all deaths from overdose were as a result of heroin or involved heroin.  Of those who lost their lives, 87% were male and 81% of such cases involved more than one drug, so it was heroin plus another.  Of the number of people who lost their lives from using heroin, 48% were injecting the drug at the time of death.  I stress that figure because it indicates that more than half the drug related deaths due to heroin were down to non-injecting reasons - people smoking it, basically.  While this legislation is welcome and is going to address the issue of intravenous use, it does not address the issue of the 52% of people who lost their lives from smoking heroin.  We need to be cognisant of that.</p>  <p>  What we are providing here will help a number of people.  There is no doubt about that and I welcome it, but it is not going to address the issue of drug use in this State.  Unfortunately, we are behind the times compared with other European states.  We need to look at the evidence available.  I saw one local councillor, whom I will not name, debating with the Minister of State on a television show recently.  He said there was no evidence to suggest that injecting centres save lives.</p>  <p>  I want to read into the record the number of people who have had their lives saved because of these injecting centres.  The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction has calculated that in Germany, ten people are saved every year because of these centres.  In Canada, up to 12 deaths have been prevented every single year.  A 2011 study went into more detail.  It tracked the number of fatal overdoses in the 32 months before a centre was opened and the 27 months after the centre was opened.  It found that the rate of overdose deaths fell by 35% in the first two years of the centre's operation, while it fell by less than 10% in other areas of the city where they were not providing a supervised injecting centre.  That same report went on to say that not only did it prevent deaths, it probably prevented 35 HIV infections every year since opening.  While there is a lot of research in Australia, it does not go into the number of people who have potentially been saved, but it enables the data to be analysed and for the figures to be worked out.  They reckon that 25 overdose deaths are prevented every single year by providing these centres.</p>  <p>  The evidence is available, and I agree with Deputy Chambers that when we are dealing with this type of issue, the scaremongering has to go out the window and we have to rely on the evidence.  I know personally, and the Minister of State knows why, that there is a lot of stigma around people who use heroin.  We can pass this legislation, but for me that is only half the battle.  We have to open one of these facilities.  Let us be very clear that it is not going to be an easy job.  There will be many people with many issues.  There will be NIMBYism.  People will not want it in their backyard.  Those people need to take their heads out of the sand.  I have seen it in my city of Cork, where for years I was raising the issue of heroin use and people were saying not to mention it, that it was bad for tourism and bad for publicity.  The reality is people were dying on our streets.  No matter how few media articles there are about it or how quiet it is kept, the reality is people are still dying, and we can either bury our heads in the sand or do something about it.</p>  <p>  I would love to see one of these centres in my community and my constituency, because I have lost friends who have died from heroin overdoses.  I have almost lost family members to heroin overdoses.  There are many people whom I grew up and went to school with who, unfortunately, are not here today because they became addicted to heroin and lost their lives.  I could probably name six close friends of mine who, unfortunately, lost their lives because of overdoses, nearly all of which were down to heroin.</p><p>I would love to have one of these in my city.  I am quite jealous that we are planning a pilot project in Dublin.  I understand why we are doing that given that nearly half of those who inject heroin reside in Dublin.  However, more than 2,000 people outside Dublin also inject heroin and their lives are just as important.  I know people will have a battle on their hands to get this facility open.  I implore communities to recognise that such a facility does not stigmatise their community but is trying to save the lives of people who reside within that community.  They can be our neighbours, family members or people we have grown up with.  I encourage people to approach the debate with a very open mind.</p> <p> I said we are probably behind other international models because the injecting centre we are now looking at is what other countries were looking at ten or 15 years ago.  Many European countries are now moving beyond the injecting-centre model to a drug-consumption model, which is where we need to go eventually.  I outlined the figures.  Given that 52% of all heroin-related deaths are for non-injection reasons, the evidence is there to suggest we should move to that.  We are not just talking about heroin.  People who will be able to access these facilities could be injecting cocaine or amphetamines; although I acknowledge heroin is the predominant drug.</p> <p> As the Minister of State will be aware, the committee carried out the pre-legislative scrutiny.  The Library and Research Service produced a fine document on it.  Page 39 of that publication covers the main issues raised during the pre-legislative scrutiny and how well the Bill addresses those concerns.  It found that the majority of observations fell into three main areas.  Unfortunately, two of the three have not been addressed in the Bill, which is disappointing.  The one area that has been addressed is the issue of an authorised user; the committee was concerned as to what is an authorised user.  I believe the Minister of State has addressed that in the legislation and I agree completely with the definition.</p> <p> According to section 7(1), "A licence holder, or the person in charge of a supervised injecting centre for the time being, may authorise a person, not being a person prescribed as being ineligible to be an authorised user".  I ask the Minister of State to explain how a person becomes ineligible.  I do not know whether that is just a legal term.  I presume the only way for a person to become ineligible is by no longer injecting and by looking to smoke or consume drugs by methods other than injection.</p> <p> Section 5 deals with the revocation or suspension of licence and section 5(5) refers to "Where the Minister considers that there is a serious and immediate risk to the life, health or welfare of an authorised user, or to the well-being of the staff of that facility".  I am not happy with that wording.  By their very nature, authorised users who are injecting heroin are in serious risk of their lives.  That is the reality of drug use.  I do not want the legislation to contain any caveat that would allow any future Minister to revoke a licence on the basis that there is a risk to an authorised user's life or health.  We need to get real.  The user is in a centre and is injecting heroin; of course there will be a risk to his or her life.</p> <p> At the committee I raised concerns over section 11, which gives members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na permission to enter these centres.  In order for this pilot project to be successful, in addition to getting the buy-in of local communities, the Garda and the Health Service Executive, we also need to get the buy-in of the drug users themselves.  If they do not buy into this pilot project, it will fail with devastating consequences for those individuals.</p> <p> I do not know how many drug users who plan to inject themselves with heroin will actually do so if there is a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na standing beside them in the facility.  I do not know how practical that is.  I can understand the Minister of State's reasons for inserting that provision.  It is obviously to prevent people from using the centre for profit through dealing and preying on vulnerable drug users.  However, we need to look at this.  At the pre-legislative scrutiny it was mooted that a code of practice could be put in place with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That will not happen; the law is the law.  Garda&iacute; do not work off codes of practice; they work off what is legal and what is not legal.</p> <p> A heroin user in possession of heroin who is ten yards away from an injecting facility will be committing an offence.  If a garda stops that person, we will be relying on the goodwill of that garda to say, "It's all right.  Off you go.  I know where you're off to."  Many garda&iacute; will do that but it will still be illegal.  We need to address the issue of decriminalisation.  While we will not do so in this legislation, we need to do it in the context of the national drugs strategy.  If we are serious about moving to a public health model we need to look at decriminalisation, which will be a very difficult conversation but we need to have it.</p> <p> The Bill provides that if a person is caught in possession of a controlled substance within the facility, we will "disapply" the law to them.  We need to put people's minds at ease.  A number of people have said to me that passing this legislation actually legalises heroin within certain facilities.  That is not the case.  My understanding is that even within a supervised injection centre, a person in possession of a controlled substance is still breaking the law.  However, we are saying that we will "disapply" that to individuals who are in there for the purpose of using that controlled substance.  We need to knock that myth on the head immediately.  Irrespective of whether we agree with the argument on decriminalisation, nobody in this House is proposing to legalise any controlled substance that is currently illegal.</p> <p> The second myth we need to knock on the head relates to drug crime.  In all the research that has been done, there is absolutely no evidence that suggests the establishment of a drug injecting centre increases drug crime in the locality.  On the contrary all the evidence suggests it decreases drug crime.</p> <p> I hope we can progress the legislation quickly.  When it is passed the Minister of State will have a job of work regarding the regulations for providing a licence.  It cannot be too restrictive.  We cannot allow the regulations on providing a licence to become a stick that people opposed to this legislation can use to beat us.  We need to provide this centre because it is the right thing to do.  There is no such thing as a good decision or a bad decision when it comes to providing an injecting centre, only the right decision or the wrong decision.</p><p>It is the right decision to provide these types of facilities.  The facilities in question are not just about allowing somebody to walk in off the street and inject himself or herself with an illegal substance and walk back out.  That is not their purpose.  Their primary purpose is to save lives and their secondary purpose is to try to address the drug problem the individual has.  We will do that by providing all the ancillary services at the facility.  From my experience, if we have the right facility and services in place, we will not only save lives, we will save people from a lifetime of drug addiction.  If the facility is there that can actually provide the services when somebody is at their lowest point, they will grab it with both hands and take it.  They will do everything in their power to beat their drug addiction and become functioning people in society again.</p> <p> I wish the Minister of State well with the legislation.</p></speech>

Will the Minister elaborate on progress in that regard?  I am conscious that some of the units into which people are being moved before they get permanent housing are being managed by housing agencies or associations and have tenancies attaching to them.  This was relayed to me yesterday.  Is it causing an issue for some people in those tenancies when they expire or go beyond the tenancy?  Is it causing difficulties in its own right as well?  Is there provision that it will not be the case in this instance?</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-02-23a.281" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="16:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017022300031#DD01200"><p>The Deputy will receive my written reply but I will give him a verbal answer because it might be more helpful.  A significant number of families have been housed or we have found homes for them.  There have also been significant numbers of families coming into homelessness.  The figure was 87 in the month of January.  The challenge is to reduce the numbers coming into homelessness and accelerate the numbers coming out.  We have an agreement with the CEOs of the four Dublin local authorities to try to share the responsibility here for transitioning families from hotel rooms into more suitable accommodation.  The majority of those will be into social housing, either through rapid build social housing, conventional social housing or social houses that have been purchased or brought back into use from voids.</p>  <p>  We will also be very proactively using the homeless housing assistance payment, HAP, which was very successful last year.  There were approximately 800 homes found for individuals and families through the latter.  Some of the families will be in what we call family transition hubs on a temporary basis.  It is emergency accommodation specifically kitted out for families with homework clubs, facilities for children and much more normalised family-style facilities in terms of where people eat that are safe and clean and so on.  Respond! opened one in Drumcondra at the start of the year that can cater for 32 families.  It is quite a successful model.  We want to have that type of approach available for families so they can be looked after on a temporary basis while we find a transition for them into either long-term tenancies or social housing, which is ultimately the answer here.</p></speech>

I am concerned that people on waiting lists do not have the same opportunities available to them if the transition homes have leases of up to two years' duration.  It was a bold commitment that was made in the document.  I acknowledge that and wish the Minister every success with it.  I hope the target of ending that as a source of accommodation by June 2017 can be achieved.  Four options will be available between now and then.  As an example of the Minister moving in the right direction, how successful has it been since the document was produced?  How many families have been moved out of commercial hotels since the document was produced?  Does the Minister have an idea?</p></speech>

I will have to get the figure for the split between the two but many were families.  If one looks at the figure for January, which was not a good figure overall in terms of homelessness and which people have commented on, the number of homeless adults has increased.  That was not a huge surprise to us considering that we put a lot of extra emergency beds into the system.  Those beds have been filled by and large so it is not surprising the numbers are up somewhat.  If one looks at the number homeless families, it is down by 33 and the number relating to dependants is down by 98.  We are making some progress there considering 87 families came into homelessness in that month.  The truth is that in the past number of months we have managed to stop the significant increase by taking a lot of people out of homelessness as quickly as possible.  We need to ensure that we slow down the numbers coming into homelessness and continue to increase the pace in which we can facilitate the transition out of emergency accommodation.  I am still confident we can do that by 1 July; I have always said it would be in the first half of this year and there will obviously be a difference.  That only gives us four months.  It is a big job to get between 700 and 800 families out of hotel accommodation and into appropriate accommodation in that period of time, but we are determined to do it.</p></speech>

We all know the scheme has not been a success.  There have only been 217 mortgage-to-rent cases completed over six years.  I welcome a number of the proposals relating to the scheme.  These should assist in some respects.  My question relates to the potential involvement of equity funds in buying up tranches of mortgages.  Will the Minister give us more information on how he sees the pilot schemes running between now and October on three issues in particular?  How will security of tenure for the tenant be secured as it is in the context of mortgage-to-rent arrangements with approved housing bodies?</p><p>How will the financing be done, both in terms of the percentage of market rent and any other financial supports that currently apply to approved housing bodies, and will they also be applied to vulture funds?</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-02-23a.292" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="16:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017022300032#EE00200"><p>I and my Government colleagues are acutely aware of the challenges faced by households in mortgage arrears and who potentially are at risk of losing their homes.  Rebuilding Ireland includes a range of actions that are targeted at assisting borrowers and ensuring that a range of suitable restructuring options is available that ultimately seeks to support borrowers to remain in their homes.  As part of those actions I have sought, through the review of the mortgage-to-rent scheme, to ensure that those households who have no realistic prospect of returning to solvency can be supported to remain in their homes in a secure social housing tenancy arrangement thereby avoiding additional pressures on the rental and social housing sectors.</p>  <p>  The review acknowledged that the current operating model, which relies on approved housing bodies to purchase individual properties, may not have the capacity to meet the needs of all borrowers who may be eligible for the scheme.  In order to test the operability of alternative funding models for the scheme, the Housing Agency will work with a number of financial entities that have come forward with an interest in working with the mortgage-to-rent scheme to progress a number of pilot alternative lease arrangements.  The contractual and lease arrangements that are required to secure these units from a local authority perspective require detailed consideration and the questions the Deputy has asked need answers.  Overall, these pilot projects are in a developmental stage and my Department is working with the Housing Agency in this regard.  I will be in a better position to set out in more detail how the pilot projects will operate and how the private investors will be selected when this development work is complete. </p>  <p>  I have met a number of these organisations and most of them are not motivated by profit but they need a certain minimum rate of return to get funding and backing.  Essentially, instead of banks having to deal with individual properties and individual approved housing bodies and selling the properties one by one, the banks would cluster groups of properties that would qualify for the mortgage-to-rent scheme, the owners would also qualify under the new more flexible criteria and we would put together a financial package, which would mean that we could deal with 20, 30 or 50 cases at a time, which would be in the interests of the borrowers and the banks concerned.  The opportunity to deal with significant increased numbers will flow from that.</p></speech>

Any of us who is keen to see greater solutions for those in mortgage distress will keep an open mind on this.  The first key issue is security of tenure.  As the Minister knows, under the current rules, if somebody mortgages to rent with an approved housing body, they effectively have a lifetime tenancy.  Will the same type of principle apply in these cases?  If we consider, say, a 20-year lease with a fund, even a long-term reputable investment fund, the difficulty is about what will happen at the end of the 20-year period.  There is also the issue of the financing because there is considerable financial support for the approved housing bodies, albeit not as much as they would like, both in terms of the 40% figure, essentially a grant deposit, as well as the &euro;15,000 grant for refurbishment.  If the involvement of funds involves an approved housing body and a fund, as one model is proposing, that has implications but if it just a fund that is going to purchase large volumes of distressed mortgages, does the Minister envisage those involved having the same access for the &euro;15,000 grant for repairs or, for example, something similar to the capital loan and subsidy scheme, CLSS, payment to assist them with a deposit?  What is the current thinking on those issues?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-02-23a.294" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="16:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017022300032#EE00400"><p>I have met a number of the organisations behind the funds to explore how this might work.  At least one of them is now an approved housing body as well.  The one in which David Hall is involved, for example, applied to become an approved housing body and it believes it can raise sufficient capital with very modest rates of returns.  The business model will be something along the lines that a local authority will agree to effectively lease a property under a normal leasing arrangement for 20 years with an option to renew after 20 years.  The security of tenure for people in these properties should be more or less the same as a normal social housing tenant in a long-term tenancy arrangement.  In the case of approved housing bodies that look to State to partially fund acquisitions, that is a slightly different model.  There is a third model whereby funds seek to invest in social housing, knowing that the State will give a guaranteed rent for a long time.  They will be looking for low levels of returns with very high security, which is a classic pension fund-type model.  We have asked the Housing Agency to work through these models with the different people and organisations concerned and then we will choose the ones we will deal with.  From my experience of the organisations we have met, they all have pretty altruistic motives in this respect..  This is not a vulture fund-type set-up; they are organisations that have been set up to try to improve and provide more social housing and to put in place a long-term funding arrangement to facilitate that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-02-23a.295" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1215" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="16:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017022300032#EE00500"><p>Certainly that is the case in respect of the business model David Hall and his associates have put in place.  However, whether that is the case for the likes of Arizun or Merrion Capital, for example, we are not yet sure and that is because we do not know the detail.  As soon as some of that detail is available, the housing committee might be a good place to tease that out.  Many of us would like to support a good initiative that allows people to remain in their homes.</p>  <p>  There are two other questions in this respect.  The first relates to those people in mortgage distress who do not qualify for social housing support under the current legislation and whether the funds may provide an avenue for addressing their long-term housing needs.  In addition, the approximately 20,000 buy-to-let properties that are more than 90 days in arrears and which have tenants in them clearly will not benefit from this scheme.  Equally, however, if those tenants are in receipt of rent supplement, the local authorities cannot purchase those houses.  What is the Government's thinking in terms of how to deal with those two sections of the distressed mortgage market?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-02-23a.296" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="16:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017022300032#EE00600"><p>My Department can only take decisions and responsibility directly for those who qualify for social housing.  There are broader considerations potentially within Government and the Department of Finance on whether we extend those criteria.  There is an ongoing discussion as to whether, for example, we extend income thresholds around social housing eligibility and there are arguments for and against that.  What we have done, which is quite a significant change, is we have launched the Abhaile programme whereby homeowners and borrowers can now access, if they are in real difficulty, free legal assistance and free financial advice and assistance.  On top of that, for people who have no hope of being able to repay unsustainable loans, there is an obligation on banks to give a very good reason as to why they would not work with a mortgage-to-rent type system.  We have widened the eligibility criteria for that in terms of qualification of a property, in that a property with two spare bedrooms can qualify and the value of the property can also be higher but the eligibility criterion for the applicants must be that they qualify for social housing.  Otherwise, we get would get into the territory of moral hazard.  If we do not have some income limit, we will have people seeking to potentially stay in households when they may have unsustainable debt but also have an income level that could allow them to provide themselves with alterative accommodation without too much difficulty.  There are various issues to consider.  We have spoken to the Department of Finance about that but the core point is we are significantly expanding the mortgage-to-rent scheme and I hope it will result in a significant increase in numbers.</p></speech>

It will, in the main, apply to existing commercial properties and will allow them to be converted for residential use.  I accept that construction costs that would be involved in those works are excessive enough in their own right.</p><p>However, the certification and compliance costs, especially in this instance, are crucial.  The assigned certifier system is excessive in cost.  We believe it should be replaced by local authorities in an effort to reduce those costs, improve local authority revenue, get units in place and reduce rents.  I am particularly conscious of over-the-shop developments, the difficulties regarding disabled access and certification in this regard and fire certificates.  Assigned certifiers may not be in a position to sign off on these certificates unless these compliance issues are addressed.</p></reply>

What was announced today is the next phase of the repair and leasing initiative, which has been successful in Waterford and Carlow.  The plan is to roll out that model.  The Deputy has previously called for the model to be available in Offaly and other counties.  We also want it to be available everywhere.  The scheme is being progressed.  A total of &euro;32 million is secured for the scheme, but again there is potential for further roll-out if needs be because it is a successful scheme.  This should be considered as one phase.  There will be more to come.</p>  <p>  To concentrate on the Deputy's question, which concerns the potential for other spaces in urban centres, again we agree with his proposal.  There is great potential in it.  We have flagged this in A Programme for a Partnership Government, published in May 2016, which we were all part of putting together.  It sets out the ambitious priority attached to urban regeneration by the Government, incorporating a series of specific actions aimed at facilitating the regeneration of our urban centres, many of which have been adversely impacted by the economic downturn.  Rebuilding Ireland - Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, published in July 2016, further reinforces the Government's commitment to urban regeneration.</p>  <p>  Pillar 5 of Rebuilding Ireland is specifically focused on utilising existing housing stock, with a key objective of ensuring the existing vacant housing stock throughout the country and across all forms of tenure, in both the public and private sectors, is used to the optimum degree possible.  Deputy Cowen and I discussed the scheme today and earlier in the week as well.</p>  <p>  In this context and further to Action 5.11 of Rebuilding Ireland, a working group which I chair and which involves senior representatives from my Department and many other Departments, local authorities and other relevant actors has been established to bring forward proposals for new urban regeneration measures as early as possible.  It is intended that the new measures will complement the existing regeneration activities under my Department's social housing capital programme as well as other initiatives.</p>  <p>  Owners of vacant commercial units in urban areas, including vacant or under-utilised areas over ground-floor premises, face a number of regulatory requirements, exactly as Deputy Cowen said, to advance projects for their re-use for residential purposes.  Such requirements may include planning permission and building control approval as well as requirements regarding protected structures, which can present regulatory barriers to the re-utilisation of vacant commercial space for residential purposes.</p>  <p>  As part of its deliberations in the working group and in line with the Rebuilding Ireland commitment, we are reviewing planning legislation to allow the change of use of vacant commercial premises in urban areas, including vacant or under-utilised areas over ground-floor premises, into residential units without having to go through the planning process.  Such vacant units could then potentially be brought into productive and beneficial use for housing purposes earlier than might otherwise be the case.  We expect the working group to publish and finish this report in the second quarter of this year because we recognise that this is urgent.</p>  <p>  Separately, my Department, working with Dublin City Council in the context of the living city initiative, is exploring the potential for further streamlining the approach to redeveloping and re-utilising vacant properties.  In this context, processes and requirements regarding planning, building control, fire safety and the conservation of historic buildings are also being considered.  The working group membership includes architects, and we understand the situation.  Very often it is impossible to bring these buildings back into use.  We are determined to find solutions to this.</p></reply>

I do detect an effort to get to the nub of the matter by virtue of the working group he has in place that is investigating the matter.  He says he hopes recommendations will emanate from the working group by the end of the second quarter.  I ask him to ensure this happens and that, based on those recommendations, the working group sees fit to find the mechanism that can alleviate the problem of certification of building controls.  The recommendations should not compromise in allowing for and creating ease of access for people who wish to develop these properties in such a way that the end result will be what we all want to see, which is more property being made available and the rental deficiencies in all towns throughout the country being addressed.  I would welcome that.</p>  <p>  Regarding the certified assessor and the associated costs for the building sector in general, as I have said on numerous occasions the costs in this country are excessive when compared with those of the likes of the North.  I believe I have asked the Minister of State to consider this before.  I ask him to allow his working group to investigate and make a recommendation as to the feasibility and viability of, and potential associated with, a new scheme whereby the local authorities would be that assessor.  This would offer an opportunity for the scheme to be streamlined and standards maintained throughout the country.  The standards are not necessarily compromised at present but they are definitely excessive, are too great a cost and feed into the more general problem of excessive construction costs.</p></speech>

I share these concerns so I have put much time and effort into meeting people in the business who are becoming assigned certifiers and carrying out this work.  There is a great range of costs out there.  We are analysing these costs in our Department.  We have two working groups on the overall costs of construction, which Deputy Cowen and I have discussed.  The Deputy has had discussions with the Minister, Deputy Coveney, on the matter as well.  There are two separate reports analysing all the costs.  It might not be the case that we compare that badly with other countries, from what I can see, but we analyse this as well and we must keep pushing the cost down.</p>  <p>  There is much misinformation out there in respect of the assigned certifier.  I stress, and I have said this before, that the Committee on Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, of which the Deputy is a member, could do great work to analyse and go through this area as a committee and a public forum.  I have met companies and individuals who can do this work at much lower prices than those I am hearing about.  I stress that the committee is a perfect place to analyse this and I would encourage it to do so.  The work we are doing in the working group on vacant buildings, both commercial and residential, is about trying to find ways to reduce the costs and the timelines and make it viable to bring these buildings back into use.  The repair-and-lease initiative was discussed today.  That is what this is about.  We recognise that people sometimes own these properties but have no cash and cannot bring them back into use.  Therefore, we are finding ways to make money available upfront to bring them back into use.  However, we must try to adjust the rules and regulations without reneging on quality, design or the historic purpose of the building.  There are other ways to take a more common sense approach to this-----</p></speech>

This will identify various aspects associated with what we believe to be excessive costs, one of which will be, I have no doubt, the area of certification.  It may well be that on publication of the report, we could enter into an agreement with the committee to ask it to make recommendations immediately that can feed into a decision process as soon as possible in order for this issue to be addressed.</p></speech>

I am very aware of the different prices.  People need to do their homework.  We can only present facts and gather information, and we will do so, but there is a lot of scope to get fair deals.  I have seen the different prices quoted.  I will send Deputy Cowen the names of people who might be able to give him different figures because he seems to have seen only one set of data.</p></speech>

I cannot see them.  I have asked the Minister to call in the county manager to explain what is going on.  The National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, offered the Department houses.  The council gave me the range of reasons it had to reject properties offered by NAMA, through the Government housing agency and its mediator.  When I put the question to NAMA it insisted that it was made quite clear to all agencies that any property handed over by NAMA to a housing agency would be fully remediated to the highest living standards and would be in full compliance with all construction and building standards.  Who is codding who?  NAMA also said that it was clear prior to hand over that any issues relating to legal title or financial matters would be sorted out.  We are being fooled, going from NAMA to the housing agencies to the county councils back to the Minister and I know how hard he is working but it is not happening.  If the Minister has leadership ambitions, and I wish him all the best, he will have to do better than this.</p></speech>

It is under the same pressure and has the same rent profile as Leixlip and Celbridge, for example, both of which are included.  The fall-out from it has been almost immediate.  It is as though landlords take it as almost a requirement to get their rents up to the average in the area if they are below that and there certainly are people under pressure to move out of their houses.</p></reply>
    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-02-23a.339.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="16:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017022300034#GG02700"><p> My immediate response is that it would be a very foolish landlord who started to put up rents significantly in a town like Maynooth because that will guarantee that it will come under the rent pressure zone designations.  It would be very counterproductive if the landlords' concern is the ability to increase rent.</p>  <p>  On 24 January 2017, in accordance with section 24A of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004, as amended, the Housing Agency proposed that 15 local electoral areas should be considered for designation as rent pressure zones.  On foot of the proposal from the Housing Agency, again in accordance with the Act, I requested the Director of the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, to make a report to me as to whether these areas met the criteria for designation as rent pressure zones.  On 26 January 2017, I received a report from the RTB confirming that 12 out of the 15 local electoral areas examined met the criteria and I made orders designating those 12 areas as rent pressure zones on 26 January 2017.  The areas designated included the local electoral areas of Naas, Celbridge-Leixlip and Kildare-Newbridge. </p>  <p>  For an area to be designated a rent pressure zone, it must satisfy the criteria set out in section 24A(4) of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 (as amended): (i) the annual rate of rent inflation in the area must have been 7% or more in four of the last six quarters; and (ii) the average rent in the area in the last quarter must be above the average national rent in the last quarter.</p>  <p>  In terms of the local electoral area of Maynooth, the report received from the RTB indicated that while the average rent in the area was above the average national rent for the quarter, the annual rate of rent inflation in the area was greater than 7% in only three of the last six quarters.  The requirement for designation is for the annual rate of rent inflation in the area to be 7% or more in four of the last six quarters.  Therefore Maynooth did not qualify under the criteria set out but may well do if rents continue to increase.  We will keep these areas under consideration.  Of all Deputies in this House, Deputy Murphy will appreciate more than most that we must make decisions when intervening in the property market on the basis of independent analysis and data and not politics.  There was an argument on that before Christmas.</p><p>I will rely on the independent data that is gathered by the RTB.  We will make decisions accordingly.</p></reply>

The new arrangements are having the effect I would have predicted.  The process used to select specific areas is flawed.  My party argued that rent increases should be linked to the consumer price index.  Under section 139 of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004, landlords are supposed to give notification of rent increases.  There is no evidence that this is being universally done.  In fact, a reply I received from the RTB suggested that updates are not provided in many cases.  As Maynooth is a university town, large cohorts of renters come on stream in particular cycles.  The Maynooth electoral area is quite large and has a significant rural hinterland and this has an impact on the profile of the town for these purposes.  I am sure this is also the case in other areas.</p></speech>

When people are paying rents that are not as high as the market rate in the area, the immediate reaction is to give people notice of significant rent increases to bring them up to the market level.  I will pass the details of such cases to the Minister.</p></speech>

When we were drawing up the criteria to be used to determine whether an area would qualify to be designated as a rent pressure zone, we moved away from the process of assessing on the basis of local authority areas because that was far too broad.  We were aware that the use of local authority areas would have an unfair impact on towns as it would lead to rural areas bringing down the averages.  For that reason, we tried to find a much more granular, targeted and localised way of assessing rents in certain areas.  We decided that the only way this could be done was by using local electoral areas.  I do not doubt that people in Navan, Maynooth, Greystones and Drogheda feel that those towns should be rent pressure zones.  They would like them to be designated as such.  Tenants in certain areas like to know that their landlords cannot increase their rents by more than 4% per annum.  I have to make decisions on the basis of the data and the criteria we set out in the legislation.  We decided on those criteria for a reason.</p></speech>

There is plenty of immediate evidence that this is happening.  We argued that this restriction should be nationally applied and should not be based on rent pressure zones.  We disagreed with some aspects of the Minister's approach when it was introduced, but now we are talking about how it is actually playing out.  I am mentioning an area I am very familiar with in that context.  The problem is that people in towns like Maynooth, Navan and Greystones, which are currently missing out, will have to be put under levels of pressure that have very negative effects on them in order for those towns to qualify for these purposes in the future.</p></speech>

One of those effects would essentially have been to put a ceiling on those very low values.  This would have prevented investment in many towns across the country.  I think that would have been massively counter-productive.  Instead, we wanted to target areas where we knew there was a significant problem and where the level of demand was driving rents up to crazy and unaffordable levels.  That is why we chose the rent pressure zone model.  I understand that a similar approach is being taken in Scotland, which has a similar profile to Ireland in this respect.  I remind the House that if there are incidents happening, there are pretty strong protections, enforced and monitored by the RTB, for tenants outside the rent pressure zone regulations or restrictions.  A landlord cannot simply evict somebody.</p></speech>

The Deputy and I have debated this issue previously.  I think we need to take multiple approaches to the provision of social housing.  In addition to developing classic social housing projects on public land and actively pursuing Part V, we should use public land more strategically to drive a new approach involving a mixture of social and private housing in mixed-tenure projects and to get more social housing built more quickly.  We have already spent quite some time today talking about all the projects we are trying to push on.  Almost 8,500 social housing units are at various stages in the pipeline for delivery and construction.  We need to use the capacity of the private sector to deliver social housing, affordable units and private housing, often on the same sites.  We can do that effectively by strategically using publicly owned landbanks.  Nobody is talking about selling off private landbanks or gifting them to people.</p></speech>

Under the Dublin City Council land initiative, 50% of properties will be privately owned, 20% will be rented out privately and just 30% will be social housing.</p><p>That is absolutely scandalous.  To be clear on the rented properties, the developer will be allowed to rent those houses to people at what will effectively be market rates or a little under them.</p> <p> The Minister has stated this is not gifting but in the case of the land initiative in Dublin City Council, we can consider what is happening with O'Devaney Gardens and St. Michael's estate, where all or part of the lands will be sold for development rather than kept in public ownership.  That will come at a much lower price than those developers would otherwise pay.  For example, it works out that a developer could get his or her hands on land at the O'Devaney site at approximately &euro;24,000 per unit.  Developers are getting sites at a knock-down price and meanwhile, people who need public housing are being pushed out.</p></speech>

These will have 30% social housing and 20% for affordable rental.  It will not be just for market rents; that would contradict the term "affordable rental" in that part of Dublin.  There will be 50% for private development.  It has not been agreed as to what level of financial cost or charge will be asked of a developer with regard to that site or whether we will get a dividend through paying for social housing or financing affordable rental units.  That has yet to be worked out by Dublin City Council and it will come back to me with agreed models when it puts them together.  There will be a big fund from my Department to finance social housing projects.  We already signed off on &euro;17 million a number of months ago to build 56 units at O'Devaney Gardens.</p></speech>

That is how I worked it out.</p><p>I will speak about the Minister's new proposal for affordable rental units in the limited time I have.  His document indicates that in rent pressure zones:</p><blockquote>Lands held by local authorities will be brought to market on a competitive tendering basis [to target] middle income private rental households.<br /><br />The cost of providing rental units will be permanently reduced by lowering the initial investment and development costs for providers ... allowing the rental units to be made available at below market prices without the need for ongoing rental subsidies.</blockquote><p>Basically, it will change policy to allow new builds to be rented out without other protections.</p><p>There is one piece of council land left in greater Blanchardstown, which is a key homeless black spot.  The proposal is for that to be mixed tenure, that is, with a section sold for private housing.  That will have a detrimental impact on the people I deal with every day who face homelessness or overcrowding.

Family sizes are different, demands are different and key workers need to be able to rent - as many of them want to rent - at affordable rental prices in city centres.  We must respond to those.

We are aware of the fact that, on occasions, development proposals for student accommodation developments can raise concerns at community level.  However, the planning system is extremely open and transparent as regards community participation in the decision making process, including the avenue of third party appeals to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  While recognising local concerns that may arise, I am sure the Deputy would nonetheless agree that the provision of housing for students is an important and distinct category of accommodation within the overall rental sector in Ireland that has been underprovided for in recent years.  This level of underprovision has displaced demand into the wider private rental sector and added to the upward pressure on rents.  Therefore, the provision of additional student accommodation is an essential part of the core solution to our current housing issues and this is recognised in the Rebuilding Ireland strategy, which provides for preparation of a national student accommodation strategy; legislative and other initiatives to facilitate the higher education institutes accessing funding by the Housing Finance Agency; a streamlined planning approval mechanism; and maximising potential for purpose-built student accommodation on appropriate higher education institute campuses and public lands.</p>  <p>  Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000 applies to development projects concerning the provision of dwellings such as houses or apartments.  These are different to the type of accommodation complexes often occupied by students over academic terms that have shared facilities and are subject to central management arrangements and do not constitute separate dwellings.  However, student accommodation complexes can form part of wider mixed residential developments, including conventional houses or apartments, which would be subject to a Part V process, so each project needs to be considered on a case-by-case basis, as occurs with planning authorities.  I am aware that Dublin City Council is closely monitoring the development of student accommodation projects so an appropriate balance and mix of housing and tenure types is realised in specific areas of the city in line with the statutory development plan and the council's housing strategy.</p>  <p>  I understand the Deputy's concerns but many people tell us accommodation utilised by students is needed for other families and would agree with the concept of trying to have much more student accommodation.  This would bring more solutions to the Deputy's community and we could provide better services for students and help them integrate better into communities if they are in purpose-built accommodation.</p></speech>

It is reckoned that currently, between what has already been granted and what is coming on stream, there will be student accommodation for 8,000 students in a very particular part of the north inner city.  Dublin Institute of Technology's Grangegorman campus has indicated it needs accommodation for 4,000 students, 2,000 of whom will live on the campus.  While there is a need in the greater Dublin area for 15,000 places in respect of student accommodation, more than half will go to a particular area in the north inner city.  At community meetings concerns have been raised about the social implications.</p>  <p>  Students are entitled to their parties etc. but when they come in such numbers to areas with families and senior citizen complexes, it will create difficulties.  They are also in areas with significant drug dealing, so is there any awareness of the increased pressure on addiction services in those areas as the inevitable will come about?</p></speech>

That is a little unfair and the wrong view, as it is not borne out by facts.  I am willing to consider any facts that the Deputy has in that regard.  We are trying to provide purpose-built student accommodation with all the services required for everybody's sake and for ease of integration.  I have no problem discussing that with the Deputy but it would be wrong and unfair to assume that all these difficulties will come about.</p>  <p>  There are 1,327 bed spaces under construction, with planning permission granted for 4,741 spaces.  Planning permission has been applied for 2,602 bed spaces.  There is preplanning of potential projects amounting to another 7,000 bed spaces.</p><p>In play there is a total of approximately 18,000 over the next few years.  They are not all located in just one spot.  I am very familiar with the Grangegorman site.  I have been there.  It will be a phased development.  It should have happened before now, and if we can sort out the finance, it will happen.  Not all the 8,000 or the additional 18,000 on top of that will be in the Deputy's area.  It is wrong to assume so.  I disagree with the Deputy's assumption at the start.</p></speech>

We have the list of planning applications and they add up to 8,000.  Who is the accommodation for?  Students use student accommodation for possibly six months of the year.  Who will avail of the space afterwards?  It will be profit for the developer in the area.  I take the Minister of State's point that it will move people out of private rented accommodation which will become available to others.</p>  <p>  I am struck by the speed and urgency with which student accommodation has been going up.  We do not see the same speed and urgency with the other type of housing that is needed.  Student populations are transient and are coming into areas where there is already a transient population with private rented and hostel type accommodation, and it is not fair to the families and communities already living there.  While I do not object to students partying, that is what they do in reality.</p></speech>

I wish it were.  These projects have been sitting idle and waiting for funding for many years.  We are purposely trying to drive up the amount of student accommodation in cities and areas close to universities and on campuses.  We are trying to encourage and provide funding for education institutes to drive on-campus accommodation.  The majority will be publicly funded through the education bodies.  That is what we want to encourage.</p>  <p>  They are managed to a high standard.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, and I have visited some of the new accommodation in UCD and Maynooth.  It is built to a very high standard and there are many services on site.  Many conditions are attached to them and the student accommodation is designed in a certain way to minimise the disruption which the Deputy claims happens regularly.  It is purpose built.  I have been in student accommodation all over the area for many reasons over many years.  Trust me, it is much better developed in a co-ordinated way and designed for students in the first place and it fits in much better.</p></speech>

I put it to the Minister that his housing proposals, figures and plans are, at best, a mirage and, at worst, entirely bogus.  They are based overwhelmingly on dependence on a private sector incapable of delivering, in the new lingo, "housing solutions".</p></reply>

We have had a new housing and homelessness strategy in place since last summer, only approximately seven months ago.  Since then, we have committed nearly &euro;5.5 billion to providing a very significantly increased number of social houses.  We will build approximately 26,000 of the 47,000 that will be coming in.  We will provide the others through acquisition and long-term leasing arrangements.  There is nothing bogus.  There is no fantasy.  There will be a dramatic increase in the amount of social housing that will be provided through building, long-term leases, bringing voids back into use and acquisitions.  Last year alone we spent &euro;203 million buying more than 1,000 properties that were largely vacant to bring them back into social housing use.  We launched the numbers, and the Deputy should look at where they are going to be built and the timelines for them.  A total of 8,430 social houses to be constructed are at various stages in the pipeline.</p>  <p>  I share the Deputy's frustration.  We need to increase dramatically the number of social houses available to local authorities to house people on housing lists and get families out of emergency accommodation in hotels and individual rough sleepers into Housing First models with the supports they need.  It cannot happen overnight, and most people understand this.  There is a sense of urgency in my Department and in most local authorities to ramp up capacity significantly and to get building, and it is happening.  We have increased the funding for housing by 50% from last year to this year and all the money will be spent on construction, acquisition, bringing voids back into use and strategically using publicly owned landbanks in a much more proactive and aggressive way to get more social houses into the system.  That is what I am responsible for and it is happening.</p></speech>

During the past two weeks, it has broken three records, namely, the highest number of homeless people, even with a child becoming homeless every five hours, the highest rent increase since <i>daft.ie</i>started keeping records, and the lowest number of council houses delivered in any one year.  In his document, the Minister mentioned the 8,000.  I looked through the document and noticed that I know the person who lives in one of these houses that are supposedly new constructions in Shankill.  Strangely, the person has been living there for years.  It was not a new construction but the refurbishment of a house for a family with a severely disabled child who have been awaiting it for years.  It is the same family.</p><p>The new lingo is &quot;housing solutions&quot;.  Given that most of those housing solutions are rental accommodation scheme, RAS, or housing assistance payment, HAP, solutions, the Minister is double counting.  In many cases, individuals are being bumped from one RAS tenancy to another and then another, and this is being counted as three or four housing solutions although it is the same family not getting a housing solution at all.</p></speech>

Based on the Minister's figures for last year, there were only 2,192 new additions to social housing stock.  There were approximately 2,500 refurbishments, which brings it up to 4,000.  This means 75% of the 18,000 social housing solutions are private rental units leased for two, four or ten years.  Deputy Boyd Barrett is right.  The figures from the Minister's Department show a chronic over-reliance on private sector solutions, not a significant increase in social housing.</p></speech>

He quoted rapidly increasing rental figures.  We responded to it in legislation and with the new rental strategy in December.  There was a problem and we are responding to it.  He was wrong when he said a record low number of social housing units was delivered last year.  That is not right.  There was a significant increase on the previous year.  I am interested in getting people who need homes into a secure tenancy or a home while we ramp up construction capacity in delivering thousands of projects throughout the country.</p></speech>

I asked the T&aacute;naiste earlier about the progress on the regulatory framework and at what stage the Bill associated with approved housing bodies is.  For the Minister to be happy, perhaps he could clarify his position on the capacity of approved housing bodies to deal with their responsibilities in contributing towards the provision of social housing.  Will the Minister please elaborate on this?</p></reply>

There are 546 approved housing bodies, AHBs, in Ireland, ranging from small voluntary-led, community-based organisations to large-scale national organisations.  Together these bodies provide in excess of 30,000 social homes.  It is estimated that AHBs have the capacity to contribute around a third of the 47,000 new social housing units that are targeted over the period to 2021 using a range of delivery methods.  To support this, almost &euro;1 billion of capital funding has been secured in order that AHBs can build and acquire new social housing units.  This funding will be made available over the lifetime of the action plan through my Department&rsquo;s capital assistance scheme and the capital advance leasing facility.  In addition, a further sum amounting to almost &euro;1 billion in current funding under the social housing current expenditure programme has been secured for the cost of payment and availability agreements and leases over the lifetime of the action plan.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to supporting the AHB sector to play a central role in the effort to meet social housing needs, in conjunction with local housing authorities.  I stress to all the councillors, when we meet them, that we want that relationship between them and approved housing bodies to be strengthened.  Councillors feel that they want to be closer to the AHBs, and we would agree with that.</p>  <p>  The significant funding being provided for new housing delivery will enable AHBs to increase their revenue flows, including from rent, allowing them to enhance their staffing capacity.  Other commitments in Rebuilding Ireland aimed at supporting the sector include the establishment of an innovation fund to support the development by AHBs of innovative financial models, such as special purpose vehicles or mutual bodies.  We will also bring forward legislation in the coming months to provide for a statutory regulator to oversee the effective governance and financial management of AHBs.  This issue has been raised today and we are working very hard on it.  It is hoped that will be achieved in the next couple of months.</p>  <p>  One of the committed actions of the Strategy for the Rental Sector, published in December, is the establishment an expert group to support the development of a not-for-profit rental sector in Ireland, addressing issues such as the need to grow the necessary institutional capacity, particularly within the AHB sector, whether through mergers, new entrants or strategic partnerships.  I am expecting that this group will report by the end of the year.</p></reply>

Approved housing bodies are provided for within Rebuilding Ireland and, along with local authorities and the private sector, can have a substantial role in the delivery and construction of social housing units to meet the demand that has been placed upon the State.  I do not believe that we have explored or catered for the potential that exists for joint ventures.  I am conscious of this week's announcement of the venture between Cairn Homes and NAMA.  It is a good development and should be expanded upon by local authorities, approved housing bodies and the private sector in order for State-owned lands and local authority lands to be put to use as soon as is practicable.</p>  <p>  It has come to my attention that there are up to 500 acres in south County Dublin which is zoned for residential use and is serviced but is not in use.  There is no potential for this land to be put to use in the short to medium term.  As the Minister said earlier, the effort and the commitment exist but there appear to be logjams.  We need to identify those logjams as quickly as humanly possible with the special delivery units in local authorities in order that we can provide for opening those logjams.  If we need legislation, then let us hear about it and pass it.  Let us assure the public that this can be dealt with in the short term as well and the medium to long term.</p></speech>

Our key planning personnel and the housing delivery team in the Department are looking at all those sites.  They look, site by site, at Dublin, Cork and other towns and cities to see how we can activate these sites.  They are bringing the various players together and are identifying so-called pathfinder sites.  We are actively asking.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, and I have told local authorities that this is what we want to see happening: public and private sites brought together in co-operation.  This could be local authorities working with the private sector or with approved housing bodies to bring forward sites that can deliver the mixed tenure that Deputy Coppinger spoke of earlier.  That is what we want to achieve.  There is great potential and the funding is in place.  We have provided other funding to activate these sites with regard to infrastructure.</p>  <p>  The potential exists and we are doing a lot of work to co-ordinate this at departmental level.  We will see results because there is great potential to deliver thousands of houses on many of the lands that have been identified.  The Deputy is right to say the key is to try to activate lands that are available by bringing all the players together, including NAMA and others.  I am glad the activity of AHBs - their loan approval and drawdown - has been greatly increased in 2016 compared with 2015, and we expect a similar result in 2017 also.  We want to activate all the different measures and, ideally, bring in other resources that are off balance sheet, which is what we are trying to do.</p></speech>

I sought information from many local authorities and I would hope to have it soon.  I asked if they could definitively lay out to us with regard to their efforts to seek expressions of interest how many proposals were put before them, how many were accepted, how many were refused and why they were refused.  This is in order for the Minister and his Department to adjudicate properly and effectively on that process.  It would help us to find out where they have moved since and why they have not moved any further.  It would create an opportunity to provide us with the tools to break down these obvious logjams.</p>  <p>  I said earlier today that Rebuilding Ireland was produced with the best of intent and with a wide-ranging consultation process with all stakeholders and with the committee here with a view to addressing the issue once and for all.  Unfortunately, however, in the actual implementation of it, we are falling down in getting from the expressions of interest to building on the ground.  The Government has said that 8,500 social housing units are under construction, but the Minister of State and I both know that there are certain schemes within that figure that are two years in the making and they still have not broken any ground on site.  That is why we need to find a way of addressing that.  People may get behind us.</p></speech>

We have reduced the timing a lot in that regard.  Our people are available to have meetings in the offices of the local authorities as often as they want to drive projects on.  In all cases they have cut those timelines.  Some of the projects that were hanging around for years have now been moved on, and rightly so.  We have a view of them now.</p><p>Even the publication last week of that list means everybody can track them, including every local authority and every local authority member, who we stress need to take a more active role in tracking this.  They can ask the questions, push it through and, it is hoped, get these sites delivered more quickly, which is what we are trying to do.  There is a large site in south Dublin which has been progressing quite well under the new initiative and the results have been positive.</p> <p> I am aware of the statistics from the local authorities that have put out expressions of interest.  We try to give them advice on how to advertise for that.  I am disappointed with the number coming back in from the private sector as I would have thought there was a lot more potential.  However, anywhere we see potential we will try to work with the local authorities, and the departmental staff are there to try to move these things along as quickly as possible.  That is our commitment under the action plan for housing, namely, to make it happen a lot more quickly and to cut through those timelines.  It can happen because the resources and finances are available and it is now a question of activating the sites.</p> <p> Local authorities have to drive this.  We have asked them to do it and we have met them individually to make it happen.  While I believe it will, it is at an early stage in the process and some of them have advertised only recently.  I know the Minister, Deputy Coveney, wants to add his own view.</p></speech>

The National Oversight and Audit Commission's private rental sector review of 2014 showed that six local authorities reported 100% failure rates in regard to minimum standards of inspected private rental properties.  Wexford's failure rate was 83.1%, yet Wexford County Council informs us that its inspections are reactive only as it does not have the resources for proactive inspections.  Will the Minister consider doing something about this?</p></reply>

A key commitment in the strategy was to review the regulations governing minimum standards in rented accommodation to bring them into line with modern requirements.  That review has been completed and, on 27 January, I signed the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2017.  These new regulations will come into operation generally on 1 July 2017, replacing the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2008 and the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) (Amendment) Regulations 2009.</p>  <p>  All landlords have a legal obligation to ensure their rented properties comply with the regulations.  Responsibility for enforcement of the regulations rests with the relevant local authority.  The findings and recommendations of the National Oversight and Audit Commission&rsquo;s report, Rented Houses Inspections - A Review of Local Authority Performance of Private Rented Houses Regulations Functions, were carefully considered in the development of the strategy and have informed the actions put forward.  The inspection capacity of local authorities will be strengthened to increase the number and frequency of inspections.  In addition to the updated regulations, procedures for a more efficient, standardised and transparent inspections and enforcement approach across all local authority areas will be introduced.  Specific ring-fenced funding for inspections will be provided from 2018 onwards, with the aim of achieving a 25% annual inspection coverage of rental properties by 2021.</p>  <p>  There is an acceptance that there is a problem that needs to be resolved.  Different local authorities have very different levels of performance in terms of enforcing standards and inspections.  We are putting funding in place to try to correct that.</p></speech>

To highlight the problem, I note that in 2013, Wexford County Council inspected 1,075 private rented properties, but in 2015, it was 240 properties, and in 2016, it was 201.  It just does not have the staff.  There is a problem in regard to exactly who is going to inspect the properties, whether they are qualified or trained, and what they are trained in.  It is a big area.  The quality of a person's house has a lot to do with the quality of their life.  The Government wants to promote the private rental sector, which is fine, but it does very little about quality.  While changes are coming, will they be enough and will local authorities be given enough money to enable to them to carry out the inspections properly and introduce a really transparent system?  If a place is inspected and recommendations are made but the landlord does not make the required changes, there is no follow-up.  Will that be addressed as well?</p></speech>

We cannot simply ramp up the level of inspections overnight because, as the Deputy said, in some local authorities either the systems or the staff simply are not in place.  We are trying to put a realistic timeframe in place whereby we can put systems, people and management in place to make sure we get gradually improving figures year on year in order that, by 2021, each local authority will be meeting the target of inspecting one quarter of the rental properties in its area in a year.  We are a long way from that now.  The averages are in the low single figures in most local authority areas so we need to ramp up capacity.  There is a whole series of areas where we currently have a ramping up of capacity in terms of construction, the planning system and the engineering capacity within local authorities because a lot more money is being spent now than was the case until a few years ago.  This is part of the wider process.  The regulations are now in place and we will put the management systems in place to enforce them.</p></speech>

I keep saying we have powerful regulation for building in Ireland but we do not enforce it.  The lack of enforcement is killing us and is having a big impact on the quality of the units that are delivered.</p>  <p>  The Minister referred to the different supply but I believe he is missing the point.  He is talking about the short term and he said it is impossible to build social houses overnight.  However, in the long term we should be looking at having more of the social housing stock built by local authorities.</p>  <p>  The Minister spoke about the three areas of social, private and affordable rental.  What about affordable private?  Getting NAMA to do deals with Cairn Homes, Hines and those fellows means we are looking at units coming in at more than &euro;300,000.  With affordable private, where the State is involved directly, they will be supplied at &euro;200,000 per unit on State land.  I do not understand why the Government does not take that on board and move in that direction.</p></speech>

If they make sense, we will try to incorporate them into the housing plan.  That is why we are looking at affordable rental models in Dublin at the moment, and we will do it in other parts of the country as well if it makes sense.  We have to do it case by case and it is not a question of opening up a new category that would be demand led because we do not have funding approval for that.  We will look to create affordable rental developments, especially around build-to-rent developments in the centre of Dublin city.  We need to create affordable accommodation options for people who otherwise have to live as far away as Portlaoise and commute to Dublin every day, which does not make sense on many levels.  If the Deputy has any suggestions, we will be happy to take them on board.</p></speech>

In too many instances we hear from constituents who were on the housing list but who were taken off it when they went back to work.  The eligibility band for the Cavan-Monaghan area is the lowest in the country and it needs to be improved.  We are penalising people who are working.</p></reply>

The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs plus a comparative analysis of the local rent cost of housing accommodation across the country.  The limits also reflect a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn and thereby promote sustainable communities.</p>  <p>  Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support.  I am satisfied that the current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this.  They provide for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households unable to provide accommodation from their own resources.  These income limits will continue to be kept under review by my Department as part of the broader social housing reform agenda set out in the Social Housing Strategy 2020.</p></speech>

I recently brought a young couple to my local authority.  The young man is an apprentice while his partner is, unfortunately, out of work and receiving a jobseeker's payment.  The couple have a child.  They are not eligible for a council house.  We are talking about being prudent and fair.  Is it prudent and fair that the council does not have discretion when it comes to this couple who are slightly above the income limit?  I understand that.  This is in an area like Cavan-Monaghan.  Anybody who is fortunate enough to return to the labour force is being penalised.  We need a mix of people in different social housing schemes.  The Minister spoke about sustainable communities.  We all want to see that but the income limits that are being applied make it impossible for many people on low incomes to qualify for local authority housing.  We need to change that.</p></speech>

If they are not qualifying, I would like to see the detail of that.  I am not saying I do not believe the Deputy.  Of course, I believe him but that does not seem to be the target market we are looking to try to support here.  People on low incomes who are making the effort to get out and work need to be supported by the State in terms of their housing needs just like people on social welfare who are either unable to work or cannot find employment.  We will review income thresholds but we cannot review them on the basis of individual counties.  There must be a standardised process.  Otherwise it becomes a political exercise, which is dangerous.</p></speech>

In many cases, their children must go to school in the area where they used to live.  There was an announcement on 19 July 2016 that they would get free travel to and from school, which was very welcome.  I raised the matter in October and was told it would be a few weeks.  I raised it in December and I was told that it was to be in the new year.  I hope the Minister will have positive news and that this free travel is now available to those families.</p></reply>

I recognise that transport costs can be an additional burden upon homeless families residing in hotel accommodation in lieu of an alternative form of emergency accommodation.  Accordingly, the Rebuilding Ireland action plan on housing and Homelessness outlined an initiative to provide access to free public transport for family travel and for school journeys.  The initiative is being targeted at homeless families residing in hotel accommodation in the Dublin region.  The Dublin Region Homeless Executive, DRHE, is overseeing the arrangements.  Five separate 24-hour family Leap cards were made available to all homeless families residing in hotels in the Dublin region during 2016.  These cards were to facilitate family days out and were valid for use on all Dublin transport systems.  Over 500 families availed of this support.</p>  <p>  With regard to free public transport for school journeys, I understand from the DRHE that it has finalised arrangements with the National Transport Authority to provide for Leap cards specifically tailored for this initiative.  An order has been placed for their delivery and distribution will commence by the end of this month with Focus Ireland facilitating the distribution via its family homeless action teams.  In the interim, a number of families have been accessing the Department of Social Protection's general scheme of exceptional needs payments relating to financial support for travel.  The arrangements are now in place and the cards will be going out to families.</p></speech>

I am glad the Minister is not saying it.  I know the Minister is probably tired of hearing this but the dependence on the private rental sector to provide homes to people in the long term is not as good a proposition as local authority-built social housing.  The truth is that more and more people will need social housing because they will not be able to afford private housing.  To expand on my point about affordable private housing, we have State land.  Local authorities can provide housing for &euro;200,000 and sell it to people at that price rather than asking NAMA to do deals with developers to sell it for &euro;300,000.  I do not understand why the Government will not do that.</p></speech>

There are 91,000 people on housing lists across the country.  We cannot simply build 91,000 social houses.  We are building as many social houses as we can build at a pace that is increasing significantly relative to recent years.  A total of 8,500 social houses at various different stages to be constructed have been approved.  In the meantime, we need to provide at least 21,000 social housing solutions this year.  Part of those numbers will be HAP tenancies which, for the most part, are five or ten-year tenancies that provide suitable accommodation that is far more secure than rent supplement would have been in the past or some other alternative accommodation.  Not everybody wants or is looking for a social house.  Some people are looking for it while others are not.  It depends on their conditions, where they are working and how long they are going to stay there so the mix will always involve the private rental market.  I concede that there has been a over-reliance on the private rental market in the past and we need to increase our social housing stock significantly but you cannot do everything overnight.  While we will increase our social housing stock by around 50,000 over the next five years, we need to provide many of the housing solutions that require State intervention through initiatives like the HAP.</p></speech>

It takes a good deal of traffic.  Two issues arise.  One relates to road safety.  I believe the issues are common to all these counties.  The other issue relates to the efficiency of the road as a national route.  This particularly relates to my constituency of Meath East.</p> <p> The issue of safety is the first and foremost priority.  Six people have died on this road since the new year.  It is an extremely dangerous road.  The road is well known for accidents in Louth and Monaghan.  Frankly, accidents could happen on any stretch of this road because of the nature of the road.  It is extraordinarily busy.  In parts there are houses on it, while elsewhere there are bus stops that are unlit.  There should be a full safety review of the road.  In some cases people have died unnecessarily because of road safety issues.  There have been other accidents that have not hit the headlines.  There have been several occasions when the N2 has been closed for reasons that have not resulted in fatal accidents.  This really needs to be looked at.  It is incumbent on the Minister and Transport Infrastructure Ireland to look at this closely.</p> <p> When I refer to road safety on the N2, I cannot omit the Slane bypass, which is also relevant for the efficiency of the road.  I urge the Minister to get the Slane bypass on the agenda and to ensure it is built.  There has been some progress, there is no doubt about that, but we are five years on from a negative planning decision on the Slane bypass and we are only starting to get back on track in this regard.  Five years is almost a lifetime in political terms.  We need to make urgent progress.</p> <p> The safety issues at Slane are, in reality, far more severe than the rest of the N2 in terms of the danger and the risk to road users and pedestrians.  I cross the road in Slane at the traffic lights on a regular basis - there are many traffic lights in Slane.  I am afraid of my life every time I cross the road, even using the pedestrian crossing properly - I certainly would not take a chance elsewhere.  It is the same for all the residents of Slane and for anyone driving through the town.</p> <p> The efficiency of the N2 as a national route is another issue.  This road south of Slane is becoming completely inefficient and is not serving its purported function as a national route.  There are major traffic delays on the road every morning, especially from the Kilmoon Cross area towards Primatestown on to Ashbourne and on to the Ashbourne bypass, which is a fabulous tranche of infrastructure that has solved the problem at Ashbourne.  Commuters are delayed on this stretch unnecessarily because the road is simply not fit for purpose and because of traffic lights installed at Primatestown.  They were put in place for essential safety reasons but I believe other solutions could be explored that would marry the obvious priority of safety with the ability of road users actually to use the road in a functional way.</p> <p> We face difficulties not only for commuters in terms of the efficiency of the road but also for residents and road users on side roads.  The Garristown area is between Duleek and Ashbourne.  The road there is coming under pressure, especially between Ashbourne and Curragha and Kilmoon Cross.  That road is coming under tremendous pressure because of people avoiding the N2 on account of its inefficiency.  This, in turn, is putting pressure not only on local residents but on the council budget as well.  It is a serious threat to road safety on those roads.</p> <p> I look forward to the Minster's response on the N2 road.</p></speech>

I am happy to reiterate the points I made at that debate.</p>  <p>  As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I have responsibility for overall policy and funding relating to the national roads programme.  The planning, design and implementation of individual road projects, such as the N2, is a matter for Transport Infrastructure Ireland under the Roads Acts 1993-2015 in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.  Within its capital budget, the assessment and prioritisation of individual projects is a matter in the first instance for TIl in accordance with section 19 of the Roads Act.</p>  <p>  The Government's capital investment plan, Building on Recovery - Infrastructure and Capital Investment, provides the strategic and financial framework for the TII national roads programme for the period from 2016 to 2022.  As Minister, I have to work within the capital budgets included in the plan and TIl, in turn, has to prioritise works on the basis of the funding available to it.</p>  <p>  TII allocates funding specifically for safety works based on its analysis of the network, including the N2.  This year TIl has allocated approximately &euro;17 million for such works.  Under its HD15 programme, safety works are based on an analysis of accident density across the network and those sections of the network with considerably higher than average accident densities are selected for analysis.  Sections of road which are amenable to engineering solutions are prioritised for treatment.  In addition, TIl operates a HD17 programme based on road safety inspection reports.  These reports indicate which issues, for example signing, lining or safety barriers, need to be addressed on different sections of road and programmes are drawn up to deal with the priority issues.</p>  <p>  Good pavements also contribute to road safety and TII has allocated approximately &euro;50 million for pavements in 2017.  In the context of the TII programmes, road pavement overlay and safety schemes were completed on the N2 in 2016, including sections of the route at Balrenny to Knockmooney in County Meath and Emyvale village in County Monaghan.  Safety works at Blakestown Cross in County Louth have recently been completed.  Within the funding available to the organisation, I understand TII is also hoping to progress minor road improvement schemes on the N2 during the period of the capital plan.  These schemes involve the realignment or widening of the existing single carriageway road and include the N2 Monaghan to Emyvale improvement phase 3 scheme, where land acquisition and finalisation of tender documentation is ongoing.</p>  <p>  TIl has also advised that Monaghan County Council appointed consultants last year to review the safety aspects of the existing N2 between Ardee and Monaghan.  This report identified short and long-term measures that could be implemented along the route.  The findings of this review are currently being considered by Monaghan County Council.  I imagine they should now be considered as a matter of urgency.</p>  <p>  As regards major schemes, the proposed N2 Slane bypass has been included in the capital plan among those schemes planned to commence during the plan period.  Funding totalling &euro;1.2 million has been provided by TIl in 2017 to prepare a new design for the scheme.</p></speech>

I am keen to see a whole-of-road approach in respect of the N2.  The whole road should be taken together in terms of what reports and studies are undertaken.  This has been the problem.  We have seen piecemeal works that are very good in themselves but we are not looking at the overall problem.</p>  <p>  I do not mean to be parochial but Blakestown Cross is used by people from all three counties, that is to say, drivers from Monaghan, Meath and Louth, where the cross is located.  Shortly after the works were finished at the cross two ladies were killed near where the works took place.  When those works were done, I was so grateful.  I thought to myself that it was so safe.  Often, I come in the direction from Drumconrath, Meath Hill and Kingscourt in Deputy Smith's constituency - I imagine he is familiar with that cross as well.  It is such an improvement.  However, the point is that further down the road, within sight of those works, two ladies lost their lives.  Unfortunately, this is going to continue unless we take whole-of-road approach and review the whole thing, including the examination of safety issues.</p>  <p>  I urge the Minister to get TII to examine the matter and to examine the efficiency issues, especially in County Meath.  The fact is that traffic is building up seriously on this road.  It is a small road.  It is not built for the volume of traffic that passes along it.  There must be some way of making small improvements, especially at Primatestown Cross in County Meath, to protect people and to allow them to cross.  The lights should be changed and some other system put in place, possibly a roundabout, to allow traffic to move.  This is a major problem for my constituents and for the constituents of Deputy Smith who use the road.</p>  <p>  I thank the Minister for outlining what is being done.  I am not arguing or fighting with the Minster.  I am outlining the facts as I see them.  I urge the Minister to take a handle on this road and to treat it as one in all three counties, or four counties if we include Dublin, that it goes through, to ensure it is safe and to ensure that it works as a national road.</p></speech>

I have addressed that already.  It is a matter for TII, although it can feature in the mid-term capital review.  Obviously, the Deputy will make a submission and I will make certain recommendations to it as well.  He must understand, and I am not in any sense denigrating what he or anybody else has said, that the competing pressures on the roads, even in cases where compelling arguments exist, make it very difficult to allocate funds between them.  As far as I am concerned, the case the Deputy made is very good in terms of the road being necessary for all sorts of improvements but the case for safety is a priority.

I consider road safety more important in some respects than the condition of the roads.  If there is a case to be made where there is evidence of fatalities on a road and there are identifiable black spots, it is something we will have to consider a top priority when we are examining the allocation of money for roads.  I will give the road in question consideration in that light.  I am aware of other roads around the country which have black spots that also deserve priority.  We are talking about human life here, as against anything else, and obviously it must be top of the list.</p></speech>

I am glad the Minister is here to respond.  In my observation of the proceedings of the House, he is very amenable to taking Topical Issue debates that relate to his portfolio.  That is commendable, particularly as it is not a practice that is always followed.</p>  <p>  The Minister and I discussed this subject during a previous Question Time.  I commend Deputy Byrne on raising the subject of safety on the N2.  A large part of my constituency is served by the N2 as well and, unfortunately, I knew some of the people who lost their lives on that road in recent times.  It is most regrettable.  Our colleague, Senator Robbie Gallagher, also had a Commencement Matter debate in the Seanad on the need to upgrade the road from Clontibret to the Border in the context of the A5 development, which is critical for all-island development and particularly for the Border economy.  I wholeheartedly support Deputy Thomas Byrne's request regarding the N2.</p>  <p>  In the early 2000s a strategic study was carried out on the development of an east-west route from Sligo to Dundalk.  The chosen route from Sligo went through Manorhamilton, Enniskillen, Cavan town, Cootehill, Shercock and Carrickmacross to Dundalk.  Thankfully, parts of that route have been upgraded with the building of the Cavan and Belturbet bypasses.  Substantial funding was invested in those projects and they turned out extremely well.  The road that requires particular attention at present is the one from Cootehill through Shercock and Carrickmacross to Dundalk.  Fortunately, that road carries a large volume of heavy goods vehicles.  We welcome the employment in that area.  There are some major agrifood enterprises there, such as Lakeland Dairies in Bailieborough, Carton Brothers &amp;amp; Manor Farm poultry in Shercock and Abbott in Cootehill, as well as a number of engineering companies in those towns.  They are exporting their products and many of them must get to Greenore, Warrenpoint, Dublin Airport or Dublin Port.  If, however, one is behind a lorry when one leaves Cootehill to travel that route, one will not get past it until one is outside Dundalk, as there is a huge volume of traffic on the road.</p>  <p>  We welcome that, but there is an additional cost on enterprises in that area because of the slow movement of goods and the delays that occur.  The local chamber of commerce in Cootehill and the county councils in Cavan, Monaghan and Louth are strongly of the view that the route must be upgraded.  I told the Minister previously that if enterprises in the Border region are to have any chance of remaining competitive in the context of Brexit and so forth the infrastructure must be upgraded.  There is a huge concentration of agrifood industries in the Cavan-Monaghan area.  Their major export market is the sterling area, so they are already hit with competitive challenges.  The one way the State can support existing enterprises, and hope to be able to assist them to grow and create employment, is by ensuring it listens to them and upgrades infrastructure such as the road network.  There are huge demands on the Minister's Department and TII but, in the context of what we face, we must re-prioritise capital spending for the Border regions, which are already being affected by Brexit.  They do not have to wait until Britain leaves the EU.  I see it and I listen to business people in my area, so I am aware of how the uncertainty that has been generated has kicked in as a negative economic ingredient.</p>  <p>  The Acting Chairman, Deputy Durkan, and I spent most of today at meetings with members of the House of Commons committee on exiting the European Union and a delegation from the German Bundestag.  We are aware of the challenges.  The one thing the Oireachtas and the Government can do is deal with the areas within their own competence, such as upgrading infrastructure in those areas.</p></speech>

The consistency with which he has raised issues relating to the Border area indicates that whatever Members on the opposite side of House say about the Government, the Deputy is readying people for Brexit and is warning realistically about the dangers for the Border area and the need for infrastructure there.  I cannot say how many times he has raised the issue.  He is not only consistent in doing so, he is also right to do it in light of current circumstances.  The Deputy raised the matter with me most recently on I February during the debate on the Private Members' motion on roads funding and again at Question Time on 8 February.  While the position regarding the east-west route remains as I outlined in my reply to him of 8 February, I am happy to address it again today.</p>  <p>  Proposals to deliver an upgraded route linking Dundalk to Sligo were being examined before the financial crisis.  This would involve linking elements of the national road network and regional roads along as direct a route as possible.  Essentially, the scheme would involve upgrade or realignment works on the regional routes from Dundalk to Cavan and on national routes from Cavan to Sligo.  The latter would involve a route that passes through Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  With regard to the national element, as Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I have responsibility for overall policy and funding relating to the national roads programme.  The planning, design and implementation of individual national road projects is a matter for Transport Infrastructure Ireland under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2015 in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.  As regards the regional road aspect of the proposal, the improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads in its area is a statutory function of local authorities in accordance with the provisions of section 13 of the Roads Act 1993.  Works on such roads are a matter for the relevant local authority to be funded from its own resources supplemented by State road grants.</p>  <p>  While the recession resulted in major cutbacks in funding and the curtailment of road improvement projects across the country, my Department provided funding of over &euro;2 million to Cavan County Council, acting as lead authority, in the period 2007 to 2014 to progress the regional road element of the project to preliminary design.  It was not possible to take the scheme any further.  The seven-year transport element of the capital plan published in September 2015 includes provision for expenditure of &euro;6 billion on the road network.  In line with the findings of my Department&rsquo;s strategic framework for investment in land transport, &euro;4.4 billion of this funding is earmarked for essential maintenance and strengthening works on the road network.  A further &euro;600 million relates to public private partnership projects and the balance is for investment in a limited number of road improvement projects.  The overall funding envelope meant that it was not possible to include a range of projects in the plan.</p><p>At an estimated cost of &euro;150 million, the East Link was one of those projects.  While there is no provision in the capital plan for the east-west scheme, it is open to individual local authorities to progress the upgrade of sections of the route from their own resources.</p> <p> On the capital plan review, while there is a strong case for additional funding for the transport sector, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has indicated that the total unallocated capital is about &euro;2.6 billion.  In contrast, in the transport sector alone, there are a multitude of possible national, regional and local projects around the country, the cost of which far exceed available funding.  Unfortunately, this means that only a limited number can be put forward for consideration.  I cannot therefore give any commitment at this time on projects along the route of the east-west link.  By the end of the capital plan period, however, capital funding for the road network is expected to be back up to the levels needed to support maintenance and improvement works.  At that stage, there may be more scope to consider projects along the route of the east-west link on a phased basis.</p></speech>

It is the one competence we have in addressing Brexit.  We will not find it until the next capital plan post-2020 and I appeal to the Minister to try to ensure that sections of the project are included.  The section that I am most concerned about at present is the Cootehill-Shercock-Carrickmacross-Dundalk element of the overall route.  Other parts of it also need upgrading.  Other parts are up to good standard.</p>  <p>  The Minister might also pursue with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform the possible availability of cohesion funding post-2020.  The current round of Structural Funds, to my knowledge, ends in 2020.  I understand there may be scope for us to seek cohesion funding.  Back in the late 1990s or early 2000s, I remember many vexed debates in this House about Objective One status for different parts of the country and the division of the country as such.  Thankfully, with economic development, we lost and were beyond the criteria to draw down cohesion funding.  A case should be made post-2020, with Brexit and the unfortunate challenges and adverse impacts it will have on the Border economy in particular, that as a State we should seek access to cohesion funding again with a view to upgrading the infrastructure in the area that is and will be most adversely affected by the impact of Brexit.</p>  <p>  I sincerely hope the Minister will try to pursue a number of aspects of advancing this project with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  We need to support existing enterprise in the Border region and we need to support those enterprises that will hopefully be able to expand.  Currently, currency devaluation, the fluctuation of sterling and all of that poses particular difficulties for them, and again we have a huge focus on indigenous industry.  Indigenous manufacturing products generally go to our nearest market.  Manufacturers in the indigenous sector, such as agri-food, are very dependent, though not solely, on the sterling area for export.</p></speech>

I do not know the answer to his question about the Cohesion Funds but I will undertake to pursue it with my colleague at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to see if that is available.  The Deputy is talking about after 2020.  I see no reason why we should not look at that possibility.  I do not know whether it will be so.  I appreciate the case the Deputy made and that he is a strong advocate for the funding need for the Border for infrastructure and Brexit.  I will bear that in mind and inform Transport Infrastructure Ireland and local authorities of the views he put before the House.  I will refer back to him on the issue of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p></speech>

Currently, Lucan community college is included in the Department of Education and Skills construction programme 2012 to 2016.  The extension has been blighted by delays over the last ten years.  There are many young people in Lucan.  It has a large, growing school population.  There is temporary accommodation on the campus currently to accommodate the overflow of students.  I understand, because I got a lot of correspondence in the last week about this, that it is at stage 2A of the architectural planning process.  That target was meant to be for completion of the extension in 2018.  Now that is not going to be met.  They have said that this needs to go to stage 2B, which could have the completion date of September 2019.  That is still a long time away.  Even that could run into difficulty.</p>  <p>  I am trying to get clarity as to whether this could be fast-tracked or if clarity could be given to the college and the parents of students in the vicinity, because there is a huge need for this college.  The college is about 30 years old.  It needs to be updated.  I ask the Minister to give clarity on when this can be finalised and completed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-02-23a.506" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="18:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017022300043#QQ00600"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising this.  He is right.  This has had a considerable history and I can understand how people might get confused at the development.  I will set it out for the Deputy as clearly as I can.</p>  <p>  Lucan community college caters for both boys and girls and operates under the patronage of the Dublin and D&uacute;n Laoghaire Education and Training Board, ETB.  The college has been in operation since 1987.  Enrolment in the college for 2015-16 was 875 pupils, a 5% increase over the previous five years.  Temporary accommodation has been installed on-site to cater for the increased enrolments in the school.</p>  <p>  The brief for this project of an extension and refurbishment to the permanent modern accommodation is to cater for 1,000 pupils and a classroom special needs unit on the existing school site.  The original design team for the project was appointed in June 2011 on a more restricted brief for an extension to the existing school.  This project reached completion of stage 1, architectural planning, in April 2013.  As part of that work and following an assessment of the current accommodation, it was agreed by the Department that extensive additional refurbishment works to the existing school would also be required.  The Department approved a significant increase in the scope of works for the project to incorporate those refurbishment works.  However, directly arising from this very significant expansion in the scope of works, it was necessary to commence a tender exercise for the appointment of a new design team to take the project forward from that point.  This process was conducted by the ETB and was completed in October 2014.  Tendering rules require that if the value of a project increases by more than 50% a new design team tender has to take place.  The new design team was authorised to proceed to stage 2, architectural planning - developed design, in other words the detailed layout.</p>  <p>  In March 2015, officials from my Department met with the ETB and its design team about the progression of the project.  Further information was requested from the design team, including a reconciliation of areas.  This was reviewed by my Department and an increase in the size of the proposed accommodation of more than 1,000 sq. m extra was approved.  The newly appointed design team sought a further meeting with the Department to discuss the increased accommodation and to reconcile the areas.  My Department facilitated this meeting in June 2016.  The stage 2 report was submitted to the Department on 7 November 2016.</p>  <p>  Following the stage 2 stakeholders' meeting, which was held on 30 November 2016, the ETB and its design team were requested to submit a stage 2 addendum addressing issues which arose at that meeting.  This addendum was submitted by the ETB on 22 December and my Department commenced its review of the report in early January 2017.</p><p>Once that review is complete my Department will revert to the ETB with regard to the further progression of the project.</p> <p> Upon successful completion of stage 2A the project will progress to complete stage 2B, detailed design, which involves obtaining planning permission, fire certificate and disability access certificate, and the completion of tender documents.  Following completion of stage 2B the project will then be progressed to tender and construction stages.</p></speech>

Can the Minister give a completion date to try to decipher this?  These things can go forever.  Can the Minister give a completion date saying that it should be completed by September 2019?  Obviously, the correspondence I got from some of the parents asked if the completion of stage 2A could be expedited with approval to stage 2B granted as a matter of urgency.  I do not know if the Minister addressed that in the reply.</p>  <p>  Basically the students and parents are looking for a completion date that the school can plan for.  I do not know if the Minister can supply that.  I know these are technical things.  This seems to have really dragged on to a point where figures can be a bit elusive.  I ask for some sort of completion date.</p></speech>

It is expected that by the end of March to mid-April the Department will have completed its review of the stage 2A documents.  However, as the reply explains, it then has to submit a planning application, get planning permission, a fire certificate and a disability access certificate, and complete tender documents.  I cannot indicate how long it will take to get planning permission, whether there will be snags or appeals.  All those things could lead to delays.  If the local authority imposed a planning requirement that had not been anticipated in the design, it would have to be reviewed.</p>  <p>  I cannot give an accurate estimate of how long that would take.  Obviously, if it gets through stage 2B, it is then in a position to commence tendering which is a whole process in itself after which it goes to construction.  Unfortunately, as I know from experience, there can be delays in a project like this at any of those points, including at planning stage.  There can also be issues with tender documents.  I cannot give a clear line of sight.</p>  <p>  We are building schools providing 20,000 new school places every year.  We try to ensure we prioritise our work so that we have a continuous flow.  No shilling ever gets unspent in our Department.  We always have projects like this.  As it gets through we will be in a position to prioritise it for funding.  It is a supply line and I do not control the speed with which the supply moves along.  I can fully understand the Deputy's concern.  As I outlined in the earlier reply, the history has been a chequered one.  People have been frustrated and have had to make adaptations and changes.  It leads to the sort of correspondence the Deputy has received.</p></speech>

Last year, 2016, was a record year for the demolition and confiscation of Palestinian dwellings and livelihood structures in the Occupied West Bank by the Israeli army.  Figures from the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and EAPPI, the Ecumenical Accompaniment Programme in Palestine and Israel, show that 1,089 structures were demolished or confiscated in 2016, leaving some 1,600 Palestinians displaced and affecting the livelihoods of a further 7,100 people.  This was the highest annual figure since formal recording began and represented a 96% increase on the 2015 total.  The figures for 2017 so far indicate we are heading to have another record year for demolitions.</p>  <p>  On Sunday it was widely reported in the Israeli press that 42 homes and businesses were served with demolition orders by the Israeli army.  These demolitions, once carried out, would in effect destroy the entire village.  Such a widespread issuance of demolitions orders at one time in one village is not only unprecedented but a clear declaration by the Israeli military that it plans to remove the entire community.  That is what this whole community is facing.  While it is correct to say that many of the structures have been built in violation of the planning laws of the Israeli military, this ignores the fact that these planning laws are unfair, unjust and apartheid-Iike in their makeup.  They are also superseded by international law, which bans such actions.  Under Article 46, the destruction of such property is in grave contravention of the Fourth Geneva Convention.</p>  <p>  This is an unprecedented issuing of demolition orders in this village and it is a very rare occurrence for the Israeli military to issue so many demolition orders at once.  If these demolitions take place they will leave hundreds of men, women and children homeless.  Such actions would also constitute a grave breach of the of the Fourth Geneva Convention, which prohibits the destruction of personal property by an occupying power unless it is rendered absolutely necessary by military operations.  It also prohibits all forcible transfers of civilian populations by an occupying power.  What they are doing here is wrong under international law.</p>  <p>  Israel has avoided large-scale evacuation of Palestinians in Area C in the past, partly because of the protests by European and American diplomats.  I am asking the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to make urgent representation to the Israeli Government to reverse these demolition orders.</p></speech>

The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade asked me to send his apologies and reply on his behalf.  He is very keen to get a full account of the issues the Deputy has raised.</p><p>The Bedouin community of Khan al-Ahmar, to the east of Jerusalem, has been subject to demolition and removal orders for many years.  Some houses and other structures have been demolished on a number of occasions.  International donors, including the UN OCHA humanitarian fund to which Ireland contributes, have provided humanitarian assistance to replace demolished structures, including water facilities and latrines.  Particular attention has been focused on the school, constructed out of tyres plastered with mud, which currently serves five local communities, and has 169 pupils.</p><p>However, concern has been heightened in recent days by the issue of a series of new stop-work orders relating to the village structures, and by the imposition of a military lockdown on the community and heavy military presence, giving rise to fears that a major demolition action may be planned.  Irrespective of whether this is intended, the object clearly is to increase pressure on the residents to move from the area.</p><p>There has been a strong international response to this threat, in which Ireland has taken an active part.  In October 2016 the Irish and other EU heads of mission in Palestine visited Khan al-Ahmar to see the situation, demonstrate support and show that the actions of the authorities there were being scrutinised.  In response to the recent increased threat, there have been strong statements on the case from the relevant UN agencies on the ground and from the EU representative.</p><p>The Irish ambassador in Israel has made a <i>d&eacute;marche</i>at a senior level in the Israeli Foreign Ministry, drawing attention to the threats and expressing the strong concerns of the Government over the threats of demolitions, contrary to international law.</p><p>The Irish representative in Ramallah will be joining other EU heads of mission in a further visit to the community in the next few days.  More broadly, Ireland also supports a range of Israeli and Palestinian NGOs that are active in combating human rights and justice issues arising from the occupation.  The Minister, Deputy Flanagan, has also recently decided that Ireland should join the West Bank Protection Consortium which is made up of a network of NGOs and international donors and works with a total of 392 communities, 188 of which are at heightened risk of forcible transfer.  The consortium supports threatened communities and co-ordinates the provision of essential services including material assistance and legal aid to those at risk of forcible transfer.  Ireland has allocated &euro;200,000 to the consortium for 2017.  In the case of Khan al Ahmar, the most recent reports today suggest the threat of demolition may not be as imminent as feared.  The prompt attention to the case may have helped in this regard but we cannot be active on every case all the time.  This is the kind of uncertainty the community has to live with permanently.  Ireland's missions in the area will keep this case under very close observation.</p></speech>

International pressure, when applied collectively, has an impact and can in some case halt these demolitions.  Unfortunately, the number of demolitions is at an all-time high.  Last year, there was a 96% increase and this year it seems to be at the same scale.  It is almost as if whatever shackles the Israeli Government had have been thrown aside and it seems to be moving ahead with these proposals.  We know from our own history, the history of evictions and people being forced off their land.  It was burned into the psyche of generations of Irish people.  Similarly this is what will happen in this situation.  Visiting the village yesterday, the UN co-ordinator for humanitarian aid and development activities for the occupied Palestinian territory, Robert Piper, commented that:</p><blockquote>Khan al Ahmar is one of the most vulnerable communities in the West Bank, struggling to maintain a minimum standard of living in the face of intense pressure from the Israeli authorities ...  This is unacceptable and it must stop.</blockquote><p>The EU delegation in Jerusalem or Ramallah released a statement and I welcome that Ireland is part of it.  There was a motion passed in this House on the recognition of Palestine.  I call on the Irish Government to recognise formally the state of Palestine.  How many more international laws and human rights violations will it take before we collectively stand up for the rights of Palestinians?  How many more homes have to be demolished before the Government recognises it is time for action and time to recognise the state of Palestine?  If there is any message at all that we can send from this Parliament to those people who are suffering so badly, it is that we recognise their plight, their homeland and their right to be free.</p></speech>

I have set out the response from the Minister.  The Deputy will see the Irish representatives along with other international colleagues are very active and recognise the urgency and concern the Deputy raises.  On the wider issue of a settlement in the region, it is Ireland's view and that of the European Union that a just and comprehensive resolution to the conflict must be based on two states living side by side in peace and security.  That goal remains unchanged.</p>  <p>  The Government has also made it clear in its programme for Government that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade keeps under continual review whether the immediate recognition by Ireland of a state of Palestine prior to its real achievement on the ground could be a helpful step towards the goal of resolving the conflict.  He has made it clear he will recommend early recognition by Ireland if it would be helpful.  He is working very closely with a number of Middle East peace initiatives, both an initiative by the French and preparatory work led by Sweden.  It is in the context of those initiatives that the Minister will make a decision on this issue as is committed to in the programme for Government.</p>  <p>  I will convey the Deputy's views to the Minister and once again apologise he was not able to make it here on this occasion.  It does not in any way diminish his commitment to the issues the Deputy has raised.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-02-23a.519" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1252" speakername="John Brady" time="18:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017022300045#SS00500"><p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&quot;</p><p>Yoko Ono once said that some people are old at 18 and some are young at 90 and that time is a concept that humans created.  I will begin by thanking the individuals and organisations that have come out in support of this Bill and in support of an end to the mandatory retirement age.  They are Age Action Ireland, Active Retirement Ireland, the National Women&rsquo;s Council of Ireland and Professor John Crown, who also formally brought forward a Bill to abolish the mandatory retirement age.  I also acknowledge former Deputy Anne Ferris who brought forward this Bill in 2014.</p><p>To put this into perspective, if the rules we allow employers to set for ordinary workers were to be set in the House, how many Deputies would be sitting in the Chamber, perhaps not tonight but any other night?  Does any Deputy believe their age impacts on the job they do every day?  If the answer is no, which I am sure it is, then how can we allow age to impact on the ability of others to work?  It is very easy to make rules in here for others which do not and will not impact on people in the Chamber.  This Bill provides us with an opportunity to right this wrong and allow choices for workers.  Age does not determine whether a person can do his or her job.  This Bill is fundamentally about choice.  It is about saying to workers that if they want to, they can continue to work beyond 65 or 66 and that they can retire earlier if they wish and have the means to do so.  There are many different reasons a person may choose to continue to work beyond 65 or 66 such as financial or social reasons or simply to avoid isolation.  The question to all parties and Deputies is simple.  Should workers have a choice when it comes to their retirement?</p><p>The national positive ageing strategy published by the Government states there is evidence that longer working lives have beneficial effects on the well-being of individuals and that productivity does not necessarily decline with age.  Any decline is easily compensated by qualities and skills acquired through experience.  Since I introduced this Bill in December, I have received numerous e-mails and phone calls from many parts of the State.  I will mention one from a lady named Ann who e-mailed me about her late husband who was forced onto a jobseeker's payment after being forced to retire at 65.  She told me:</p><blockquote>My husband gladly paid taxes all his life; he should not have been forced on to Jobseekers.  My husband did not make a decision to retire; he had to retire at 65 years of age ... Not only do I have to live with the loss of my husband every day but I live with the knowledge that during my husband&rsquo;s final six months he faced the frustrations that this system imposed on him.</blockquote><p>This is the impact that mandatory retirement has had on one couple and this is only one story of many more.</p><p>The scandal of 64 year olds being forced onto a jobseeker's payment for one year as they wait for the State pension cannot be allowed continue.  That is a serious issue which came into play in 2012 and which is having a major impact on many people.  Currently, there are more 65 year olds in receipt of jobseeker's benefit than any other age group in this State.  There are 5,239 men and women aged 65 in receipt of jobseeker's payments.  Not only is that a huge problem now, it will be a bigger problem in 2021 when the pension age rises again to age 67.  It will give rise to even greater difficulties in 2028 when the pension age increases to 68.  We need to address this anomaly now and we can do so by means of this Bill.</p> <p> One of the greatest challenges facing this country is sustaining the State pension into the future.  According to the census figures for 2011, there are more than 530,000 people aged 65 and over, and just 128,000 aged 85 and over.  By the year 2046, 1.4 million people will be aged 65 and over and 470,000 will be aged 85 and over.  If we look at that from solely a financial perspective, it makes more sense for workers to continue paying into the Exchequer rather than receiving payments from it.</p> <p> Another very serious anomaly that will be addressed by the passing of this Bill is the difficulty of reaching the 520 contributions - increased from 260 - required in order to qualify for the State pension.  The huge increase to which I refer has left many people, particularly women who may have taken career breaks over their working lives in order to look after loved ones or family members, short of the necessary 520 contributions.  That is evident from the 36,000 women who have applied for the State pension since 2012 and who are in receipt of smaller amounts than would have been the case had they retired prior to that date.  By abolishing mandatory retirement we will give people an opportunity to work and build up the necessary contributions and, therefore, avoid a lesser pension payment and also avoid possible poverty in their older years.  Again, this is only a choice.</p> <p> The Minister, Deputy Varadkar, has reminded us time and again that there is no mandatory retirement in Ireland.  However, Irish law permits employers to impose mandatory retirement ages in employee contracts in both the public and private sectors.  That is the issue at the heart of this debate.  We are aware there may be some minor technical structuring issues with the Bill but having met with Department officials, we are confident that those can and will be overcome on Committee Stage by way of amendments.  We will be happy to accept all amendments because the Bill is so important.  We are big enough to accept such amendments.  The Bill includes exemptions for those in security-related employment such as the Prison Service and so on.  That reflects the position in existing equality legislation.  Current legislation states that mandatory retirement can be allowed in cases where it is objectively and reasonably justifiable, which leaves scope for a very broad interpretation by the courts.  It is for that reason that we want to see this legislation strengthened to ensure that the abolition of mandatory retirement becomes a reality.  We owe it to every worker in the State to give him or her a choice when it comes to retirement.</p> <p> We must end the facilitation of ageism and outright discrimination against workers.  This is fundamentally a human rights issue for workers and I urge all parties across the House to support this Bill.  As I have stated already, we are open to amendments.  We are not saying that the Bill is perfect; it is not.  We want to get broad support from across the Chamber and allow the Bill proceed to Committee Stage where the changes that are necessary can be made to end this discrimination that has existed and continues to exist.  I am glad to bring the Bill to the floor of the House and I will listen with interest to Members' contributions.  I will hand over to my colleague, Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in.</p></speech>

We will see how we go.</p><p>I commend my colleagues, Deputies Brady and Mitchell, on bringing this important Bill forward.  I also wish, as Deputy Brady has already done, to acknowledge the work done by the former D&aacute;il Deputy, Anne Ferris, who brought this same Bill forward in 2014.  I thank her for all her work on this issue.</p><p>What this Bill ultimately aims to do is end discrimination and give older workers a choice when it comes to retirement.  In my opinion, it is a no-brainer.  I am sure every Deputy and Senator elected to these Houses has been approached on this subject by people who have been forced to leave their jobs as soon as they reached the age of 65 or perhaps even earlier.  They are people who are in good health and who enjoy their work.  People who have financial obligations and mortgages to pay simply cannot afford to be unemployed and with no pension entitlement.  That is wholly unfair.  It is wrong that Irish law currently permits employers to impose mandatory retirement ages via their employees' contracts, in effect, facilitating ageism and creating a set of second-class employment rights for older workers. That should not be allowed happen.  The employee should have the right to choose when he or she will retire, not the employer.  </p><p>This Bill is supported by numerous organisations, including Age Action Ireland and Active Retirement Ireland.  The United Nations Madrid International Plan of Action on Ageing called for older persons to be able to work as long as they want to work and are able to do so.  Interestingly, in a Eurobarometer survey conducted across the European Union in 2012 it was found that 61% of respondents felt that people should be allowed to work beyond retirement age.  In Ireland, this figure was 73%, which is considerably greater than the average return across the survey.</p><p>An argument used to support the current legal provision is that if people retire at an earlier age there will be more employment opportunities for younger people.  Such statements have been dismissed time and time again, and I believe the evidence supports the contention that it is simply not true.  The experience and wealth of knowledge held by an older person at work can be taught to younger workers coming in.  The World Health Organization has recommended the elimination of mandatory retirement ages and stated, &quot;Policies enforcing mandatory retirement ages do not help create jobs for youth, as was initially envisaged, but they reduce older workers&rsquo; ability to contribute and reduce an organization&rsquo;s opportunities to benefit from the capabilities of older workers.&quot;  That is also acknowledged in the Government&rsquo;s National Positive Ageing Strategy which was published in April 2013.  In regard to employment, the strategy states: </p><blockquote>There is evidence that longer working lives have beneficial effects on individuals&rsquo; physical and psychological wellbeing.  Some evidence also shows that workers&rsquo; productivity does not necessarily decline with age - any decline in physical capacity is easily compensated by qualities and skills acquired through experience.</blockquote><p>There is no doubt but that one of the greatest challenges facing us as a country is sustaining the State pension into the future.  By 2046, 1.4 million people will be aged over 65 - or so the experts tell us - compared to the 530,000 recorded in the last census.  This would represent a staggering increase.  As it stands, a worker forced into retirement at the age of 65 is entitled to jobseeker's benefit of &euro;188 per week at the maximum rate until he or she turns 66.  Financially, it makes sense for an older worker to continue to contribute to the Exchequer instead of receiving payments from it.</p> <p> The fact that the Bill was voted through in 2014 is a source of hope, but it is deeply regrettable that nothing further was ever done with it.  Mar sin, iarraim ar gach Teachta v&oacute;ta a chaitheamh ar son an Bhille seo.  I urge all Deputies to vote in favour of the Bill and to ensure that, collectively, we address this anomaly once and for all and have it closed down.  I commend the Bill to the Members and hope they note that many of them will already have supported it.  I hope this is indicative of how they intend to address the Bill on this occasion.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-02-23a.524" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1277" speakername="David Stanton" time="18:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017022300047#UU00200"><p>I thank Deputy Brady for the opportunity to discuss this very important issue and this very important Bill.  As he will be aware, I have long had an interest in reforming our retirement age regime so that persons who have something valuable to contribute can continue to do so even beyond the so-called "normal" retirement age.  The Government has decided not to oppose the Bill.  As Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in said, this has happened previously.  On the previous occasion, the Bill was sent to the Oireachtas committee I chaired.  We did much work on the Bill at the time and had public hearings on it and so on.  The Government supports in principle measures aimed at facilitating fuller working lives.  This is notwithstanding the fact that there are serious technical problems with the Bill as drafted and that there are serious policy and expenditure issues that need to be considered very carefully.  I will come back to these in a moment.  I note that Fianna F&aacute;il has also put forward a Private Members' Bill on this issue, so it is clearly of considerable interest to many Deputies and Senators.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that Ireland does not have a mandatory statutory retirement age in the private sector, where retirement issues are regulated by employment contracts, but there are mandatory retirement ages in the civil and public services.  The Bill is presented as an amendment to equality legislation that would have the effect of abolishing mandatory retirement ages, save in respect of specified security-related employments.  However, the policy implications that would flow from this step are fundamentally not in the equality area, but rather relate to employment policy, including issues surrounding youth unemployment, pensions and public sector recruitment and expenditure.</p>  <p>  Deputies will be aware that this Bill is very similar to the Bill proposed by the then Labour Party Deputy Anne Ferris towards the end of the term of the previous Government.  The Oireachtas joint committee, which, as I said, I chaired at the time, subsequently invited public submissions, held a day of hearings and published a supportive report on the Bill.  At the time, I said the report was marked by its progressive nature, taking account of our changing workforce and ageing population.  It struck me as I was listening to the Deputies that as we are reaching full employment now, we will be looking for more people to stay in the workplace.  Things have changed.  We now have people saying they are finding it hard to recruit employees, which is good and should be acknowledged.</p>  <p>  In December 2015, an amendment was made to the Equality (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2015, bringing our equality legislation further into line, but not completely, with the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice of the European Union.  This reform specified that any compulsory retirement age must be objectively and reasonably justified by a legitimate aim and that the means of achieving that aim must be appropriate and necessary.</p>  <p>  In August 2016, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform published the report of the interdepartmental group on fuller working lives.  The report made a number of recommendations assigned to Government Departments and employer and worker representatives for follow-up.  For example, the report recommended that the Department of Jobs should ask the Workplace Relations Commission to prepare a code of practice under section 42 of the Industrial Relations Act 1990 on the issue of longer working in order to set out best industrial relations practice in managing the engagement between employers and employees in the run-up to retirement, including requests to work beyond what would be considered the normal retirement age in the employment concerned.  The WRC has commenced work on preparing the code in consultation with relevant stakeholders.  In this regard, I bring Deputies' attention to the fact that work is being done in this area.  The matter has not been ignored.</p>  <p>  The report of the interdepartmental group also recommended that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, with public service employers, review the current statutory and operational considerations giving rise to barriers to extended participation in the public service workforce up to and including the current and planned age of entitlement to the contributory State pension.  This review is currently under way and is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2017.  I believe it would be preferable to await the outcome of the review before any related legislation is pursued.  Again, I make the point that work is ongoing in this area.  The matter is not being ignored.</p>  <p>  Retirement ages in the public service are generally set out in legislation.  Amendment of multiple pieces of primary legislation would be required in the context of the enactment of the Private Members' Bill as proposed.  The key point for the Deputies to consider is that the Bill would not set aside such specific provisions in other legislation unless they are amended in the Bill one by one.</p>  <p>  In the context of the Public Service Pensions (Single Scheme and Other Provisions) Act 2012, the issue of a mandatory retirement age was considered.  The outcome to these considerations was that the retirement age for members of the public service pension scheme was linked to the age of qualification for the contributory State pension - currently 66; 67 in 2021; and 68 in 2028 - but it also incorporated a mandatory retirement age of 70, subject to certain exceptions.  This was considered as an appropriate balance between making provision for longer working lives arising from the increased mortality expectancy of the population while incorporating a mandatory retirement age.  The mandatory retirement age can be changed by order of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  This approach reflects the approach at European level incorporated in the EU Framework Employment Directive 2000/78/EC which provides that national authorities can provide for mandatory retirement ages if they can be objectively justified.  I reiterate that the policy implications here would have to be carefully considered.</p>  <p>  The proposal in the Bill would involve setting aside the retirement provisions of most existing employment contracts on a unilateral basis and would have serious implications, which we need to tease out carefully, for public sector employment, pensions policy and labour market policy generally.  My stating this is not to raise a principled objection to the Bill, but to flag that we consider that the Deputy has substantial work to do yet before we are in a position to consider the Bill in detail.  I think the Deputies acknowledge that further work needs to be done by all of us in this area.</p>  <p>  It appears the Bill is intended to apply retrospectively to pre-existing contracts of employment.  The Attorney General has advised that legislation of this nature may be susceptible to legal challenges, having regard to Article 15.5.1&deg; of the Constitution, which precludes the Oireachtas from declaring unlawful acts which were not so at the date of their commission.  In addition, employers may consider that the legislation amounts to an interference with contractual relations and disproportionately interferes with their constitutionally protected property rights.  The legislation may further impact on pending legal proceedings where an employee has challenged the justifications advanced by an employer for imposing a compulsory retirement age.  This issue may, in the absence of transitional provisions, generate disputes and legal challenges.  I would be genuinely interested to hear how Deputy Brady proposes to address such questions.  Again, I do not say this to challenge the Deputy in any way, but these are issues we all need to tease out carefully because they are complex.</p>  <p>  In financial terms, I also point out that the Bill may have implications - not all favourable - for older workers and pensioners.  The need for consequential amendments to income tax and pay-related social insurance measures connected to retirement age arises and should be considered in respect of the Bill.  These include the age tax credit, which is currently available to individuals aged over 65, and the exemption from PRSI available to those aged 66 and over.</p>  <p>  Close consideration would be required to ascertain the impact of the proposed measures on defined benefit schemes and their sponsoring employers and employees in particular.  This would involve developing an understanding of the potential range of positive and negative consequences for employers, employees and defined benefit scheme funding.  We also need to consider the consequences of legislative changes to mandatory retirement ages provisions that may conflict with the existing legal and regulatory conditions stemming from employment law, defined benefit scheme trust deeds and rules, pensions law and pension drawdown rules.</p><p>We also need to consider the consequences of legislative changes to mandatory retirement ages provisions that may conflict with the existing legal and regulatory conditions stemming from employment law, defined benefit scheme trust deeds and rules, pensions law and pension drawdown rules.  On the other hand, however, abolition of fixed retirement ages may have a positive impact on the ability of women to quality for the full State pension and this also needs to be weighed in the balance.  I acknowledge that Deputies have pointed that out.  There may be significant implications for youth employment if considerable numbers of older workers do not retire as envisaged in their original employment contracts and if this reduces the number of new hires.  The impact is difficult to quantify at this stage without detailed research and analysis.</p> <p> The T&aacute;naiste requested officials from the Department of Justice and Equality to meet with the sponsors of the Bill and at that meeting a number of fundamental drafting errors were pointed out.  The current Bill seeks to amend section 34 of the Employment Equality Act 1998 by substituting a new subsection for subsection (3).  However, it would appear that the drafter is seeking to replace the original subsection (3) in the Bill as enacted.  In fact, it should be noted that subsection (3), as originally enacted, was replaced by the Equality Act 2004 and the substance of the revised subsection now relates to occupational benefits schemes.  The proposed approach in the Bill would cause this to be replaced.  Presumably this is an error but the resulting loss would include the explicit prohibition in occupational benefit schemes of discrimination on the gender ground.</p> <p> Moving on to section 34(4), this subsection was also replaced by a new subsection in the Equality Act 2004.  Again, this drafting error would need to be addressed as the Bill seeks to make special provision for members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Defence Forces, the Fire Service, etc., but the proposed amendment does not make any reference to the related provisions for recruitment and retention in those professions in section 37(3) and (4).  The collective citation to the Bill should be revised to reflect all relevant legislation - the amendments made in the Equality (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2015 are not reflected here.</p> <p> The Attorney General has advised that the scope and objective of the Bill requires clarification in light of its opening paragraph.  On first reading, this language goes beyond the Title and stated objective of the Bill.  It would appear the amendment in its present form would repeal employment equality rules prohibiting discrimination on the grounds of age or disability in the employment area.  Clarification of the position is essential to ensure that the State continues to comply with its EU treaty obligations.  It is important to note, as I said, that the cost implications arising from this Bill could be very significant.  The Bill would appear to allow for financial incentives to be offered to employees to cease work at any particular age.  There is an overriding need to stay within the parameters of the fiscal rules and this must be borne in mind in any policy change such as the Bill proposes.</p> <p> Government is open to debate on the current Bill.  However, we need to proceed carefully in what is a complex area.  We would not want a Bill that could have serious adverse or unintended consequences arriving on the Statute Book where the State would then be vulnerable.  I look forward to the debate and welcome the comments and views of colleagues.</p></speech>

We believe we should recognise the potential of our ageing population to contribute to and enrich our society in many diverse ways, given their talents, experience and wisdom and the many years of healthy life expectancy which most can enjoy.  With that in mind I believe it is time to abolish mandatory retirement so that people can continue to work beyond normal retirement age should they so wish.  This has been our stated position since 2012 and is why we introduced the Employment Equality (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2012 in Seanad &Eacute;ireann which, like the Bill being discussed, also sought to abolish mandatory retirement.</p>  <p>  In 2012 Fianna F&aacute;il issued a new policy document, Active Ageing and Quality Caring: A Fianna F&aacute;il Policy Paper to Promote the Human Potential and Human Rights of our Older Irish Citizens.  The document was published by the former Senator, Mary White, on the party's behalf and she introduced the Bill in the Seanad in 2012.  In that policy paper we point out that we have the opportunity to benefit our society by harnessing the social and economic potential of older people and at the same time to benefit our ageing citizens by responding to their desire to participate in society whether socially or economically.</p>  <p>  In order to broaden choice and rights, Fianna F&aacute;il seeks the end of the compulsory retirement of persons at the age of 65, whether in the public or private sectors and to make it unlawful to require a person to retire at or above the age of 65 unless there are clearly specified grounds justifying such compulsory retirement such as competence and performance.</p>  <p>  In Ireland today, people are living longer and have more years of healthy active living than previous generations enjoyed.  Today, a woman who reaches the age of 65 has an average life expectancy of 20 further years while a man can anticipate 17 additional years of life.  We have an ever-growing number of older people in our midst.  Their numbers are projected to double in number from some 500,000 today to 1 million in less than 20 years.  It is simply wrong that people who are productive, working, contributing to society, paying tax, healthy and who want to keep working should be compelled to retire.  In Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the Employment Equality (Repeal of Retirement Age Provisions) Regulations came into force on 6 April 2011.  The effect of those regulations was to repeal the legislation which permitted an employer to terminate the employment of an employee who reached 65 without that being deemed unfair dismissal or unlawful age discrimination.  Compulsory retirement based on age is discrimination.  Unless there are convincing reasons, such as health and safety concerns, workers should have the right to choose when they retire.  When Canada ended mandatory retirement last year, its Human Rights Commission pointed out that we are not born with date stamps saying our fitness for work expires at 65.</p>  <p>  A major study carried out by the EU, published in January 2012, found that almost half of Irish people would like to continue working after they reach pension age entitlement and far exceeded the EU average of one third being so inclined.  Older people who want to continue working after pension or retirement age do so because they feel fit, active and capable or they wish to maintain their current income level.  It is wrong that people who have worked all their lives are forced to retire at age 65.  The contributory pension is not payable until one reaches the age of 66.  People who retire at 65 are forced to apply for jobseeker's benefit at &euro;188 for 12 months until they reach the age of 66 and their pension entitlements kick in.  There is also a significant difference, &euro;42 in the amount paid for the pension and the jobseeker's allowance.  Recently a man came to my office who had worked with the Waterford local authority since he was 18 and he had to retire at age 65.  He told me it was the first time in his life he had to apply for jobseeker's benefit and it broke his heart.  He always boasted of the fact that he had never had to sign on in his life.  He was fit and healthy and still had much to offer.  There are more people aged 65 on the live register claiming jobseeker's benefit than any other age group.  We all know that.  The age to collect the State pension will rise to 67 in 2021 and to 68 in 2028.  Future incomes for those retiring before reaching State pension age will become an increasing problem.  I likened it recently to a runaway train, that is coming towards us all.  Over 1 million people will be aged over 65 in 20 years' time.  We have to make provision for that.  It is a source of real fear for people that their retirement may not be financially secure.  This morning I met Justin Moran of Age Action who fully supports this Bill and what it is trying to achieve.  Fianna F&aacute;il fully supports it too.  It may not suit every employee.  House of our support in this matter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-02-23a.527" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1362" speakername="Denise Mitchell" time="19:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017022300048#VV00300"><p>What this Bill aims to achieve needs to be emphasised, namely, choice.  We cannot and are not forcing people to remain in work.  There is a point at which people will retire and the decision to retire must be a personal one but at present people are being forced, through a contract, to retire at a certain age.  Leaving the labour market suddenly because of an employment contract does not respect a person's time served, skills gained and experience given.</p><p>People sometimes feel they are no longer individuals, but numbers.  As we all know, this can affect people socially and financially and in many other ways.  We must also bear in mind that some people cannot afford to retire.<br/><br/>The Government has taken away the transitional State pension and has made it clear that it is not going to be reinstated.  This places a financial burden on some people who are forced to retire at the age of 65.  It is crazy that people who are forced to retire at the age of 65 must go on the dole and be available for work.  The Government increased the pension age to 66 in 2014 and intends to increase it further to 67 in four years' time.  Will those who are forced from their jobs at the age of 65 have to wait a further two years for a State pension?  While the State is continuing to push out the pension age, it is allowing employers to compel people to retire at the age of 65.  I suggest that the least the Minister should do is allow women who will receive smaller pensions as a result of the 2012 changes in the pension bands to work to gain more contributions.  Having said that, Sinn F&eacute;in's preference is for those changes to be reversed.  We set out our position in this regard when we proposed a motion in this House in December.<br/><br/>It is clear that people have a contribution to make after retirement.  It seems to me that specifying an age at which people may be forced from the workplace suggests that people of that age have no economic value and no contribution to make.  This approach, which sends out a signal of &quot;out with the old and in with the new&quot;, cannot be allowed to remain.  According to the national positive ageing strategy, there is evidence that longer working lives have benefits for physical and mental health.  Surely we should not put any legal barriers in the way of the achievement of this source of well-being.<br/><br/>Many Deputies probably received correspondence on this issue in the run-up to this debate.  I would like to read from a touching e-mail I received from a lady called Jackie:</p><blockquote>I am worried sick about turning 65 next year and having to leave my job.  My husband died suddenly last year and I am already struggling with bills on my own.  I cannot afford to retire next year.  It is not just financial.  I love my job, my children are all grown up and have their own lives; my job gives me a purpose and a reason to get up every morning.  I do not want to have to leave it next year because of my age.</blockquote><p>As we all know, 65 is not an old age.  Employers should not have complete power to change people's lives when they reach that age.  We are proposing to amend the Employment Equality Act 1998.  How can we say we have equality in the workforce when the State allows this discrimination to exist?  It must be changed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-02-23a.529" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1309" speakername="Se&aacute;n Crowe" time="19:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017022300049#WW00200"><p>I warmly welcome this Bill and commend my party colleague, Deputy Brady, for bringing it to the House.  The Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, mentioned that other Bills are being prepared.  I do not think anyone really cares what name is on the Bill.  The most important thing is for legislation in this area to be moved through both Houses and to come into effect.  The Minister of State mentioned that this issue was considered by a committee he chaired in the last D&aacute;il.  I have read through many of the comments that were made to that committee in 2014.  We are now in 2017.  We do not want four years to pass before this legislation is up and running and enacted.</p>  <p>  As other Deputies have said, as a society we are all living longer, thankfully.  That in itself creates challenges.  Newspaper headlines tend to refer to the increased number of older people as a timebomb, but I suggest it should be seen as a positive achievement of our society.  While it creates challenges for services and has health implications, it also has an impact on people's employment prospects.  The huge changes that were made to pension schemes by the Fine Gael-Labour Party Government have unfortunately been really negative for many people, particularly women, and have led to significant difficulties.  For example, changes were made to the way in which one's employment start date was established for the purposes of determining one's period of employment.  Similarly, Deputy Brady referred to the difficulties caused by the change in the ceiling one has to reach with one's number of stamps.</p>  <p>  The whole point of this Bill is to give people a choice.  It is not about forcing people to work longer if they do not need to do so.  I think most people work because they need to do so for financial reasons.  However, some people work because they get satisfaction from their jobs.  Deputies have spoken about people who have told them about the importance of their jobs for themselves and their self-esteem.  As people get older, they read material that describes older people as "bed-blockers" and as negative rather than positive for society.  In this part of the world, ageing is seen as something negative.  In many cultures in other parts of the world, it is seen as hugely positive and important that people have experience and a history of involvement in issues.</p>  <p>  This Bill gives workers a choice when it comes to their own retirements.  It proposes that rather than requiring workers to retire without any choice at the age of 65 or 66, people of that age should be able to decide whether they want to retire immediately or to continue to work.  What could be wrong with that?  It is argued that this measure would hinder youth employment, but if one examines the research that has been done on the effects of similar legislation in other countries, one will see that this is not necessarily the case.  I am reminded of the argument that was used years ago to require women to leave the Civil Service when they got married.  They were deemed to be somehow preventing other people from getting jobs.  In the event of redundancies, the attitude was that women rather than men should be let go.  Society has moved on from those days.  We would not dream of discriminating against people on the basis of religion, sexual orientation, gender, colour or creed, but we discriminate against people because of their age.  When we pick up glossy magazines, the bodies and physical appearances of younger people are depicted as something we are supposed to work towards.</p>  <p>  We need to be clear that getting rid of these mandatory retirement clauses is not about forcing people to work forever.  People are concerned when they hear this case being made because they suspect it is a way of getting them to work for longer.  It is not about that; it is about giving people choices.  It is about older workers having the same job security as their younger counterparts.  It is about allowing them to decide when they wish to stop working.  It is about people being fit for work and being able for the work itself.  Other Deputies have mentioned Age Action Ireland, which is one of the leading advocacy organisations for older people.  It has referred to this set of retirement clauses as ageist.</p><p>It is also stated that it creates a second class set of employment rights for older people who suffer financially as a result.  Their value and self-esteem is undermined by being told, in effect, they are too old to work.  What is this about only changing that perception?<br/><br/>The Bill will address two major pension issues.  It will allow women who have been discriminated against by pension changes to continue to work to get to 520 contributions and ensure they can get a full pension if they wish to do that.  Again, I did not agree with those changes and I would like to think if we were ever in Government, we would reverse those measures brought about under the previous Government.<br/><br/>The Bill would also end the ridiculous issue of people aged 65 being forced on the dole.  As public representatives we have all had such people coming to our constituency offices, saying they had never set foot inside a dole office but had been forced to sign on.  They may have been put on some sort of scheme, and in some cases people may not have been fit for them.  There were no medicals taken for some of the schemes I know of where senior citizens were being asked to attend.  The cohort of those aged 65 on jobseeker's payments have been mentioned more than any other age category in the State.  That must be examined.<br/><br/>I wish read into the record the voices of some older people, as this Bill is concerned with the frustration being felt by people.  One woman spoke of how:</p><blockquote>[T]he frustration of losing my job for no other reason than because I had turned 65 years of age was exacerbated by the financial hardship this policy of mandatory retirement inflicted on me.  I was trying to pay a mortgage to the bank and a loan to the credit union at the same time and it was very difficult to keep going.  I had to cut right back.</blockquote><p>The person goes on to explain that she had to cut back on television and telephone services, as well as medication, all to pay for the mortgage and so on.  We force people down this route.  I know of many constituents in my area who took up the 50-50 scheme to buy their own homes.  The difficulty was in trying to get a mortgage to cover that.  We are limiting people's choices to buy their homes and there is discrimination against people when it comes to getting insurance at a certain age.<br/><br/>The current pension system is unfair and must change.  Once more I commend my colleague on bringing forward the Bill.  None of us would be satisfied after this debate if this went to a committee and was not to be seen thereafter.  God knows where we will be in another three or four years.  Some of us may be here and some of us may not.  It will not be acceptable for us still to be discussing this in three or four years.  We should have collective agreement, if we can, to bring this through.  Some people at home may have gone through the different difficulties in the Bill, and I accept there are such difficulties, but many of us may switch off and the viewers at home may do the same.  The area is complex, but collectively we can deliver on the Bill.  There is goodwill across all parts of the House so we can and should do it.  We owe the people of that age to give them a chance or a choice, if they want it, to continue in employment.</p></speech>

I regard reform in this area as something very important, as I stated a number of years ago, although it is not as long ago as Deputy Crowe made out.  We have had elections and the formation of a Government since then.  At that time and now, it seems we have agreement across the House that this must be addressed.  We must get the detail right if the reform is to be feasible and work as intended.  I mention again that Ireland does not have a mandatory or statutory retirement age in the private sector.  In that space, retirement issues are regulated by employment contracts, so we can put that aside for the moment.  If the employment contracts can be set up in a certain way, this issue does not arise.  There are mandatory retirement ages in the Civil Service and public service, so we must be clear about the paramaters of the issues we are trying to solve.</p>  <p>  I will reflect briefly on some of the issues we must consider before we can take this Bill any further.  I mentioned the technical problems with the Bill as drafted and I am happy to note the Deputies across the House will take that advice on board.  We will all work on it together and I look forward to the proposals Deputies might bring forward to address some of those issues.  We on the Government side will work as well.  We must think carefully about the implications for employment policy, including issues of youth unemployment, pensions and public service recruitment and expenditure.  I mentioned earlier that matters would include pensions policy and pensions schemes, and the immediate implications for affordability may be positive as persons expected to retire shortly choose not to do so.  However, there may be implications for pensions contributions calculated actuarily, which could have the opposite effect.</p>  <p>  In employment law, the retirement clause in existing contracts would be made void without reference to the wishes of the contracting parties.  The current Private Members' Bill as drafted would allow an employee discretion to retire at the previously envisaged age but leave no choice to the employer.  Voiding a contractual agreement in such a one-sided way may be legally problematic.  With regard to the labour market and employment policy, the reduction in expected numbers leaving employment may reduce opportunities for young people or advancement opportunities for people at an earlier stage of their careers.  The advancement opportunities are something we must think about as well.</p>  <p>  Retirement ages in the public service are generally set out in legislation.  The key point for Deputies to consider, and which I should repeat, is that the Bill would not set aside such specific provisions in other legislation unless they are amended in this Bill one by one.  We would have to go through all the legislation in the Statute Book and amend it as required.  It is not simply about producing this Bill, as this will not change all the other legislation.  I mentioned the Public Service Pensions (Single Scheme and Other Provisions) Act 2012 and that arising from considerations at the time, the retirement age for members of the public service pension scheme was linked to the age of qualification for the contributory State pension, which is currently 66 and will be 67 from 2021 and 68 from 2028.  It also incorporates a mandatory retirement age of 70, subject to certain exemptions.  Again, I should recall that the Attorney General has raised issues with the approach in the Bill and specifically with regard to retrospection.  We are living in a time when people are living longer and the sustainability of the pensions system must be addressed as well.  That is why the pension age is being progressively increased.  This has implications for retirement ages and the Bill provides the opportunity to consider this in great detail, which is welcome.  The Department of Social Protection argues that it looks after anybody caught in the arrangement mentioned by Deputies and it does not necessarily end with the social welfare payment.</p>  <p>  We must proceed carefully in what is a very complex area.  We do not want a Bill with serious adverse or unintended consequences arriving on the Statute Book, leaving the State vulnerable.  I close by stressing my personal commitment to reform in the area and, as I have said, I have some history in this respect.  People who can still make a valuable contribution to the workforce and can do so should be facilitated in so far as is possible.  I hope we can agree a way forward in this complex and important area.  There is some work being done, as I mentioned, and I ask that we wait for those reports to be presented in order that we can consider the detail of the information.  This debate has been very useful because it reminds us of the work that has been done and the importance of this area for people listening to this debate.  As Deputies Crowe and Brady have said, they want to stay at work and for all kinds of reasons find work beneficial.  They do so for social or economic reasons and it was mentioned that it is a reason to get up in the morning.  There are many reasons and we have been through this many times.</p>  <p>  I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the time and Deputies for their work and attention in the area.</p></speech>

It must be welcomed that the Government and Fianna F&aacute;il will not oppose the Bill and are willing to work with Sinn F&eacute;in on getting it right.  It would have been surprising if the opposite had been the case, given that all parties agreed to the Bill when it came before the House back in 2015.  Unfortunately, the Bill fell with the Thirty-first D&aacute;il.  The Minister of State says we must wait for reports to be produced before we progress the Bill.  I think this will be a very short-lived Government.</p></speech>

My fear is we will not progress it fast enough.  I am conscious there are people in the Gallery and people and organisations watching the debate from home.  Although they had much hope and optimism when the Bill was previously supported, ultimately, their hopes were dashed when it did not progress.  It is imperative that we work on this Bill.  Sinn F&eacute;in and I are willing to do all the heavy lifting and would welcome any support to try to get it through Committee Stage as quickly as possible.</p>  <p>  As I said in my opening comments, the Bill will have an impact on many areas to the betterment of many lives.  As many people have said, 80 is the new 60 and 60 is the new 40.  We all know people are living longer and healthier lives.  The Bill is fundamentally about choice and about giving those people the choices to continue working if they want to.  As Deputy Mitchell noted, we would love to see all the changes that were introduced in 2012 amended and changed, and all those measures that have impacted on women and pensioners reversed.  Outside of that, there are major challenges.  Our older population is growing very quickly.  As I outlined in my contribution, by 2046 we will have 1.4 million people aged 65 and older.  This is a major challenge.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State raised the old red herring of the impact the Bill would have on youth unemployment.  It is a tired and flawed argument that was thrashed out back in 2015 when the Bill was first brought forward.  The evidence is there to see in countries which have moved ahead and abolished the mandatory retirement age.  The evidence indicates that reducing labour force participation among older people does not lead to increased employment for young people.  Iceland, New Zealand, Sweden and Norway are among the top ten countries in the world for youth employment and for employment of older people.  There is evidence that it does not impact on youth employment.</p>  <p>  A 2014 report from the IZA World of Labor research institute found there is no trade-off between the employment of young and old workers.  Higher employment for older workers coincides with higher employment for younger workers.  Reducing the employment of older persons does not provide more job opportunities for younger people.  The report also found that measures introduced in Denmark and France that reduced labour force participation for older workers saw falls in youth employment over the same period.  A comprehensive 2008 working paper on the effects of early retirement on youth employment in Belgium found no positive link between early retirement and youth employment.  The link has also been comprehensively dismissed on repeated occasions by the OECD, which stated in a report, "It is important to dispel a number of myths in this area ... the claim that fewer jobs for older workers results in more jobs for younger workers, though unfounded, is proving especially stubborn".</p>  <p>  The argument that fixed numbers of jobs can be reshuffled between workers of different ages as a result of government policy is untrue.  The OECD report found the more older workers were in employment the better it was for the economy and for youth employment rates.  Instead of setting older workers against younger workers, we should try to maximise the valuable contribution older workers provide to the economy, including making full use of skills, experience and wisdom of older workers to train in younger workers and newer employees.  Many people, when they hit the age of 65, which is a number on a piece of paper, feel their worth has expired when they are forced into retirement, in many cases, as a number of Deputies said, against their will, for many reasons, whether social or economic.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State touched on employment contracts in the private sector.  The retirement age is written into these contracts and it is permitted by law.  The Bill will address this in both the private and public sectors.  The Minister of State mentioned the issue of retrospective law.  We understand that with any retrospective law there is potential for legal and constitutional challenge.  This must be analysed and balanced on Committee Stage.  Although we can get viewpoints from the Attorney General or from anybody else, good, bad or indifferent, all legislation the House produces is open to legal challenge.  This makes the committee's work more important.  It must ensure we get the Bill right.  The responsibility falls on all of us here.  We all agree with the principle of the Bill, which is to abolish the mandatory retirement age.  We all need to get it to Committee Stage and get it right.</p>  <p>  Many people are watching the debate and have been given hope by the words that have come from the Chamber.  The vote will not be held until next week.  The Minister of State has just indicated that the Government will not oppose the Bill and, therefore, there will be no vote.  Real hope is coming from the Chamber tonight.  It is imperative that we get it to Committee Stage as quickly as possible.  The Minister of State has said we must wait until the reports come out.  I will not outline my concerns around the Government's timeframe.  However, we need to move on the Bill.  People are watching and hurting.</p>  <p>  More than 5,000 65 year olds are forced to sign on to receive a jobseeker's payment.  The Minister of State has admitted that they have to sign on only once in that year and we turn a blind eye.  Although they are forced into receipt of a jobseeker's payment, they do not have to go out and seek work.  It is a serious anomaly that will get worse in 2021 when the pensionable age increases again and when it increases to 68 a few years after that.  This serious flaw should have been addressed, but was not.</p><p>There is a serious problem for women as they are forced to take a lower payment because of the changes in pensions and PRSI in 2012.  This is a real opportunity to address that and that is why it is essential the Bill moves on to Committee Stage, so it can be enacted.  It means so much to so many people, and for so many reasons.</p> <p> I thank the Minister of State, Fianna F&aacute;il and my colleagues who have spoken on the Bill.  It is a big achievement for everyone here.  I am not sure how many other pieces of legislation have received such unanimous support from across the House.  I am not sure if this is the first time it has happened but it is one of the first times in this D&aacute;il.  I am glad this is the case on such important legislation.</p></speech>
