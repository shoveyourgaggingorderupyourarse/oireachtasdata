Given that the general ban on evictions ended on 22 April 2021, there is a genuine concern that many of these tenants could end up losing their homes and becoming homeless.  I ask the Minister to outline what he is going to do to ensure that this very specific group of tenants is protected in order that we do not see a rise in homelessness, and particularly family homelessness, in the coming months.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-06-24a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1561" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021062400003#A00600"><p>I thank Deputy &Oacute; Broin for his question.  Since 1 August 2020, the Residential Tenancies and Valuation Act 2020, and its successor, the Planning and Development, and Residential Tenancies, Act 2020, enhance tenancy protections where a tenant is in rent arrears due to Covid-19 and at risk of losing his or her home and make the necessary declaration.  Indeed, coincidentally, we were debating the extension of the protections in this very Chamber yesterday evening.</p>  <p>  Since August last, a landlord is also legally required to serve both the RTB and the tenant with both a 28-day warning notice - a notice period that has been increased from 14 days - seeking payment of rent arrears and also any related notice of termination that might ensue.  Otherwise, the notice of termination is unlawful.  I am stating that because it was a permanent change that we made last year in the legislation, with effect from 1 August.  That Bill did not have unanimous support at the time.  It was opposed by some in the Opposition, which, in fairness, was their right.  It is a permanent change.  It is most important that we are flagging rent arrears from the earliest opportunity as it arises.  </p>  <p>  On receipt of the warning notice, the RTB will acknowledge receipt to the landlord and the tenant and will provide information to the tenant to enable her or him to get advice from Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, MABS, on State income support, and will offer assistance to the tenant in obtaining this advice.  The aim is to ensure that early action is taken to address rent arrears, to the benefit of both the tenant and the landlord.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy correctly stated, the RTB received copies of 3,810 warning notices that landlords had issued to tenants in rent arrears.  That is something that would not have happened but for the passing of the Acts last year that I brought forward.  It also received copies of just over 1,120 notices of termination grounded on rent arrears.  To put that in context, it relates to almost 300,000 tenancies.  Perhaps I will expand on that and provide more detail on it, following the Deputy's supplementary question.  It is an important issue and one which we must keep an eye on.  I will speak more on it following the supplementary.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-06-24a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1468" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021062400003#A00700"><p>My question was very specific.  While the information that the Minister has provided is very interesting, it does not actually address the question.  I look forward to him addressing the question in his response.</p>  <p>  The problem is as follows.  The homeless figures for April 2021 show, for the first time in a long time, an increase the number of families with children in emergency accommodation.  We know that the single largest cause of family homelessness is landlords issuing vacant possession notices to quit.  In fact, looking at the most recent data from the RTB, they tell us that 49% of notices to quit are on grounds of sale and 24% are in cases of the landlord or landlord's family using the property.  There is a real concern among front-line homeless service providers that now that the general ban on evictions has ended, we are going to see a return to the pre-Covid monthly increases in homelessness.</p>  <p>  Specifically, I am asking the Minister that for those people who have notices to quit today, whether for rent arrears, sale of property or use of property by landlords, what is the Minister going to do to ensure that we do not see a month-on-month rise in homelessness, and in particular, family homelessness with children involved?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-06-24a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1561" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021062400003#A00800"><p>Homelessness is an absolute priority issue for me and the Government.  Thankfully, in the last year, year-on-year, we have seen a significant reduction in homelessness, both in child and family homelessness and overall.  There are issues with single person homelessness, rates of which remain stubbornly high.  The overall number of people who are homeless is still far too high.  All of us would agree with that assertion.  The monthly figures will be published tomorrow.  I have seen the preliminary figures and the trend within them is good.  Having said that, it shows the challenge of the work that remains to be done in this space, particularly around the provision of permanent homes, and specifically for those to whom the Deputy has referred.</p>  <p>  Of those who received notices of termination, 475 tenants sought protection under the self-declaration.  I would ask any of those who have received a notice of termination to engage with the RTB and to look, in particular, at the protections that are there and the emergency rent supplement payments that are available.</p>  <p>  However, it is an area that we are going to watch.  Almost 300,000 tenancies were registered with the RTB by the end of 2020, and there were just over 1,120 notices of termination.  Therefore, it needs to be put into context. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-06-24a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1468" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021062400003#A00900"><p>Again, the Minister did not answer the very specific question.  The single biggest cause of the dramatic drop in family homelessness in the last year was the blanket ban on evictions.  One of the first acts of Deputy O'Brien as Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage was to end that blanket ban.  It was reintroduced when level 5 restrictions returned, but it ended again on 22 April 2021.  That means that if landlords continue to issue vacant possession notices to quit and others, we could see a month-on-month increase in homelessness.</p>  <p>  I am asking the Minister a very simple question.  What is he going to do for those people who today have received notices to quit and who are not eligible for the very restrictive Covid-19 renters protections?  What is the Minister going to do for those who have received notices to quit and are at imminent risk of eviction and, therefore, at risk of homelessness?  What additional measures and interventions will be taken?  Otherwise, the fear of many - not just in the Opposition but also in the homeless services sector - is that the progress made over the last 12 months, to which the Minister rightly referred, will start to be undone and homeless numbers will begin to rise.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-06-24a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1561" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021062400003#A01000"><p>Yesterday evening we brought forward the fifth piece of tenancy and rental legislation since I was appointed Minister.  We have been to the fore in the areas of rent and protection for tenants.  Last August, when exited out of the blanket ban on evictions that was in place, we did so on the basis of very strong legal advice that we had received, that any measures that we take must be proportionate.  Whether Deputies want to acknowledge it or not, we must balance the rights of the property owner and, indeed, the tenant.</p> <p>I said yesterday evening that I intend to bring forward substantial reforms relating to rent and tenancy reforms in the autumn but specifically for the people referred to by the Deputy.  I remind him and others that when we exited the blanket eviction ban last August, there were many who predicted "a tsunami of evictions".  This did not happen because the protections this Government and I brought in are targeted and proportionate, and are working.  Even though only 475 people have sought that protection, the fact that they are there shows that we are serious about protecting tenants.</p></speech>

The T&aacute;naiste, who has made a lot of pronouncements on housing recently, defended these prices on the basis that price levels have not yet surpassed the Celtic tiger peak.  What price levels does the Minister think would be acceptable?</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-06-24a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1561" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="09:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021062400004#B00300"><p>The April 2021 price index released by the CSO shows in general a rising trend in house prices with some variations across areas and property type.  These increases must be viewed in the context of the proceeding year, which included national lockdowns and restrictions on movement, which impacted severely on the construction sector and our supply.  Obviously, there has been a lot of pressure on the second-hand market and the ability of sellers and purchasers to engage in normal sales activity, including physical viewings.  We had a situation that was far from ideal in respect of virtual viewings and biddings but those changes had to be made in the context of public health advice.  The ongoing easing of Covid restrictions will support a full reopening of the housing market and a return to a more normal supply of properties for sale.  This will impact positively on the rate of price increases.  The wide range of actions set out in the programme for Government will continue to deliver increases in housing supply and affordable housing, which is a priority for me, despite the challenges presented by Covid and will support a moderation in house prices.</p>  <p>  The new housing plan entitled housing for all, which I will publish in the coming weeks, will set out a whole-of-government approach to outline how we get to a housing system that gives us sustainable supply at a price people can afford with appropriate housing options, particularly for the most vulnerable.  We will bring the Affordable Housing Bill, which has passed the Seanad, into the D&aacute;il for Second Stage later.  This is the most comprehensive affordable housing legislation ever published by any Government.  In particular, this Bill will help those in the unaffordability trap.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-06-24a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1550" speakername="Cian O'Callaghan" time="09:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021062400004#B00400"><p>I would like to hear if the Minister has a view on price levels or if housing for all will set targets.  In the past week, a house in Rathmines in poor condition and in need of significant renovation has attracted a bidding war with offers in excess of &euro;530,000 above the asking price.  These kind of bidding wars create huge anxiety and fear in prospective first-time buyers and have not been seen since the Celtic tiger years.  Housing utility costs are 78% higher here than the EU average and Dublin has the second highest house prices in the eurozone.  Prices are only higher in Luxembourg.  The typical age of a joint purchaser has risen to 38 and the typical age of a single purchaser has risen to 42.  Even the report of the Government's sub-committee on housing has warned that demand side measures could add to this so I am asking the Minister what kind of price levels he thinks are acceptable.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-06-24a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1561" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="09:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021062400004#B00500"><p>The measures I have brought forward in the Affordable Housing Bill and housing for all are supply side measures because we need to get supply up to at least an average of 33,000 per year.  Last year, there were just over 20,000 completions.  This year, on the best projections we have so far, there will probably be up to 18,000.  The reality is that when the market, production and capacity are constrained, there is additional pressure on the second-hand homes market in particular.  The Deputy referred to the bidding war relating to the house in Rathmines, which I watched myself.  The bids are approximately &euro;500,000 over the original asking price.  That is not sustainable and is not something I want to see but we are in an unusual position where we are coming through post Covid and are building up capacity in the sector.  There are also some cost implications and cost increases in materials and labour that I hope will be temporary.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-06-24a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1550" speakername="Cian O'Callaghan" time="09:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021062400004#B00600"><p>Will there be targets for price levels in housing for all or does the Minister and Government have a view on that?  There are only 7,000 or 8,000 new build homes available on the open market each year.  The rest are bought by institutions or for one-off houses or social housing.  In the context of some of the highest house prices in the eurozone, the warnings that prices could reach Celtic tiger levels, the sharp increases in the cost of construction building materials mentioned by the Minister and the warnings from the Central Bank and the ESRI about adding a demand side shared equity scheme to this and adding fuel to the fire, will he reconsider those measures that will increase house prices even further given the pressure at the moment, bearing in mind the fact that the people who lobbied for that scheme did it at a time house price inflation was much more stable?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-06-24a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1561" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="09:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021062400004#B00700"><p>This Government believes in home ownership.  In his earlier contribution, the Deputy bemoaned the fact that the average age of someone buying his or her first home has increased to 38.  I have been raising this issue for a number of years but the difference is that we are doing something about it.  A shared equity scheme is part of the Affordable Housing Bill, which will come to the House this evening and which I hope the Social Democrats will support.  This shared equity scheme is focused on those who need it most.  It will work.  It has been passed by the Central Bank, has received approval and will help those caught in an affordability trap by helping them bridge that affordability gap with the State taking equity in their home.  The State will take equity in direct build affordable homes built through local authorities such as the scheme in Donabate of more than 1,200 homes, 200 of which are social and 238 of which are affordable, passed by Fingal County Council a number of weeks ago but which the Deputy's party voted against.</p></speech>

Apparently, a high-level memorandum from senior civil servants to the Cabinet sub-committee on housing said that the 33,000 new home completions that will be in the housing for all strategy will not be met until 2025.  I do not expect the Minister to confirm or deny the content of a confidential memorandum to a Cabinet sub-committee but could he tell the House when he believes the target of 33,000 public and private home completions will be met?</p></reply>

I cannot say I read the article.  My Department engaged the ESRI to undertake independent research into structural housing demand in Ireland right up to 2040.  The findings of the ESRI on structural housing demand at county level were published last December so I am familiar with that.  Based on that research and factoring in existing demand together with future projected demand, we know the State will probably require an average of 33,000 new housing units per annum and we have fed this into our housing needs demand assessment, which includes every local authority.  While there has been a significant fourfold increase in output since the lows of 2013, some of this ground has been lost due to the effects of the pandemic and we all know that.  As I said earlier in response to Deputy O'Callaghan, we estimate that housing completions will be between 18,000 and 20,000 this year.  We hope to make up lost ground through some activation measures.  Last year, the sector performed better than was originally projected.</p>  <p>  To answer the Deputy's question about when we will reach that number, in the coming weeks, we will produce our new housing policy entitled housing for All.  This will have targets.  I neglected to tell Deputy O'Callaghan about that.  The plan will set out a pathway to the sustainable supply we need at a price people can afford with appropriate housing options for the most vulnerable, including the areas around social, public housing, cost rental, affordable purchase and private housing supply, which we also need in this country.  I will outline the steps in the ladder to get to those figures of 33,000 in the housing for all plan.</p> <p>It is still being worked on but I know when it is published the Deputy will have intense interest in it.  We can debate it in detail at that stage.</p></speech>

For the second time today, the Minister has not answered the question, which was a simple one.  When does the Minister believe we will reach the 33,000 new home completions target that will be in his strategy?  If he will not answer that, will he tease out his last comments by confirming whether there will be targets for social housing and, crucially, affordable purchase and affordable rental for each year from 2022 to 2025?  The average of 4,000 affordable homes has been widely reported, I presume on the basis of briefings from the Minister's officials or office.  That target, on the basis of information given to the Oireachtas housing committee from Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage officials in the Land Development Agency, will not be met by 2025.  Will the Minister have annual targets for, in particular, affordable housing?  When will he meet the 33,000 target?</p></speech>

I hope the Deputy's party and other parties opposite will recognise that, to reach those targets, they need to support development.  They need to support building and stop voting against housing developments and proposals brought forward at local authorities across the country.  I referenced to Deputy Cian O'Callaghan probably the most significant scheme in Dublin this year, comprising 1,200 homes, which both Deputy &Oacute; Broin's party and Deputy O'Callaghan's party opposed.  There are also the ongoing difficulties with Oscar Traynor, which I am working with the local authority to try to resolve.</p>  <p>  All of us need to focus on delivering homes and stop talking about it.  My focus in Housing for All is on a housing plan backed with resources to deliver affordable homes and public homes that people need and put home ownership back at the centre of our response to the housing crisis.  I am confident we can make up the lost ground over the last year.  We will have targets in the plan for delivery and affordable housing.</p></speech>

That is bad housing policy and reckless use of a public resource.  I remind the Minister that Members of his party sided with Sinn F&eacute;in and the Social Democrats in opposing the appalling sweetheart land deal in Oscar Traynor Road.  Despite the fact the Minister has been given an alternative proposal supported by a majority of councillors on Dublin City Council in March, he is setting delay after delay on the delivery of those much-needed 800 social and affordable homes.  Does the Minister believe he will reach the 4,000 affordable homes target by 2025?  If so, how much will be invested year on year to meet the target?</p></speech>

One will be the Affordable Housing Bill, which I hope the Deputy's party and others will support, and another is the Land Development Agency, which will enable us to use our State land productively.  I was taken aback when Deputy &Oacute; Broin and his party admitted they wanted a Land Development Agency but do not want a State agency involved in residential development or building and, more strikingly, the Deputy said on the record of the committee that he does not want to master plan for housing.</p>  <p>  The State owns enough land to deliver about 114,000 homes for our people, and probably more.  We need to utilise the State land we have, get it into the market and use it productively.  I have been focusing with colleagues on getting the Land Development Agency legislation passed before the recess.  The proof of the pudding will be in the eating very soon when we see whether the Deputy and his party support the legislation.  Alternatively, will they continue to let their perfect be the enemy of the good for all?</p></speech>

Expenditure under the scheme covers recoupment made to local authorities for contracted rents due to private landlords and approved housing bodies, administration costs and a damages contingency fund for newly acquired accommodation.</p>  <p>  Exchequer funding of &euro;6.9 million was provided to Tipperary in 2020 to support 1,071 tenancies.  Funding for leasing projects is provided under the social housing current expenditure budget.  This supports the delivery of social housing by providing financial support to local authorities for the long-term leasing of houses and apartments from private owners and approved housing bodies.</p>  <p>  Tipperary County Council delivered 40 additional properties under the social housing leasing scheme in 2020, with a total spend for the year of &euro;2.5m in relation to all leased properties.</p>  <p>  The housing assistance payment, HAP, is a flexible and immediate housing support available to all eligible households throughout the State.  Funding for HAP for Tipperary in 2020 amounted to &euro;7.1 million, with 1,868 active tenancies at the end of 2020.  This funding represents the portion paid by my Department after receipt of the differential rent which is paid by the tenant to the local authority.  It does not include administration costs related to the scheme.</p></speech>

In 2020, it was more than 1,800.  The total cost in 2019 was more than &euro;6.8 million; in 2020, it was &euro;7.1 million.</p>  <p>  The housing leasing scheme is only one third of that, according to the figures the Minister of State has given.  That scheme, which offers tenants long-term security, is not being promoted or advanced by most local authorities.  It could and does provide longer term security for tenants of ten or 20 years.  This would be also more cost effective for the State.  There are sizable administration costs at county council and Department levels.</p>  <p>  The Government has front-loaded money into HAP and it is not delivering homes for people.  I accept it is putting roofs over people's heads and was needed but the overemphasis on HAP is damaging to the building of new homes.</p></speech>

That can be seen on the ground in Tipperary.  There has been a 32% reduction in the housing list in the county in recent years.  A total of 526 new homes have been built since 2016, including 274 social, 14 under the Part V process and 238 which have been brought back into use from vacancy.  The Minister has brought huge impetus in the last year to driving local authorities to bring vacant properties back into use for our citizens.  We are making progress.  There are 234 homes across 19 sites that are going through the design process and 138 at pre-tender stage.  There is a drive to get direct build new homes on the ground for the citizens of Tipperary.</p></speech>

In the past five years, there has been a complete failure by the Government to fund local authorities building houses.  In 2016, there were only 320 local authority new builds; in 2017, there were 1,014 new builds; in 2018, 2,022 new builds; in 2019, 2,271 new builds; in 2020, only 2,300 new builds; in 2021 so far, there have been 1,995.  The T&aacute;naiste at the Ard-Fheis last weekend must have been in cloud cuckoo land to think he could pluck 40,000 a year out of the sky.  This has not been happening.  Fine Gael has been in government for ten years and nothing is happening.  It was supported by Fianna F&aacute;il in the so-called confidence and supply agreement for five years.  Now Fianna F&aacute;il promises to build 9,500 social houses per year.  The spin does not get it done.  We are not getting houses built.  We were to build them in the 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s and everything else.  Now it is all spin and veneer and houses are not being built for people.</p></speech>

I did not interrupt him.  I would appreciate it if he could give me a bit of time.  In the first instance, there has been an increase of 300% in housing supply since 2012.  The Government has also delivered 34,000 new social homes, homes that are right for our citizens, since 2016.  That represents a 300% increase in supply.  While I accept that there are frustrations, there is a record budget within the Department, totalling &euro;3.3 billion, to deliver social and affordable housing.  As the Deputy will be aware, the Affordable Housing Bill has been going through the Houses of the Oireachtas and is nearing completion.  The Land Development Agency is going to deliver houses at scale.  There is nothing wrong with having ambition to deliver housing on the ground for our citizens.  But for Covid, last year we would have delivered well over 20,000 units.  The Deputy will see continued delivery over this year and next year.  The facts speak for themselves with regard to the number of units on the ground.  We have increased the numbers from a very low base and we will continue to increase them with a record budget in the Department.</p></speech>

Accessing materials is increasingly difficult.  I refer to timber in particular.  The supply is drying up.  A simple length of 4" X 2" was &euro;8 last year and is now &euro;13.  One of the main builder's suppliers in Clare is no longer stocking timber.  Builders will not give quotes of more than a month's duration because of inflation in the cost of supplies.

I am fully aware that the construction sector has faced a number of considerable challenges over the past year, not least the restrictions on construction activity introduced to combat the spread of Covid-19 and the impact of Brexit and related supply issues.  Throughout this period, colleagues across Government have engaged with representatives from across the sector.  Indeed the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, met with the Irish Home Builders Association recently, on 12 June, and the issue of increases in materials was one of the issues raised.</p>  <p>  Across Europe, supply issues have been affecting the price of timber due to increased demand.  Other construction materials such as steel, concrete and plastics have also been affected and these developments are being monitored closely internationally.  However, while the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland tender price index reveals that national construction tender prices increased by 1.3% in the second half of 2020, it is still significantly less than tender price inflation levels being experienced before the Covid-19 pandemic.  While there was elevated construction sector inflation in 2019, construction price inflation slowed overall in 2020 as a result of Covid-19.</p>  <p>  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform facilitates the construction sector group.  This group considers opportunities to introduce reforms to assist with tackling inflation in the wider construction sector.</p></speech>

It is to be hoped this is a time for questions and answers rather than propaganda.  I appreciate that the supply of building materials is, by and large, a private endeavour but if these issues are preventing the supply of housing in Ireland, which it is and increasingly will, is there anything the Government can do?  I do not really mind who answers the question.  I am particularly concerned about timber.  There is a lot of timber growing in Ireland and much of that is past the point of maturity.  Many landowners across Clare are looking for felling licences.  There is chaos in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, particularly in its forestry section.  As the Minister of State answered, perhaps he might talk to Senator Hackett, who is the Minister of State with responsibility for this, and tell her to get things moving.</p></speech>

I am very aware of the current challenges in the forestry sector and I acknowledge the implications of delays to the granting of licences for the wider industry and for the construction sector.  We are fully aware of that.  I am in regular contact with my colleague, the Minister of State, Senator Hackett.  She is working with a range of stakeholders to address this issue, particularly through Project Woodland.  It is a very difficult situation and we acknowledge that.  We are hopeful that the current process will resolve the problems and work towards a solution to address the issue of felling licences in particular.</p></speech>

This D&aacute;il has been in place for a bit longer again.  This problem predates this Government.  I acknowledge that the problem did not arise under Senator Hackett's watch but she has been in officer for a while now and I am not hearing of any increase in the number of felling licences granted.  I appreciate that there are environmental issues around forestry policy but these are not the problem here, although we need to address them.  One can blame people who object to planning or felling licences but other countries have much more environmental protection in place and do not have the same problems sourcing timber as us.  There is a logjam in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine with regard to issuing felling licences.  I sometimes question whether there might be a degree of market manipulation being carried out by large plantation owners and whether the Department is complicit in that.  One or way or the other, there is a very significant problem.  Timber mills cannot get timber so they cannot mill it and sell it on.  Small builders just cannot get timber as a result.</p></speech>

It is a significant challenge.  As I have said, the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, and the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, are determined to resolve these issues, the logjam about which the Deputy has spoken.  There is no doubt but that this has had, and continues to have, a significant impact on the construction sector in Ireland.  The Deputy specifically mentioned small construction companies and small one-off builders.  This issue is particularly impacting on them, although it is also impacting on the larger-scale builders in the sector.  I am convinced and remain confident that Project Woodland and the measures taken by the Department will resolve these issues within a reasonable period and bring supply back into the market.  That is something we all want to see.</p></speech>

The 2011 regulations prescribe maximum net income limits for each local authority, in different bands according to the area concerned, with income being defined and assessed according to a standard household means policy.</p>  <p>  Under the household means policy, which applies in all local authority areas, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, PRSI, universal social charge and additional superannuation contribution.  The policy provides for a range of income disregards and local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once-off in nature.</p>  <p>  The income bands are expressed in terms of a maximum net income threshold for a single-person household, with an allowance of 5% for each additional adult household member, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10%, and a separate 2.5% allowance for each child.</p>  <p>  The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs in addition to a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country.  It is important to note that the limits introduced in 2011 also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and providing a degree of future-proofing.</p>  <p>  Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support.  The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge.  However, as part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports in each local authority area is currently under way within the Department.</p></speech>

This is an ongoing issue, particularly in County Clare.  People contact me every day of the week who are just over that maximum threshold, which is set at &euro;25,000.</p> <p>There is a question of equity.  There is a much higher threshold in Limerick than in Clare.  This needs to be reviewed urgently.  I welcome the Minister of State's confirmation that the process is ongoing.  When does he expect that the review will be concluded?  Is it on an individual basis?  Can County Clare be brought in line with County Limerick, our closest neighbour?</p></speech>

It is important and, like him, I can see vulnerable people coming into clinics who need support and assistance with social housing.  The review is ongoing.  The review will be done in the context of the Affordable Housing Bill and its impact.  Current schemes include the direct build scheme, the shared equity scheme, and increasing Part V numbers to 20% for social and affordable housing.  The Land Development Agency will deliver social, affordable and cost-rental housing at scale.  We will hopefully complete this review to assess the impact of those when the legislation passes the Oireachtas.  I can see that issues with different local authority bands raise a significant issue with Clare and Limerick, as Deputy Carey rightly acknowledged.  We are working hard on this and we will hopefully complete the review later this year.</p></speech>

A constituent was in touch with me this week.  Unfortunately this lady is over the income threshold.  She is in receipt of the family income supplement.  It is hard to understand why she would not be eligible for consideration for social housing.  This has a negative impact on people's lives and ability to qualify for housing.  This is urgent and I ask the Minister of State to ensure that this is brought to a conclusion at the earliest opportunity.  County Clare, with the maximum threshold, should have more people who actually need housing become eligible.</p></speech>

I grew up in Clare.  There were many county council estates and they were mixed.  We all thought they were good and Government policy still promotes that.  If the threshold is set where it is in Clare, if two people in a household are working or even if just one person is working and is just a little over the minimum wage, those people are not entitled to go on the social housing list.  Effectively, only people in receipt of social welfare can get social housing in Clare because of where the limits are set.  I have no problem with people in receipt of social welfare getting social housing but it should not be limited to that because it will cause ghettoisation of social housing, which nobody thinks is a good thing, and there is a disincentive to work, especially when it is low-paid work.  We need to look at those income thresholds for the sake of society and housing in Clare, to even get back to where we were in the 1980s.</p></speech>

He is right that a key to unlocking this issue is income disregards.  He pointed out the case of a family that he has been dealing with.  Local authorities have discretion regarding payments that are one-off or temporary in nature and can disregard them.  There is potentially more space for such discretion because vulnerable people in receipt of income supports such as the working family payment currently exceed the amounts in the housing means test.  We will look at that.  It should be seen in the context of the Affordable Housing Bill.  We need mixed tenure developments.  In some quarters in the House, we hear people call for that and yet they consistently vote against it.  It is interesting to hear the debate about the Oscar Traynor site and other big sites in Dublin that are still lying idle and derelict.</p></speech>

Some 18 months ago, as mayor of Clare County Council, I signed a number of contracts in conjunction with the then Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, to deliver social housing.  I want to know how that is progressing.  Has the Minister any other good news this morning?</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-06-24a.68" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1561" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="09:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021062400007#E01100"><p>There is lots of good news.  To answer the Deputy's question, there is also good news for County Clare because we have a housing plan backed with real resources and the largest housing budget in the history of the State, which the Deputy supported, underpinned by investment of &euro;3.3 billion in housing programmes in budget 2021.  We have a national target of 12,750 social homes, 9,500 of which are new builds.  There will be an impact due to Covid but we are doing our best to make up as much lost ground as we can.  In County Clare, the council set a target for this year to deliver 227 new social homes, with 195 new builds.  That shows the emphasis that the Government has and that Deputy Crowe had as mayor in pushing towards new builds and increasing our housing stock.</p>  <p>  The social housing construction status report is published each quarter and provides scheme-level data on newly built social housing in every local authority area, including Clare.  Details about the stage of each project can be found in the status report.  The most recent report covered the period until the end of the first quarter of 2020 and provides details of 47 separate social housing schemes across Clare.  Since 2016, 245 homes have been completed in 29 schemes.  The report also shows that 177 homes are in progress across nine schemes right now, with a further 128 in Clare at various stages of the design and pre-tender process.  It is a significant pipeline of homes that we will increase further in the housing for all plan which the Government will publish in the coming weeks.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister.  I am sure that we would all agree that this cannot happen quickly enough.  I pay tribute to Anne Haugh, the director of service for housing, and her team.  It is a tricky area to work in.  We, as Deputies, bombard them with representations from people who need and are desperate to get housing.  A few things need to be looked at urgently, including social housing income bands.  Eligibility limits need to be urgently reviewed because Clare is currently in the lowest band, which is band 3.  A review of housing assistance payment, HAP, maximum rent payments is needed.  Housing assistance payments in Clare were the third lowest in the country, at &euro;550, with two parents and three children.  In Ennis, the average private rental cost is &euro;1,000.  In the south of the county, in places such as Westbury, a three-bed semi-detached house, which is a modest house, has a rental cost of &euro;1,400.  HAP does not correlate to the market values for renting.</p></speech>

There is a committed and dedicated housing team in Clare County Council.  I intend to visit in July to look at some of the schemes myself.  I look forward to meeting the Deputy there.  We need to increase new stock.  We have outlined that and will be ambitious.  We also need to look at existing stock.  Clare County Council, through the work of its housing director, chief executive, and teams on the ground, was successful last year and brought 77 vacant homes back into use with funding of &euro;1.5 million that I provided.  Those are 77 homes that were not in use and are now back in use.  This year, Clare County Council is targeting 119 vacant homes to bring back into use for people on the social housing list, with funding of &euro;1.7 million which the Government provided for Clare.  We need to and will build more homes but we need to better use the existing stock.  In less than two years, we will have brought back nearly 200 vacant homes in Clare for the use of our citizens and that is good.</p></speech>

Returning the voids to use and getting people into those homes is important.  It is awful to see a house boarded up or lying idle.  On the theme of housing in Clare, I raise the issue of Traveller accommodation.</p> <p>The issue of Traveller accommodation has received a great deal of coverage in recent months.  At times, the media and many people round on the local authorities and criticise them in that regard.  I want to put that in context in County Clare.  Fifty per cent of the homeless people in Clare are Traveller families.  This area is hugely resource-intensive and the council has been seeking the assistance of the Department by way of submissions for funding, in particular for a housing welfare manager to oversee the homeless action team.  I hope the Minister will consider that.  He knows this sector well.  It is resource-intensive and without the right supports it flounders.  Building houses is one response.  Addressing the plethora of issues in terms of sifting through applicants and drilling down into their familial issues requires resourcing.  I hope the Minister will make some positive announcements in that regard very shortly.</p></speech>

I recall thinking at the time that the houses were among the most expensive social houses ever built in Clare, but he explained that was because of the increase in build standards required - be that as it may.  My question to the Minister relates to how much more expensive the building of these houses has become as a result of materials inflation, which is an issue I raised earlier.  This affects one-off builds, but it also affects the capacity of local authorities to deliver houses.  There is huge material inflation, especially, but not just, in timber.  The Minister may not have this answer off the top of his head, but how much more will the houses for which Deputy Crowe signed the contract when he was mayor of Clare cost because of inflation, because of Covid or for any other reason?  We all know that house building is becoming increasingly expensive.</p></speech>

It is good to see the Deputies working together to deliver homes for our people.</p>  <p>  My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, is doing Trojan work in the area of Traveller accommodation, with a budget of &euro;15.5 million that will be and is being spent, all of it being used on the capital side.  We want to see our local authorities using the funds that are being provided by the Government to deliver Traveller-specific accommodation.  The Minister of State is dealing with that matter on a daily basis across all local authorities, including Clare County Council.</p>  <p>  On the question posed by Deputy McNamara, there have been material increases in timber, plastics and metals, some of it Covid-related and some of it Suez- and supply chain-related.  This is being monitored by the Department's market surveillance unit.  The increases we are seeing could be temporary, but we are monitoring the situation.  The Deputy asked if this has an effect on delivery.  There is no question that it does.</p>  <p>  Deputy Carey raised the issue of affordable housing.  The Deputy will know, because he has been an ardent supporter of the Affordable Housing Bill 2021, that the Bill comes before the D&aacute;il today.  It is the most significant affordable housing Bill in the history of the State and will impact positively on County Clare.</p></speech>

When I raised the issue in the House with the T&aacute;naiste two or three months ago, he indicated that a commission on housing will be tasked with dealing with that process.  What is the position on the commission on housing, will the referendum be a priority for that commission and when can we expect to see a possible wording for that constitutional change?</p></reply>

It also commits to establishing a commission on housing to examine issues such as tenure, standards, sustainability and quality-of-life issues in the provision of housing.  It is planned that the commission on housing will review the commitment to hold a referendum on housing once it has been formally established in September of this year.  The chair designate for the commission was announced in May and work is advancing on the finalisation of the terms of reference and membership of the commission, and associated reporting requirements.</p><p>The establishment of the commission on housing provides a critical opportunity to support a considered debate, including a review of the conclusions of the eighth report of the Convention on the Constitution.  It will also provide an opportunity to involve expert stakeholders in this area, to seek to achieve consensus around what the referendum may include and to ensure that suitable and well thought-out proposals can be developed on which to consult more widely, subsequent to consideration by the Government.  It is important that any proposed amendment does not create any unforeseen consequences and provides legal clarity.  Legal advice will be needed on the implications of any proposal.  The commission on housing will provide the appropriate vehicle to support research and debate and develop proposals on this referendum.</p><p>There are a number of scheduled referendums in the programme for Government.  In terms of my remit in electoral reform, it is the case that the Taoiseach will be considering all of these in sequence.  The Citizens' Assembly on Gender Equality has proposed another referendum.  There is a schedule.  My preference is that such referendums should be stand-alone referendums on specific days.  Getting through the schedule of referendums is going to be a challenge.</p></speech>

A couple of months ago the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage had a good engagement with Home for Good.  We fully understand the complexity of changing the Constitution.  Later today, we will debate the Affordable Housing Bill 2021.  I hope that it will be passed and that we will also soon pass the Land Development Agency Bill, which will see a large-scale roll-out of affordable housing, social housing and, importantly, cost-rental housing.  I welcome the Minister's comments this morning on the housing for all strategy and the targets and objectives to be set in that regard, as well as the record budget that this Government has set aside for the delivery of that much-needed affordable housing.  The referendum on the right to housing would add to the suite of measures that the Government is introducing to provide housing and it makes sense that it would be enshrined in the Constitution by way of legislation as soon as possible.</p></speech>

The work of the Government is underpinning a right to housing.  Housing is being delivered at a scale of pace.  As my colleagues have said, there is a record capital budget for this year and that will continue into the future until we make serious inroads into the housing crisis.  It is important to note that the right to housing in recognised in Europe in the constitutions of Belgium, Finland, Greece, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Sweden and in legislation in Austria, France, Germany, Luxembourg and the UK.  Around the world, the right to housing is included in 81 constitutions.  There is good precedence for the commission on housing to look to other jurisdictions in getting the wording correct on a right to housing.  The proposal has to be delivered in the correct way and, as has been said, in a way that does not deliver any unforeseen consequences.  The Government's approach to housing is on a rights base.  We are keen to deliver over the term of this Government.</p></speech>

Only 29 vacant properties have been brought back into use in the area through the various schemes introduced over the last three or four years.  Is there a particular difficulty in the D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council area in comparison with comparable councils such as Fingal County Council, Galway City Council and so on?  I am interested in hearing the Minister of State's response.</p></reply>

I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 50 together.</p>  <p>  I have had no direct interaction with D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council recently in respect of specific issues related to vacant housing.  Officials of my Department are, however, in ongoing contact with local authorities on issues related to vacant housing, providing advice and guidance where appropriate.  A series of briefing sessions for vacant home officers was organised between March and June 2020 and there is ongoing engagement with those officers as issues arise.</p>  <p>  The national vacant housing reuse strategy, which was published by my Department in 2018, provides a targeted, effective and co-ordinated approach to identifying and tackling vacancy across the country.</p> <p>The range of objectives and actions it specifies have been pursued in partnership with stakeholders and agencies across the housing sector to address vacancy in our housing stock.  In that context, all 31 local authorities have prepared a vacant homes action plan for their respective administrative areas.  These plans identify the scale of vacant homes in their jurisdiction and set ambitious but realistic targets for the number of vacant homes that can ultimately be brought back into use.  In that regard, my Department and the local authorities are being proactive in dealing with vacant properties and there are a number of schemes available to incentivise reactivating suitable dwellings into liveable housing stock.</p> <p> My Department continues to keep vacant homes schemes and the various functions of the vacant homes officers under review, with ongoing feedback from those officers.  I am anxious to ensure that best practice is implemented more consistently across local government and intend to address this by way of a circular following on from the new housing strategy, Housing for All, which will be published in the coming weeks.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-06-24a.94" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1480" speakername="Jennifer Carroll MacNeill" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021062400009#G00200"><p>I thank the Minister of State.  That is encouraging news at a national level.  I am concerned about the D&uacute;n Laoghaire area because there is a finite amount of space for new builds.  The area is bordered by the sea and is already densely populated.  We have a challenge, with a sports-mad population, to find green space for children to play.  In that context, we really depend on using existing stock efficiently and well.  The very helpful vacant homes website that Mayo County Council set up identifies that in May of this year there were 130 vacant homes but I know that is not the universe of vacancy in my area.  I refer in particular to over-the-shop units on George's Street in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  There are 264 shops on the street, which is 1.2 km long.  D&uacute;n Laoghaire is an old Victorian town and it has proved very difficult to convert over-the-shop space into residential property for a whole range of reasons, including the need for fire escapes and insurance difficulties.  These are opportunities and I know that this is an area in which the Minister of State has a keen interest.</p></speech>

A vacant homes pilot project took place involving six local authority areas, with two visual inspections six months apart.  In D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, 1,177 properties were inspected and 21 were deemed to be in long-term dereliction in that functional area following the second inspection.  We need to review our plans on vacant properties and are doing so in the context of Housing for All.  The Deputy is right to point to the potential to unlock property along a 1.2 km street in her area.  Brownfield sites and units above shops may provide suitable accommodation.  We really need to ensure that schemes are targeted to unlock the potential that exists and that is one of the key issues I am exploring in the context of the towns first proposal, to give people the opportunity to live over shops which will assist in meeting the demand for housing.  We will do our very best to deliver on those policies.</p></speech>

As the Minister of State said, this is important on a number of fronts.  First, it helps to meet a housing need for different types of family units who need different types of space.  Second, it helps to revitalise our towns and increase footfall on the streets.  This is not just relevant in the D&uacute;n Laoghaire, George's Street area but is such an obvious area to try to target.  Third, from a climate perspective it is far more beneficial to intelligently and efficiently use existing stock rather than building new housing, although that is also necessary.  It is just inconceivable that as a State we would have vacant and redundant space.  I spoke with the architects in D&uacute;n Laoghaire about this and about the challenges they face.  Clearly the fire escape issue is a difficult one but there are ways of getting around it.  The bigger issue is insurance.  I urge the Minister of State to have a conversation with the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Fleming, about this because the insurance differential for having commercial space on the ground floor and residential space above seems to be an almost insurmountable difficulty.  I would ask that the Minister and the Ministers of State have a discussion with their colleagues in the Department of Finance about this.</p></speech>

This is an issue that we have been looking at in Cork city for the past ten or 12 years.  I discussed with the Minister a number of weeks ago the fact that there are 92,000 vacant homes in this State but we have only three full-time vacant home officers.  The Minister of State said that a grant of &euro;50,000 is available to local authorities but that is only a drop in the ocean.  There are vacant properties in areas where there is insufficient land available to provide housing for people.  I accept that the Minister of State is genuine with regard to this issue.  I urge him to speak to the Minister and officials in the Department about the possibility of providing more resources in this area.  This is a quick way to get housing onto the market and to provide accommodation for people.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-06-24a.98" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1519" speakername="Cathal Crowe" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021062400009#G00600"><p>In any county there are typically 15 to 17 communities which one can mark off on the housing application list in terms of where one would like to live.  In between those communities, there is a scattering of towns and villages that do not have social housing or in which local authorities are no longer providing social housing.  In county Clare there are places like Labasheeda and Lisdoonvarna which have a range of vacant properties on their main streets, with for sale and to let signs all the way along.  People talk about the housing crisis but there are many properties that are under lock and key or that have been boarded up for many years.  It makes sense to start turning these around.  We have a policy on voids and a very positive scheme in place, to which the Minister referred earlier.  We also need to look at revitalising some of our declining rural villages, in particular the string of houses up along their main streets.  We need to see people living over shops again and we also need to turn around those vacant properties.</p></speech>

In terms of towns first, towards the end of the year we will have firm Government proposals for unlocking some of those sites that are targeted in the national planning framework and bringing them back into use.  We must also consider sites, houses and shops on main streets that can be converted through the various schemes which are currently being reviewed by the Minister in the context of Housing for All.  It is also important to acknowledge that local authorities have resources available to them, with a grant of &euro;50,000 for vacant homes officers.  In many local authorities vacant homes officers are working on numerous other tasks including broadband, for example, but they need to be focused on getting properties back into use.  In Cork city, an inspection showed that only 16 properties were vacant over the course of six months.  This is something we will have to closely examine but maybe there is not as much low-hanging fruit as some would suggest.</p></speech>

The first deals with historical vacancies, the ones that have not been filled for quite some time and asks why that is the case.  The second deals with future opportunities and asks what posts will be created and how we plan to recruit for them.  I am particularly interested in the area of west Waterford which has been lacking a ranger for a long period.</p></reply>

Staffing levels across the Department, including conservation rangers, are kept under regular review in line with emerging business needs and Government policy on public sector pay and staffing, as advised by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  </p><p>I have previously confirmed that the filling of up to 60 conservation ranger posts, announced by the Minister in Killarney National Park a number of weeks ago, is a priority for the Department within the requirements of the policy on public sector pay and staffing.  A national recruitment process for conservation rangers was advertised late last year and is being managed by the Public Appointments Service, PAS.  The process is at an advanced stage, with a panel of successful candidates now in place and the first 20 currently being assigned to locations around Ireland, including Waterford.</p><p>Front-line conservation rangers are deployed through a regional structure and assignments are determined in light of departmental business needs and priorities.  A calibrated proportion of the expansion of the ranger cohort will be assigned to the Waterford area and similarly across the country.  While it is too early to be specific as to the exact number of additional rangers to be assigned to the Waterford area, the proportion of rangers will be pitched at a level to meet local conservation needs and will be based on the outcome of the recruitment process.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-06-24a.105" nospeaker="true" time="10:10:00" ><p>I want to use this opportunity to say that we were delighted with the additional intake of rangers this year.  We had initially proposed an intake of 20 rangers and there was an initial ten in that.  Thanks to the work of my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, we were able to up that figure to 60, which is badly needed.  Boots on the ground are what we need across the country if we are to tackle the biodiversity crisis.</p><p>From visiting our national parks in recent weeks, I want to pay tribute to our conservation rangers and staff in the NPWS across the country.  They have done an incredible job throughout the Covid pandemic.  Our national parks and nature reserves were open in order to provide refuge and solace to people throughout what has been an incredibly difficult 15 or 16 months.  They had to reconfigure our spaces and introduce different systems to manage social distancing.  The huge numbers who attended and visited our parks are testament to the great work that has been done by our staff.  I was in Connemara last week to see the fantastic work that was done there and the Minister and I were in Killarney National Park following the fires.  I pay tribute to our staff on the ground there who managed that difficult situation so well.</p><p>We know we are in a biodiversity emergency and that the additional rangers we will take on in the coming months will provide a valuable service, including in the area of west Waterford, which Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh has raised.  We have a major job of work to do and I am confident that with the additional resources provided through budget 2021 for the NPWS; we will be in a better place where we can meet those demands and manage our national parks in a way that is a safe and happy experience for visitors but that is also good for nature and biodiversity.  We are grateful to the organisations throughout the country that partner with our national parks to make them as good an experience for people as possible and to make them safe refuges for nature as well.</p></speech>

As he will know, Green Party representatives are often the first port of call if something is happening that people identify within their environment that they have a problem with.  The speed of reaction is so important because once the tree is cut down, the nest is lost or the hedge is grubbed out - that is it.  It is a damage that cannot be undone.  That speed and those boots on the ground that the Minister of State talks about are vitally important.  I would have come across a number of particularly egregious acts in west Waterford but because there was an absence of a conservation ranger and because the county council is overstretched in this department, by the time there was an official State reaction the damage was done and it could not be undone or unpicked.  I welcome this announcement of 60 rangers but I want clear details and timelines on when those posts will be filled.</p></speech>

On the specific issue of responding to particular incidents, yesterday the Minister and I were able to sign off on a memorandum of understanding with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on tackling wildlife crime.  This will bring a more strategic approach to the work we are doing.  Later this year we will establish a dedicated wildlife crime unit within the NPWS, which is a first for this country.  That will add additional resources and bring a much more strategic approach to tackling wildlife crime in the preservation of crime scenes and in preparing books of evidence.  We have had a number of high profile prosecutions in wildlife crime in the last year and that is down to the dedication and hard work of our NPWS staff throughout the country.  I assure the Deputy that we will meet that staffing requirement in the coming months and it will have a significant impact in collaboration and in working with agencies on the ground.</p></speech>

I know there was a historical issue that made it difficult to fill vacancies and that is why that issue in west Waterford existed according to my information.</p>  <p>  In recruiting these rangers, the other thing I would like to impress on the Minister of State is that we have to make these sustainable and good jobs.  We are talking about highly qualified people who are often very motivated and who are drawn into the field because of a particular love of biodiversity or our natural world.  We also have to make sure that this is a proper and sustainable career choice.  We have to make sure that the terms and conditions are such that we are paying qualified people at a rate that it will make sense for them to continue that on and to take the conservation of our wildlife and natural world very seriously as a career choice into the future.</p></speech>

It is a very important development that additional boots on the ground, as the Minister of State put it, will be in place.  I thank the Minister and the Minister of State for coming to Killarney so swiftly recently in the aftermath of the devastating fires there.  I want to emphasise how important it is that those personnel would be put in place without delay.  There has been historical underinvestment in front-line personnel going back quite some while.  The posts that have been announced are welcome but I suspect that we will probably need to increase the numbers of personnel on the front line over the coming years.  I acknowledge again the fine work that is taking place.  I understand that the Minister of State has been to Killarney National Park twice already.  It is clear to see his enthusiasm and natural interest in the area and I thank him for all the work he is doing.</p></speech>

To respond to Deputies Griffin and &Oacute; Cathasaigh on the sustainability of the jobs, as the Deputies will be aware we are in a process of reviewing the NPWS.  Hopefully the outcome of that review will look at the sustainability of career paths within the NPWS.  In Connemara last week, we met some of our staff who are retiring after 30 or 40 years of service, some of whom would have come in at an operational grade and moved their way up.  The opportunity is there for people to have sustainable and viable careers in the NPWS and we are very grateful to our staff and to our partners on the ground, including the chambers of commerce in Connemara and Killarney.  This is a partnership approach and that collaboration will be required to tackle this crisis.  I am also conscious, as Deputy Griffin said, that this will require resources, not just this year but next year and into the next decade, which is the decade of ecosystem restoration.  That is critically important for biodiversity in this country.</p></speech>

As the Deputy will know, statutory responsibility for the provision of homeless services rests with each individual housing authority.  My Department's role in homelessness involves the provision of a national framework of policy, legislation and, importantly, the funding to underpin the role of the housing authorities in addressing homelessness at a local level.  Thankfully, as I said earlier, we are seeing significant improvements in that area year on year, with a significant reduction in homelessness.  It is still a high rate but the trend is good in that regard.</p>  <p>  All emergency accommodation, whether provided by local authorities, NGOs, voluntary bodies or privately, are required to comply with standards and these standards are monitored.  The national quality standards framework for homeless services is in place nationally for local authority and NGO-delivered services.  Local authorities also carry out inspections on facilities that are not covered under the framework.  This regime operates in parallel with, and is based on, the national quality standards framework.</p>  <p>  The standards and facilities teams in the Dublin Region Homeless Executive, DRHE, oversee all emergency accommodation in the region and seek to ensure that all relevant guidelines, policies and procedures are complied with in order to deliver a safe and comfortable place for people to stay.  The DRHE has an inspection regime in place to deal with complaints and to ensure accommodation is appropriate and safe.</p> <p>I ask any Deputy who knows of specific instances of breaches or who has concerns to raise them directly with me or the DRHE.  Separate to the service standards expected of providers according to service level agreements, all homeless service providers must meet the requirements of statutory codes, in particular the requirements of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 and, indeed, the Fire Services Acts.</p></speech>

Much work and consultation went into the creation of these standards and they are good.  It is an issue that they are not being applied to the private providers.  These services are funded by the local authorities and are in receipt of funding through the Minister's Department to provide accommodation.  We have some serious issues.  Hostels that were shut down by non-governmental organisations, NGOs, because of poor standards have been reopened by private, for-profit sector providers.  People who are experiencing homelessness are being put into rooms without windows.  Hostels have been shut down because they were not meeting minimum fire safety standards.  I have met, as I am sure the Minister has, people experiencing homelessness who tell me they feel safer sleeping on the street than going to some of these providers because standards are so low.  Why are some of the providers not applying these standards?  What specifically is the Minister going to do about it?</p></speech>

I want to make sure that those who are in emergency accommodation are only in it in the short term.  It is not a permanent solution for them or their families.  The use by families of emergency accommodation, particularly in hotels, has, thankfully, reduced by 80% year on year.</p>  <p>  I do not mind telling the Deputy that I have had discussions with the DRHE about the national quality standards framework, NQSF, and how it may be applied.  We have, effectively, a parallel system whereby the same standards are applied to private emergency accommodations, PEAs.  I want to see a reduction in our use of PEAs, which is happening.  I have met with the new chief executive of the DRHE about this matter and I have been assured that detailed inspections of private accommodation facilities are taking place.  We want to make sure that the standards applied are the same in public and private accommodation.  I will come back to the Deputy with more information in my supplementary reply.</p></speech>

The standards are not being applied to the private providers.  There is talk of parallel standards but when it comes to the inspection forms, the NQSF is a detailed inspection form of 12 pages that touches on many issues and contains many good standards whereas the forms for inspections of private accommodations reflect a bare, minimal process.  Much of the good stuff that is being applied to not-for-profit accommodation is not applied to the private providers.  I am bringing to the Minister's attention the fact that all the private, for-profit providers are not being inspected to the national quality standard as was the intention.  When is he going to sort this out?  It is not good enough that people experiencing homelessness are living in substandard accommodation, at times, and that those accommodations are not being inspected to the national minimum quality standard.</p></speech>

We provide the policy framework and funding for them to do it.  That is important because each local authority and its staff know an area better than a central authority would.  The issue is acute in Dublin because that is where the majority of homeless people present.  Dublin also contains the majority of homeless services.</p>  <p>  I regularly meet with representatives of the DRHE, Dublin City Council and others on this matter.  Standards are applied to private emergency accommodation.  They are parallel standards to the NQSF.  I have discussed with the DRHE the benefit that would potentially accrue from applying those standards across the board.  We need to get there.  It is a detailed and complex process.  We have improved the services in PEAs.  I believe that the standards and services anyone in emergency accommodation receives should be the same regardless of which type of accommodation a person is in.  It is something at which I am actively looking.  The Deputy has showed a particular interest in this area and has regularly questioned me about it.  I have taken those matters up with the DRHE and I will report progress to him.</p></speech>

It is not viable for first-time buyers to purchase and do them up.  It is a crying shame that we have so many vacant properties all over Ireland, yet it is too expensive to get them up to the proper standards.  We need to be more imaginative and that is why I am asking the Minister to engage with the Department of Finance to see what can be done to assist such purchasers.</p></reply>

The Government set out its housing priorities in the programme for Government across numerous areas, including homelessness, affordable home ownership, private and social housing delivery, rent reform and planning.  My Department is focusing on moving those priorities forward.  To deliver on these commitments, I will publish a new housing policy and action plan, housing for all, in July.  It will provide a whole-of-Government approach to housing policy and is at an advanced stage of development at present.  The plan will factor in existing demand together with future projected demand and put in place the steps needed to deliver an average of 33,000 new homes per annum during the period 2020 to 2031.</p>  <p>  In addition, we are advancing work on the town centres first initiative which is specifically considering the actions required to address vacancy and dereliction in town centres while supporting more opportunities for living in towns.  The project is being led by colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke.  My Department and local authorities are being proactive in dealing with vacant properties and there are currently a number of schemes available to incentivise suitable dwellings into liveable housing stock.  I am also advised by the Minister for Finance that the help-to-buy initiative, a scheme to assist first-time purchasers with the deposit they need to buy or build a new house or apartment, may apply in certain circumstances relating to the conversion of non-residential buildings to residences.  Similarly, the living city initiative may also be of relevance in certain locations.  It may require some tweaking, which could be addressed in the town centres first initiative.</p></speech>

It is welcome that the help-to-buy scheme would be expanded because it is a good scheme.  It would make sense to do that where properties have been vacant for, for example, two years.  I also feel that an expansion of what worked under the home renovation incentive, HRI, scheme, that is, tax relief on the VAT on materials and labour, in respect of such properties for first-time buyers would be very welcome.  A long number of years ago, I helped to draw up what became the repair and leasing scheme.  I was not happy with the amount of investment from the State that went into that.  We need to give people support because we have seen that where grants are available, people use them.</p>  <p>  I feel first-time buyers should be given exemptions to VAT charges, as I have mentioned.  They should also be exempt from reconnection fees.  Such fees are expensive and we could look at that with the utility companies, whether we are talking about the reconnection of water or electricity.  Can we look at giving a capital gains tax break to a person selling a property to a first-time buyer?  That might get properties onto the market and give the first-time buyer a more competitive place in that market.  Those things could help to free up properties and put more money in the pockets of the people who are trying to purchase them to do them up.  Those people are trying to compete with investors right now and they cannot do that.</p></speech>

The Government and the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, are considering, as a part of the town centres first initiative, a suite of measures that will support and unlock much of that potential.  Deputies across the House have spoken about the need to unlock the potential in our smaller town centres and on our high streets.  The option of living above shops should be available.  Shops should be brought back down into full occupancy, given the scale of the challenges in retail.  The town centres first interdepartmental group, established by the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, in November 2020, will consider many of these fiscal measures, as well as other potential measures relating to the conservation of historic buildings and grant schemes that are much more targeted at bringing many properties back into productive use and providing a high level of thermal and acoustic comfort that makes it possible for people to live comfortably in town centres while a night-time economy is still being managed.</p> <p>A wide suite of measures, therefore, will be brought forward under the town centres first policy, which will help unlock this potential we all want to see happen.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-06-24a.129" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1581" speakername="Brendan Griffin" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021062400012#K00200"><p>Town centres are very important but there are also huge numbers of properties scattered all over the countryside.  Such a scheme could very well apply to those properties.  I will also add another suggestion.  Right now, under planning laws, a person can extend at the rear of a building without planning.  I believe the dimensions are approximately 400 square feet.  It might make sense to double that exemption in rural areas, and perhaps within a 50 km zone, and increase the dimensions by 50% to 800 square feet in a rural area and 600 square feet in an urban area.  Many of those properties were quite small compared to modern standards.  Again, there would be less red tape for someone who is seeking to convert the property and, in some cases, build on such basic things as a kitchen or bathroom.  A person should be able to do so without having to go through the whole planning process.  Speed up the process, bring more of these properties into circulation and get people into homes.  As I said, there are thousands of them out there.  It is a crying shame in a housing crisis that we have so many vacant units all over the country.  We need to be imaginative in how we solve this.</p></speech>

I see many of these properties as I travel across the country, not just in the west but all over.  As I said, it is important that we use every mechanism possible to unlock the potential and get them back into productive use.</p>  <p>  Specifically, around the town centres, we are looking at four specific areas around governance, enabling economic and social purpose, a new living towns approach and aligning investment and resources.  That will, therefore, address those specific issues in urban clusters and smaller urban centres.</p>  <p>  As Deputy Griffin said, however, this perhaps needs to be broadened out and looked at in consideration of rural houses and cottages, which are beautiful in their own right and have a heritage aspect, which could be brought back into use.  The Minister of State, Deputy Burke, is certainly giving consideration to that but these are all very worthwhile suggestions.  As I said, every opportunity we can get to try to unlock that potential should be explored and considered.</p></speech>

Ireland distinguishes between the territory of the state of Israel and the territories occupied since 1967 in line with international law and the relevant UN Security Council resolutions.</p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to use our seat on the UN Security Council to draw attention to the issue of settlements, demolitions, evictions and settler violence.  When I addressed the Security Council on 16 May, I raised illegal Israeli settlements and their impact on the viability of a future two-state solution.  Later today, Ireland will join a meeting of the Security Council with the UN special co-ordinator on the Middle East, which will focus on the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 2334.</p>  <p>  At an informal meeting of EU foreign ministers on 27 May, I called on EU colleagues to address the issues of settlement expansion in a more robust way.  I raised these issues again at the Foreign Affairs Council on 21 June.  The EU and the international community more broadly has an obligation to act and seek to address these root causes of violence and tension.</p>  <p>  Ireland consistently conveys our views on settlements to the Israeli authorities directly.  I have met with the Israeli ambassador and conveyed in the strongest terms my concerns on settlement announcements and associated infrastructure development.  Department officials work closely with the Office of the United Nations Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process, and UN agencies on the ground, on these issues.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s ambassador in Tel Aviv raises this issue regularly with the Israeli Government.  Ireland's representative office in Ramallah has made a number of visits, along with EU representatives, to sensitive sites of concern in the West Bank.  Ireland&rsquo;s position is informed by international law, respect for human rights and the negative political impact of settlement activities on the prospects for a future negotiated peace agreement.</p></speech>

We need to do more, however.  We have now declared that Israel has breached international law and continues to do so at an accelerated pace.  This week, sanctions were reimposed on Russia for its illegal actions - as the international community has declared - on annexing Crimea.  We now need to push for similar sanctions on Israel for its grave violations of international law and continued policies of apartheid.  We should now be pushing for a downgrading of economic, cultural, military and diplomatic relations with a country that has and continues to breach international law.</p>  <p>  I need to hear the Minister state this is what we are pushing for when we say we are highlighting these issues.  It is all well and good highlighting them but the perceived impunity with which Israel believes it can continue to operate needs to be challenged.  It can done only by imposing similar sanctions as we have on other countries that have broken international law.</p></speech>

The question of boycotts and sanctions has been discussed on many occasions in the Oireachtas.  The Government does not support boycotts on Israel.  Such sanctions would be ineffective and, more importantly, counterproductive.</p>  <p>  Although we differ on issues to do with the occupation, we do not regard ourselves as hostile to Israel.  If we are to achieve what the Government wants to continue to advocate and work towards, which is a peace settlement that results in two states living side by side, with security issues and sovereignty issues addressed, then we need to maintain a relationship, particularly now that there is a new Government in Israel.  We need to work to build consensus within the EU and within the international community in terms of how the international community works with the new Israeli Government and the Palestinian authority.  There is work to be done there as well.</p>  <p>  We must work to ensure we isolate and reduce the influence of Hamas and other terrorist groups in order that we can ensure good international politics and the right kinds of interventions result in both sides, through legitimate political leadership on the Israeli and Palestinian sides, working towards a negotiated peaceful solution with the support of the international community.  That is the objective we are after here.  Isolating, boycotting and targeting Israel at this stage would be counterproductive towards achieving those aims, and would potentially undermine Ireland's capacity to influence others to build the kind of consensus I believe is needed.</p>  <p>  That said, we will of course continue to raise these issues.  Ireland is probably the most vocal country in the European Union on this issue.  We have asked the commission to produce a toolbox to ensure we can use the leverage we have to the greatest extent possible to move relationships in the right direction.  Talk around boycotts and sanctions at this stage, however, isolates Ireland rather than puts us in the middle of an influential discussion to bring about change.  We have an opportunity now with the new Israeli Government to make progress and we should focus on doing that.</p></speech>

What we now have is a new Israeli Prime Minister, who is committed to the illegal colonial settlements and their expansions.</p> <p>In recent weeks, we have seen continued abuses, human rights violations and attempts to remove Palestinians in Sheikh Jarrah and elsewhere in the occupied territories.  We see the continued bombardment of Gaza despite a so-called ceasefire.  The policies that have been attempted up to this point are failing.  Israel is a rogue state and a continual breacher of international law.  It needs to be treated accordingly and we must act, at national, EU and international level, in that regard.  This House has passed a historic resolution but there must be consequences arising out of that action.</p> <p> Does the Minister agree that now is the time, at national level, to move to recognise the state of Palestine?  It is something we, as a State, can do.  If he is hell-bent against moving to impose sanctions, a position with which I totally disagree, then we must move on recognising the Palestinian state.  We also must move forward the Control of Economic Activity (Occupied Territories) Bill 2018.  What are the Minister's intentions on those two specific issues?  Will he recognise the state of Palestine and will he progress the 2018 Bill or, at the very least, ask that its provisions be looked at on an EU level?</p></speech>

I have repeatedly referred to the illegality of settlements, settlement expansion, demolitions and forced evictions.  I have been highly critical, both nationally and internationally, of those policies because I believe they are counterproductive to achieving the outcome of a peaceful resolution to a conflict that has gone on for far too long.  Do I believe that taking the approach the Deputy is advocating, which is to try to isolate Israel through boycotts and sanctions, is the right mechanism to achieve a resolution?  No, I do not, because, in doing that, we would isolate Ireland rather than isolating Israel.</p>  <p>  We need to build an international consensus and Ireland has been at the centre of trying to do that.  We will continue to do so at an EU level.  We will continue to ask the European Commission to bring forward a toolbox that enables us to use the EU's leverage, which is far more powerful than Ireland's leverage alone.  That is what we will focus on.  It is what, in my view, foreign policy is about.  The debates in this Chamber are, of course, important and Ireland needs to lead by example and try to give global leadership in forums such as the EU and UN in an effort to bring about real change to protect Palestinians and international law.

As he knows, I have strong views on this matter, as do many others in the House.  I am deeply concerned by the impact of the recent escalation of the conflict on children in the occupied Palestinian territories and in Israel.  I have been clear about the need to respect international humanitarian law, including the protection of civilians, particularly children, and the need for any response to attacks to be proportionate.</p>  <p>  In my address to the UN Security Council on 16 May, I made it very clear that children must never be made prisoners of history.  According to the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, of the 260 Palestinian fatalities in the recent conflict, 66 were children.  In Israel, two of the 13 fatalities were children.  In addition to the tragedy of these killings and injuries, no child anywhere should have to endure the trauma of an onslaught of rockets and missiles.  In my address to the Security Council, I called for violations against children to end.</p>  <p>  As I have stated, the ceasefire that came into effect on 21 May is welcome and we must do all we can to support it.  Tensions are still high in the region and there remains a responsibility on all parties to ensure the ceasefire is respected.  All unilateral actions that could increase tension must be avoided.  Responsibility also lies with the international community to support the ceasefire and encourage the parties towards a return to political engagement.  This is an effort to which I am fully committed.</p>  <p>  The focus now in the Gaza Strip is on recovery and protection.  On 19 May, I announced an additional &euro;1.5 million in emergency humanitarian support for the occupied Palestinian territory in response to emergency appeals from both the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, UNRWA, and UNICEF.  I will continue to highlight this issue at the UN and through the EU and support international efforts to ensure the current ceasefire holds.</p></speech>

There is a project in Palestine called the Better Learning Programme, which is funded by the Irish taxpayer and the Norwegian Refugee Council.  Eleven children participating in that programme were murdered in May, most of them in their homes.  I do not know how the Minister and his counterparts can stand over, and even legitimise, the state of Israel when it conducts murderous bombings of innocent people.  It is incredible that the Minister can stand here and say he does not see how a policy of sanction against Israel could be worthwhile.  I find that absolutely incredible.  Would he have said the same in the 1980s when apartheid in South Africa was at its height?  I know he would not have done so.  Why does he say it now when there is apartheid in Israel and that state has murdered not only the children in the recent conflict but thousands of children over the past 40 years?</p></speech>

Ireland, on its own, does not have the capacity to impose sanctions on Israel and should not do so.  We would end up isolating ourselves, not Israel, if we tried to do that.  The way to do this is to focus on the relationship between Israel and the EU because that is where there is real leverage.  We are trying to work within the EU system, and with the UN, to ensure there is real engagement with the new Israeli Government and that it is very clear regarding the intent of the EU in ensuring the <i>status quo</i>between Israel and Palestinians, which results in cycles of violence every number of years, is not sustained.  We have to change that and the direction of it.  In my judgment, the way to do so is to maintain a relationship with the Israeli Government and use the tools we have available to us to bring about a change in approach that can result in a peace negotiation.  We also must do that with the Palestinian Authority.  We need to empower democratic, moderate forces across Palestine and challenge violent, extremist forces within Palestinian communities.</p><p>In regard to Gaza, I assume the Deputy has been there.

Was there any punishment imposed or any effort to secure accountability?  Was there any kind of sanction in regard to the economic and trade agreement between Israel and the EU, which is worth tens of billions of euro per year?  I already know the answer is "No".  There has been no sanction or punishment.  The innocent people of Palestine suffer while other people pay lip service to what is happening.</p> <p>The Minister must go back and say to his EU counterparts that Israel is not a normal state but an apartheid one that lives on violence and fear.  If there is no sanction or punishment, Israel will continue to do this and we will still be having this conversation.  The only way Israel will come to heel is when it is punished economically and legally.</p></speech>

I am trying to ensure we are a relevant partner internationally, influencing decisions that impact on the lives of young Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank and indeed young Israelis as well, who have also lost their lives, although the injury and loss of life has been completely disproportionate, as it always is when there are rounds of conflict between both sides because of the military might on one side.  Having said that, the Deputy talks about punishment, sanction and so on.  We do not have the capacity to deliver that as a State unless we can convince others it is the right thing to do.  That is how the relationship between the EU and other parts of the world works.  One needs to win the argument not just in this Chamber but across the European Union as well.  I am trying to ensure that our position remains credible, that we have a good and functioning but honest and blunt relationship with the Israeli Government, and that we have a close relationship with the Palestinian Authority as well.  In doing so, we are able to influence both in the context of trying to move towards a negotiated solution.  Otherwise we will be back here again in a few years' time talking about the loss of lives of children and civilians, similarly to what we have seen in recent weeks.  That is the approach we continue to take.</p></speech>

I am really glad he asked it.  I know there is huge interest in the Israel-Palestine question and that is always going to be a big feature of foreign affairs questions but there are so many other really significant issues and conflicts that Ireland is involved in also, particularly in the context of the UN Security Council, and this is one of them.</p>  <p>  I am extremely concerned by the ongoing conflict in Tigray.  Notwithstanding commitments made, the situation on the ground is deteriorating.  Yesterday we heard deeply disturbing reports of an air strike on civilians in a crowded market, which, if deliberately targeted, would constitute a war crime.  An immediate ceasefire is urgently required.  In this regard, it is imperative that Eritrean forces leave Tigray immediately.  They have committed to doing so and it has not happened.</p>  <p>  I am alarmed by credible warnings of famine coming from UN organisations.  I am also concerned by ongoing attacks on humanitarian workers.  There is an urgent need for full humanitarian access, which is being partially but not fully facilitated.  Ireland joined recent international calls for a humanitarian ceasefire to allow for planting and to avert the risk of famine.</p>  <p>  Ireland continues to work on the UN Security Council to ensure it addresses the situation in Tigray.  Most recently, on 15 June, we called an informal meeting of the UN Security Council that focused on the humanitarian situation.  In April, Ireland led the negotiation of a council press statement on the situation in Tigray, which was the first time the UN Security Council spoke publicly on the ongoing crisis.  We have also used council thematic discussions on conflict and hunger, and on conflict-related sexual violence, to highlight these aspects of the crisis.  It is fair to say our role in bringing the crisis in Tigray to the attention of the council has been widely recognised internationally.</p>  <p>  Ireland continues to support a strong and constructive EU response to the crisis.  I underlined our real concern in this regard at the foreign affairs committee on 21 June.  EU foreign ministers will discuss Ethiopia again in July.  I continue to engage with key interlocutors on the situation, including in the region; in the Gulf, where I met a number of counterparts last week; and in the African Union.  I plan to visit Ethiopia during a visit to the Horn of Africa next month.  My Department, through Irish Aid, has provided over &euro;3.2 million to support the humanitarian response in Tigray and the refugee response in neighbouring Sudan through our UN and NGO partners on the ground.  Further humanitarian support is under active consideration.</p></speech>

We must continue to keep the focus on the situation in Tigray.  It is unfortunate that the statement from the UN Security Council, while welcome, did not go far enough.  It did not demand that Eritrean troops withdraw from the Tigray region.  It did not mention the Amhara influence and involvement in ethnic cleansing in the Tigray region.  A number of things must happen now.  We must have all war crimes independently investigated.  That is something that must happen immediately.  Those who perpetrate such war crimes must be held to account.  We also need full humanitarian access to the region as well.</p></speech>

Food insecurity continues to be of serious concern.  Over 5.2 million people are in need of emergency food aid right now.  Alarmingly, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, UNOCHA, has confirmed that 350,000 people are in imminent danger of famine.  There are grave concerns about levels of malnutrition, particularly among young children and pregnant and breastfeeding women.  The United Nations Children's Fund, UNICEF, has warned that at least 33,000 severely malnourished children face death by starvation if there is no intervention.  I repeat that we are talking about 33,000 children.  We continue to hear disturbing reports of the use of starvation as a weapon of war.  One such report came from UNOCHA chief, Mr. Mark Lowcock, at the Security Council discussion on Tigray called by Ireland on 15 June.  Ireland has also highlighted the issue of severe food insecurity in Tigray during recent Security Council discussions on hunger and conflict.</p>  <p>  There is a real crisis on the ground.  We need to shine a light on it, and we are doing so.  People need to be held to account.  It is a highly complex situation in Tigray.  There are no easy answers in the context of the overall political challenges for Ethiopia.  Consequently, we are treading carefully here but we are also strong in our language in highlighting the plight of people on the ground.  This desperate situation involves potential famine and starvation.  The use of sexual violence as a tool of war has been documented also.  We will continue to focus on this until we get - we hope - a permanent ceasefire and a political dialogue, which is what is needed.</p></speech>

There is indeed continued mass rape, summary execution of youths and men and deliberate destruction of economic, social and religious infrastructure.  All of this is continuing at an accelerated pace.  We must move beyond the words of condemnation and must now use our influence.  We are probably one of the countries that hold the most influence in the region, given our long-standing ties, and we must put that pressure on the Ethiopian Government.  I would like to hear what the Minister has to say about our engagement with the Ethiopian Government on the issue.  We must also move beyond sanctions.</p>  <p>The position is grave and in our engagement with the Ethiopian Government we must apply pressure for full humanitarian access to the region.  We must also consider an international arms embargo on Ethiopia.  Would the Minister support or advocate for such action at EU and UN Security Council level?</p></speech>

What we understand happened yesterday will increase even more the need for international intervention here.  A crowded market seems to have been targeted with an air strike, and where we think up to 60 people have been killed, with hundreds of people injured.  There seems to be evidence that ambulances travelling to the scene from a nearby hospital were deliberately prevented from getting there for a period.  These are really worrying accounts of what may well turn out to be war crimes and undoubted breaches of international and humanitarian law.</p>  <p>  The challenge is first to get a ceasefire and, second, to get humanitarian assistance to people who need it.  Third, we need to ensure we have a credible reporting mechanism that is independent and accepted internationally when it comes to establishing facts on the ground.  Fourth, the Eritrean troops in Ethiopia and Tigray should go home and not be there.  They are either invited to be there or they have invaded; it is one or the other but, either way, they should not be there.  Both the Ethiopian and Eritrean Governments have confirmed at UN level that those troops will return to Eritrea but that does not seem to have happened.</p>  <p>  We must work with the Ethiopian Government and insist on shining a light on atrocities if and when they are happening.  We are trying to get that balance right.  I will visit Ethiopia and, I hope, the Tigray region in a few weeks.</p></speech>

These measures target those behind the repression, those responsible for the forced landing of the Ryanair flight in Minsk on 23 May and several prominent business figures who support and benefit from the Lukashenko regime.  Ministers also agreed on sectors to be targeted by economic sanctions and work is under way to implement that agreement.  Although there have been some signs of willingness from the Belarusian authorities to move the two individuals arrested on 23 May, Mr. Roman Protasevich and Ms Sofia Sapega, to a less onerous form of detention, Ireland will continue to insist on their immediate and unconditional release.</p>  <p>  Ireland, the EU and our like-minded international partners are united in calling for the regime to end the repression against its own people and for the Belarusian authorities to co-operate fully with international investigations into the forced landing of the Ryanair aircraft.  Ireland played a constructive role in the successful adoption of an EU-led resolution at the Human Rights Council that gave the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights a mandate to investigate human rights violations in Belarus.  Her team is scrutinising more than 2,000 reports of human rights violations and we support this work.</p>  <p>  The EU will also seek a mandate renewal for the UN special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Belarus during the 47th session of the Human Rights Council.  Ensuring accountability will remain a key priority for Ireland.</p></speech>

I very much welcome the targeted sanctions, asset freezing and travel bans for the 86 people and entities associated with the Lukashenko regime.  It is a very positive development.  I also welcome that the Belarusian national airline is banned from EU airspace and it is likely that more targeted economic sanctions are coming down the track, perhaps even as early as this weekend.</p>  <p>  How does the Minister see this playing out over the next couple of months?  We are all aware that the United Nations International Civil Aviation Organisation was tasked with formally investigating the Ryanair incident, with a report to be submitted by 26 June, which is only two days away.  Does the Minister see that deadline sticking and the report being submitted?  Does he expect the report will be published and, if so, when is that likely to happen so we can all read exactly what happened?</p></speech>

This incident has, in many ways, galvanised the EU in its response to the Lukashenko regime.  A Ryanair plane, registered in Poland but flying from Athens to Vilnius, was effectively hijacked in the sky - that is what happened - and the pilot was told there was potentially a bomb on the plane and it had to turn around and fly to land in Minsk.  It was escorted by a military aircraft and when the plane landed, the passengers were kept on it for quite a period while military police came on and took certain passengers off before arresting them forcefully.  That is not acceptable and really focused the EU's attention on the intervention that is necessary in the context of what is happening in Belarus.</p>  <p>  I suspect there will be much pressure for the report to be accurately concluded and be made public.  I do not have exact dates around that and Ireland does not control it.  I am sure the Ryanair airline will contribute fully to the investigation.</p>  <p>  More broadly with respect to Belarus, I suspect the ongoing repression in the country will continue for some time.  The EU is certainly resolute and united in the action and position we must take to change those facts on the ground and to allow the people of Belarus to choose their own political leadership.</p></speech>

Is there anything we can do at a national level to demonstrate our solidarity with and support for the people of Belarus and the political opposition in exile?  I would be grateful for the Minister's thoughts on whether we should invite the opposition leader here to address the Houses of the Oireachtas, whether at a committee or in plenary session, either in person or remotely.  He met her in Brussels recently and she appears to be very principled and capable.  I would be grateful for his thoughts on whether that would be possible.  I know she has a very busy schedule but we could at least extend an invitation and leave it up to her to decide whether to accept or decline it.</p></speech>

Of course, she is living in Lithuania now for her own protection.  She is planning to come to Ireland and we have extended an open invitation to her.  We expect she will be here next month and I look forward to welcoming her here.  She knows Ireland well, by the way.  As a young girl she lived with a family for different periods in County Tipperary.</p> <p>She learned how to speak English here and is very familiar with Ireland.  Ms Tsikhanouskaya has a lot of affection towards this country.  I believe that Ms Tsikhanouskaya will get a very strong welcome and a lot of solidarity when she comes here, in the context of the dangerous, difficult and challenging work she is trying to do for her country, her own personal circumstances and those of her husband and children given their vulnerabilities, and so on.  I hope that when she comes to Ireland, Ms Tsikhanouskaya will have an opportunity to meet not just with me and with Government figures, but also with Opposition spokespersons and perhaps the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence.  Ms Tsikhanouskaya has a lot to say and we should listen.</p></speech>

I believe that in 2020, arms were transferred through the airport on 285 occasions.  Is this set to continue?</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-06-24a.180" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="11:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021062400016#O00500"><p>If the Deputy allows me to give the regulations around this, then I will answer the direct question.  The Air Navigation (Carriage of Munitions of War, Weapons and Dangerous Goods) Order 1973 prohibits the carriage of munitions of war through Irish airspace or through Irish airports on civilian aircraft unless an exemption has been granted by the Minister for Transport.  Statistics on such exemptions are published on the Department of Transport&rsquo;s website.  The process in place around the granting of such permission by the Minister for Transport is robust and includes seeking the advice of my Department on any implications for Ireland's policy of military neutrality.  Permissions are only granted where no such concerns arise.  With regard to foreign military aircraft, permission must be sought from me in advance for landings.  Such flights are routinely required to meet strict conditions to ensure compatibility with Ireland&rsquo;s policy of military neutrality: that the aircraft is unarmed, carries no arms, ammunition or explosives, must not engage in intelligence gathering and does not form part of any military operation or exercise.</p>  <p>  The Deputy refers to more than 220 occasions in 2020 when arms were transferred through the airport.  That is not quite the case.  These exemptions are sometimes for a personal protection detail where light arms are carried on the person.  For example, we met the Secretary of State Blinken a number of weeks ago and he came through Shannon Airport.  Jake Sullivan came through Shannon Airport also when we met him.  They would have had security around them, including bodyguards that were armed.  In order for that to happen they need to get an exemption for each member of their security personnel who carries a pistol on his or her person.  That is the exemption space we are talking about.  Those exemptions are not about carrying large volumes of munitions or arms through Shannon Airport.  The exemptions refer to light arms on the person, whether that is security personnel or whoever.  This is just to put it into context.  I checked this with our team before answering this question because I want to be accurate.  When exemptions are applied for, the only exemptions that are granted are, effectively, for light arms that are carried on a person.  This is obviously not the same as carrying large arms and munitions into a war setting.  That is not what is being facilitated.</p></speech>

It is, basically, another term for military weapons or munitions.  Why is neutral Ireland facilitating weapons of war going through Shannon Airport from the United States of America?  The Minister has just clarified that the exemptions must go through the Minister for Transport, if they go through.  Nearly 300 such missions were facilitated by Shannon Airport in 2020.  The Minister has said it was light arms.  How many are being facilitated in 2021?  Must the Minister for Transport personally sign off on each facilitation of arms, or is it the civil servants?  Who is it?  I believe there is a huge amount of weapons going through Shannon Airport.</p></speech>

In order for a civilian aircraft that is carrying US military personnel to travel through Shannon Airport, if any of them are carrying arms on their person there needs to be an exemption for that.  There is no exemption to carry large munitions or arms for military operations or war.  There is not.  The only exemptions here are for light arms that are carried on a person.  If a senior US official comes through Shannon Airport on a military aircraft, he or she will have a personal security detail.  There will be other cases where light arms are justified and carried, but this is different from using Shannon Airport as a stopover to carry munitions or arms to a theatre of war.  That does not happen.  I want to reassure people that this does not happen.  It is certainly the information on the brief I have anyway.  This is about light arms that are on a person where there is a justifiable reason for it.  It is no more and no less than that.  They are the exemptions that are considered by the Minister for Transport, in consultation with my Department.  Those exemptions are given when appropriate.</p></speech>

Has there been any recent review of any possible international threat to Shannon Airport by those who may be enemies of the United States of America?  We currently have Defence Forces troops in the Sahel region of Africa where there is a serious ongoing conflict.  Will the Minister offer sincere guarantees on the safety of these personnel?  Why exactly are they there?  Do our troops need to be there if there is a greater danger to their safety than in more proven peacekeeping missions?</p></speech>

I have answered the first question: there are no large-scale stocks of weapons travelling through Shannon Airport.  There are not.  The US sometimes uses Shannon Airport for refuelling to bring personnel from one part of the world to another, and not with their weapons.  When the US seeks exemptions, we are talking about light weapons that are for personal security reasons and so on, and not about soldiers with their weaponry heading for parts of the Middle East or wherever.  That is not how it is.</p>  <p>  On the mission in Mali, peacekeeping is dangerous.  As Minister for Defence, of course it is my job to ensure that we look after the safety of our own personnel and our peacekeepers, that they are trained and equipped, and that they are not put into a theatre of conflict where the risk profile has not been fully examined first.  Mali is a dangerous part of the world.  It is a very complex country and we are there to try to help to bring stability to the Sahel region and to Mali in particular.  We are involved in two missions there: a UN mission and an EU mission.  The EU mission is a training mission where our Defence Forces personnel are training Malian troops to protect themselves and their people.  Our UN mission has an Army Ranger Wing element because it is a complex mission.  I understand that they are doing an excellent job and are managing the risk appropriately.</p></speech>

The rights of LGBTQI+ people are essential human rights and Ireland strongly advocates for their promotion and protection throughout the world, including in our relations with Hungary and Poland.</p> <p>On 15 June, the Hungarian National Assembly passed a bill with the official title "Stricter measures against paedophile criminals and on amending legislation related to the protection of children".  While ostensibly a child protection law, amendments added to the bill&rsquo;s original text mean this proposed legislation provides for measures with disquieting and far-reaching negative implications for Hungary's LGBTQI+ community.  The new law provides for restrictions on LGBTQI+ representation in media.  There is also a de facto prohibition on talks on LGBTQI+ issues in schools and educational programmes.  This means that only organisations approved by the minister of education will be able to provide such talks and school principals and teachers would need to secure special permission to undertake such lessons. </p> <p> Such legislation has no place in the EU.  It will lead to further marginalisation and stigmatisation of the LGBTQI+ community.  Under Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union, the EU is founded on shared values, including human dignity, freedom, equality and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities.  This law is fundamentally at odds with these values and I urge the Hungarian Government to reconsider the decision to introduce this bill.  At my meeting last month with the Hungarian foreign minister, I highlighted the importance of the EU demonstrating tolerance.</p> <p> The Government has publicly expressed its deep concerns regarding the anti-LGBTQI+ aspects of this new law.  At the most recent meeting of the General Affairs Council on 22 June, there was an Article 7 hearing on Hungary&rsquo;s adherence to the EU values enshrined in Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union.  Ireland actively participated in this hearing and the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, firmly articulated Ireland's views on this issue as well as on issues related to the rule of law in Hungary.  Ireland also supported a joint statement at the Council by the Benelux foreign ministers, which expressed grave concern at the law and its capacity to further stigmatise and endanger the safety of the LGBTQI+ community in Hungary.</p> <p> The embassy of Ireland in Hungary has actively supported statements of concern made locally by like-minded partners and has registered deep concern about this law and its implications for equality and human rights.  The embassy is also co-ordinating this year&rsquo;s statement by embassies in Hungary supporting the Budapest Pride parade, which takes place on 24 July.</p> <p> We also regularly raise our concerns on this issue with the Polish authorities.  In particular, I have written to my Polish counterpart to set out the concerns that have been expressed by Irish people and by the large Polish community living in Ireland.  I also underlined the shared commitments of Ireland and Poland to equality and non-discrimination as EU member states. </p> <p> The embassy of Ireland in Warsaw undertakes a number of initiatives to demonstrate support for the LGBTQI+ community in Poland, including participating in the Warsaw Pride parade and actively engaging with civil society groups in Poland supporting the community.  The ambassador also signs an annual open letter of support for efforts to raise public awareness of the issues affecting the LGBTQI+ community in Poland.</p> <p> As I said at the outset, the rights of LGBTQI+ people are human rights.  It is imperative that all member states continue to respect the values to which we have all signed up.  Ireland will continue to work with our EU partners and others to constructively engage with Hungary and Poland on these important issues.</p></speech>

We are moving towards the unfortunate re-imposition of repressive regimes of the past.  Recently, Amnesty International described the new laws as an attempt by the Hungarian Government to spread hatred and we can also agree on this.  The organisation has also claimed the Orb&aacute;n Government is putting the lives of innocent people at risk of cruel political campaigns.  The Orb&aacute;n regime, which has ruled Hungary since 2010, has enacted a socially conservative policy agenda, shaping the EU member state into what he calls a bastion against liberal ideologies.</p>  <p>  This legislation should not be taken in isolation.  Last December, the Hungarian Parliament adopted a package of measures enshrining what is seen as the traditional family, effectively banning adoption by same-sex couples.  In May 2020, a ban on legally changing one's gender came into force, with rights groups warning this would expose transgender Hungarians to discrimination.  In 2018, a Government decree effectively banned universities from teaching courses on gender studies.  This legislation should not be taken in isolation.  We need to stand up to it but we also need to take serious measures to stop the spread of far right hatred, particularly in eastern European countries.</p></speech>

It was robust.  People Before Profit express our solidarity with the LGBT community not only in Hungary but across the world and in Ireland.  Given that it is Pride week, it is very relevant.  At one stage, people not only in Ireland were hounded, marginalised and put in situations where it was extremely difficult for them.  In our organisation we hold solidarity against these particularly draconian laws, which are the anti-gay laws, in Hungary.</p>  <p>  Orb&aacute;n has history in this.  He has introduced laws against immigrants and against workers to cause division.  This is not in isolation.  The far right in this country have tried to do the same to malign people of different sexual orientation.  This should never be accepted and we stand shoulder to shoulder with the LGBT community in Hungary at this time.</p></speech>

I encourage the Minister to keep up his work on highlighting our outrage at what has been happening.  Last night, as I arrived back in Leinster House from here, the Pride flag was being shone on our Parliament Buildings.  This is the position we need to maintain.  We need to be a beacon for the rest of Europe and the rest of the world, that we stand in solidarity with those people who feel so marginalised by what has happened in Hungary and Poland.</p>  <p>  I call out UEFA on its actions this week.  It bottled it when it could have stood up and made its voice heard.  It was a terrible shame it did not do so when it had the eyes of the world upon it and had an opportunity to support the LGBTQI+ community and did not do so.  It should be reminded of this.</p></speech>

It is archaic and totally out of date.  It goes against the grain of where western democracy has gone.  I was born in 1982 and went through primary and secondary school in the 1990s.  The standard back pocket slagging in the schoolyard was to throw a homophobic jibe at someone.  How far we have come now with marriage equality and the openness of our society, and this has been embraced in most other European nations.  This is where people have gone and, rightly, where society, the body politic and everyone has gone.  We should do everything we can diplomatically to condemn the decisions Hungary is taking.  As the previous speaker said with regard to UEFA, we need to stand with other nations in condemning this.  We are all about embracing inclusivity.  It is wonderful to see the Pride flags flying high in Dublin and elsewhere throughout the country this week.</p></speech>

It is not about conservative views versus liberal views.  It is about human rights.  That is what this is about.  This is why I agree with Deputy Griffin that UEFA showed cowardice on this issue.</p> <p>It has done great work in terms of trying to stamp out racism in football, as indeed have many other sporting organisations.  It is a natural extension of that to also be vocal around the need to protect and respect diversity and minorities in the context of sexual preferences and the LGBTQI+ community. <br/><br/>It was unfortunate.  There was an opportunity for sport, while it was under the international spotlight, to make a clear statement on the need to protect minorities and express a concern about an EU country moving in a different direction.  It decided not to do that because it regarded it as a political statement which should not be part of sport.  Protecting people's human rights is not a political statement <i>per se</i>.  It is what we are about in the European Union.  It is the core of our value system.  It is the foundation on which we have built this incredible peace, economic and environmental project, and all of the other things that the EU does together.  It is what it is about.<br/><br/>There are certain core principles that we agree together to protect and enhance, not just within Europe but in other parts of the world.  When one country is passing legislation that the rest of us feel is counter to that, we call it out.  It does not mean that we do not have a good relationship with Hungary.  It is part of a shared Union with us.  We believe it is not acting in a way that is consistent with EU values on this issue, and we need to call it out. <br/><br/>As Members said, when we walk through Dublin during Pride month, we will see Pride flags everywhere.  Buildings have promotional rainbow branding all over the place.  Schools, businesses and Parliament buildings have flags because it is now part of who we are in terms of wanting to express nationally and internationally that we value minorities.  We do not discriminate or isolate them in the way that they would have experienced in the past.  We are public about that, and that is very much part of what the European Union should be about. <br/><br/>I welcome the comments.  We will continue, in the appropriate way, to highlight our concerns and do what we can to try to force a rethink in the Hungarian Government in terms of its approach to this issue and from a Polish perspective also.</p></speech>

I share the commentary with the Minister.  It was cowardice.  UEFA has missed an opportunity and has abdicated responsibility on this issue.</p>  <p>  To get back to the issue in terms of Hungary and where we started with this conversation, there needs to be consequences for the draconian powers and legislation which the Hungarian Government has enacted.  The European Commissioner for Equality, Ms Helena Dalli, said that the EU could impose funding restrictions on Hungary over this legislation.  Can the Minister state whether that is something we would support?  Could he expand on that?  While the imposition of sanctions or financial restrictions on Hungary are important, that is only part of what needs to be done because the hate stoked up by politicians like Orb&aacute;n needs to be tackled.  We must do it by showing solidarity in this Parliament and standing together to face this down wherever it arises.</p></speech>

We have all enjoyed football over the past seven days, but UEFA's decision was unforgivable and spineless in terms of standing up for human rights, as the Minister said.  At this particular juncture, when people are coming together in football terms, it has shown a lack of solidarity for people who are trying to get basic human rights in Hungary.</p></speech>

Two of them are "Love is Love" and "The Future is Equal".  Imagine using the laws of a state to also hurt, criminalise and harangue who seek to love someone of the same sex.  By any metric, that is wrong and everything that can be done diplomatically to call it out should be done.</p>  <p>  While we are on the issue of equality, it is reprehensible that there is a party in the North that would to try to prevent the equality of language in Northern Ireland.  It is wrong.  The DUP also tried to subvert and stop marriage equality in its jurisdiction.  It is wrong and archaic, and is the politics of the past.  The whole world has moved on and I thank the Minister for all of his positive statements in this regard.</p></speech>

On this issue it is very encouraging to see.  I also wish to acknowledge the Houses of the Oireachtas authorities for their work at this time.

It is strong.  Over the past decade, in particular, Ireland has in many ways opened up a debate and discussion that has been inclusive, generous and progressive.  We have an obligation to try to ensure that kind of inclusive discussion also happens in other parts of the world and, if necessary, other parts of the European Union so that people's concerns, anxieties and perspectives can change and they can get the reassurance they need to change their approach on this issue.</p>  <p>  We need to talk to other EU countries and institutions around how the EU responds to the legislation that has been passed in Hungary.  We also have to work to try to build a conversation of tolerance in countries that feel the need to pass legislation like this.  In many ways, through our history we have managed to move to a much more generous and modern, tolerant and inclusive space and the country is the better for it.  We should be encouraging a similar pathway for other countries that have yet to make that journey.</p></speech>

It was stuck for six days and there was a backlog of 400 ships in the canal area.  The ship was dislodged.  A huge volume of cargo destined for Ireland is still detained on the ship.  Is the Minister engaging with his counterparts in Egypt, via diplomatic channels, to ensure the cargo is released and brought back to Ireland?</p></reply>

We have not had any representation on this issue, apart from Deputy Crowe.  I am happy to be helpful on this issue, if we can, through our embassy in Cairo.</p> <p>It is a good and active embassy.  However, no company, stakeholder or interested party has reached out to us with a concern.  A legal case is under way relating to cargo that was on the ship, the commercial interests around that and so on.  We cannot interfere with that legal case and it needs to take its course, but if there are diplomatic issues that we can help with, I am open to doing so.  Clearly, the Deputy probably knows more than I do about the specific frustrations and concerns of some Irish commercial interests linked to that cargo.  If he wants to get in contact with the Department, we will see if we can be helpful.  We cannot interfere with or influence a court decision in Egypt, but if there are appropriate diplomatic channels that we can use, we are certainly open to doing so.</p></speech>

He used the word "interfere".  I would not ask him to interfere, but I would suggest that he make strong representations to his Egyptian counterpart.  The dispute is with the vessel.  In a lawsuit, the Suez Canal Authority is seeking $916 million in damages, including $300 million for loss of reputation.  The obvious action is to decouple the authority's legal dispute with the vessel from the cargo.  The cargo is destined for Rotterdam, Ireland and other places across Europe.  It includes cargo of considerable value, although a great deal of that value has been lost.  The ship should be decoupled from the cargo in the lawsuit, which is the point I would like the Minister to make to his counterpart in Egypt.</p>  <p>  I have approached the Egyptian Embassy in Dublin and the Irish Embassy in Cairo.  I do not want to bad-mouth them, but I have not heard much from either.  I cannot get through to the embassy in Cairo.  That does not bode well in itself, as there needs to be good phone answering on that end.  I have not been able to deliver my message to date.</p></speech>

I have a very good relationship with my Egyptian counterpart.  Normally, we speak about Israel and Palestine and trying to take action on ceasefires, in which Egypt has significant involvement, particularly where they relate to Gaza.</p>  <p>  The Deputy has raised this issue in the Chamber and sought a conversation with our embassy, but perhaps if he comes to my office, we will try to be as helpful as appropriate on the issues he has outlined.</p></speech>

A considerable number of containers on board were destined for Ireland via transshipment through the Port of Rotterdam.  I have spoken with many of the people who would have been receiving that cargo.  They have cited problems with lost sales, raw materials that would have been used in component manufacturing in Ireland, and just-in-time products, whose value is lost if they are not on the sales shelf at the correct time.  For example, there was half a container's worth of gloves, which are seasonal, valued at &euro;250,000.  The person who wanted to sell them had to procure a different shipment, increasing his costs to &euro;500,000.</p>  <p>  This issue requires engagement.  The obvious approach is for the authority to decouple its legal argument with the ship from its argument with the cargo.  Indeed, there is no dispute over the cargo.  Release it.  Give it to its rightful owners.</p></speech>

There is a large amount of money involved and this is a high-profile legal case on the back of major disruptions that happened as a consequence of a ship going aground and blocking the Suez Canal for a sustained period.</p>  <p>  There is an offer to work with the Deputy on this issue as appropriate, but I do not want to start making commitments that I cannot deliver on until we examine the detail.  We can certainly raise the matter in the appropriate way.  We cannot influence the outcome of a court case, but if there are appropriate conversations to be had with the Egyptian authorities, we can work on those.</p></speech>

The Council held a discussion on the situation in Belarus and we met the opposition leader, Ms Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya.  As I said in response to an earlier question on Belarus, we decided to impose restrictive measures on 78 Belarusian individuals and eight entities.  These measures will sanction those behind the brutal repression we have been witnessing in Belarus, those responsible for the forced and unlawful landing of a Ryanair flight at Minsk, and several prominent business figures who support and benefit from the Lukashenko regime.  The Council agreed on sectors to be targeted by economic sanctions.  We also discussed ways for the EU to maintain people-to-people contacts with ordinary Belarusians.</p><p>EU foreign ministers met the Iraqi foreign minister and discussed how the EU could support upcoming parliamentary elections there.  Ministers decided to deploy an EU election observation mission, subject to security considerations.  We also discussed how the EU could support the implementation of urgently needed economic and security sector reforms in Iraq.</p><p>In a strategic discussion on the relationship between the EU and the Latin American and Caribbean region, we had an exchange on how to strengthen and increase dialogue and co-operation.  We focused on how the EU could help the region overcome the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p>I raised the need for the EU to address in a more robust manner the root causes of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, including settlement expansion, demolitions and evictions, matters that the D&aacute;il just discussed.  I encouraged the EU to step up its engagement with both parties in the context of a new Government in Israel and with a view to encouraging the rescheduling of elections across Palestine.</p><p>I also raised my deep concern regarding the conflict in Tigray and the continuing deterioration of the humanitarian situation there.  The Council will hold a full discussion on the situation in Ethiopia in July and I plan to visit Ethiopia next month.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>The Council heard updates from the High Representative on the talks in Vienna on the joint comprehensive plan of action regarding Iran, and on his recent visit to Lebanon.  The Council also exchanged views on Mali, the Belgrade-Pristina dialogue and the EU-Turkey and EU-Russia relationship.</p></speech>

It was a terror-like attack, risking the lives of more than 170 people, including EU citizens.  It was an international crime and a continuation of the repression of the Belarusian people.  It was an act of piracy against an Irish-registered plane with the tricolour on its fuselage.  Since then, the EU has strengthened its pre-existing restrictive measures over the situation in Belarus by introducing a ban on the overflight of EU airspace and access to EU airports by Belarusian carriers of all kinds.  EU member states are required to deny permission to land in, take off from and overfly their territories to any aircraft operated by the Belarusian carriers, including as marketing carriers.</p>  <p>  Speaking as my party's spokesperson on aviation, it is important that this restriction be enforced.  Is it being enforced across the EU?  Is there any pushback from the awkward squad of the EU, specifically Hungary and Poland?</p></speech>

There is a challenge, though, which I raised, as did a number of others.  While it is the appropriate action and the EU and EU leaders needed to respond robustly to an outrageous act of aviation piracy, which is how it has been described, cutting off Belarusian airlines and not allowing them into EU airspace or EU airlines into Belarusian airspace has created a consequence of isolation for Belarus, in that any international travel will now have to go east rather than west to get to the EU.</p> <p>People may well have to fly to Moscow to be able to fly to the EU now.  It is still the appropriate decision to take that position from an aviation perspective, to respond to what happened, but it has a consequence we need to think about in the medium term.  The other very strong and robust sanctions are not only appropriate but will also be effective.  The EU is likely to add further to those sanctions in the months ahead.</p></speech>

A fourth package of EU sanctions over enduring repression and the forced landing of the Ryanair flight was announced on Monday.  The goal of these sanctions is to put pressure on the Belarusian political leadership to initiate a genuine and inclusive national dialogue with broader society and to avoid further repression.  Is there any sign these measures will have any real impact so far as Belarus is concerned?</p></speech>

It will take time for those decisions to take effect.  The debate within the EU around sanctions is always a delicate one because if sanctions are applied in the wrong way they can be counterproductive.  In the case of Belarus, the EU is very united on the need to target its sanctions at people who are responsible for anti-democratic practices and repression, and those who benefit from the Lukashenko regime remaining intact, so they are appropriate.  A fifth sanctions measure is currently under consideration, around looking at other economic sectors we may be able to put pressure on to force a change of approach in Belarus and a move towards allowing the Belarusian people to have the power to elect their own leadership democratically and transparently.  Time will tell how effective those sanctions will be.</p></speech>

Israel&rsquo;s new coalition Government took office on 13 June.  I have written to the new Minister of Foreign Affairs, Yair Lapid, and I look forward to having a chance to speak with him in due course on a range of issues.  The EU High Representative has spoken to Mr. Lapid.  I participated in a discussion on the Middle East at the Foreign Affairs Council on Monday.  The relationship between Israel and the EU is important and we hope to have an opportunity to meet with Minister Lapid at the Foreign Affairs Council in the coming months.</p>  <p>  Civil society organisations play a valuable role in protecting human rights.  My Department considers the analysis of civil society on the situation in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories, including the report to which the Deputy referred.  Ireland also provides financial support to Israeli and Palestinian non-governmental organisations, NGOs, working on human rights, particularly in occupied Palestinian territory.  The human rights situation in the occupied Palestinian territory is very concerning.  Ireland raises concerns about human rights and unlawful and discriminatory practices against Palestinians, both directly with the Government of Israel, and in multilateral forums.  Many of the Deputies will have heard me doing that, including at the UN Security Council and the Human Rights Council.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s position will continue to be based on international law, Israel&rsquo;s obligations as an occupying power under the Fourth Geneva Convention and the relevant resolutions of the UN Security Council.  Later today, Ireland will participate in the monthly UN Security Council meeting on the situation on the Middle East.  Today&rsquo;s session, which includes Israeli and Palestinian permanent representatives to the UN, focuses on the implementation of Security Council Resolution 2334, which relates to settlements.  Ireland will set out our clear position on the illegality of Israeli actions on settlements, evictions and unnecessary demolitions and our concerns at the scale and nature of their expansion, which negatively impact both the human rights of Palestinians in the occupied territory and prospects for a future, viable two-State solution.</p></speech>

He talked about human rights and core principles.  Quite clearly, the policy of Israel has gone beyond all core principles.  The Human Rights Watch report, A Threshold Crossed: Israeli Authorities and the Crimes of Apartheid and Persecution, published in April, details in the strongest language possible the crimes against humanity, persecution and apartheid, that Israeli authorities are committing against millions of Palestinians.</p>  <p>  The Minister referred to the new Israeli Government taking power on 12 June.  After it took power, significantly, on 15 June, there was a second round of air strikes against Gaza.  I specifically ask the Minister what forceful action he is taking.  I appreciate his bona fides and hard work on this matter, but as we talk and use words people are dying on the streets of Gaza.  I have the details, as does the Minister.  The ambassador from Palestine has filled all of us in on this.  What action is the Minister taking, in view of the trade between Europe and Israel?</p></speech>

I am glad to say we have a ceasefire.  Obviously, there was real concern about air strikes in recent days in Gaza.  Thank goodness, nobody was fatally injured in those air strikes.  There is no country in the EU more vocal on this issue than Ireland and no foreign minister more vocal on it than me.  I again used the opportunity, under the current affairs section of the discussions at the Foreign Affairs Council on Monday, to raise my concern about these issues and to ask yet again for the European Commission to produce a toolbox so we can really understand the leverage we have and the tools we can use to make sure we get real engagement on some of these issues.  There was an indication the new Israeli Minister of Foreign Affairs would be invited to meet us in the Foreign Affairs Council.  I would welcome that and the opportunity for that discussion.  We will continue to focus on ensuring Ireland uses its influence as best we can to move towards a discussion and negotiation for a permanent peace settlement, which is ultimately what this is about.</p></speech>

We know the International Criminal Court, its staff and the civil organisations that support it are under extreme pressure, because of increasing public criticism of it by England, the leader in England and by Israel itself, among other countries.  We know that because former politicians in Ireland signed a letter in relation to the matter.</p>  <p>  The EU trades with Israel.  The Minister used such strong words regarding gay rights in other countries, which is perfectly correct, but we do not use the same strong language when it comes to what is happening because of the Israeli occupation, illegal by any standard, in its taking over and killing people.  I am an absolute supporter of the Jewish nation, and I do not like to have to say that, but what is happening is against all human rights standards.  We have got to stand up and say that, while still supporting Israel.  We have to stand up and say what it is doing is utterly wrong.</p></speech>

We need a relationship with Israel but we have also got to call out breaches of international law.  I can be accused of some things in this House, but I am not sure it is fair to accuse me of not speaking directly and in a strident manner about the Israel-Palestinian conflict.  I have been very direct in calling out breaches of international law and the disproportionate use of force and my concern that not enough has happened to protect civilians and children.</p> <p>We have also backed that with significant increases in financial support for UN organisations working in Gaza.  I do not shy away from using strident language when it is appropriate to do that.  However, I also believe there is an opportunity now to reach out to the new Israeli Government and to try to ensure there is a change of direction over time in its policy direction towards Palestinians, which I and this Parliament call out all the time.</p></speech>

Some 76% of people sharing rented accommodation do not believe they will ever own their own home.  Tens of thousands of people are locked out of home ownership, trapped in over-priced rental accommodation or forced to move back home with their parents, who are beside themselves with worry that their children will ever own their own home.  Young couples are unable to save for a deposit because of sky-high rents, and single people are priced out of a market that only caters for two-income households.  Separated and divorced people are paying maintenance and rent while trying to save a deposit of 20% for a new home.  Families who lost their home after the crash are desperately trying to put an affordable roof over their heads.  Every day, I and, I am sure, the T&aacute;naiste and his Government colleagues receive calls and emails from people in these situations.  These are the casualties of ten years of Fine Gael housing policy.</p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste has sat at the Cabinet table for those ten years.  These stories and the hardship endured by the people I am discussing are his legacy.  In 2011, when he joined the Cabinet, the average price of a new home in Dublin was &euro;318,000.  Today, it is &euro;503,000.  During Fine Gael's time in office, house prices have increased by 88% across the State and by 99% in Dublin.  That is the T&aacute;naiste's legacy.  In 2011, the average cost of renting across the State was &euro;781 per month; today, it is &euro;1,256.  That is an extra &euro;6,000 per year on rent.  In Dublin, the position is even worse.  Average rents have increased from &euro;960 per month to &euro;1,745.  That is almost &euro;10,000 extra per year for rent for average renters.  The T&aacute;naiste's legacy is spiralling house prices and sky-high rents.</p>  <p>  When the T&aacute;naiste was elected leader of Fine Gael, he said he wanted to represent those who get up early in the morning to go to work.  The only people I see his Government representing are big developers and big landlords, throwing around sweetheart tax deals and land deals like confetti.  It has become increasingly clear that Fine Gael is not the party of hard-working people.  It is a party of privilege, a party of the very well-off and a party of ever-rising housing costs.  In fact, when asked about rising house prices last week, the T&aacute;naiste suggested that things were really not as bad as the Opposition is saying and that the solution was to saddle working people with increasing levels of mortgage debt.  Is he that out of touch?  Does he not understand the depth of the crisis that he has created?</p>  <p>  It is time for the T&aacute;naiste to accept that his housing record is one of failure, that ten years of Fine Gael housing policy has made the housing crisis worse and that if he continues to repeat the mistakes of the past, things will only get harder.  It is time to give renters and those seeking to own their own home a break.  Will the T&aacute;naiste now accept that the only way to deliver genuinely affordable homes for working people is to follow the advice of Sinn F&eacute;in, the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, and the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, and to double direct State capital investment in public housing, to deliver 20,000 social and affordable homes annually until this crisis is over?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-06-24a.242" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021062400021#T00600"><p>The fact that the Deputy has to go out of his way to misrepresent what I say and to misquote me is emblematic of how dishonest and two-faced he and his party are when it comes to the issue of housing.  What I said was a statement of fact, but I did not say under any circumstances that I thought it was desirable that we should see house prices rise further or get back to the level they were at 14 years ago.  What the Deputy misquoted me as saying was absolutely incorrect and he should withdraw it from the record.  It is not the first time his party has deliberately twisted, misrepresented and deceived regarding comments made by Ministers in respect of housing, because that is the only way it can gain traction, particularly online.  It is a real shame that this is the way the Deputy behaves.  Quite frankly, it is beneath him to misrepresent things that Members say in the House for political purposes.</p>  <p>  I believe in home ownership and, thankfully, 65% of people in Ireland own their own home.  That has nothing to do with Sinn F&eacute;in.  It is due to policies and decisions made by my party, Fianna F&aacute;il, the Labour Party, the Green Party and others in bygone years.  However, it is not a reality for hundreds of thousands of people in the State.  For them, home ownership is a dream or a distant possibility.  That has to change, and I get that.  The Government gets that too and that is why we have taken actions to help people to buy their first home.  For example, the help-to-buy scheme has helped tens of thousands of people to secure a deposit to buy a home.  That was opposed by Sinn F&eacute;in.  The Rebuilding Ireland home loan helps people to get an affordable mortgage.  This is something we must build on and make more available to more people.  The rent pressure zones limit rent increases to no more than 4% in areas where rents are high and rising.  As the Deputy knows, that is currently under review to see if we can do more in that regard.  In contrast, Sinn F&eacute;in's local authorities and councillors in Northern Ireland voted to increase rents.  That is the type of hypocrisy we see from the Deputy and his party.</p>  <p>  Of course, the main part of the solution, and it is not the sole solution, is more supply of housing of all forms.  Social housing to help people get off the housing list does not just benefit people getting off the housing list but society as a whole because it frees up rental properties for others, reduces competition for private housing in the general housing market and helps first-time buyers.  That is why between 2016 and 2019, when my party held the housing brief, we increased the supply of social housing tenfold, from approximately 600 per year to 6,000 per year.  We are aiming to go higher under this Government and to reach more than 10,000 per year, if possible.  However, there are constraints, and the Deputy knows that better than most.  Cost rental has been initiated by my party.  On Enniskerry Road, we will see the first people occupying cost rental properties very soon.  That has nothing to do with Sinn F&eacute;in.  The Government is going to build on that and there will be far more cost-rental housing as well.  The shared ownership scheme, which Sinn F&eacute;in opposes here but promotes in the North, is helping people to buy affordable housing.</p>  <p>  There is also support for private investment in housing.  That is necessary because most people want to own their own home.  That means private housing, private enterprise and private developers, all of which Sinn F&eacute;in opposes and which it would essentially drive out of the housing market, thus resulting in less housing supply.  What was emblematic of Sinn F&eacute;in's approach was what it did in Donabate in Dublin Fingal, the county in which I live and not too far from my constituency.</p> <p>Sinn F&eacute;in, for ideological reasons, voted against more than 200 social houses because 600 private houses were going to be built on the same site.  The party was so ideologically opposed to private housing and homeownership that it was willing to vote against social housing as well.  Does the Deputy believe  homeownership should be higher?  It is now roughly 65%.  Does Sinn F&eacute;in think that percentage should be higher, or does it secretly believe in less homeownership?  Does the party want a higher percentage of housing in public ownership and a lower percentage in private ownership?  I would like to know that, because there has never been an answer to the question of whether Sinn F&eacute;in believes in increasing the percentage of homeownership and in more people owning their own homes.  I would love to hear the Deputy's answer in that regard.</p></speech>

The key problem is that almost every single policy this Government has introduced has pushed up house prices and rents.  The help to buy scheme pushed up house prices.  Rent pressure zones, RPZs, pushed up rental costs.  The shared equity loan scheme, which we will debate later today, has been criticised by everybody, including councillors in the T&aacute;naiste's own party.  Sinn F&eacute;in is the only large party on the floor of the D&aacute;il that year after year has said that 8,000 affordable homes should be built annually.  To answer the T&aacute;naiste's question directly, half of those, 4,000 homes, would be affordable purchase for aspiring homeowners.  How many affordable homes has this Government delivered for renters and purchasers in ten years?  Not a single one through any Government scheme.  It is time, therefore, for the T&aacute;naiste to wake up and realise the extent of the Government&rsquo;s failures.  It is time to own up to the misery and heartache being caused for tens of thousands of families, correct the error of these ways and invest in the homes that working people desperately need and rightly deserve.</p></speech>

We want to increase that budget by as much as possible, but there are also other demands which we must take into account in health, education, welfare, other infrastructure and climate action.  We will do as much as we can in all those areas, but it is dishonest to think we can do the maximum in all areas, because that simply does not add up.

Last week, the T&aacute;naiste told this House that there were fundamental problems with two aspects of the deal, namely, ownership and governance.  Given that I have been telling the T&aacute;naiste exactly that for the past four years, I am quite curious as to when he finally saw the light.  His comments in the House last week were surprising in several respects.  First, it had been pointed out to him for years by myself and others that this deal is manifestly bad for the public.  Yet the T&aacute;naiste blithely ignored all those warnings.  Whenever I have raised concerns about ownership, governance and ethos, I have been fobbed off with assurances that a legal framework was all that was outstanding.  Work started on that legal framework in 2017.  Four years later, however, there is still no sign of it.</p>  <p>  There is a second reason the T&aacute;naiste's comments were unexpected.  He complained bitterly about the proposed 99-year lease, saying it was not satisfactory and that we should own the site.  It was his Government, however, that proposed a lease in the first place.  Back in 2017, officials in the Department of Health had to twist the arms of the members of the board of St Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group to get them to even consider a lease.  That is all laid out in the correspondence released by St Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group this week.  In July 2019, however, the T&aacute;naiste referred to the proposed lease himself in this House.  He said that St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group had agreed in principle to provide the State with a 99-year lease of the land upon which the new maternity hospital will be built.  The T&aacute;naiste framed it as a win for the State that St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group had agreed to provide a lease.  The St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group has been criticised for the curt letter it released this week, and certainly much of it does not stand up to scrutiny.  However, I can only imagine the shock and amazement of the St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group at the latest comments from the T&aacute;naiste.  </p>  <p>  This mess has the fingerprints of the T&aacute;naiste's party&rsquo;s fingerpri all over it.  The former Deputy and Minister for Health, James Reilly, announced the project in 2013, the next Minister in the Department of Health was the now T&aacute;naiste and he was followed as Minister by Deputy Simon Harris.  Finally, last year, the current Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, was given what can only be described as the poisoned chalice.  I am curious, therefore, given the longevity of this crisis, about what prompted the T&aacute;naiste to get to his feet in this House last week and express serious concern.  Was there something significant about the timing?  This is an issue that voters in Dublin Bay South care deeply about, and perhaps their concern has been a catalyst for some long overdue action.  In light of yesterday&rsquo;s debate, what steps does the T&aacute;naiste's Government now intend to take to ensure the new publicly-funded national maternity hospital is constructed on land owned by the State?  Will it now be guaranteed that the new facility will be fully owned and governed by the State?</p></speech>

Like her, I have been always interested in this project and I have always had concerns about it.  What prompted me, quite frankly, was a straight question from Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith.  I would not have answered that question had I not been asked it.  As the Deputy pointed out in her remarks, it might have been two or three years since I was last asked publicly or in this House to give my views on the new national maternity hospital project.  I am conscious that negotiations have been under way during that period, and I have been restrained in what I have said.</p>  <p>  Regarding the position of the Government, this Government and, indeed, the previous Government which I led, it has always been one that has favoured co-location over integration, that has insisted that the new hospital, like the existing one, must be clinically and operationally independent and that any gynaecological or obstetrical procedure which is lawful in this State must be provided for in this hospital.  We want to own the hospital and, ideally, to own the land as well.  We also want proper representation on the board, and the governance aspect is as important as the ownership of the land, if not more so.  That is my position and it has not changed.</p>  <p>  For the record, in 2017 and 2018, two memos for information were brought to Government.  I checked this with the Cabinet secretariat.  No memo for decision was brought to Government, and no memo decision has yet been brought to Government.  Therefore, a Government decision on the lease and on the governance aspect has yet to be made.  It was not made by the previous Government and it has not yet been made by this Government.  Had it been made back in 2017 or 2018, I assume the project would have gone to tender by now.  However, it did not.  I reiterate that two memos for information went to Government and no memo for decision, and that still has not happened.  We are where we are in that regard.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to the development of this hospital.  It is planned for the St. Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital campus at Elm Park, and that is set out in the programme for Government.  We have not given examination to alternative sites.  What we must do now is to conclude the governance arrangements necessary to ensure protection of this public investment for the public good and, in particular, to ensure there is an absolute, legally binding assurance that all legally permissible obstetrical and gynaecological services will be provided in the new hospital as they are currently in Holles Street.</p> <p>There is universal agreement in this House that this must be done.</p> <p> The project is unprecedented and inherently complex because it involves relocating one voluntary hospital onto the campus of another, neither of which hospital the State owns or controls at present.  What is different now is that the State is going to invest hundreds of millions of euro in a new building on that campus, which changes things in my view and in the view of the Government.  We have clear legal advice that the draft legal framework ensures that all legally permissible medical services will be provided in the new hospital and we are having that double checked at present.</p> <p> On the 99 year lease, the Government was not satisfied with that which is why negotiations continued and why the idea of a further 50-year extension was proposed.  That matter is far from concluded.</p></speech>

The mantra from the Government has been that the Mulvey deal is the solution.  Does the T&aacute;naiste now accept that the Mulvey deal is the problem?  Apart from the issue of the lease of the site, what the Mulvey deal sets out is a corporate structure which entails St. Vincent's owning the full operation of the new national maternity hospital.  Under that deal, the national maternity hospital company is to become a wholly-owned subsidiary of St. Vincent's.  Is that not the nub of the problem?</p></speech>

As I was about to say, the Mulvey agreement has, in my mind at least, already been departed from by the Government in certain aspects.  Initially, the building was not to be owned by the State.  It is my understanding that this has now been resolved and the State will own the building.  That was not originally the case in the Mulvey agreement.  Discussions are ongoing around the composition of the board of the national maternity hospital.  Initially there was to be no representation.  Now there is one public interest director but we are not satisfied with that.</p>  <p>  The Mulvey agreement is an agreement between St. Vincent's and the National Maternity Hospital at Holles Street.

I want to help by coming up with solutions to help young families to get homes.  Today I want to raise the very important issue of mortgage affordability, particularly for first-time buyers.  As we all know, this country is in the middle of a housing crisis and while it is true that the main issue is the supply of affordable housing, another issue that can be addressed immediately is the very restrictive lending rules imposed by the Central Bank.</p>  <p>  In my home town of Dundalk the rental price for a three-bedroom family home ranges from &euro;1,300 to &euro;1,800 per month.  When for sale, those same houses are generally on the market for between &euro;200,000 to &euro;270,000.  A quick calculation indicates that the average monthly mortgage repayment for these homes would be between &euro;900 and &euro;1,200.  Under the current Central Bank rules, a young family is expected to save approximately &euro;2,000 per month towards a deposit as well as pay rent of up to &euro;1,800 per month.  The T&aacute;naiste will agree that this is not realistic.  If a young family can afford to and can demonstrate that they are paying rent at a higher level than a comparable mortgage, it is clear that they can afford such a mortgage.  A simple solution is to amend the rules to allow first-time buyers to include the rent paid for a period of three years as a virtual deposit on their mortgage application.  This would clearly demonstrate their ability to repay a mortgage and remove the draconian rules which mean they have to save for a deposit while also paying ridiculously high rents.  It does not add up and it does not make sense.</p>  <p>  The figures for my home town of Dundalk show that a young family hoping to purchase their first home would have to save an average of &euro;2,000 per month while paying rent of approximately &euro;1,500 per month, a total of &euro;3,500 per month.  This means that the family would need a gross income of approximately &euro;5,500 per month, or a gross annual salary of &euro;66,000, just to pay their monthly rent and save for a deposit.  This does not take account of other outgoings like food, utility and medical bills.  It is clear that this is not a realistic situation for young first-time buyers in Ireland.  At this rate they will be condemned to a lifetime of paying high rents, most likely to vulture funds.  The Government must act now to deal with this very serious issue.  People should be able to buy their first home but to earn &euro;66,000 means, in many cases, two people working.  </p>  <p>  The Government is looking for solutions to the housing crisis and I am not here to play a blame game.  Will the Government consider my suggestion regarding a virtual deposit?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-06-24a.289" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="12:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021062400023#V00900"><p>The Deputy made some very good points in his remarks.  As the House will be aware, the objective of the Central Bank macro prudential mortgage lending rules is to mitigate systemic risk and promote financial stability, to increase the resilience of the banking sector and households to the property market and to reduce the risk of credit spirals from developing in future.  They are there to avoid a boom and bust in home values, people ending up in negative equity and a future banking crisis.  They are there to prevent the mistakes of the past being repeated.</p>  <p>  However, we must make sure that we are not fighting the last war when it comes to mortgages.  The mortgage rules have very much helped to keep a lid on house price inflation, which is a good thing but they have also driven up rents, which is not a good thing.  Like Deputy Fitzpatrick, I would know and would have been contacted by many people who are paying very high rents of between &euro;1,600 and &euro;1,800 per month.  They are struggling but are managing to pay them and yet they cannot get a mortgage of &euro;1,500 per month.  They cannot get a mortgage for a lower amount than they are currently spending on rent and they find that difficult to accept and so do I.  With this in mind, the Central Bank has indicated that it will carry out an in-depth review of lending rules over the course of this year and into next year.  I would encourage the bank to expedite that review and the public consultation that it intends to carry out, through which it will hear the voices of people who are caught in the rent trap in this way, paying higher rents than they would pay if they were able to get a mortgage they could afford.</p>  <p>  In assessing a borrower's ability to repay a mortgage, lenders can and do take account of applicants' existing financial commitments, including their rental payments.  However, there is a significant difference between a rental contract and a mortgage contract to purchase a home and this must be borne in mind.  A house purchase and associated mortgage contract usually has a more long-term character than a rental contract which leaves the house purchaser or mortgage borrower more exposed if there is a future shock to his or her income, house prices or interest rate, for a longer period.  </p>  <p>  The Central Bank mortgage macro prudential measures apply certain loan to value and loan to income restrictions to residential mortgage lending by financial institutions.  In general, the maximum mortgage limits are 3.5 times the borrower's income and for first-time buyers, 90% of the value of the residential property.  For second and subsequent buyers, the maximum mortgage limits are 3.5 times the borrower's income and 80% of the value of the home.  However, banks have some flexibility at their discretion to provide mortgage loans in excess of the specified regulatory limits but it is a commercial matter for lenders as to whether they avail of this discretion.  For example, up to 5% of lending to first-time buyers can be above the 90% threshold and up to 20% of lending to second-time borrowers can exceed the 80% threshold.  Furthermore, up to 20% of lending to first-time buyers can exceed the 3.5 times income limit.</p></speech>

These young people need hope.  There are houses for sale in my home town of Dundalk for between &euro;200,000 and &euro;270,000.  These people are working hard and are putting their whole lives on hold to try to get a family home.  I am not going to be like Sinn F&eacute;in and engage in a blame game over this.  The Government has asked for solutions and I am suggesting one.  I want this Government to commit to helping these families to get a home.  These young families are coming to my constituency office on a regular basis.  They are working morning, noon and night and doing shift work.  These are working class people who get up early in the morning to go to work and they need help.  What am I to say to them?  Am I to tell them "No"?  They can afford to pay their rent but they cannot afford to also gather the money for a deposit.  They can show that they could pay back a mortgage.  I am seeking a commitment from this Government.</p> <p>I ask it to sit down with the Central Bank and put a bit of pressure on it.  These people are stuck in the middle.  They cannot get on the council list because they earn too much.  Realistically, they are going for houses that a lot of work has to be done on.  It is their families, friends and relations who will give them a hand with that work.  They want something to start with.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste not to tell me that something will happen next year or the year after.  I am looking for a commitment that the Government will consider this virtual deposit to help these families get the deposit and get on the ladder for the first time.</p></speech>

As I said earlier, many people are paying &euro;1,800 or &euro;2,000 in rent per month.  They could afford a mortgage of &euro;1,500 and would be better off if they could get that mortgage but they cannot do so.  I hear what the Deputy is saying and I hear that from people all of the time but I am not passing the buck in saying that the Central Bank is independent.  It is independent and for good reasons.  It sets interest rates independently of the political process and it puts macroprudential rules in place to avoid a repeat of the mistakes of the past, including the creation of a housing bubble, which all of us in this House want to avoid.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank has regular engagement with the Minister for Finance and the Government.  I met the Governor of the Central Bank about this matter some years ago in my previous role as Taoiseach.  It is now carrying out a review of the mortgage rules.  I am asking it to do that expeditiously, properly and well, but also to do so as quickly as possible.  It is welcome that the Central Bank is having a public consultation.  I hope that people who are trapped in this situation will take part in the public consultation and that the Central Bank will hear the voice of people in that regard.  It has a major role to play in ensuring financial stability and in making sure we do not repeat the mistakes of the past.  However, it cannot be blind either to the unintended consequences, which may be rents going as high they have gone and people feeling that they will never be able to buy a home of their own.</p></speech>

Last Saturday night, I watched the news and the headline from the Fine Gael Ard-Fheis was the T&aacute;naiste announcing that Fine Gael was committing to building 40,000 houses every year.  That is great if the T&aacute;naiste knows of a way to do this, but as someone who has worked in the sector for many years, I asked myself what cunning plan our T&aacute;naiste has come up with.</p>  <p>  Besides the point of having even half of it as affordable or social housing, about &euro;10 billion would be needed with another &euro;10 billion needed from the private sector.  Can the T&aacute;naiste tell me how we will get over the obstacle that there are 200 quarries in a planning quagmire?  Can he tell me how the 14,000 or 15,000 houses that are on judicial review are going to get sorted?  Unfortunately, things are being challenged day in, day out.  Can the T&aacute;naiste tell me why the forward planning of Irish Water is not funded for the next four to five years?  I talk to Irish Water on a regular basis.  If that funding is not put in place, there will be a problem.</p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste might not know about a thing called DoneDeal.  If one looks around Dublin or in any other city, one will see that there are no lorry drivers available to take muck away from sites.  One cannot get a theory test or even apply for a driving licence if one wants to go down that road.  Blocklaying in a rural house in a rural area is gone from &euro;6,000 to &euro;16,000.  The price of timber is gone up by 46%.  I have spoken to the T&aacute;naiste personally about the saga in Ireland but it is not only in Ireland.  Timber is brought in as well and it is a bidding market.  It is not about getting materials or the price of same but it is a question of whether the materials can be got because America and other countries are giving better prices when the boats are on the high seas.</p>  <p>  I know the T&aacute;naiste has spoken about apprenticeships before.  We seem to put people who are accountants or whatever on a pedestal, and rightly so, but we do not seem to put the person who is the blocklayer, who is in what I call the wet trades or any apprentice on the same pedestal of people who go down a different road.  Whether we like it or not, if we do not have the people who can drive the digger, lay the pipe, put down the tar, lay the blocks or do the steel structure, we will not have someone doing it with a computer.  I am asking the T&aacute;naiste if he can shed light on this for me because it is like Christy Moore's song; I thought about it for a while and "The dream turned into a nightmare" for me when I started asking myself how we will get around all of these obstacles.</p>  <p>  The other part of this is that we had the climate action Bill last week.  The Greens, who are delusional in my world, believe we will reduce emissions when we need to build 40,000 houses per year.  I do not disagree with the T&aacute;naiste on that, but I ask him to tell me how we can square the circle.</p></speech>

I restated that ambition at the weekend and I stand over the fact that I did so.  Back in 2016, we were only building 5,000 to 6,000 homes per year.  We are now up to around 20,000 homes per year, notwithstanding the fact that construction was blighted by the pandemic.  We used to build 80,000 homes per year and I believe that setting the ambition of getting to 40,000 per year is ambitious but realistic.  It is double where we are now and half where we were during the housing boom some time ago.  I am not saying we can do it next year - do not get me wrong on that.  That is certainly not what I said, but I think we can scale up to that target.  We think there will be about 20,000 public and private builds this year and perhaps we can go to 25,000, 30,000, 35,000 and 40,000 or perhaps we can go a bit faster to 27,000, 34,000 and 41,000.  That is the kind of thing we are talking about in the Government as we put together the "Housing for All" policy, which is the Government's new housing policy, replacing Rebuilding Ireland.</p>  <p>  I see Davy Group suggested in its report today that this is not enough.  It said that we need to build 200,000 new homes in three years.  Unfortunately, I do not believe it is possible to scale up to 60,000 or 70,000 homes per year in such a timeframe.  I take the Deputy's point that if it was easy to do, it would have been done by now.  It is not easy.  We have issues around access to capital, both for the Government and private builders.  We also have issues around a shortage of skilled labour and the availability of serviced land by Irish Water and by local authorities.  We also have issues around the planning process, which takes a long time in this State and often ends up stuck in judicial reviews.  We also have issues around the availability of materials.  Steel is becoming more expensive and less available because of this central bank-fuelled boom around the world.  Central banks have printed &euro;9 trillion and that has driven up the cost of commodities, with a boom happening in China for example.</p>  <p>  While they might not say it publicly, everyone in this House privately understands that there is nobody in this House who would not like to see more houses built as quickly as possible but there are lots of constraints that are not always under our control.  We will do our best to deal with them as best we can, however.  That involves increasing Government investment in public housing, of which social housing will be the major part.  It also involves the Government investing in apprenticeships and the Deputy will know what the Minister, Deputy Harris, is doing in that regard.  That is having some real success in getting more people into apprenticeships in line with the target of 10,000 apprenticeships per year.  It will mean the Government trying to make sure that more sites are serviced through programmes such as the local infrastructure housing activation fund and the capital budget of Irish Water.  Beyond that, there will be things outside of our control, such as the availability of materials, one of which the Deputy mentioned.</p></speech>

The first thing that needs to be realised is that we need to get away the cycle of boom and bang.  That is why people are reluctant to go into apprenticeships.  While the Minister, Deputy Harris, is bringing stuff forward, and I welcome that, there does not seem to be a lot of movement in the wet trades.</p>  <p>  The other side of it is that there seems to be a ferocious focus on cities.  If one were to look at the price of land in the smaller towns or villages, one would get better value for money.  We also need to be sure about the likes of procurement.  What seems to happen in this country is that one big guy applies for permission for 500 or 600 houses.  Many smaller builders would not have the capital to be in that league but would be well capable of building four or five houses.  Much makes more and the Government should give those small builders the opportunity to do that, as well as trying to bring older houses in rural areas back into use and giving incentives for same.</p> <p>If the T&aacute;naiste does not knuckle down over the next six months to tackle the different problems I have highlighted, having looked at the industry, they will never be solved and we will never get to our target of 40,000 houses.  We must sort out the planning issues and all the other issues I have highlighted because they are causing problems and logjams in the housing industry.</p></speech>

There are many different bottlenecks and points where one can run into trouble in terms of housing construction.  All of those bottlenecks must be dealt with to allow for a clear and flowing pipeline of houses, which is what we want.  I agree with the Deputy that every town and village in Ireland should be able to expand.  I do not mean a return to sprawl or to development distant from the major cities, but any town in Ireland should be able to expand and we need to ensure that is reflected in our planning laws.  Smaller builders who can build houses in fours and fives, relatively inexpensively and on relatively small sites, can make a big difference for people.  That is a part of what Home Building Finance Ireland, HBFI, is supposed to be doing in lending to those small builders.  It is doing that, although perhaps not to the extent it should be.</p>  <p>  The Deputy is also right when he says that meeting the target of 40,000 houses per year as soon as possible, although we have not yet decided what year that will happen, is not just about building new houses from scratch.  It must also be about bringing derelict houses back into use.  Although I would not count such projects in the 40,000, we also need to ensure that vacant properties are brought back into use.</p></speech>

Tallaght, in particular, was mentioned as a possibility.  Can the T&aacute;naiste confirm whether the Government is indeed looking at alternative sites and, if it is, which sites, and what stage is that at?  If an alternative site was to be chosen, how long would it delay the project?  Will the T&aacute;naiste confirm, so we are all crystal clear on it, who is leading this on behalf of the Government?  Is it the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, or the former Minister for Health, Deputy Harris?</p></speech>

The Government considered it some time ago and decided, for good, clinical, patient safety and patient quality reasons, that all four maternity hospitals should be relocated and co-located with adult hospitals.  That is the case in Limerick, with University Maternity Hospital moving to the Dooradoyle site.  It is also the case with the Rotunda Hospital moving to the Connolly Hospital and the tri-location of the Coombe with the children's and adult hospitals in St. James's Hospital.  The most obvious and best fit for Holles Street and the national maternity hospital, notwithstanding the enormous complications, is St. Vincent's hospital.  I am not aware of any plans to look at alternative sites.</p></speech>

Gay and bisexual men in Ireland currently must abstain from any sexual contact for a minimum of 12 months before meeting the criteria for donating blood.  The same criteria do not apply to other blood donors.  This ongoing ban discriminates and stigmatises individuals and feeds into negative stereotypes of whole communities.  A review of the science by the advisory expert group to the Irish Blood Transfusion Service, IBTS, is currently under way but no end date has been given for the delivery of this service.  With the UK and Northern Ireland moving to a more tolerant and evidence-based position on blood donations, will the Government commit to the removal of the current discriminatory practice and its replacement with an evidence-based individual risk assessment model for all blood donors?</p></speech>

There is no reference to the Government in that regard and the service does not require the approval of the Government and it is not a Government decision.  However, I echo the Deputy's comments and ask the medical people, scientists and experts in the IBTS to have regard to what is happening in the UK and other countries that are taking an approach based on individual risk rather than picking out particular groups in the way the Deputy has, very articulately, explained.</p></speech>

As they do, variants of the virus are rampaging through the global south.  I ask again what is the position of the Irish Government on the TRIPS waiver?  It is fair to say the vaccination programme here and in other wealthy countries are going well but if perfect incubator conditions are being created in less prosperous places throughout the world, we are all at risk.  As a former and potentially future Head of this State, what would be the T&aacute;naiste's message on the TRIPS waiver and whether Ireland should be demonstrating leadership in that regard?</p></speech>

A TRIPS waiver is not enough in that regard.  It is proverbially like giving somebody the recipe but not the kitchen.  They have not been given the materials or know-how to produce vaccines.  The first thing that should happen is export bans should stop.  As trade Minister, I have instructed my officials to vote against export bans, and we have.  It is all very well for countries such as the United States to back a TRIPS waiver while banning exports at the same time.  We must get rid of export bans.  The best thing we can do is to work together and with industry to license this intellectual property to the global south and help to build the necessary factories, provide the money and know-how to do these things, and then help them to provide vaccines to their populations.  A TRIPS waiver on its own might make us feel good but it would not do much good.  It needs to be a part of a comprehensive solution and we are working towards that with the WTO.</p></speech>

There is talk of disciplinary action.  Would the T&aacute;naiste agree that the number of cancelled calls speaks to something more than sloppy policing by particular members of the Garda?  At best, it speaks to me of a failure on the part of the leadership of the Garda to instil and foster a culture of making protection of women and children a high priority.  At worst, it could even speak to a culture of misogyny.</p><p>The Irish Council for Civil Liberties now believes that the very first event organiser of a street protest since the onset of the pandemic to face a &euro;500 fine is Ms Aislinn O'Keeffe of Limerick.  She is alleged to have organised a socially distanced protest involving no more than ten people on a wide city street on 18 March on the issue of opposing femicide and domestic violence.  She refuses to pay the fine and awaits a court summons.  Would the T&aacute;naiste agree with me that prosecution would be a bad look for the Garda in this instance?</p></speech>

I can say that any inappropriate cancellation of 999 calls is a serious issue.  The Garda Commissioner has assured the Minister for Justice that when somebody calls 999, they can expect and trust that a member of the Garda will help.  That should always be the case and should always have been the case.  The Garda Commissioner is before the Policing Authority today and will give a full account of the serious shortcomings that occurred, outline the steps that have been taken to ensure they do not happen again and will answer questions on the matter.</p></speech>

In some cases, the people applying for the mortgage were not even aware that their employers were availing of the scheme.  The lenders are using the wage subsidy scheme to reject mortgage applications.  These lenders assume that any company availing of the employment wage subsidy scheme is about to fail.  That is not true, as the T&aacute;naiste knows.  Some of the largest employers in the country are availing of the scheme.</p>  <p>  As the T&aacute;naiste is aware, we are in the middle of a housing crisis.  It has been reported that lenders are cancelling mortgage facilities to applicants who were already given the go-ahead.  That means people are losing their homes and deposits.  What is the Government going to do to ensure lenders are not using the wage subsidy scheme to blackball mortgage applicants?</p></speech>

This matter has been raised by Ministers in our interactions with the banks.</p> <p>As the Deputy knows, it is a tricky issue.  If somebody is in receipt of the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, by definition, the company he or she works for must be down 30% or more in terms of turnover.  While that does not mean that person's job is at risk, it means it is more at risk than someone who works for a company that is not in receipt of the wage subsidy scheme.</p> <p> Banks cannot turn a blind eye to that when it comes to calculating risk.  We need to be honest about that.  Again, however, I understand the case the Deputy has made.  In our engagement with the banks, we make the point that while this is a commercial decision for them and they must assess it as part of their risk calculation, they need to be sensitive to people and have regard to that.</p></speech>

He heard Deputy Fitzmaurice and others saying that construction workers, farmers and people trying to get a college cannot get their theory tests.  How are we going to build back better or take off like a rocket?  I hope the T&aacute;naiste is not too fatigued after his Ard Fheis on top of building 40,000 houses.

A person can then input details and submit his or her application.  However, because both of the students who are applying or going into the next year do not have the registration confirmed yet by the colleges, they are not linked.  This creates an internal review, which means there is a 30-day wait for a further decision.  Both students need to create an internal review and get letters from the colleges.  Even if only one student does it, it means that the second will not get the increase of what is available due to two siblings attending college.</p>  <p>  This year will be a nightmare.  Many internal reviews are going to happen come September as a result of a change in circumstances and the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, being stopped.  I call on the T&aacute;naiste to make sure a team is tasked with linking students together, which was stated on the original SUSI grant applications, and sending a double consent form for both students to sign to give permission to share information in order that they can register for college and both go automatically.

Obviously, the aim is to move down through the age groups and vaccinate people in their 30s now, moving into those in their 20s and then to people aged between 16 and 20.

There is a real risk, not just of new variants of Covid-19, but also the return of respiratory viruses such as flu and respiratory syncytial virus, RSV, which were suppressed last year.</p>  <p>  It is the plan of Government to have a similar vaccine programme for influenza this winter on a similar scale to last year.  One thing we must look at, though, is the nasal spray for children, which we did for the first time last winter.  The uptake on that was actually pretty low.  We will need to see if perhaps there is a better way to do that.</p></speech>

I very much welcome that.  I am glad that the State took that challenge.</p>  <p>  I am aware, however, of local authorities using contractors who are paying significantly below the rate set out in the SEO.  I have seen payslips from workers who are being paid &euro;10.50 per hour for doing work the SEO states should be paid at a rate of &euro;19.37 per hour.  That means that after deductions, workers are coming out with &euro;372.36 for 39 hours' work.</p>  <p>  What is the point of the SEO if local authorities are paying contractors who are going to undermine the rate?  The SEO sets the minimum.  Not only are these workers not getting the rate but they are not getting the contributions into their pension either.  I ask that the T&aacute;naiste examine the evidence, which I will share it with him, but also that he sends a directive to the people who are spending State money to the effect that they need to use it to support the SEOs, not undermine them.</p></speech>

We plan to have some more of them.  The Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy English, has launched the process to have one quite soon in the area of childcare.</p>  <p>  I will be happy to receive that evidence and information from the Deputy.  Of course, local authorities and public bodies should be compliant and should not pay below the legal minimum rates.  They are not just agreed rates or union rates.  They are the legal minimum rates in those sectors and they must be applied.</p></speech>

It is hugely significant in the context of John the Baptist Community School in Hospital, County Limerick.  For the forthcoming year, it will facilitate students who are attending their second nearest school to be able to avail of school transport as a concessionary.  That is to be very much welcomed.</p>  <p>  It is going into the rural areas of Ballyneety, Knockea, Ballybricken, Caherconlish and Fedamore in east County Limerick, which will make an enormous difference to these people.  I have been working with the parents and the school on this for a long number of years.  They have this peculiarity where their nearest school is measured from the general post office, GPO, in Limerick city but their main nearest school is their local school, namely, John the Baptist Community School.</p></speech>

Two years later, it is unacceptable that the report is still not published in time for the 2022 budget.  The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, stated in the Chamber last November that the disability capacity review was completed and would be published in due course.  That was eight months ago and there is still no sign of it.  This delay is unnecessary, unethical and unwarranted and it is increasing frustrations for my constituents in County Clare.  The failure to ratify the optional protocol to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in a timely manner is a further unnecessary roadblock to progress.  Will the T&aacute;naiste intervene on these serious matters and ensure the publication of the two reports and the ratification of the optional protocol are accelerated with the utmost urgency in time for budget 2022?</p></speech>

I do not know when it is intended to publish the Indecon report but I will check it out and get back to her by correspondence.  The Government is keen to build on our ratification of the Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities by opting into the optional protocol as well, but we need to make sure we are ready to do so.  I do not think we are quite there yet but we have never been closer.</p></speech>

I refer to the settlement of a case this week concerning the death of the baby of a couple, which I raise with the permission of their solicitor, on the basis of exceptionally poor clinical judgment, erroneous advice and exceptionally poor risk management by the hospital.  It conceded liability in full at 3.55 p.m. yesterday, with nobody there from the hospital to pay any respect to the couple or give any serious apology.  Everything that can be done should now be done to protect Ms Price, Mr. Kiely and their baby son, Christopher, whose name should never have needed to be read into the record of this House, from ever having to see this happen to another couple.</p>  <p>  What happened to them should never happen again.  We are having the wrong conversation on national maternity hospital.  We need to talk about clinical management and the risk to women.  We do, of course, need to talk about where and on whose land the new hospital should be built and under what governance it should operate, but unless we also talk about ongoing risk management and how women are treated holistically, we are having the wrong conversation.</p></speech>

I know something about the very sad case she raised but I do not know all the details of it.  That is why I will be restrained in my comments.  It was obviously an enormous tragedy for the family and I can only imagine what it is like to be told your child will be born with a severe disability, or perhaps not born alive, and to go ahead with a termination believing it is the right thing for all those involved, only to be told later there was a mistake in the test and that your child would have been born healthy.  I cannot imagine it and I do not think someone could ever get over it, quite frankly.  I welcome that the national maternity hospital has conceded liability.  Once again, it is sad that liability, where it is conceded, is only admitted at the last minute and perhaps could have been done sooner.  I would encourage anyone involved in such cases to be as sensitive and honest as possible in their dealings with those involved.</p></speech>

Residents in the Mervue area have raised concerns that the build-to-rent nature of the proposed development at Crown Square will result in sky-high rents that ordinary working people, including the children of locals, many of whom want to continue to live and raise families in the Mervue area, will be unable to afford.  Build-to-rent development goes against the Government's national planning framework, which encourages sustainable living in town and city centres.  There are also concerns regarding lower standards in build-to-rent apartments.  We need good-quality apartments that people can rent at an affordable price and can afford to buy.  Does the T&aacute;naiste have concerns about the lack of affordable apartment buildings in Galway?</p></speech>

A lot of apartment buildings would not be built at all were it not for the fact there was an investor willing to invest in them and pay upfront to provide the finance for them.  Nobody would win if there were fewer apartments built.  It would drive up prices and rents for everyone and we need to bear that in mind.  We also need to bear in mind that there are people who need to rent for one reason or another for a period in their lives, if not for a long period.  I do not like to see some politicians referring to people who live in apartments or people who rent as transients.  I thought that was a very strange comment.  What we need is for people not to oppose every type of housing development because they do not agree with a particular type of housing.  We need more types of housing of all sorts in all places.</p></speech>

What stage is the Government at with the new violence reduction strategy it promised?  Will the Government consider a knife amnesty, which has worked before in this jurisdiction, when it was used in Limerick, and has been very successful in Scotland?  Unlike some parties in the House, the Government parties do not walk away when it comes to matters of criminal justice in this State.  I want to know what succour the Government can provide for the victims of knife crime and, more importantly, what protections it can provide to ensure this worrying rise in knife crime is stopped in its tracks.</p></speech>

They are being charged either astronomical insurance premiums or they are not getting quotes at all.  I know of a rural community centre in Louth with a turnover of &euro;6,000 that is paying substantially more than &euro;2,000 a year in public liability insurance.  The organisations operating in that centre also need their own insurance.  I am aware of a community organisation with responsibility for a small piece of ground that is now being charged approximately &euro;3,000 a year for public liability insurance, when the cost previously was &euro;600 to &euro;800.  We need to deal with the duty of care issue and the duty of play issue, which relates to personal responsibility.  Another factor is the insufficient number of underwriters in this particular part of the industry.

The Deputy will be familiar with the new personal injury guidelines that have just been agreed by the Judicial Council.  We anticipate that this guidance will bring down awards and should, therefore, also bring down premiums.  We are advancing the Criminal Justice (Perjury and Related Offences) Bill 2018 to enable us to take a harder line against people who make bogus or exaggerated claims.  We are also reviewing the duty of care legislation to rebalance the responsibility in a way that ensures a fair balance between community centres, for example, and other businesses and people who might sustain injury.  There is a list of actions under the action plan for insurance.</p></speech>

Walking tourism in west Cork is now worth &euro;14 million to the local economy and is growing from year to year.  We have some spectacular walks, including the Beara way, Sheep's Head way, Seven Heads walk and Mizen Head walk, to name but a few.  A total of 695 landowners, mainly farmers, maintain these west Cork walks for the public to enjoy.  West Cork Development Partnership has successfully administered this walks scheme for many years but it has only two part-time recreation officers to look after the 695 existing landowner participants.  For a similar scheme in Leitrim, where 25 landowners are involved, there is, rightly, one full-time rural recreation officer to administer the scheme.</p> <p>For the future of the successful walks scheme, be it the Beara-Breifne Way or other routes under the West Cork Development Partnership, at least four full-time rural recreation officers are needed.  Will the T&aacute;naiste work with the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Humphreys, and the many County Cork Oireachtas Members who attended a Zoom meeting on the issue this morning, to organise a meeting with the aim of working towards a solution on this crisis issue for the greater benefit of tourism and farmers in west Cork?</p></speech>

Obviously there was good news in January from the Minister for Health that the funding would be obtained via the HSE service plan.  Will the T&aacute;naiste give campaigners a commitment on when the programme will be rolled out because this campaign has gone on far too long?  Families in desperate situations have gone through a licensing system which is very cumbersome and bureaucratic and does not really work.  If this programme gets up and running, medical cannabis products may be issued under prescription for the first time.

This week I met the Therapists for Change group, which represents psychotherapists.  Its main concern is the HSE's over-reliance on charities to provide mental health services, where the prevailing culture is that pre-accredited and post-accredited psychotherapists are expected to work for nothing.  Pre-accredited counsellors and therapists are caught up in this unpaid system but they must do this unpaid time in order to get a job.  Group members have a couple of asks.  One is that the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, meet them, and they have sent a letter off to her today.  The second question relates to when CORU will open up its registers to counsellors and psychotherapists to allow the HSE to recognise psychotherapy qualifications and employ psychotherapists directly.</p></speech>

This has been the culmination of nearly a year's work by me and my departmental officials, along with members of the Oireachtas committee, who did much work to get us to this stage.  The Bill has been passed through the Seanad, as Members know, and what is now coming before the D&aacute;il is very important legislation.  It is a major priority for me, as the Minister responsible for housing, to deliver affordable housing for working people and to provide hope for a whole generation that feels it has been locked out of the housing market.  I am very pleased to be here today and I thank Members for their input so far.</p>  <p>  At its heart, this Bill is about the State stepping up to provide affordable homes for purchase and rent using all means at its disposal to tackle the housing crisis.  The ongoing affordability crisis has reduced home ownership rates to historic lows.  It has increased the age of the average first-time buyer by almost a decade to just under 36 years of age.  Ireland has plummeted from a world leader to below the EU average rate of home ownership.  For an entire generation, owning a home is slipping through people's fingers as they pay over unprecedented levels of rent or languish in their parents' houses.  A generation is caught in an unaffordable rent trap.</p>  <p>  We must put in place the legislative buildings blocks of a new approach to the crisis, one which puts home ownership back on the table for a generation that has been smothered by rising rents and job uncertainty.  This housing crisis is not about one party or the Government but about giving a whole generation hope and investing in the future of our democracy.  The Affordable Housing Bill 2021 is a very important step in rising to that challenge.  It places the legislative foundations for the State to put bricks and mortar on the ground to directly tackle the housing crisis, particularly in the area of affordable rents and purchase.  It is the most comprehensive affordable housing Bill ever published.  It is radical and a clear departure and change from what has been the housing policy.  It is a change that many thousands of our young people are looking for.</p>  <p>  I firmly believe home ownership is good for individuals, families, communities and the country.  With this in mind I have put affordability and the chance to own one's own home at the heart of this Government's housing policy.  This Bill and the Land Development Agency Bill 2021 are going through the Oireachtas simultaneously and will work in tandem to give people the opportunity of ownership.  These two landmark pieces of legislation are backed up by the largest housing budget in the history of the State and our most ambitious social housing targets on record.  Combined, this represents a major step change in our housing policy that mobilises both the public and private sector.</p>  <p>  This Bill has four key new elements.  There is the first local authority-led direct-build affordable homes on State lands in over a decade.  There is our first ever national cost-rental scheme and an innovative shared equity scheme.  Finally, it will expand Part V provisions to increase the percentage contribution to 20% and to apply it to cost rental as well as social and affordable housing.  These elements of the Part V expansion will be brought to Members for consideration on Committee Stage, following the conclusion of our work with the Attorney General and Cabinet approval last Tuesday.</p> <p>The upcoming housing for all plan, which will be published next month, will set out an ambitious range of targets across the country over the coming years.  The roll-out of local authority-led affordable housing will be a central plank of the Government&rsquo;s affordable housing plan.  Homes will broadly range from &euro;160,000 to &euro;310,000.  I have worked with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and am glad that we have agreed a number of significant reforms to the serviced sites fund to ensure it can help local authorities effectively fund major housing delivery, and to get on with the delivery of those affordable homes.</p> <p> Shared equity will involve the State bridging the affordability gap by taking an equity stake of up to 20% between an individual&rsquo;s mortgage limits and the price of the home.  It will work in conjunction with the help-to-buy scheme to help to get people into homes this year, starting this year.  It will be one tool in helping to turn generation rent into a generation that can buy and own their own home.</p> <p> On shared equity, I want to address some of the concerns and comments that have been raised, and tackle some of the unfounded and opportunistic criticisms around a particular aspect of the Bill, to dispel any uncertainty and directly tackle deliberate misinformation.  Because of the Opposition&rsquo;s hesitancy, in some quarters, to acknowledge that it is broadly supportive of most of the measures contained in the Bill, such as local authority direct build affordable homes, expanding Part V and a new form of tenure in cost rental, a particular and intentionally distracting focus has been paid to the affordable purchase shared equity scheme.  I intend that this scheme will be a short-term, targeted measure as part of a much broader multifaceted approach to increasing housing supply and affordability.  This specific measure on shared equity increase viability and generate supply to provide an immediate boost to first-time buyers for new homes.  It has been developed in very close consultation with relevant Departments, housing delivery partners, international comparator bodies and other key stakeholders.  It will work.  We have examined and assessed the impact of similar schemes, not the same schemes, in other jurisdictions, including in England, learning from experience and developing an Irish scheme that is calibrated for Ireland.  With regard to our nearest neighbour, the English scheme has supported 250,000 home purchases.  An independent assessment conducted by the UK&rsquo;s National Audit Office - the equivalent of Ireland's Comptroller and Auditor General, not the London School of Economics - found that the scheme has met its twin objectives of increasing supply and increasing home ownership.  The office's analysis found it increased supply by 14% and that purchase price or house price inflation rose by approximately 1% on a like-for-like basis.</p> <p> Certain elements of the Opposition, but not all, may not want this scheme to provide support to house purchasers.  I believe those needing to buy a home want support.  They deserve support and they need it.  A recent Behaviour &amp;amp; Attitudes survey found that 76% of those expressing a view were in favour of the introduction of a shared equity scheme as a means of making the cost of homes more affordable.  We have a decision on whether we delay further to allow people to continue to pay up to &euro;2,000 a month in rent, or help them to get a mortgage that would be half of that, and help them to get to own their home now.  There should be no more procrastination.  We must get on and do it.</p> <p> Nevertheless, taking on board legitimate concerns, safeguards over and above those in place in the UK's scheme are being built in to tailor eligibility to meet individual affordability needs only and to manage prices through area-based price ceilings.  These price ceilings are price caps, not price targets.  The price ceilings are based on real data, which is the CSO-recorded median price of new first-time buyer homes sold in each area.  This means that developers will build homes in the lower half of the price distribution specific to that area.  I am happy to confirm, again, that this will explicitly not be a second mortgage.  It is an equity stake.  It is not a debt-led scheme.  It will not compel homeowners to borrow more than they can afford.  It will not attract exorbitant interest rates, as some have tried to portray earlier in the debate.</p> <p> I am pleased that the provision of cost rental has been widely welcomed by a range of political and research groups.  It will see rents that are anticipated to be the region of 25% to 30% lower than comparable market rents, and which will provide greater returns as they mature.  This is an entirely new form of tenure and an exciting departure for housing in Ireland.  Cost rental will cover the cost of developing and managing those developments, and will provide State-backed affordable rents for our people.</p> <p> I want to correct any suggestion that the inclusion of a very limited return on equity is equivalent to allowing the private sector to generate large profits in this space.  We want to broaden out and expand cost rental.  The Exchequer will need assistance in doing that.  Where any private providers wish to deliver cost rental homes, for instance large institutional pension funds, or indeed ethical funds, they will of course seek a modest return.  The legislation provides for regulatory-making powers to set a cap on the allowable level of return.   For example, between 3.5% and 5% is permitted under the exemplar Austrian cost rental model of cost rental, which we are seeking to emulate in Ireland.  This allows the delivery of cost rental at scale and a model that is not entirely reliant on State support.  Furthermore, this provision will allow the Land Development Agency, LDA, to deliver cost rental at scale, and to provide for some modest returns in that space to reinvest into further cost rental across the board.  That is for those who are supporting the Land Development Agency Bill 2021, and who support the LDA in building homes.  This will be a very important deliverer in this space with where we start breaking ground this year.</p> <p> I will now turn to Part V and first-time buyers.  I have previously confirmed that it is my intention to bring forward further changes to strengthen this Bill on Committee Stage.  This will include expanding Part V provisions of the Planning and Development Act 2000 to increase the percentage contribution and to make it available for the provision of affordable housing by local authorities and approved housing bodies, AHBs.  The provisions, however, will require that the Part V contribution for social housing will be a minimum 10%, which is protected.  In areas where there is no affordable purchase or rental need, which will be very few areas but there may be some, all of the 20% will be applied to social housing provision.</p> <p> My Department is also currently working on amendments to create an owner-occupier guarantee.  This will involve enabling local authorities to designate a specified number of houses and duplexes with a predetermined range of at least 0% to 50% in a development for owner-occupiers similar to requirements under Part V.  It will complement the actions taken by the Minister for Finance and me last month on protecting traditional family homes from bulk purchasing.</p> <p> We are in the middle of a national housing crisis.  We are taking steps to address that.  Faced with such an emergency we need to use all the tools at our disposal to address this challenge across the private and the public sector.  I am genuinely committed to pragmatism over ideology and real delivery over dogmatism to boost housing supply and open up home ownership to a new generation.  To refuse to use the private sector would be fighting with one hand tied behind our back.  Instead we need to show energy, innovation, flexibility and commitment to get bricks and mortar into the ground, with the State playing a central role.  The State is the biggest builder and biggest investor in housing.  This will remain so through our housing for all plan, which we will publish in the coming weeks.  In this light, the Bill is very important legislation.  It is a major leap forward in housing policy.  It is also a major leap forward into helping people own their own home or to rent their home at an affordable rate.</p> <p> I look forward to a debate on the Bill's provisions.  I will seek to respond to any specific questions put forward by Deputies in that regard.  I genuinely look forward to any suggestion on Committee Stage for how this legislation can be improved.  We need this legislation to pass by the summer recess.  It is urgent and important.</p> <p>A lot of very detailed work has gone into it.  There was good pre-legislative work done by the Oireachtas joint committee, which was also protracted.  There was good debate in the Seanad throughout all Stages, including amendments.</p> <p> I fundamentally put to colleagues, and I say this respectfully, that if they support home ownership for generation rent, they will support and vote for the Bill.  If they support affordable and cost rental, they will vote for the Bill.  If they really want affordable homes on State land for our young people and not so young people to buy, they will vote for the Bill.  If they want every newly granted planning application for new housing estates after the passing of the Bill to include an increased affordable housing provision, they will vote for the Bill.  There are no ifs or buts at this stage.  There is no equivocation and no conditions.  It is now time to start delivering for our people.  This is the basis for delivering affordable housing at scale on private and public land.</p> <p> People are watching.  There is great interest in this legislation and this initiative by the Government to deliver real opportunities for people to buy and rent homes at an affordable rate.  Now is the time for Members to decide whether they are for helping generation rent get out of that rent trap and whether they really want to start developing affordable homes for people at scale, through this legislation and separately in the LDA legislation, which are intertwined.</p> <p> I am acutely interested to hear views and I have heard views all the way through this.  At the end of the day, Deputies either support these measures or they do not.  I hope we will get as much cross-party and independent support for the measures I am bringing through, in the first year of this Government being in place.  Others have fed into the process and I welcome this.  I welcome the feedback I have received on this.  Now is not the time to allow someone's perfect be the enemy of the good.  We need to get on with delivering affordable homes to rent and to buy for our people.  This is the way forward to do so.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-06-24a.352" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1468" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021062400031#GG00200"><p>The Bill has been two and a half years in gestation.  Considerable work on the legislation and the ideas behind it started a year before the previous Government fell.  As I understand it, the working group continued to work on it during the interregnum and modest changes, in my view, have been added by the Government.  This means the legislation before us in fact does not represent the profound change in housing policy the Minister claims.  It is much more a continuation not only of many of the core principles of Rebuilding Ireland but of Deputy Alan Kelly's Social Housing Strategy 2020, which was launched in 2014.</p>  <p>  I will go through each of the four principal areas of the Bill to give the Minister my feedback.  As the Minister knows, Sinn F&eacute;in supports the Bill.  It is a qualified support.  There are sections of the Bill the Minister undoubtedly knows we completely oppose.  Even on those sections we broadly support, we believe the Minister could do a much better job and we look forward to engaging with them on these crucial matters on Committee and Report Stages.</p>  <p>  All of the elements of the Bill, bar the shared equity loan scheme, are measures on which Sinn F&eacute;in, other Opposition parties and other Government parties have been campaigning and calling for years.  An affordable purchase scheme led by our local authorities is something for which I and the Minister argued throughout the lifetime of the previous Government.  We will support any measure that assists and funds local authorities, AHBs and community housing trusts to deliver genuinely affordable homes for people to buy.</p>  <p>  The serviced sites fund model is not a bad model.  There are better ways of doing it and the permanently affordable leasehold model Sinn F&eacute;in has proposed was initially proposed by &Oacute; Cualann.  Unfortunately, the banks would not support it.  It is one that would guarantee not just affordability for the first purchaser but for all subsequent purchasers, to build up a stock of permanently affordable privately-owned tradeable homes into perpetuity.  However, we support the serviced sites fund model at its current level so long as the homes are purchased at prices of &euro;250,000 or less.  It is important to be very clear the purchaser of that home still has to repay the shared equity portion at a later stage but for us the purchase point of &euro;250,000 or less is key.</p>  <p>  The difficulty is that the serviced sites fund is being used in other ways and we have some concerns about this, which I will make very clear.  For example, in O'Devaney Gardens, because of the joint venture nature of the development with a private developer the purchase price of a three-bedroom unit would be &euro;310,000 plus the &euro;50,000 shared equity portion to be repayable to the local authority.  This is &euro;360,000.  This is not affordable.  It is the wrong use of the fund and I urge the Minister to examine it.</p>  <p>  Likewise, the Department refused under the previous Minister to fund Dublin City Council to buy the glass bottle site to deliver the 15% affordable housing as part of the Poolbeg strategic development zone, and this land is now being bought above the guide price by the Johnny Ronan real estate group and others.  The serviced sites fund, even if it were increased to &euro;100,000, may not and probably will not on its own, deliver genuine affordability.  So far, I am not seeing much evidence of the Minister or the Department assisting Dublin City Council with this.  It is very disappointing that we do not have the regulations with respect to the scheme, and I ask the Minister in his response to let us know where they are at, when he intends to publish them and whether he will consult the Oireachtas housing committee.  Local authorities need this to progress as quickly as possible and we will not stand in the way of it.</p>  <p>  With respect to cost rental, it is very disappointing the section is a short number of pages, which means, in fact, the Bill does not deal with the substance of cost rental.  This in itself will be dealt with through regulations.  I make the same point as to when we will see these regulations and whether the Minister will consult, albeit in a time-limited manner, with the Oireachtas housing committee on these.  The key problem, however, with how cost rental has been developed to date is that the entry level rents are too high.  The cost of &euro;1,100, &euro;1,200 and &euro;1,300 for one, two and three-bedroom units is not affordable for the key demographic above the threshold for social housing but unable to afford the private rental market.  The way in which the financing is being structured does not lend itself to bringing down the rents to the kind of levels we see with new cost rental in Germany or Austria, with rents of &euro;700, &euro;800 or &euro;900 a month depending on where they are.  This means the financing model needs to ensure the soft loan component for the State covers at least 30% of the capital costs and the loan, whether from the European Investment Bank, EIB, the Housing Finance Agency, HFA, or elsewhere, is for 30 years or more, after which the soft loan from the State would be repaid.</p>  <p>  It is a bizarre idea to separate the primary delivery of cost rental from the primary delivery of social rental.  One of the great values of integrating social and affordable rental into the one provider is when the long-term loans on the cost rental are eventually paid down, the housing provider has a revenue stream to recycle into the management and maintenance of their stock as well as developing new stock.  This idea that the LDA will be primarily involved in cost rental and local authorities primarily involved in social housing is the most short-sighted and ill-conceived element of the Government's approach to cost rental and I urge the Minister to reconsider.  The idea, for example, that St. Teresa's Gardens should be an LDA project rather than a fully funded Dublin City Council project makes no sense.  I am happy it will be 100% public housing similar to St. Michael's Estate but it would be much better if it was being developed as St Michael's Estate is, as opposed to what is essentially a split managed scheme with the local authority buying back the 30% social housing and the LDA ultimately profiting from the cost rental.</p>  <p>  I am concerned, notwithstanding the Minister's remarks, about the involvement of private developers in the delivery of affordable cost rental.  I want to be very clear.  If an AHB or local authority or community housing trust wants to access private finance, whether it is equity finance or loan finance, so long as the rates are competitive in comparison with the EIB and the HFA, I have no problem with it.  In fact, Cl&uacute;id Housing recently did a very positive deal with Legal and General to secure the financing of homes but homes it will own at a point in time.  If we allow private developers as opposed to private finance to deliver affordable cost rental, we will never get the return when that stock matures, which is one of the hugely important long-term benefits of this type of tenure.</p>  <p>  The Minister clearly misunderstands the arguments many of us are making.  It is not about the level of profit.  Finance always costs something and if the cost of the finance is competitive that is not the problem.  It is that at a point in time in the future, when the principal loans mature and the housing provider generates a revenue surplus, it should not go to the private sector.  It should be recycled into public housing, whether delivered by local authorities, AHBs or other providers.</p> <p>On the shared equity loan scheme, the Minister's attempt to disregard very significant concerns from economists, reputable bodies like the ESRI and others is disingenuous.  This is a terrible scheme which will inflate house prices.  We know that is the case because that it what it does everywhere else.  It led to a 6% increase in house prices in London.  The Minister continually and knowingly, in my view, misrepresents the UK's National Audit Office report.  That report does not look at inflation.  Rather, it looks at the house price premium which is a completely different metric.  We have said this to the Minister repeatedly and he keeps misrepresenting it because he thinks it will serve his interests. <br/><br/>This is a secondary loan.  If it was purely a shared equity stake there would be no interest rate on it.  The problem with interest rates is that the Minister is right.  They start very low.  If somebody is not in a position to start repaying a loan, in particular when he or she gets to year 15 and onwards, the interest rates will become punitive.  The reason is that the purpose of the interest rate is to incentivise the buyer to repay at an earlier stage or remortgage at year 15 or 20.  Unfortunately, as we learned from the last failed Fianna F&aacute;il shared ownership scheme which had a mortgage interest rate four times higher than mainstream banks after the Celtic tiger collapse in 2008, modest income families at risk of losing income at a future point in time will not be able to refinance and will end up with very heavy housing costs.<br/><br/>I would like the Minister, if he could, to confirm in his remarks if the Central Bank has made a formal decision on the inclusion of the banks as co-partners in the scheme.  He seemed to indicate earlier today in another debate that they have.  If that is the case, can he tell us the detail of how much is involved and whether staff from the banks will be seconded into the special purpose vehicle to administer the loans?  That also carries certain risks.  Just as help to buy clearly led to an increase in house prices, and 60% of those availing of it did not need it because they had sufficient mortgage finance and deposit finance to buy a home, this will be the same.  I suspect it will grow and last much longer than the Minister is claiming.<br/><br/>I fully welcome the provisions regarding Part V.  The Minister knows he supported a Sinn F&eacute;in Bill to a similar effect during the last Government.  It should never have been reduced to 10%.  It is something Fianna F&aacute;il and Sinn F&eacute;in firmly agree on and the sooner that is introduced the better. <br/><br/>On the owner occupiers guarantee, the Minister needs to reconsider having some level of application of the guarantee to apartments.  If we want to have vibrant and sustainable cities and if those cities are, in the main, going to be made up of new apartment developments, we need to give people the option to own those apartments.  Otherwise, what we are saying is that homeownership is something for the suburbs and regions, but not for inner city centres.  That is completely contrary to the national planning framework and good sustainable planning.  I urge the Minister to reconsider that and allow people to own and live in our city centres.<br/><br/>Likewise, it should be a provision in the owner occupier guarantee that the figure could be up to 100%.  Planning authorities are best placed to decide the percentage tenure mix of rent or owner occupation in a given location.  I would like to see that addressed.<br/><br/>In the few minutes I have before I conclude, I would like to say that legislation does not build houses.  Investment does.  While the Bill provides an important framework for that investment, if it is not followed up by a level of direct capital investment by the State in the delivery of genuinely affordable homes for working people to rent or buy, then all of this will come to very little.  Our problem at the moment is that we know from figures given to the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage by the LDA and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, which are based on the current levels of investment in our local authorities, AHBs and the LDA, that delivery of affordable homes between now and 2025 will be exceptionally modest. <br/><br/>The Department has told us that this year 530 units could be delivered, between rental and purchase.  Next year the figure could reach 700.  By 2023 it may get to 1,000, but they are pre-Covid figures.  The LDA will not have delivered a single home until five years after it has been established, in 2023, and even then it will only be a few hundred.  It will be 2025 before it breaches 1,000.  That tells me that unless something changes in budget 2022, the Government will not reach the target of 4,000 affordable homes by 2025.  Obviously, that is the average over a ten-year plan, and I appreciate that, but the Minister can hear the point I am making.<br/><br/> My view is very clear.  We need, at a minimum, an annual average target of 8,000 genuinely affordable homes every single year for the next decade.  Half of those should be affordable rental and half should be affordable purchase.  The reason I say that is that is what the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, housing agencies, the ESRI and, more recently, the NTMA, have called on the Government to do.  We need a doubling of direct capital investment in local authorities, AHBs, community housing trusts or whatever other not for profit providers exist to deliver those home. <br/><br/>The problem is that Fine Gael does not want to spend that money.  That is why we are having such uncertainty around the future funding of the LDA and the cost rental equity loan was a measly &euro;35 million this year, despite the fact that the Minister's budget ask from his Fine Gael colleagues in the Department of Finance was actually much more significant than that.  That is why we have a cost-rental equity loan, CREL, scheme in the first place rather than an expanded capital advance loan facility.  We need 20,000 public homes, comprising 12,000 social and 8,000 affordable, annually if we are going to make a dent in this crisis.<br/><br/>The last points I want to make are about home ownership.  The Minister, as he liked to do in opposition, now says as Minister that he believes in home ownership.  Home ownership started to decline, and declined most rapidly, when the Minister's party was last in government because of the private sector-led policy his party pursued which pushed up house prices and rents and made home ownership difficult for so many.<br/><br/>If the Minister is serious and genuinely wants to deliver homes at prices that people can afford, then he needs to radically shift policy.  I have yet to see any evidence of that.  Ultimately, however, the locked out generation, the housing needs of which the Minister and I want to see met, will judge by action and not fine words on the floor of the D&aacute;il or ink on the page of a piece of legislation.  They will judge on how many homes are built and at what price they are delivered year after year. <br/><br/>Until we see the level of public investment that everybody, bar the Government, seems to think is needed in the direct delivery of affordable homes to rent or buy, this problem will not be solved.  If the Minister comes out with a great plan in the summer, and takes the advice of Sinn F&eacute;in, NESC and NTA and doubles capital investment in the delivery of public housing in budget 2022, he will have our support.  If not, we will keep coming back and saying that until there is real change, the crisis will get worse and we will continue to advocate what we believe are the necessary solutions to give people the affordable homes that they not only need to but rightly deserve.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-06-24a.354" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1470" speakername="Dessie Ellis" time="13:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021062400032#HH00200"><p>T&aacute; an-&aacute;thas orm go bhfuilim ag labhairt ar an mBille seo.  T&aacute; s&eacute; an-t&aacute;bhachtach ar fad.  The programme for Government promised to deliver an affordable housing scheme to help out first-time buyers and, in exceptional circumstances, those who lost their homes in the financial crash as well as those who were forced to sell their homes as a result of a relationship break up.  These are the principle ways to avail of the affordable housing scheme.  However, the Minister's recent announcements as to what constitutes affordability as a maximum of &euro;450,000 for an apartment and &euro;500,000 for a house in Dublin has sent shockwaves to anyone trying to put together a deposit to buy a house or apartment.</p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">  Those buying their first home will need to have saved at least 10% of the house price as a deposit, but preferably up to 20%.  Additional costs would also include the likes of legal fees.  As the Minister</font>can see, there is already a heavy financial burden being placed on first-time buyers.  This is clearly a disincentive for many young people looking to get on the property ladder for the first time and will shackle them to long-term renting.  Others will have to continue to live in the family home.</p><p>It is a positive move that the Minister proposes to return the Part V take to 20% of any housing development if the development comprises more than nine units.  This should have been done long ago and it is something that we in Sinn F&eacute;in vehemently opposed when it was originally changed to 10%.  It is to be hoped this will happen.  However, it is not clear what proportion of this 20% will go towards affordable housing. </p><p>Prior to 2015, the breakdown was 10% social and 10% affordable.  Is it the intention of the Minister to do something similar?  I heard him say that he is talking about that.  He has clarified some of these matters, but further clarity is needed.</p> <p> I have a great concern that, among other categories of development that are exempt under Part V, one is where a site is on land of 1,000 sq. m or less.  This has had a detrimental effect on developments that are mainly located in the city centre and where more than nine units are being built.  This exemption is being abused and should be removed.</p> <p> It appears that the Minister has set the affordable rental bar too high, which is at approximately &euro;1,300 per month in Dublin on average.  These high rents have two effects: first, they are not affordable for many people; and, second, a great part of many people's incomes goes on paying rents, leaving them with no spare capacity to save for a house deposit.  Even couples in good employment on what would be considered reasonable incomes would struggle to pay such high rents.</p> <p> The use of homeless housing assistance payment, HAP, and housing HAP cost the State &euro;422.729 million up to 2019, and the cost is still rising.  More money is given to homeless HAP than housing HAP and local authorities have discretion to exceed the HAP rent limits for homeless households, including people in homeless accommodation.  Local authorities are authorised to uplift HAP amounts by up to 20%.  In the Dublin region, this can rise to 50%.  Large sums of money are being spent by local authorities that could otherwise be used for building sustainable social housing.</p> <p> The Minister's plans for a new affordable purchase shared equity scheme whereby the State would take a 20% equity in a purchased property have previously proven unworkable.  Experience of such schemes shows that they have led to inflated house prices and individuals accumulating large and unsustainable debts, forcing them to go from mortgage to rent after having paid their mortgages for many years along with their rent as the schemes entailed.  We are still dealing with the repercussions of these earlier share ownership schemes.  The flaws in the Minister's proposed scheme have been highlighted not just by us, but by economic organisations like the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, and even members of his own party and other Government parties.  I hope that the Minister takes on board our concerns and does not repeat the mistakes of the past.</p></speech>

He seems to have shifted on the Bill following the discussion in the Seanad, and there will be more shifts on Committee Stage in terms of Part V developments.  I look forward to further detail on same.</p>  <p>  I wish to speak about affordability and what is happening in the market.  House prices are increasing all over the country.  There is a general assumption that this is based on pent-up demand now hitting a market with a low level of supply.  There is a degree of truth in that, but as the Minister knows, I have been paying close attention to the activities of investment funds in the second-hand housing market across the country, particularly the Dublin region, which includes my constituency.  The impact of those activities on prices is disgraceful and is artificially inflating what is already a red-hot housing market.</p>  <p>  In recent months, I have been tracking a particular estate in my constituency, which the Minister also represents.  Four houses were put up for sale in the early part of this year.  They were the same type of house and each had an asking price of approximately &euro;300,000, which in the madness of today's Dublin housing market actually seems somewhat affordable.  That is how crazy the market is.  Three of the four houses were sold off market to an investment fund.  The fund offered &euro;20,000 or slightly more above the asking price.  The general public did not know that these three houses were for sale because only the fourth hit the websites and windows of estate agents.  I do not know what the other house went for, but the three bought by the investment fund went for &euro;320,000 or &euro;325,000.  A fifth house of the same type in the estate has now been put up for sale on the open market for approximately &euro;330,000.  That price is not to do with the pent-up demand of first-time buyers, families, people downsizing or whatever.  Rather, it is down to the investment fund setting a price early this year of &euro;320,000 or &euro;325,000 off market.  It is a large estate and I am not sure whether other new houses have been sold in recent weeks or will be put up for sale for investment funds to snap up.  When we hit October or November, we will see asking prices of &euro;350,000.  Block buying apartments and estates like what happened in Kildare, Santry and elsewhere is disgraceful, but what is happening with investment funds in the second-hand market is disgraceful and immoral and it is not getting enough attention.</p>  <p>  My example is relevant to the Bill because it raises a question about the extent to which investment funds are skewing asking prices and the impact of that on the calculations that will define affordability based on house prices in particular areas.  As the Minister mentioned, there will be an area-specific ceiling.  That sounds like a good idea, but I will not jump into a discussion on it because I want to hear more detail.  It is scandalous that housing in a particular estate has increased in price by &euro;50,000 because 75% of the purchasers are investment funds that did not buy from the open market.  I would like the Minister to guarantee the D&aacute;il that his Department is aware of this issue, is devising more sophisticated and harsher measures to tackle it and will not allow artificial activity in the second-hand housing market to impact the calculations for affordability, price ceilings and brackets for two-bedroom, three-bedroom or four-bedroom houses.  My concern is that they will be artificially skewed.</p>  <p>  When big investors and developers were active in the market previously and driving supply and prices, there was a visibility to it.  We knew what was going on because it was being reported, but what is happening now is insidious and under the radar.  We all need to discuss and tackle it more, but it is ultimately the responsibility of the Minister, his Department and his fellow Ministers where appropriate, for example, the Minister for Finance, to eradicate it from the housing market.  It is taking homes away from people who need them.</p>  <p>  I believe it was the Minister who stated that the average age of first-time buyers now was 36 years, or perhaps it was Deputy &Oacute; Broin.</p></speech>

We all meet people who, since their early to mid-20s and through two recessions, have been painstakingly saving and operating in a fluctuating and regulatory environment to try to get on the market.  They hope and pray that a house in a particular estate opens up, and when one does, there is the traditional bidding war between first-time buyers and other interested parties, but they do not know that there were three other houses that they did not even have a chance of getting and were swept away from them.  I cannot speak about it enough.  It needs to be resolved.</p>  <p>  Through this Bill, the Minister is having a crack at providing an affordable housing scheme that will work.  Our housing spokesperson, Senator Moynihan, has articulated through her many contributions in the Seanad that she has concerns about the calculation of affordability and the way it should be linked to income.</p> <p>It is a fundamental flaw in how the Government is dealing with affordable housing in terms of setting prices for the houses and homes that will be delivered.  Nothing is affordable unless income can cover not only housing but the bills and costs that come with living in Ireland, which we know are quite extensive, be they health, education or basic costs of living.  Nothing is free in this country.  Everything is paid for, and paid for by ordinary workers.</p> <p> We need State investment in affordable housing at scale.  There is no other way.  We all agree on that, although there might be a couple of exceptions in this House.  The flaw in the lack of a definition of "affordability" impacts on some of the credibility of this Affordable Housing Bill.  The Labour Party still has concerns about the shared equity portion of the Bill and how it could serve to increase prices, despite all the voices in politics and beyond, including the ESRI and other agencies.  The Minister has spoken quite vociferously to that and has staked a claim that it will not be debt-led and it will be an equity stake to bridge the gap between mortgage and price.  However, this is a risk and a roll of the dice with this Bill.  There is no other way of putting it.  We know from other examples it has more or less always led to an increase in house prices.</p> <p> As we know, the housing affordability crisis affects young people disproportionately.  We have a whole locked-out generation, which is actually two generations considering the average age of a first-time house buyer.  We could have a third generation added to that, the people who are currently doing junior certificates, transition years and all the rest.  At this moment, unless Bills like this are proved to work, their post-college, post-apprenticeship or work futures are not looking too bright in terms of being able to afford to live.  I have previously spoken in this House about the traditional social contract whereby someone who went out to work and was in work, whether as a Secretary General in the Civil Service, a captain of industry, delivering bread, driving a taxi or whatever it might be, would ultimately be able to afford to buy a house.  If that person slipped below the threshold, the State was there with a local authority social housing scheme to make sure he or she was not going to fall through into the abyss.  We are a stage where neither of those two options exist successfully at the moment.  We do not have an affordable housing scheme or a supply of housing that meets the needs of young people and young workers and gives them hope.  We do not have a local authority social housing scheme that is capturing people the way it needs to and the waiting lists remain too high.  Some progress is being made but it is not enough.  </p> <p> As has been mentioned over the past few weeks, and as I stated at the start of my contribution, we need to kick investment funds out of the housing market.  They are causing untold damage, not only with bulk purchases of new estates but, as I articulated quite clearly with my examples, their activity in the second-hand housing market, which is having a significant impact that is going unrecorded and will have an adverse effect on any of the calculations or legislation coming through as part of a suite of housing legislation.  This Bill goes hand in hand with the LDA Bill and the Residential Tenancies (No. 2) Bill discussed last night, so there is an awful lot of housing legislation going through at the moment and much work being done in committees.  If we are not capturing the fundamentals of what is wrong in the market at the moment with this legislation, and my concern is we are not, then we will have a severe problem.</p> <p> The market-led approach, and it has been such since the mid-1990s, should have led to supply increasing and rents falling.  As we know, that just has not happened.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin highlighted rent and house prices from 2011.  House prices came down because of the crash.  We do not want them to go back up, but they happened because of a distinct, massive economic shock.  We need to be careful about where we are picking our figures from.  If we can bring our calculations back to people's current incomes that is the best way of doing it, rather than selectively picking a moment in time.  We could go back further and compare what our parents paid in mortgages or local authority rents, but that does not stand up. </p> <p> We will get more detail on the Part V issue the Minister mentioned, but if we are moving back up to 20%, what are the level of opt-outs going to be?  He can come back on this.  The Labour Party shipped a lot of criticism when it opted for 10%, bringing it down from 20%, but the reason we did that in government was the opt-outs in the previous scheme were such that on some estates not even 1% was being delivered.  One of the compromises we had to swallow, and "compromise" is a dirty word for many in politics but it is a fact of life, was that a flat 10% had to be delivered.  If a flat 10% was delivered throughout the history of Part V, we would probably not have such a housing crisis.  Under the previous regime, there were too many opt-outs, land swaps and cash deals done with local authorities to give them fields out in the middle of nowhere with no zoning whatsoever, where nothing could ever be built and local authorities cannot do anything with now.  In terms of bringing it up to 20%, if it is hard, fixed, fast and will really deliver at that level, it is to be welcomed.  I look forward to hearing from the Minister in his reply, and on Committee Stage, about what opt-outs there will be.</p> <p> Delivery and supply are key.  How these provisions interact with the LDA and wider Government policy is going to be the proof of this particular pudding.  What we can see in the approach to cuckoo funds who are buying up properties that exist out there at the moment does not give us cause to be too excited.  The lack of affordability being linked to income in the Bill is a real issue for the Labour Party as well.  We supported this Bill in the Seanad and we will support it in the D&aacute;il because there are measures in it that are good and need to be supported.  I hope the Minister knows from our record that we will judge everything on its merits.  We are happy to support what we believe in and happy to criticise, and argue strongly against, what we do not.  This Bill is a mixture of provisions that will help and provisions that need to be improved on, such as the shared equity scheme, which we believe will bump up house prices even further.  I thank the Minister for his contribution and look forward to hearing the rest of the debate remotely from my office.</p></speech>

There is a raft of housing legislation coming through the House and sometimes it can be very difficult for people watching to know how all of it will benefit them.  I will not trade political arguments in the Chamber but will try to explain to people out there who need help, and cannot afford to buy or rent a home, what this Bill does.  It is the first comprehensive affordable housing Bill the State has brought in.  It will effectively take public land, build homes on it and make them available, in some cases, below the cost of producing those homes.  It will mean that, once again, local authorities can build affordable housing and provide mixed estates.  It will make sure we can build communities.  I want young people to know the Government is building affordable housing on public land using the Bill.</p>  <p>  We are making a new form of affordable cost rental available.  We have heard about the Vienna housing model and what happens in other European cities.</p> <p>With this Bill we will build apartments.  If somebody does not qualify for social housing, we will ensure that he or she can access cost rental.  The person will have below-market rents for all his or her life, a secure tenure below the cost of renting.  It will mean a person will have security to rent if he or she is unable to get a mortgage and does not qualify for social housing.  That is the case with public sites - we are building public housing on public lands.  On private land, we are increasing the obligation of developers from 10% to 20%.  We want to ensure there is more affordable housing on those sites.  For the first time, Part V will now include affordable and social housing.</p> <p> The last point is that for many people all these measures will still take up to three years to come to fruition.  I am sure the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, is conscious of that.  I am conscious of it.  It will not happen overnight because building homes cannot happen overnight.  In the meantime, there is a scheme that will allow people to buy new homes now so they can access housing.  The State will effectively give them a five-year, interest-free loan of 20% of the cost of the house.  It means that a couple with a combined income of &euro;70,000 will be able to purchase a home for approximately &euro;350,000.  Do we believe that is affordable?  No, but we are helping.  What is affordable is the schemes I mentioned previously, whereby we will provide homes for between &euro;160,000 and &euro;300,000.</p> <p> All of these are practical measures that are going to help people and couples.  It will mean there will be more affordable housing.  When the review of the national development plan takes place this summer, we will put our money where our mouth is and invest significantly in the provision of homes.  That is what the Government should do.  Helping people who have been locked out of other schemes to buy a home not only helps society but also our economy.  It ensures that we are competitive and that we have a compassionate society and sustainable communities.</p></speech>

The Green Party has long championed and campaigned for affordable sustainable housing solutions, especially now in this housing crisis.  I look forward to engaging with the Minister on the Bill to try to strengthen it for tenants and homeowners.</p><p>The Bill offers a great opportunity and gateway to introduce new housing models to the State, such as community-led housing, a ground-up approach that enables people to pool their assets and resources to create homes and communities which meet their particular needs in a sustainable manner.  There is significant evidence and many examples of the benefits of this model across Europe in terms of long-term affordability and addressing loneliness, social cohesion and environmental sustainability.  I visited such a complex in Berlin where costs of homes are 30% lower.  I hope to submit clear recommendations on the Bill for policy development in line with international best practice, and I hope the Minister will consider this model as part of the Bill.</p><p>Another sustainable housing model which is centred on affordability and is part of the Bill is cost rental, which is Green Party housing policy.  It is one we have pushed, and will continue to push for, as part of the Government's response to the affordability crisis.  We believe cost rental built <i>en masse</i>, with approximately 10,000 units annually for ten years, can make the rental market affordable.  My colleagues and I will continue to work with the Minister and his Department to ensure that cost rental remains permanently affordable and is a State-led housing model.  We must ensure that cost-rental units remain cost rental in perpetuity and that rents do not increase but, in fact, decrease after the cost calculation period ends.  We must cap the equity returns at 3.5% and, importantly, ensure tenants are protected by offering tenancies of indefinite tenure.</p><p>Finally, the Bill offers a good opportunity to level the playing pitch for first-time buyers and to ensure they are not outbid by pension funds.  The Green Party will bring forward an amendment to ensure that 30% of units in apartment developments are reserved for first-time buyers.  I look forward to engaging with the Minister on those amendments.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-06-24a.363" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1513" speakername="Pauline Tully" time="14:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021062400035#LL00300"><p>A number of aspects of this Bill are commendable, but I am a little concerned about some other aspects of it, as I will outline.  For example, the affordable dwelling purchase arrangement in Part 2 of the Bill seeks to facilitate the building of affordable housing on land owned by local authorities.  However, no additional funding was made available in budget 2021 to pay for affordable purchase homes, and only 90 affordable purchase homes are to be delivered in 2021.  That is nowhere near ambitious enough.  Similarly, the funding that has been allocated for cost-rental dwellings, which Part 3 of the Bill attempts to deal with, is inadequate.  Only &euro;35 million has been allocated, which has delivered just over 400 cost-rental homes.  We can compare this with the &euro;75 million that has been allocated for the shared equity loan scheme, which was lobbied for by the property industry.</p>  <p>  There is also a question about whether the rents under this scheme will be genuinely affordable.  The first homes delivered under this scheme on Enniskerry Road in Dublin are to have rents of &euro;1,200 per month for a two-bedroom apartment.  That is well above the affordability level of the majority of people.  The target rents for cost-rental homes in the capital should be between &euro;700 and &euro;900 per month and lower in other areas of the country.  Currently, in my county of Cavan rents are more than &euro;900 per month.</p>  <p>  I am entirely opposed to Part 4 of the Bill which provides for the shared equity loan scheme.  A similar scheme was introduced in Britain and it was severely criticised in a House of Commons report published in 2019.  The report concluded that shared equity loans did not make homes more affordable, that 60% of those who availed of the loan did not need it and that as the loans were unregulated they put borrowers at significant risk.  This was echoed by independent research conducted by the UK housing charity Shelter, which found that the shared equity loan scheme led to increased house prices, adding approximately &pound;8,250 to the average price of a home.  Why is the Minister attempting to introduce a scheme which has proven to be not only ineffective in delivering affordable homes but has actually had the opposite effect?  I fear it has less to do with a desire to deliver affordable rental and purchase homes and more to do with the lobbying that the Minister received from the property industry.  It has been shown that pro-developer schemes such as this have not worked.</p>  <p>  Instead, we should divert the &euro;75 million allocated to this scheme to local authorities and approved housing bodies to deliver affordable rental and purchase homes.  House prices are simply too high, and increasing first-time buyers&rsquo; access to credit is not the solution.  Working people need cheaper homes, not more debt.  That is the type of developer-led housing policy which caused the property crash and recession in 2008.</p></speech>

Last weekend, there was coverage in the <i>Business Post</i>, by Killian Woods, of a new-build home in Malahide, in the Minister's constituency.  It is in a great development with great amenities in a highly sought-after area.  It has been vacant for the last four or five years and was bought by an investor.  The point being made was simply that the return from the house price increases would be attractive enough for an investor to do that, without renting it out.  Vacant homes have to be tackled.  Taxes need effective measures there.</p><p>There is the wider issue that rental returns are so attractive at present that investors are buying homes, blocks of apartments and housing estates.  They are also buying second-hand homes in bundles on the basis of very attractive rental returns and yields.  They know there is a guarantee that if they cannot get them on the open or private market, they will be able to get them through long-term leases to local authorities or others backed by the State.  Those excellent returns are completely skewing housing affordability.  It is one of the issues that must be tackled.  It is part of the wider phenomenon of the commodification and financialisation of housing that is taking place.  During the Celtic tiger years, we saw how buy-to-let investors were encouraged to buy housing and how that wrecked housing affordability at the time.  It was unsustainable and was one of the contributing factors to the crash.</p> <p>We are seeing something similar now regarding investors and this situation must be tackled.  In that context, I am very concerned - and this is not particular to the Minister - that the Government is continuing to back measures which are inflating rents and house prices.</p> <p> Housing policy, housing legislation and this Bill should not be seen in a vacuum.  We must see all of this in the context of what is happening economically internationally.  Particularly because of quantitative easing, we are now seeing a flow of investment money into housing internationally because investors get good returns and good yields from such investments.</p> <p> A countermeasure in this regard is allowed for by the European Central Bank, ECB, in the form of the State borrowing heavily to invest directly in building affordable homes for purchase and rent.  That is what the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, and several other bodies have asked for and are seeking the Government to undertake to counter the harmful effects of quantitative easing in respect of the flow of investment money into housing.  All those aspects must be tackled if we are serious about affordable housing, and such endeavours must go hand-in-hand with the legislative measures in this Bill.</p> <p> We have an affordable housing crisis, and that includes a lack of affordable homes for purchase and for rent.  To address this crisis, we must do exactly what the current Minister said should be done during the last election campaign.  We must build about 10,000 directly built affordable homes every year.  That is what is needed.  The current Minister was absolutely right about that when he said it during the last election campaign.  It is welcome that there will be hundreds of cost-rental homes available this year, but we need that availability to be on the scale of thousands of such homes if we are going to address this issue.  We also need directly built affordable homes for purchase.  Schemes such as those undertaken by the &Oacute; Cualann Cohousing Alliance are very good but they are on a very small scale, and we must be doing this on a scale which produces thousands of homes.  I do not mean large-scale in respect of very large developments.  We require a range of developments in different locations around the country and in different parts of Dublin to deliver those thousands of homes and to build sustainable and high-quality communities.</p> <p> The State has an absolutely key role in bridging the affordability gap.  There are people who cannot afford the high costs, high rents and high purchase prices of the homes being delivered by the private sector and who do not qualify for social housing.  It is that gap in the middle that must be addressed.  We must be crystal clear regarding what we mean when it comes to affordable housing and cost rental.  A percentage discount off the full market price will not cut it.  The delivery of affordable homes for purchase and for cost rental does matter.  I do not believe that private sector delivery alone is the way to go on this issue, because that sector is effectively just looking for that discount off the full market prices.</p> <p> This Bill, in respect of improving it, must really nail its colours to the mast regarding defining housing affordability.  It should be done properly in this Bill and that is an existing weakness and gap in the legislation that I will be seeking to address in my amendments.  Affordability should be based on income and it should be something like a maximum of one third of income going to pay for people's housing costs, including utility costs.  We should also be examining residual income and what people can afford to pay after they have met other essential costs, such as transport, childcare and those types of expenses.</p> <p> Regarding the Part V aspect of this Bill, I welcome the expansion back to what was previously the case in this regard.  As Deputy Smith said, what was there before was rather ineffective because of all of the opt outs.  Potentially, therefore, this legislation will be much better than just restoring the original provision.  One area of the Bill, however, needs particular work.  I am not saying that this change must be made in time to be included in this Bill, because I know that this legislation must pass quickly.  However, significant work will need to be done later on delivering value for money in Part V delivery.  Much can be done to improve on this aspect.  I would like to see that done and I will be raising this point on Committee Stage, and I will continue to raise it.  We could be doing better at that point.</p> <p> Turning to the shared equity aspect of the legislation, I have some specific questions regarding the Minister&rsquo;s statement in that regard.  He said that these will be short-term measures.  What sort of timeframe is he talking about?  The Minister also said that similar schemes have been looked at, not just in the UK but in other jurisdictions.  What other countries and jurisdictions were looked at?</p> <p> I am concerned that the Minister continues to quote the British National Audit Office report.  It is a good report and it should be quoted, but it is the way it has been quoted that I have an issue with.  The report refers to a 1% price premium and not to 1% price inflation, and that is a key difference.  The report clearly states that for the same homes, the same square metres in size and in the same areas that people who availed of the equity scheme paid a price premium of 1%.  It did not state that price inflation was confined to only 1%.  The Minister has repeated that since the very start of these discussions about shared equity, and I urge him to re-examine this aspect.  It is a flawed reading of that report and I ask him to look at it again.  It is a good report and it should be part of what informs this debate, but it is very important that it is quoted correctly.</p> <p> Moving on to price caps, and associated measures, if price caps were to be some measure of an effective guarantee in respect of the shared equity scheme, we would need much more localised price caps to be instituted rather than simply having a cap based on the median for an entire local authority area.  The Minister and other Deputies will be well aware that can be a huge variance in prices within a local authority area.  Using the Minister&rsquo;s constituency as an example, there will be a major difference in the prices that first-time buyers might be looking at when purchasing a home on the open market in the northern part of that constituency compared with areas such as Malahide.  There is great variance across that constituency.  A &euro;400,000 price cap on an affordable home in the parts of Fingal where house prices are more expensive might have some effect.  However, it is not going to have any effect at all in those parts where the average house price on the open market is well below &euro;400,000.  Therefore, if price caps are to be utilised, having them on such a blunt scale will be very ineffective.  I appreciate that there may be complications regarding how far it may be possible to localise such price caps and it may not be possible for the Minister to bring about extremely localised market price caps.  However, if price caps are to have an effect as a measure, they will need to be much more localised.</p> <p> I have serious concerns about the shared equity part of the Bill and I do not believe those concerns have been properly addressed to date.  I am concerned that the shared equity scheme will add fuel to the fire of house prices.  When we look at the people lobbying in favour of this scheme, they started lobbying for it in February 2020, just after the election campaign, when house price inflation was much more stable.  Those lobbyists were looking at this mechanism back then as a means of trying to kick-start house price inflation.  There is no need for that now because it is already happening.  There is too much of it happening now and, therefore, I reiterate in the strongest possible terms that this aspect must be looked at again.  We had very serious warnings from the Central Bank and the ESRI regarding this initiative, as well as from several commentators.  </p> <p> In addition, we have had warnings that we are potentially looking at house prices reaching Celtic tiger levels again.  We are also seeing the sharp increases in the prices of construction materials because of the uptick in construction building internationally due to Brexit and quantitative easing and investors not getting returns on bonds and yields.  Therefore, they are putting investment money into some of the construction materials, effectively speculating on them and pushing up those prices.  Given all that, it makes no sense for the Government to be adding fuel to the fire of house price increases via this scheme.</p>  <p>A former senior official in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform warned that the property industry wants an equity scheme because &quot;it will increase prices&quot;.  Those words were from a neutral Government commentator.  What is happening here is a resuscitation of the failed policies of the Celtic tiger era, when the Government ignored warnings from commentators and from its own Civil Servants and championed tax subsidies for developers which led to a sharp increase in house prices.  Thousands upon thousands of families had to deal with the burden of unsustainable debt and unaffordable house prices and the last thing we want to see is a repeat of that.<br/><br/>Evidence from the UK on its shared equity scheme, where equity loans have been in place since 2013, is that the loans have led to increased house prices and a boom in profits for large developers.  It is no surprise, therefore, that large developers have been lobbying for such a scheme here.  A study by Professor Geoff Meeks of Cambridge University found that in the four years after the shared equity scheme was introduced, average share prices on the FTSE 350, where most large developers are listed,  increased by 47% but the share prices of the leading developers benefiting from the shared equity scheme increased by 230%.  In the years before the shared equity scheme was introduced, the share prices for those developers did not increase above the level of other stocks and shares on the FTSE 350.  An analysis of house prices in ten towns and cities across England found that homes available under the equity loan scheme were, on average, nearly 15% more expensive per square metre than comparable homes not eligible under the scheme.  A 2019 report by the National Audit Office, the same report quoted by the Minister earlier, found that the scheme was used largely to purchase larger and more expensive new-build homes compared to homes bought by other first-time buyers without the scheme.  In the east midlands, for example, the average purchase price for a first-time buyer of a new-build property in 2018 was less than &pound;158,000 but buyers availing of the shared equity loan bought homes that cost, on average, more than &pound;235,000.  In north-east England, where the take-up of the equity loan scheme was the highest in the UK, the gap was even wider.  The average price paid by first-time buyers for new-build homes was less than &pound;110,000 but those availing of the shared equity loans purchased homes costing more than &pound;182,000.  <br/><br/>The Bill lacks a proper definition of affordability.  There is a very strong case to be made for defining affordability in terms of people's income and ability to pay.  I have a strong fear that if this is not done, many of the very welcome affordable housing measures in the Bill to help people who are short of full market prices will miss an entire cohort of people who do not qualify for social housing and are way off being able to afford homes at full market prices.  They will continue to be consigned to paying high and unaffordable rents for years to come.  Home ownership levels of 70% were referenced recently by the T&aacute;naiste.  It is welcome that the leader of Fine Gael wants to see home ownership levels back to the level they were at when his party took office in 2011.  I am interested to hear the views of the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage on home ownership.  Would he like to see a restoration?  Not long ago, around the time that the Minister started in electoral politics, home ownerships levels in Ireland were at about 82%.  Would the Minister like to see restoration to that kind of level and how soon can we get there?  I hope some of that detail and some of the targets in that regard will be contained in the Housing for All strategy.  It is important that we have targets and are able to measure progress.  It is all very fine for Deputies to refer to restoring the home ownership levels to those that pertained when they took office in 2011 but we need to have a roadmap and strategy for getting there.  <br/><br/>On cost rental and affordable purchase, the model of delivery is of crucial importance.  Private sector delivery, as envisaged by the Government, will push up prices and costs, making homes less affordable.  Let us take the example of the Part V proposal submitted by Bartra for O'Devaney Gardens, comprising 104 units, of which 31 have one bedroom, 56 have two bedrooms and 17 have three bedrooms.  This works out at an average, inclusive of VAT, of &euro;354,000 per home or &euro;315,000 excluding VAT.  If the State was financing the building of those Part V homes - this goes back to my earlier point about Part V and value for money - we could potentially save around &euro;4 million on the Part V element of the scheme or &euro;38,000 per home.  That would bring the cost down to an average of &euro;277,000 per home excluding VAT.  That is significant in terms of cost rental or affordable purchase.  The reason for this is that the State has access to borrowing at much more favourable interest rates and lower financing costs than the private sector.  There are other savings that could be made without compromising on quality.  Ms Orla Hegarty has provided good detail on how with economies of scale in terms of fixtures and fittings, we could achieve savings.  The County and City Management Association, CCMA, is also looking at this issue and at where savings can be made.  It is looking at the possibility of having elements of universal design for the internal build-out of social homes but having external variants and unique external designs, which is very important.  I would not like to see us return to decades past where we had only one or two external designs that were built <i>en masse</i>.  We could see significant savings on internal elements and that should not just be done for social homes but also for cost rental and affordable purchase homes.  Of course, this can be done if we do not rely solely on private sector delivery.<br/><br/>I will be concluding shortly and am glad that I have not had the same effect in this Chamber as Deputy Duncan Smith had, although his contribution was very good.  Apologies, I could not resist that.  On a very important point-----</p></speech>

I  was very struck during the election campaign by the number of people I met in my constituency in Donaghmede who told me about the affordable purchase homes they bought when they were younger as part of the newly-wed scheme, under which a lottery was run in the Mansion House.  They told me about how their grown up children are now living in the boxroom upstairs with their grandchildren.  All of us want to see that ending.  I will certainly be supporting the measures in this Bill that are effective and I will be proposing amendments to the measures that need to be improved and strengthened. </p></speech>

Young people in particular feel locked out of the housing market.  They feel the dream of one day owning their own homes is a far-off idea at best and at worst, just a pipe dream.  I want to live in a city and a country where home ownership is possible, if not the norm, for people my age.  That is why I am so glad we are introducing the first ever Bill that will focus solely on affordable housing.  It works in tandem with the Land Development Agency Bill to put affordability at the heart of our housing system.  It will do this in four different ways: first, through the direct, local authority-led building of affordable homes for the first time in more than a decade - that means councils delivering affordable housing; second, through the first ever national cost rental scheme that will deliver long-term, over secure and affordable leases for those who wish to rent longer term; third, through a national shared equity scheme for new-build homes that will see the State taking an average equity of approximately 20% in the cost of a home, with a mortgage to be taken out on the remainder if people opt for that initiative and want that assistance; and, fourth, it means an expansion of the Part V clause to provide 10% affordable purchase and, crucially,10% social housing, as well as affordable housing in all new developments.</p> <p>The two biggest issues facing the housing market are affordability and supply.  A combination of short-term measures will help turn approved planning applications into homes.  Measures such as the shared equity scheme and the cost-rental model, combined with long-term changes like expanding Part V and the direct building of affordable homes by councils, will help us ensure supply and affordability are delivered for people as part of a comprehensive and well thought-out housing policy.  All of this work is underpinned by the largest ever housing budget and the most ambitious targets on record.</p> <p> We have heard criticism of parts of the Bill, particularly the shared equity scheme.  Sinn F&eacute;in does not want it to be available in the Republic of Ireland, despite overseeing it in Northern Ireland.  We have heard comparisons with the UK scheme and Opposition politicians are right that it was not perfect.  That is why we have learned from it and why we are targeting our measures at people who need support and at the places that need homes built in them.  We have learned from their experience and we are building on that.  That is how policy should work.  It should be developed by building on policies from other countries, by improving on them and by bringing in our own initiatives such as the Rebuilding Ireland home loan.</p> <p> We have also heard talk of investor funds and of their being no place for them in Ireland.  That is simply fairy-tale economics because without foreign investment, we cannot build the homes we need or fund apartment blocks.  We need to produce in excess of 35,000 homes over the next ten years at a cost of &euro;10 billion per year.  How do we fund that without external help?  The fact is that our ambitious targets require the direct focus and support of measures such as this Bill.  They sure could do with the support of all Members of this House because if we worked together towards a shared goal of creating housing for everyone, then things would happen a lot faster.  Our aim must be to solve the housing crisis and get people into homes.  Our collective efforts must do that.  This Bill will deliver homes, help make housing affordable and help young people realise their dreams of owning a home.</p></speech>

The scheme is long overdue.  It is unfortunate that the previous Government did not provide one but thankfully the programme for Government compelled the Minister to bring forward a Bill such as this and thankfully he is doing so.</p><p>The legislation will apply to future planning but it will not be or cannot be retrospective and, therefore, it cannot apply to all of those thousands of units held up in a planning process that I am afraid is not fit for purpose in the context of a housing emergency.  It is this issue that I would like to address during the short time I have been allocated.  I want to lay out an issue which is the greatest enemy to the supply of public and private housing, including social and affordable housing, namely, the planning process.</p><p>An opinion poll in <i>The Irish Times</i>last week highlighted the readiness and preparedness of the public to address the issue of objections to developments.  Some might not be fazed by opinion polls but I am one of those who is.  The opinion poll coincides with my views and opinions, which I have often relayed to my colleagues.  I got written confirmation from the Minister that he is planning to bring forward a planning reform Bill in the autumn and I welcome that.  I would hope that this Bill would then - and I wish it would do so earlier - overhaul the planning system, not just with the Bill I introduced last month setting out a time period for An Bord Plean&aacute;la decisions but I would seek to suspend the process of judicial reviews at a time of housing crisis and emergency.  We had the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, legislation at a time of financial crisis and that addressed and laid the foundations for the recovery of our public finances.  Housing emergency measures in the public interest, HEMPI, legislation is necessary at this time.</p><p>Protracted and ridiculously long delays should not be tolerated.  There were many and much financial packages and funds provided from outside the State that were initially made available on planning applications being granted.  These have been withdrawn since because of the three, four and five-year delays that those providing the funding simply cannot comprehend.  My proposal will not be popular with some but I am not here to try to please everybody.  That sort of attitude is one that has us where we are.</p><p>I am satisfied, as a councillor for 18 years and as a Deputy for ten years, that sufficient improvements and protections in the planning procedures and means of appraisals over the years have restored and earned the credibility of the democratic planning process.  We have seen, for example, the provision of a planning regulator in recent years.  We see county development plans and the wide ranging consultative and reporting process that they involve are also subservient to national spatial strategies and regional development and planning guidelines.  This all combines to convince me that the competitiveness, competence and professionalism of independent oversight and delivery of planning by our local authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la are sound.  However, it is there that it needs to stop.</p><p>Fianna F&aacute;il took on the housing portfolio in order to get housing done.  At this time of emergency, when I look at judicial reviews and the issues around them, many of those issues, whether commercial or residential, are issues of the contention of those appellants in relation to Government policy and ideology and bear little impact, considering the impact they have on the crisis and those affected by it.  I note that in residential, energy and afforestation cases, the same names appear in these files.  It is crippling our economy and our ability to respond and provide homes in this country to those who need them most.  The effectiveness of such drastic but necessary actions can be measured at the end of this Government's term and I would beg the Government to consider and exercise its authority and majority and move in this direction in these matters.</p><p>I again welcome the Minister's commitment to provide a reform Bill in the autumn.  I ask that he give serious consideration to issues such as this that need to be addressed.</p></speech>

Naming a Bill that will drive up house prices and offer rental at &euro;1,100 a month in Cork as an Affordable Housing Bill is a farce.  Affordability cannot be based on the market price; it has to be based on income.</p>  <p>  House prices in Cork rose last year by 11%.  For most of my constituents, the average family home in Cork is so far out of their reach that they cannot even imagine owning their own home.  Telling them that affordable housing will be less than &euro;400,000 in Cork gives the majority of people no hope.  Does the Minister realise how much &euro;400,000 means to ordinary people?  That is not affordable.  Whether it is a cap, target or aim, when we discuss affordability and affordable housing we should not be hearing figures such as &euro;400,000.  It is that simple.  That scares people because they know the 4% increase that was brought in by the last Government as a cap on rents became the target and is now just the norm.  People know that developers and speculators will see the &euro;400,000 as a figure to aim for.  Where has that figure come from?  It should not be a target and it should not be there at all.</p>  <p>  As I said earlier, the average house price in Cork rose by 11% last year and it is now &euro;310,000.  We know that an 11% increase was ridiculously high when house prices were already too high but the Government is setting a target that could possibly lead to a 29% increase in house prices in Cork.  The Government's plan runs the risk of making homes that are not affordable so ridiculously out of reach that home ownership will become a thing of the past for the vast majority of ordinary people.  Instead, young people and families are forced to choose between living with their parents or paying huge high rents to vulture funds.  These cannot be the choices that we are giving young families and people.</p>  <p>  There is so much more I want to say but I just want to remind the Minister and the other Government Ministers and Deputies that it was Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael housing policies over the last 20 years that have put us where we are now.  I do not believe this Affordable Housing Bill will deliver everything the Minister says it will.</p> <p>I wish it could, I sincerely do, but I do not think the Minister understands the reality of the situation.</p></speech>

We will undoubtedly introduce amendments on the next Stage and will try to be constructive.  We supported the Residential Tenancies Bill even though it was incredibly limited and did not go half far enough.  We did not block that legislation.  We sought to amend it but the Minister chose not to take on board any of our amendments.  We will see what the Minister does with any amendments or suggestions we make on this Bill.</p>  <p>  There was a bit of politicking from the Minister at the outset to which I will respond in kind.  He referred to pragmatism.  The Government and the Minister, in particular, though I have also heard it from other Ministers, wheel out a narrative to the effect that they are the pragmatists whereas we are the idealists who talk about pie-in-the-sky, fantasy economics and so on.  As somebody who studied philosophy, I want to inform the Minister that pragmatism is a philosophy, an ideology, and perhaps the Minister should read about it before he bandies around the term.  It is a philosophical movement that started in the United State, perhaps unsurprisingly, in the 1870s, with people such as Charles Peirce, William James and John Dewey.  It has been updated by relativistic philosophers such as Richard Rorty and the post-modernist, post-structuralist gobbledegook that circulates in some academic circles.  Let us be clear that so-called pragmatism is an ideology every bit as much as the ideology the Minister accuses us of adopting.  To spell out where we are coming from, and this is directly relevant, I am a materialist, as against a pragmatist.  In other words, I start with material reality whereas pragmatism is about essentially saying we have to balance between existing and moving realities.  Nowhere is this better epitomised than by the fact that in this Affordable Housing Bill, there are 55 different references to things that will not be done in the Bill but will be done afterwards by ministerial regulation.  That is pragmatism in the extreme because some of the key questions we need to answer to deliver affordable housing are not answered in the Bill.  They will be answered later by the Minister, depending on circumstances.  That is the actuality of pragmatism and to be honest, it is quite undemocratic.  I do not know if it is questionable from a legal and constitutional point of view to have that much stuff in the Bill that will be done later by the Minister.  That stuff includes, critically, what the affordable dwelling contribution will be, the prices that will be paid, how affordable limits will be set in particular places and so on.  We do not really know whether the affordable housing will actually be affordable because that is all going to be done later and is not done in the Bill.</p>  <p>  A materialist approaches things from the simple starting point of asking, without anybody having to make profit, how much would it cost for us to build a house?  If there are no markets, marketing, speculation and all of that stuff, how much would it cost to build a house?  It would cost &euro;160,000 to &euro;200,000, depending on the size of the house.  Market conditions are referenced throughout the Land Development Agency Bill and this Bill in terms of how rents and affordability are going to be set.  If we did not have market conditions, we could build houses pretty cheaply ourselves.  For how much is the market able to deliver houses?  It apparently differs in different parts of the country which is strange, in and of itself.  In one of the biggest residential developments in the country, which is happening in my constituency, it will cost &euro;400,000 for Hines to build an apartment.  There is a big gap between what it would cost us to build places and what the private sector can deliver.  What is the average price for a house in D&uacute;n Laoghaire?  It is in excess of &euro;500,000.  The Affordable Housing Bill and the Land Development Agency Bill state that the price of affordable housing or affordable rents will be set by reference to the market and will represent a discount on that market price.  The Minister has said that discount on the market rent will be 25% to 30%.  The Minister has said that the discount on house prices will be based on the median house price in any particular area.  That is a big problem for us and is not going to work.  When I say "us", I mean people in south Dublin.  In fact, it applies to pretty much all of Dublin, much of Galway and Cork, and quite a bit of Waterford.  That is a serious problem.</p>  <p>  There is cap of &euro;450,000 for a property in my area.  One would need an income of approximately &euro;120,000 a year to pay for a property at that cap.  Given that house prices in my area are averaging &euro;500,000, that is a serious problem.  I do not see how this legislation is going to help ordinary working people.  I have been at pains to explain to the Minister that if one is on minimum wage and happens to live in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, one does not get a higher minimum wage.  A public servant who happens to live in south Dublin does not get a higher wage from the Civil Service.  A teacher, a member of the Garda or a nurse does not get paid more because he or she happens to live in D&uacute;n Laoghaire but house prices and rents in the area are multiples of what they are in other parts of the country.  If the measures in this Bill will be taken by reference to median market prices or rents, we have a serious problem and I do not see how the Minister is going to be able to deliver in my area.  I do not see how he can deliver that level of affordability but we know that if we built the houses ourselves, we could build them at &euro;160,000 to &euro;180,000 or &euro;200,000.  That is real, practical materialism.  One could even call it pragmatic.  Why would we build houses via the market, which is clearly unable to deliver affordability in my area, when we could do it ourselves and deliver affordability?  That is the simple question I ask and to which I never really get an answer.  It is a sort of pragmatism extremism to insist that we bring the market forces in, even though the evidence would suggest they are incapable of delivering affordability.</p>  <p>  The points have been made about the shared equity scheme.  In that context, we are going to be paying private developers these extortionate prices under Part V.  Can the Minister find me some private developers who are going to be building at affordable prices in my area?  I just told him about the biggest residential development in the entire country.  I met the developers, who told me it costs &euro;400,000 to build one of those apartments.  With that in mind, for how much are they going to sell them?</p> <p>We have been asking D&uacute;n Laoghaire&ndash;Rathdown County Council for approximately four years how much affordable housing we are going to get for the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, in Cherrywood.  We still cannot get an answer.  The council cannot figure it out.  It cannot work out the conundrum of how we actually get a serious amount of affordable housing for the &euro;15 million.</p> <p> When the LIHAF was originally announced, 30% of any development was going to be affordable and would be less than &euro;350,000.  That disappeared within a few weeks because it became obvious that the developers were not going to wear that in areas like Cherrywood.  We still have no idea four years on, and ten years since much of that came into the hands of the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, and was then handed over to Hines and others, how much affordable housing we are going to get or what the price will be.  I am none the wiser today from the Government's Bill, which I have read through, as to how much the affordable housing in Cherrywood will actually be.</p> <p> Deputy Cowen also made a very good point, which I was going to make but I will repeat.  None of the additional 10% is going to apply to all the planning permissions that have been given under the strategic housing development, SHD, anyway, and, of course, we know a slew of SHD planning permissions have been rammed through over the last few years and will continue to flow in until the SHD regime is wound up.  I welcome the additional 10% in Part V in terms of affordable housing.  However, none of that 10% affordable housing will apply to any of that vast swathe - in other words, the huge amount of stuff that will actually be built over the next number of years, if they build it and are not just speculating on the land, which many of them are.</p> <p> We would, therefore, need far more radical measures, which I believe we should be taking, and to insist that we get additional affordable housing immediately in areas like Cherrywood and other such areas.  We should take much more radical actions to achieve that.</p> <p> I also want to question the cost rental aspect of this.  First of all, the cost-rental rents are again being checked against market rents.  I do not understand why that would be the case.  Again, a person's eligibility for cost rental will based on income.  If a person's income is too high for social housing, then the next category up will be cost rental.  A person's eligibility, therefore, for social or cost-rental housing will continue to be income-based but the rent he or she pays in cost rental will differ in different places.  That is wrong.  It is not fair.  Why should it be different?  Why should someone pay higher cost rental in Shankill than in Salthill?  Give me a good reason.  There is no good reason </p></speech>

That is not fair.  I mention the fact that the Minister or previous Governments have not raised the income thresholds.  I laughed at the Minister's response to a Topical Issue matter tabled by Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire the other day, in which the Minister announced the income threshold review for social housing.  Does the Minister know how long that review has been going on?  It has been going on for approximately four years.  I recall that every year - every few months - I would ask the then Minister with responsibility for housing, Eoghan Murphy, about it.  I would ask when the income threshold review was coming and he would tell me that it was coming soon and that it was under way.  It never came.  Why is that?  It is because there is a policy in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to constantly reduce the number of people who are eligible for social housing, and in effect, to replace much of previous social housing provision on eligibility with cost rental because the rents will be higher in cost rental than they will be in social housing.</p>  <p>  In that regard, another ideological phrase from the pragmatists appears yet again in this Bill.  I asked the Minister to take the phrase "undue segregation" out of the Land Development Agency Bill 2021 and it appears here.  As far as I know, that has not been replaced on Report Stage of the Land Development Agency Bill.  The Minister can correct me if I am wrong.  He said he would look at it.</p></speech>

The phrase &quot;undue segregation&quot; appears here again, as if there is a due or acceptable level of segregation.  There is not.  Why does it appear?  I will tell the Minister why it appears.  It is because the<i>de facto</i>pragmatic solution is actually about new forms of segregation, and new forms of classification of cohorts of people, who will be suitable for different types of housing based on another phrase I really dislike and find insulting, frankly, which is &quot;social background&quot;.</p><p>Undue segregation of people of different social backgrounds, therefore, is a prejudiced, preconceived and predetermined notion of certain people living in certain types of housing with certain types of tenures.  It would appear they will actually be segregated unless we really get rid of segregation.  I know there was segregation in the previous incarnation of the Part V, when it was social and affordable housing.  There is segregation in many of the Part V developments where the Part V 10% social housing is literally a separate block, away from the privately-owned housing.  It is very segregated and it is a form of social and housing apartheid.  Indeed, there are different finishings and so on in different houses.</p><p>The other aspect of cost rental I worry about is the fact that it is another investment opportunity.  Investors who ask for the building they own or have built to be designated as cost rental will essentially get the cost of the house paid for by the tenant over a period of 25 years, and can then opt out of the cost-rental scheme and sell it on.  We are, therefore, creating investment opportunities but at the end of the period, the investors can pull out of the arrangement.</p><p>I have another question about cost rental.  What happens when a person's income exceeds the cost-rental eligibility limits while he or she is living in the house?  In England, they brought in this so-called flexible social housing scheme where a person's eligibility for the social housing in which he or she is living is reviewed every five years.  This, therefore, creates the conditions where a person can actually be thrown out of social housing if his or her income exceeds a certain level.  Is that going to happen with cost-rental housing?  I will be glad to get the reassurance.  Certainly, that is what we were being told about cost rental in the earlier incarnations of this a few years ago.</p><p>In any event, I do not see why we are creating an investment opportunity in cost rental whereby private investors essentially get their investment paid through rents that will be paid by the tenant, and can then pull out of the arrangement after 25 years, with an investment paid for by somebody else, and sell it on into the market or do whatever they want with it.</p><p>That is why I believe things will be far simpler, whether we call it cost rental, public or social housing, if it is based on income.  We get rid of segregation, and these notions of different backgrounds, if a person pays his or her rent according to his or her ability to pay and anybody at all can apply for social housing.  It is not, therefore, this notion that only people on the very lowest incomes are social housing-type people.  Anybody should be able to avail of social housing and pay a different rent according to their ability to pay.</p><p>Equally, it should be the same with affordable housing.  Affordability should be based on a person's income, not by any reference to the market, particularly when the areas where the housing and affordability crisis are worst are precisely the places where the market is out of control and incapable of delivering affordable housing to ordinary working people.</p> <p> We will not oppose this Bill but we will seek to amend it.  We are concerned that many aspects of the Government's housing proposals, particularly the LDA aspect, will potentially make the situation worse and cost the State a lot of money.  We are opposing the Bill dealing with the LDA but we will not oppose this Bill.  However, we want it to reflect a proper notion of affordability that is based on income, not the market.</p></speech>

The 50% provision for family purchase in new developments is very welcome, as is the 10% quota for affordable housing.  Contrary to others, I welcome the shard equity scheme because it will bring into the market the people who have been locked out because they are just over the income margins and cannot get on the housing ladder.  We have to do something special for them.  The site subsidy is to be increased to &euro;50,000.  I would like to hear the commencement date for all these measures.</p>  <p>  I really welcome the commitment by the Minister to seek a 50% increase in resources for the LDA.  It is crucial that the agency should have the resources to assemble sites but, in addition, I would like an announcement before the autumn of its plans to deliver capacity for at least 50,000 homes.  We need to rattle the cages of the people sitting on substantial sites and planning permissions and this is the way to do it.  We also need to see significant land banks developed in the alternative magnets for development outside Dublin, including Cork, Waterford, Galway and Limerick.  It is really important that we see those sites and land banks developed.</p>  <p>  It is also very important that we remove the logjams in approval, appraisal and tendering that have dogged city councils.  The LDA must get through those processes more quickly.  That means streamlined tendering and approval mechanisms, not long delays between the Minister's Department and other Departments.  It also means ensuring there is a stream of projects in order to facilitate cost-effective building.  The reality is that it is too expensive for people to submit to tender and that is ultimately driving up costs.</p>  <p>  I say very sincerely to Deputy Boyd Barrett that if he and many others on the left insist that no public land can be used for anything but housing for people on the public lists, we will kill the potential of the LDA.  We need a rebalancing in our country of housing development.  That means meeting the needs of all types of families, including those in Cork, Galway and all the current pressure zones.  If the parties opposite continue to block developments such as that on Oscar Traynor Road, they will kill the potential to fix this problem.  Deputy Boyd Barrett may say it is good politics or good ideology to block them but I say it is very bad for the communities that seek to be served.</p>  <p>  Finally, we need further innovation in the field of housing provision.  We cannot expect first-time buyers to pay for the standard of compact development on brownfield sites that we want for sustainability purposes.  There must be a cut in development charges for those people and support from the State for some of the infrastructure.  First-time buyers cannot be expected to foot the bill for sustainability for the next 100 years.</p></speech>

It is an important part of the Government's plan to increase our housing stock by providing affordable housing.  Getting on the first step is the hardest part of getting on the property ladder.  Any action we can take as legislators will be welcomed by those wishing to have a home they can call their own.  This Bill is only one of many more steps that are needed as part of a multifaceted approach to increasing our housing stock and regenerating sustainable communities.  The Clare county manager recently cited the lack of sewage facilities and capacity in certain areas throughout the county, which is having a negative impact on those communities.  Those types of deficiencies must be addressed if we are to reintegrate rural communities.  We need to bring forward a scheme to resolve that particular issue.  I acknowledge the Minister is working on such a scheme and I hope he will bring his proposals to conclusion soon.  He needs to address that issue in tandem with progressive measures such as this Bill.</p>  <p>  There are more than 3,000 people on the housing list in my constituency of Clare, all of whom are seeking a home they can call their own.  The housing lists include people in a range of different circumstances, including those who will seek affordable housing under this Bill.  We, as legislators, need to see greater detail on which type of housing people on the lists are seeking and their present housing circumstances.  We need more affordable housing options for families across Ireland.  We need to build a better social mix and integration into our housing developments.  We cannot leave middle Ireland behind and that is why I strongly support this Bill and the policy proposals contained within it.  The Minister must keep his options open regarding the delivery of quality units and the scale of those developments.  One size does not fit all.  I look forward to seeing the rest of the proposals he brings forward as part of a new housing policy solution that will provide affordable housing for all in our communities.  I reiterate my support for the Bill and commend the Minister and his officials on bringing it before the House.</p></speech>

In this case, we are taking about the provision of housing that is affordable for ordinary workers and families.  That is the requirement against which this Bill will be measured in the coming months as it goes through all Stages.  It is the standard against which it will be measured over the years, if it takes effect.</p>  <p>  I would welcome a move by the State to deliver affordable housing for purchase and rent by people for whom housing is beyond their reach at this time.  We have had affordable housing schemes before, some of which went to the wall during the crash.  I recall one in Cherry Orchard, in my area, in which the houses were deemed affordable until the crash happened.  Overnight, the council had to step in and buy all the houses, which were built on council lands using the serviced sites fund.  The council said when it built the houses that they were super affordable but we argued that they should be available for cost-price purchase.  The council said "No" and insisted the price would be &euro;200,000.  We argued that they cost &euro;120,000 to build but the council refused to sell them at that price.  Once the collapse in house prices happened, the council had to step in because it could not get anybody to buy the houses at the price it was asking.</p>  <p>  Even with the provisions in this Bill, a large cohort of people in our society will remain locked out of housing because they earn too much to be on the social housing list or too little to qualify for affordable rental or affordable purchase.  That will be the case even under the schemes set out by the Minister.  One step the Government could take that would help many people is to increase the income threshold for social housing.  If the Minister is genuine about dealing with this issue, he should make that announcement at the same time as he is advancing this Bill.  It might increases the housing lists but it would enable local authorities, with State support, to build social housing and to then carry on, as this Bill intends, to deliver properly affordable houses for rent or purchase.</p>  <p>  N&iacute;l tith&iacute;ocht inacmhainne do na c&eacute;adta m&iacute;le sa St&aacute;t faoi l&aacute;thair.

It is important at the outset to say we all have our own ideas about what affordability is.  For people who are listening it is about the fact that we can build houses.  It is about giving affordability to people who are brave enough to want to buy their own houses and to take out a mortgage.  It also gives affordability to people who cannot do that and need help from the State.</p>  <p>  I listened with interest to what Deputy Boyd Barrett was saying and the retort from Deputy Bruton.  They talked about Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway.  I assure the Minister there is a housing crisis in every town and village in this country.  That is why we must take action.  I do not believe this Bill alone will be the panacea that solves all our problems.  When one looks at the construction industry and how we had a boom-bust, we still have that type of scenario going on.  At the moment we are in a position where we do not have a proper supply of houses.  We do not have people building houses in sufficient quantities to make them affordable.  That is why the Minister has had to bring in this legislation and why we must have State intervention and assist people.  The construction of houses is fraught with different nuances that affect the delivery of housing.</p>  <p>  I will talk first about planning in this country and how we have allowed our planning situation to become totally based on judicial reviews and going to the courts to prevent developments.  That in a way is creating a shortage.  It is also taking the appetite away from people who would be brave enough to apply for planning permission to build housing developments because they feel objections are such an easily accessible way of preventing such developments.  It must be looked at.  In my own county, the county development plan is being reviewed and new plans are being worked on.  One of the issues I find with doing those plans is that when we talk about zoning, we are very constrained in what we zone.  We zone areas on a desktop basis, and lands within towns, villages and cities may or may not become available for construction as a result.  We do not zone enough land as residential low density, R1, land.  That creates a tiered approach to planning and drives up the price of development land because not enough of it is being zoned to give people a choice of where to build.  We are in a way strangling our towns and villages by being too conservative in the amount of land we make available as zoned for residential.</p>  <p>  The other area we must look at, and I have repeated this a number of times, is that it is okay to talk about affordability and all of that but if we do not put in the infrastructure and we do not provide to Irish Water the resources to put in the required waste water systems in our towns and villages, we will not be able to build houses.  I know I am repeating myself in view of other times I have spoken about housing in the House but in County Galway at least, we have frozen out planning because we do not have the proper waste water facilities in place.  We will not allow private waste water treatment plants and at the same time there is a big question mark over one-off rural housing.  We are asking people to live in their own communities but they cannot build there because the infrastructure is not there as Irish Water does not see it as a priority.  It says it is not a priority because it does not have the funding, so we must address that.  When the Land Development Agency is talked about, I am concerned about it on the basis we will end up with the same type of scenario we have with Irish Water.  I am worried that the LDA will not have enough resources to tackle all the problems and that it will focus its efforts on cities like Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway and neglect the other regional areas which also have housing crises and rent pressure zones.</p>  <p>  Within my own constituency I deal with people who are trying to build houses or get onto a council housing list.  Then I see we cannot build houses in places like Athenry right now, all because Irish Water does not have the necessary infrastructure in place.  Half a job has been done and the plant has been upgraded but it still cannot be used, or no benefit can be had from it as the network is not in place to allow development.  We have the same thing in Craughwell, Corofin and Abbeyknockmoy.  I keep going on about this.  The county council is trying its best to move this on but its planners are hamstrung and cannot actually give permission.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la will not give permission because the infrastructure is not there.  This must be tackled and the way to tackle it is to provide the funding.  People have said to me that we have a town and village renewal scheme which is there for that.  The Minister knows well there is no budget to put in waste water treatment facilities under that scheme or under the urban or rural regeneration schemes.  We must ensure we do this in such a way that we are honest with the people.</p>  <p>  I think it was Deputy Boyd Barrett who was talking earlier about us categorising people.  There is no one category of people here.  Many young professionals and people who are working in construction cannot get a mortgage because the mortgage they will get will not be big enough to allow them to purchase a house.</p>  <p>  Another area of concern is the strategic housing developments, SHDs, which have been granted planning permission.  How many of these projects have actually started construction on site?  This is something which must be addressed so that when we achieve planning permission, we see it going to construction within a reasonable time period after that.  It is important we are not just granting these permissions and then they are left for speculation further along.  This is a very important aspect to the whole issue of housing.  We must look at it from the point of view of what can we do now, right now, while we are doing all this legislation.  I am repeating myself when I tell the Minister it is a crying shame how many vacant properties we have in this country that we have done nothing with.  We must ensure that in the interim, while we are waiting to get the Land Development Agency and all these things going, we utilise what we have.  We have so many vacant properties in our towns, villages and cities and we have people who would be willing to go in and make living accommodation for themselves and make homes within these places and build up their communities.  However, they must be incentivised to do it and right now we are disincentivising them by refusing them access to the help-to-buy scheme because these are second-hand properties, which is ludicrous.</p> <p>The other issue mitigating against them is that under the Rebuilding Ireland home loan scheme we can only give them the mortgage for the capital rather than renovation costs that might be applied to these buildings.</p> <p> We could also do something simple with the warmer homes scheme.  A 100% grant for first-time buyers of second-hand houses should be provided to allow them to upgrade them and make them energy-efficient.  This would take people off the housing lists and invigorate our towns and villages</p> <p> These are simple actions but they can be done now and we do not have to wait.  People might look at costs and say we cannot afford it because so many millions of euro are being put into different schemes.  Right now, however, the amount being paid by the Minister's Department through the HAP scheme is incredibly high.  It is up to &euro;400 million per year with nothing to show after it.  That is being paid for people's rent when we should have them in their own houses or council housing stock.</p> <p> Another matter that must be addressed is procurement and all the hurdles put in place when a public contract is to be used.  I am talking about the number of gateways a county council must go through in order to get approval for a project.  In some cases, Departments may have up to 12 gateways, thus hampering our local authorities in providing development.  This is prolonging the agony for people who do not have houses.</p> <p> We must tackle procurement and give autonomy to local authorities.  We must devolve the schemes to them and let them get on with it, instead of them having to report five or six times to get approvals, creating a logjam in Departments.  No matter what we do, we must streamline this process.</p></speech>

This Bill will make provision of more affordable housing to ordinary people who would not otherwise be able to avail of it.  That is why the Bill must pass and I support it.</p>  <p>  I will also comment on matters that may help increase the volume of affordable housing that can be made available.  We can look at what is happening in local authorities.  Louth County Council, for example, has used CPOs to obtain 100 abandoned houses to refurbish and relet for an average of &euro;182,000 per house.  If other county councils around the country were to use their determination, grit and drive, as shown by Louth County Council, to provide homes at a reasonable affordable cost, it would be the way forward.</p>  <p>  We can also look at local authorities using the repair and lease scheme to make houses affordable.  Counties such as Waterford have spent &euro;4 million over the past number of years on the scheme and it is a paragon of virtue, determination and drive again in this work while other county councils have done absolutely nothing and have not spent a single penny.</p>  <p>  There are good things going on and I know the Minister wants to change the way things are happening.  I urge him to place key people from his Department in positions where they can drive local authorities in the way Louth and Waterford councils are being driven.  This will ensure we can spend the money that has been provided by the Minister to get people into homes.  It is the way forward.</p>  <p>   Candidates are walking the streets of Dublin canvassing for the upcoming by-election.  Everywhere I go on every street I see empty homes and it is time for an empty homes tax to be introduced in the upcoming budget.  The money coming in from those empty homes could be diverted to affordable housing.  It is what is being done in Vancouver and it is working there.  It needs to happen here now.  Hundreds of houses have been occupied this way in Vancouver.  They were put on the market because the owners who had left them vacant for years became afraid.</p>  <p>  People have been put into these properties because the owners were forced to do it.  We must ensure the owners of homes lying derelict in Dublin are forced to allow people live in them through an empty homes tax.  We cannot sit back and let this drift on.  The social cost is totally unacceptable.  The Minister has my full support and it is time for the Government to act.  It should not stand back from more radical measures and ensuring that the good work of local authorities is praised.  The authorities that are not doing their job should be forced to do it.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister for the &euro;5 million allocated to Dublin City Council today to tackle void homes.  We look forward to such funding for other local authorities.</p>  <p>  This is the first ever legislation that focuses purely on affordable housing.  It is a significant intervention in the housing market that will put affordability at the heart of the housing system.  The Bill has four key elements that will help increase the supply and availability of affordable housing.  It creates a legal framework to support local authorities directly building affordable homes and this will result in thousands of new affordable homes directly built by councils.  It establishes the first national cost-rental or affordable rental scheme, which will give people who want to rent but earn above the social housing support limit discounted rates and indefinite leases.</p>  <p>  The Bill establishes a new shared equity scheme to help first-time buyers bridge the funding gap and purchase their first home.  It rightly sets a cap on these prices.  It also expands the Part V social housing provision to 20%, and this means all new housing schemes will include 20% social and affordable public housing.  This will set aside thousands of new homes for public housing.</p>  <p>  I am heartened by what appears to be a cross-party consensus for the Bill.  We discussed it many times and there was indication that there would be opposition but I welcome that Deputies from all parties, particularly those from the Opposition, will support the Bill today.  I hope we can continue to work in the vein of consensus to ensure we can deliver the provisions in the Bill. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-06-24a.414" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1626" speakername="Steven Matthews" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021062400043#TT00900"><p>This legislation is particularly welcome by the Green Party, not just because it will address the delivery of affordable housing but because it enshrines in legislation for the first time cost-rental housing.  We have long advocated for this form of housing, based on the Vienna model.  We met Green Party colleagues from Austria recently to learn from their experience and craft that European leading example into our legislation.  It is simple, makes perfect sense and provides a long-term and sustainable housing model at affordable rents with security for those renters.  It will deliver that much-needed State-supported public housing on public lands.  It is not just the Green Party that has pushed for cost-rental schemes.  The National and Economic Social Council stated in its recent report on housing delivery the importance of establishing a national cost-rental programme at scale, which is key.</p>  <p>  I thank the Minister and his departmental officials for working with us to include this important element, which is provided for in Part 3.  I spoke to many people during the general election campaign about housing matters and this Green Party proposal, and I indicated we would legislate for it if in government.  Today, it is what we are doing.</p>  <p>  The passing of this Bill will be a pivotal moment in the delivery of housing in this country and I view it as a moment when we will accelerate a whole-of-government approach to building homes, including social and affordable homes, along with affordable, secure and high-quality rental homes.  It will not happen overnight and there will be challenges.  This will require the full attention of the Government and a commitment to funding.  That commitment is there and this Government will be the one to deliver on housing.</p> <p>I hope we can get cross-party support to do so.  We have massive cross-party support and we have put in a lot of time at the Oireachtas committee on the pre-legislative scrutiny.  There were some 60 amendments submitted to our pre-legislative scrutiny report, and 54 of those amendments were agreed across the parties.  I expect to see that cross-party support here today when we vote on this Bill.  The committee had many witnesses, including the County and City Management Association, the approved housing bodies, and the Land Development Agency, all of which expressed their satisfaction with the Bill.  They are at the coalface of the delivery of public housing.  This is what impresses me about it.</p> <p> I am out of time but I will be supporting the Bill and I thank the Minister of State for his work on it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-06-24a.416" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1588" speakername="Patricia Ryan" time="15:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021062400044#UU00200"><p>This Government's approach to housing favours vulture funds and institutional investors.  Sinn F&eacute;in in government will turn the tables on these funds in favour of ordinary workers and their families.  For too long, successive Governments have treated housing as a commodity, so much so that people who are on relatively good incomes have found themselves squeezed out of the market, leaving home ownership as an impossible dream.  Sinn F&eacute;in in government will change this.  We will deliver affordable purchase homes at scale for &euro;230,000, and for less outside of Dublin.</p><p>The Bill is called the Affordable Housing Bill, but this Government's definition of &quot;affordable&quot; is not on this planet.  In fact, I put it to the Minister of State that sometimes it is not even in the galaxy.  The only solution is to build public and affordable homes on public land.</p><p>There is no doubt that during this debate the Government speakers will engage in deflection, they will ignore the failings of the Bill and they will tell lies about the Opposition.  The Government says that we are voting against housing, when in reality we are voting against the gifting of public lands to private developers to enable them to screw ordinary workers and their families with overpriced homes as we saw recently with the rezoning in Fingal.  It is Fianna F&aacute;il councillors who are standing in the way of affordable housing.  The Government says that the Opposition is voting against housing, but in reality we are voting against unsustainable development where towns like Newbridge are crying out for a new bridge over the River Liffey to relieve traffic gridlock.  We are voting against the rapid expansion of towns such as Kildare without sustainable development.  What is the point of building homes in a field with no services, no sports facilities and in some areas no school places such as for those pupils in Kildare town and Newbridge, with just two months left until school starts again?  We need to provide infrastructure before or during the delivery of homes.</p><p>I have major concerns about the shared equity loan scheme section of the Bill.  A shared equity loan does not make a home more affordable.  It simply increases the level of debt held by working families, at best to lock in what otherwise would be unsustainably high house prices and at worst to inflate those prices even further.  I am not alone in my concerns about shared equity.  Numerous commentators have said it will have an inflammatory effect on house prices.  The Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, Professor Karl Whelan, and the former Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, Mr. Robert Watt, all share this view.  The Green Party's housing spokesperson had the good sense to buy the book by my colleague Deputy Eoin &Oacute; Broin, <i>Home: Why Public Housing is the Answer</i>.<i></i>I suggest that the rest of the Government would do the same.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-06-24a.417" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1461" speakername="Michael Collins" time="15:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021062400044#UU00300"><p>The Government has failed.  Despite all of the rhetoric it brings here, the truth is that it has failed on housing.  The Minister has missed every deadline that he set.  The Minister said he would have an affordable housing Bill in September, then it was by the budget, then it was by the new year.  Week after week we have heard more infuriating stories about home buyers being locked out of ownership.  The Government talks about ownership, but thanks to the Fine Gael policy of throwing the doors wide open to the wrong kinds of investment funds we know now that not only is the Government supporting these funds through an unfair tax policy, but taxpayer money is being used to assist in the funds buying up the homes.  This comes as another slap in the face for anybody who is trying to buy a house, who plays by the rules, who pays sky-high rents or is living with their family while trying to save a deposit.  It truly shows where this Government's priorities lie.  People expect the Government to make radical decisions and interventions to support working people.  Renters, first-time buyers and those in mortgage distress want a break.  They want a Minister who does not miss deadline after deadline for legislation.  They want a Minister who backs up legislation with State support.  Budget 2021 allocated only &euro;35 million for cost rental and &euro;50 million for affordable purchase housing.  People want a Minister who does not break election promises.</p>  <p>  In its election manifesto Fianna F&aacute;il promised 10,000 affordable homes every year for ten years.  Why has it abandoned that promise?  So far this year only 569 social homes have been delivered.  Direct capital investment in public housing needs to be significantly ramped up in order to meet the social and affordable demand.  Fianna F&aacute;il's dream of 10,000 houses per year has been well overshadowed with the T&aacute;naiste's announcement over the weekend of 40,000 homes.  Maybe he was sleep talking, I do not know.  As far as I remember he was in government for many years as Taoiseach of our country, yet he could not deliver a fraction of what he is now talking about.  Maybe it was a bit of dreaming or coverage.  RT&Eacute; gave him plenty of time to talk about it and it gave him loads of time again on Sunday to talk about it.  When we sit in here and talk realistically there is no sign of RT&Eacute; giving us any coverage.  It is an unbelievable situation that a T&aacute;naiste could stand before our country and talk of delivering 40,000 homes.  I could stand before any TV camera in the country and dream up figures.  I could say that we want 60,000, but we are realists on the ground.</p>  <p>  Deputy Bruton said a while ago that we need to meet the needs of families.  I appreciate that the Minister of State was here yesterday, and the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, was here earlier.  I was hoping he would stay but I am not having a go at him, I respect that everyone has schedules.  I wanted to tell him about the crisis we have in my constituency.  I presume it is also a crisis in every other constituency in the State, because if it is not then we have a more serious crisis in west Cork than anywhere else.  As Deputy Bruton said, we need to meet the demands of families.  Young people are applying for planning permission and they are being refused left, right and centre.  There are beautiful green-field sites.  The young people's plans pass the architectural rules, the guidelines on the roadside, and perhaps the council is happy with everything.  Then, however, there is an issue with the scenic landscape or every other cock and bull story is put before them.  It is a complete and utter farce.  I was going to ask the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, who left the Chamber a short while ago, if he would consider holding a meeting between himself, the Oireachtas Members of Cork county and the planners in Cork county.  We need to set a new stand for the people in west Cork.  They need to be assured that if they do pre-planning and tick a lot of the boxes, which are fair, then they would not be caught out on the unfair boxes.  Planning is now a no-go area and the Government has let it get to that.  It puts further pressure on social housing in my constituency.</p>  <p>  We had a very strong and peaceful protest here this week by the fishers of this country.  They are angered at the attack on their livelihoods in rural Ireland.  The smaller farmers are also angered.  Young people are making such gallant efforts, be it in Kinsale or elsewhere.  I have lists of people in Bandon, down into Schull, down into Castletownbere, Drimoleague, Dunmanway, Skibbereen, and Bantry who have identified the right sites, they have done everything by the book, they want to get their lives off to a start, they want to take out a mortgage and they can do that.  They do not want to be a burden on the State, but the State continues to inflict the most serious of refusals on them.  Our Rural Independent Group is very lucky to have a Deputy of the calibre of Deputy Richard O'Donoghue from Limerick who gives us very good and strong advice as he is from the construction sector.  Deputy O'Donoghue certainly knows more about planning than any one of us in the Rural Independent Group.  I will certainly be listening and talking with him.  I do believe that we need to take matters further even if it means that we must converge and block up Dublin city.  This would be the only language the Government seems to know.  In the fishing crisis we had a whole seven or eight months, and yet when the protest was heading to Dublin on Tuesday the Taoiseach decided to act on it over the weekend and meet with the fishing industry.  Is that the only kind of language the Government knows?  Why in the name of God can the Government not work towards solutions and not create a crisis point for people?  That is the issue here.  I will fight tooth and nail for every young person who wants to get planning in my rural community.  I want the planners to be taken to account.  I want it to work at the top level of government until these people get their planning in a fair way.  Once their architecture design is perfect and once the council is okay, then to hell with the other stupid rules that are put there: they are not realistic rules.</p> <p>They are certainly wagging the tail.  I will not stand for it in my constituency.  If it means we have to head to Dublin again we will head there.  We will bloody well - pardon my language - make serious efforts to put the people's rural planning to the forefront in the next election because it certainly is a massive issue in my constituency.</p> <p> We look at county development plans.  What are we doing?  Why are we putting together county development plans?  I can guarantee if I had the chance, and I do not get the chance, to sit down to look at what plans are for Ballinadee or Ballydehob and what is in the county development plan for the rural towns and villages of west Cork, I would see plans for another six houses here,18 houses there and 20 houses there.  The next thing is that we hear about places like Ballinspittle, where we have good genuine people willing to put in sewage plants and extend them close to Cork city where development could take place, and there are great businesses in towns and villages, and they are being refused.  They will do the work when Irish Water cannot do it.  We look at Clonakilty, an area that is rapidly running out of water.  There is no development and no funding whatsoever.  We are okay so long as the rain keeps falling but if we have a dry summer we will have a hungry and dry people in Clonakilty because they will not get water.  These are the simple facts and the crisis we are facing.  The Government has shut its mind to the real issues.  Because it is a rural Ireland issue and an issue in west Cork it is secondary but if there is an issue up here that someone will do without a cup of water in Dublin there will be a crisis and we have to talk about it here for the whole day to resolve the situation.</p> <p> I have always looked at rural development and the development of towns and villages in County Cork, in beautiful places such as Drimoleague, Allihies, Eyeries, Baltimore or anywhere people would want to go, including Schull and Ballydehob.  There are beautiful empty houses in towns and villages.  With regard to living over the shop, no proper grants were made available so people could come to live in these beautiful rural communities, whether in Dunmanway or Ballineen.  They are fabulous communities in which to live.  They have massive facilities that no town or city has and the Government continues to refuse to give them proper funding to build their towns and villages.</p> <p> There are houses and the best of shops, community centres and schools throughout west Cork but no investment.  People want to leave the cities and come to live there.  They want to leave the cities and get planning permission in rural communities.  There is a crisis in the cities because they cannot cope with it.  We can cope with it but we will not be given the opportunity because the Government has its mind set on closing rural Ireland.</p> <p> There are also difficulties with a massive lack of social housing.  I will be doing clinics all over west Cork today, tomorrow and Saturday, and 80% of the people coming before me plead and cry in my office for houses.  They literally cry.  This is a scandal in this day and age when there are possibilities and solutions, and the solution is rural Ireland.  I know the Government does not understand it at all because it does not have a clue where rural Ireland is.  It is beyond the Red Cow, and my God that Red Cow is a huge Red Cow because it has the Government blinded.  I am telling the Minister of State we will keep the Government's eyes open.  Wake up.  The solution to the housing crisis is in rural Ireland and I plead with the Government to work with me towards this solution.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-06-24a.419" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1499" speakername="Richard O'Donoghue" time="15:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021062400045#VV00200"><p>We all know there is a housing crisis and I am disappointed the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, was afraid to stay here with me to hear some truths.  That is no disrespect to the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan.  It is amazing when the truth is heard from a rural Independent and a person who is self-employed.  I have been self-employed all my life.  I understand what a knock-on effect is for housing because I build houses.  I have always built one-off houses.  I am a small-time builder and a local builder.  I tried to use local people and local merchants to support local.  That is what I do.  In the most recent contract I did, 92% of the people were local to the area.  When big contracts are given to multinational companies, 4% or 5% of the people from the local area and the local merchants get the work.  This is the difference between knowing what you are doing and working off Dublin standards.</p>  <p>  We will look at why we have a housing crisis and the knock-on effect for the 37% of the people who live in rural areas.  The Rural Independent Group brought forward amendments to the 2040 plan to allow people to build in rural areas.  The Green Party, Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael voted against an amendment that would allow people to build on their own land, whether they were part of the farm or not.  It is their heritage and it could be their inheritance.  All we asked was that the Government would give people a chance to build their own houses on their own land or on a site they may have purchased or been given, once they met the environmental guidelines and the housing guidelines.  However, the Government voted against it.  Now we have people who want to use their own money and their own land to build their own houses and they are being added to the housing list.</p>  <p>  Then we come to successive Governments.  When I got here it was 32 years but now it is 33 years that Askeaton has been waiting for an upgrade of its sewerage system.  It is pumping raw sewage into the rivers.  Glin is in trouble, as are Drumcollogher and Hospital, with sewerage systems.  A report shows the biggest contributors to pollution in Ireland are the local authorities from the lack of funding from the Government.  I will break it down for Government Members in case they cannot understand.  I do not mean to be disrespectful to anyone but in the country we can call people overeducated fools.  What we call overeducated fools in certain cases are people who are so well educated they get up in the morning and have to look at a chart to put on their trousers and their shoes but they can run the country because they have no experience of what it is to be self-employed.  I am a person who is self-employed and many people involved in fishing who were here yesterday are self-employed.  The farmers on whom the Government puts more controls are self-employed.  The SMEs that give 51% of employment in Ireland are self-employed.  Who does the Government target with all of the taxes?  It is the 37% of the people in rural areas.</p>  <p>  The Government introduced a carbon tax.  What does this entail for people living in rural areas?  It means every man, woman and child who needs to go to school, to work or to do the shopping is charged extra tax because they have no infrastructure.  They have no bus service.  They have no train service.  They have nothing.  We pay more taxes to support the Government.  Where does it put the money?  Let us head to Dublin.  A minute ago, we heard a Deputy thanking the Minister for providing &euro;5 million to Dublin to upgrade some derelict houses.  Every day I come up here I see how tunnel visioned the Government is.  Deputy Michael Collins recognised it when he spoke about going past the Red Cow.  A red cow could be a white head if people understand farming; but it is the Red Cow.  Is this why it was called a Red Cow up here?  Is it because when people go past it they have gone into rural areas so they try to stay this side of it?  Is that why it is?</p>  <p>  A total of 37% of the people in Ireland are going to revolt against the Government for its failure to recognise farming, fisheries, construction and SMEs.  It is overtaxing everyone in the 37% to pay for its vision.  A Minister said he believes that for a population of 3,000 people, 30 cars are adequate and we can carpool.  Tell that to the farmer who wants to get cattle to the mart or somebody in an area who has to cycle to get to a carpooling car to go to work.  That Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, has not yet commented.</p> <p>He has been asked to come to Limerick twice.  I will put him up for a week.  I will give him a house.  I will let him be isolated.  I will give him a good bike.  I will even give him a repair kit in case he gets a puncture on the road.  I will tell him to go off and get his shopping, go to work and try to get to here for one week.  That is real life.</p> <p> Let us look at what else the carbon tax has done.  I heard another Deputy say that if the rest of the country looked after Louth County Council, houses would be built for &euro;182,000.  I will give him a reality check.  In the past three months, the price of steel has gone up by 62%.  Why do I know this?  It is because I buy steel for housing.  The price of insulation has gone up by 44%.  Why do I know this?  It is because I am in construction.  The price of timber has gone through the roof - it has increased by 44%.  Why do I know this?  I know it because I am in construction.  Why did I pick out where the problems are?  We cannot get our stuff through Dublin Port.  We cannot get things through any port with the restrictions that are in place.</p> <p> Where does the problem lie?  It comes back to the Government.  A simple solution to felling licences would be to include them in licences granted for planting forestry and growing trees.  That would have to be monitored.  We are six or seven months into the year and we still do not have felling licences.  The costs are being put onto the people who want to build houses.  The Minister provided statistics about the cost of building houses, which ranges from &euro;160,000 to &euro;310,000.  The cost increase of a 2,600 sq. ft house in the past 12 months is &euro;84,000, a figure which is rising.</p> <p> I have mentioned the 37% of the people who live in rural areas.  We are gathering and coming together fast.  Fishermen protested yesterday and farmers have also protested.  SMEs and people in rural Ireland will come back up and claim what is rightfully ours, and stop the Government squandering our money.  It is putting people into cities.  I have uncles and first cousins living in Dublin, but they came from another county.  They will also revolt against the Government.</p> <p> The Government has sent us the LDA, but the paperwork states it will only produce houses in areas with a population of over 30,000.  That covers Limerick city.  There is more to Limerick than the city because we are a county.  I represent the county.  The Government does nothing for towns, villages and rural areas.  The Government has never given us funding to upgrade our infrastructure so that we can help the environment and address the housing crisis.  All it does is put obstacles in our way to stop people doing things on a daily basis and increase costs.  All of the services in large cities and towns are using our money from rural towns, villages and areas where the Government is not willing to invest.  That is what is wrong with the Government.  The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, needs to wake up.  I will give him a reality check.  I will bring him to County Limerick if he would like to come.  I will put him up and see how he lasts for a week in a rural area.</p></speech>

We have heard a lot of people talking about fishing, insulation and rural and urban Ireland, but I have heard very few people talk about what exactly is in the Bill and why it will transform the housing situation in Ireland.  This is the most comprehensive affordable housing Bill in the history of the State.  In fact, it is the first affordable housing Bill in the history of the State.  That is what this Government is doing.</p>  <p>  The Bill and Government policy will mandate the direct building of local authority affordable housing.  It will mandate and permit a national cost-rental scheme and a national shared equity scheme and expand Part V to 20% to include affordable housing.  That is what is going to happen.  The vast majority of that cannot happen without this Bill.  As has been said by Deputy Matthews, a large number of amendments to the Bill were put forward by Opposition and Government backbenchers and were accepted by the Government in a spirit of generosity knowing that this is a national crisis that we have to solve.  The Bill is going to be transformative.  I cannot wait until it is passed and it will then be time for all of us to make sure it is put into action.</p>  <p>  We all must look at our attitudes to housing and examine whether housing developments should be objected to.  A Sinn F&eacute;in Deputy wondered earlier whether there was any point in building housing in a field in Kildare.  I think there is a point in building houses in fields in Kildare and other places.  To say that the infrastructure is not there is not an excuse.  We need to put the infrastructure in place, but it is wrong to say that it is a reason to oppose housing.  We must build housing with facilities and infrastructure and allow developments and construction to proceed, which will improve our economy and get people into family homes.</p>  <p>  I object to the comments from Independent Deputies that rural Ireland is being put at risk.  It is a very dangerous argument for rural Deputies to complain that they seem to be paying for everything or that not enough is being spent in rural Ireland.  The truth is that Ireland has a very redistributive tax system, not just between rich and poor but also between urban and rural.  We are a better country for it.  I support the Bill.  Deputy O'Donoghue complained about highly educated people.  Further and higher education and second and third level has been key to this country's success, and that will continue.  It is wrong to denigrate it.</p></speech>

This is an important Bill and I echo what my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, said.  It is very easy to get emotional and bang the drum for rural Ireland, but in reality if one reads through the Bill one will find it is one of the most effective pieces of legislation to enable people to come back and live once again in rural Ireland.</p>  <p>  I come from County Longford, one of five or six counties that have a unique housing problem in that there is not so much an affordability issue in our county but rather a sustainable building problem.  In Longford and other similar counties the problem is that the average mean price of a house is still less than what it costs to build a house.  For the past 11 years we have looked on aimlessly and hopelessly as houses were being built across the country, while it was not commercially viable to build a house in Longford.</p>  <p>  Now, thankfully, through the serviced site fund or shared equity scheme we finally have an opportunity to give first-time buyers in my county a real chance to get on the property ladder.  It is an extraordinary statistic that it has been 11 years since a three-bedroom semi-detached house has been built in County Longford.  That is probably indicative of the Bill in that this is the first piece of legislation in 11 years that will give hard-pressed young couples and families an opportunity to get on the property ladder.</p>  <p>  I am proud of the Bill.  It was a key plank in the programme for Government.  The Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, and the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, have worked tirelessly on this, as have departmental staff.  I am pleased to see it advanced to this stage.  I look forward to local authorities like those in Longford being invited to issue their expressions of interest and finally start breaking ground once again on affordable houses in County Longford.</p></speech>

It is a necessary Bill to achieve better affordability in housing.  I want to pay tribute to our party colleague, Deputy Duffy, and thank the Minister, Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, for the openness he has shown in working with him to improve this Bill.  I want to thank the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, for coming in to hear the debate.</p>  <p>  In particular, I want to welcome the introduction of cost rental on a statutory basis.  It has been a long-term aim of my party to introduce this, not just to achieve a short-term improvement in the affordability of housing for people but also to achieve the long-term impact of moving the property and rental markets away from boom and bust by taking a universal approach to housing provision.</p>  <p>  One aspect of housing affordability that I wish to highlight is the issue of transport.  We simply have to stop building houses in places where people have to own cars to live in them.   The AA estimates that the average cost of running a family car for a year is over &euro;10,000.  The price tag on sprawl is significant and it is falling on families.</p> <p>We know the answer, namely, transport-oriented development, as recommended by the NESC and international experts.  It means building housing at medium densities around public transport stops.  The Government has a plan to increase public transport services significantly, especially outside Dublin, but we must develop housing in a way that can be easily served by those services.</p> <p> Recent Irish research shows the phenomenon of forced car dependency in Ireland, with people being forced to own cars even though they cannot afford them.  The measures in the Bill will significantly increase housing affordability, but we must also get our planning right so that we are not forcing people to pay an additional price tag of &euro;10,000 per year because of where they live.</p></speech>

"Affordability" has become a word that, in many instances, no longer means "affordable".  In Galway, there have been no affordable builds for many years.  People will hear the word "affordable", believe it is positive and look forward to perhaps being able to buy their own homes.  Many people constantly get in contact with me and say that they cannot afford a house.  With just 90 affordable homes available for purchase in 2021, though, this will not be a major cause for celebration.  That number amounts to fewer than four homes per county.  What will it mean for Galway?</p>  <p>  What about the cost-rental aspect of the Bill?  We badly need homes that are available for cost rental.  In my home county of Galway, rents are now 6.1% higher than they were in the first quarter of last year.  In Galway city, the price of renting is up 16%.  Despite that, just &euro;35 million is being given to this scheme whereas the shared equity scheme will get &euro;75 million.  It is clear where the priority lies.  The shared equity scheme, which will only be open to new builds, is a disaster waiting to happen.  It is a recipe for more price inflation, which is why the developers wanted it.  If anyone wants evidence to support the claim that it will be inflationary, the good news is that he or she will not have to look too far to get it.  Research has shown that, in Britain, the average new build premium is a 29% markup as a result of the Tory party's shared equity scheme.  In other words, it pushed up prices by almost 30%.</p>  <p>  We have had well over a decade of housing being in crisis.  Rents and prices have reached unaffordable levels.  Cuckoo funds are buying up large amounts of the new stock that is coming online, causing further price inflation.  Now we have this so-called Affordable Housing Bill.  For many people, it will not make a difference in their lives.

I question whether it actually is affordable housing, but at least there is something before us.  I also welcome the cost-rental model being put on a statutory footing.  However, the Bill will in no effective way solve the housing crisis.  It will not make housing more affordable for many of those who want to buy.  In fact, the Central Bank and the ESRI say that it could increase house prices.</p>  <p>  Why is there such a reluctance by the political establishment to move towards a real solution to the crisis?  A large State-funded and State-led programme of building public housing is one of the key ways of dealing with it.  To me, one reason is obvious - the ties between Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael and the banks, developers, landlords and, now, vulture funds.  The refusal to build public housing as far back as the 1980s was a deliberate policy to force people into the private rental sector to a point whereby, in 2016, Mr. David Ehrlich of IRES REIT was able to say: "It's a great market.  We've never seen rental increases like this in any jurisdiction that we're aware of.... I truly feel badly for the Irish people."  IRES REIT has invested heavily in this country over the past eight or nine years.  The refusal also forced people to take on unaffordable mortgages, burdening a couple with a virtual lifelong debt, with one partner essentially working simply to pay it off.  Even that option is not available to the majority of young couples now.</p>  <p>  There is another reason, namely, good old-fashioned snobbery.  I do not just think that - I know it.  There has always been an element of people who look down their noses at people who live in council housing estates.  It is astonishing, or perhaps it is not, to see this attitude reflected by a leading member of the Government.  The T&aacute;naiste and leader of Fine Gael, Deputy Varadkar, let the mask slip when he spoke about people wanting "free housing".  No one ever talks about free housing.  There is no such thing.  There never was and never will be.  People in council housing paid rent and still do.  The T&aacute;naiste likes to speak about people who want "free housing, free education, and free healthcare" without making any contribution towards their provision.  It seems that he is unaware not just of council housing rents, but of how the tax system works.  Even if someone is unemployed and not paying income tax, he or she will pay VAT and excise taxes.  In fact, the lowest 10% of income earners pay 30% of their incomes in taxes, which happens to be the same percentage paid by the top 30% of earners.  The T&aacute;naiste needs to grow up, leave behind the privileged posh boy notions of his youth and get to grips with the reality of life for the majority of people in this country.</p>  <p>  Having got that off my chest, I want to make it clear that people like me recognise that problems can arise from going about building public housing the wrong way.  If public housing is used as a social dumping ground with badly designed estates, a lack of facilities, tenants being targeted by criminals to pull them into drug crime and no hope for the families living there, it can lead to problems with crime, drug abuse and anti-social behaviour.  It does not have to be like that, and should not be.  It is certainly not the type of public housing that the Opposition, and I am sure many in government, advocate.  We can have a mix of public housing options, including traditional council housing and affordable cost-rental apartments for those who do not qualify for council housing lists because they are above the income thresholds.  This will result in good, strong communities in well-designed eco-sustainable housing with good public transport, heavily subsidised schools and cr&egrave;ches, primary care centres, community and sport facilities and green spaces.</p>  <p>  Many people have claimed to have led on cost-rental policy.  The first time I heard of it was in 2017 when Dr. Tom Healy of the Nevin Economic Research Institute commissioned an explanation of what "cost rental" meant, taking from the Vienna or European model.  The concept was initially based on a fair rent scheme and has since turned into the cost-rental model.  The key aspect of the scheme was that the rent was affordable and there was security of tenure for all walks of life - bus drivers, retail workers, nurses, manufacturing workers, post office workers and all workers above the income thresholds for social housing lists.</p> <p>The concept was that rent would be based on one third of a person's income, which is not provided for in this Bill.  It was also based on the fact, and I refer to Dr. Healy on this, that it would not include a profit margin in the cost.</p> <p> The Minister of State emphasised that where any private providers wish to deliver cost-rental homes, for instance, large institutional pension funds, they will of course seek to earn a modest return.  That is profit no matter what way you look at it.  The legislation provides for regulatory powers to set a cap on the allowable level of return, for example, between 3.5% and 5%.  That is not on what the cost rental or fair rent scheme was based.  It was based on non-profit.  There are many ways things can be changed and become something they are not.  This is certainly the case with the cost-rental model the Minister is putting forward today.</p> <p> I am not opposed to private house ownership.  The Small Dwellings Acquisition Act allowed for a scheme whereby the State provided mortgages administered by local authorities.  The mortgages were for 35 years with interest at 50% of the going rate to make them affordable.  Will the Minister consider a similar scheme to meet today's needs.  Between the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, and local authorities there is sufficient publicly-owned land to build 100,000 housing units.  We know that.  This has not only been reported, but scientifically proven.  If 20,000 of said units were built over the next five years, we would be close to 100,000 housing units.  It would have a dramatic effect on the crisis and would help to reduce rents in the private sector, alongside effective rent-control measures to give real security of tenure.  It would reduce prices in the private sector by reducing demand and increasing general supply.  This crisis will only get worse unless this type of radical action is undertaken because housing has to be based on need and human rights.  The more we move towards the private sector controlling the public sector, the less that need will be met.  The programme for Government includes a commitment to a housing referendum.  What is the point of a housing referendum if we do not have houses to make it a reality?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-06-24a.428" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1508" speakername="Michael Fitzmaurice" time="16:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021062400048#YY00200"><p>I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate.  There is not a Deputy in the D&aacute;il who would be against anything that can help the housing situation.  That is the first thing that needs to be said.  We have come up with a lot of reports, legislation and different ideas in the past few years but, the bottom line is, unfortunately, they are not helping the situation on the ground.</p>  <p>  The first thing we need to do is start joining heads together and get people thinking together.  There is no plan for three to six years down the road.  Roads, sewers, electricity and water need to be put in place.  The budget for the likes of Irish Water to build that infrastructure needs to be agreed.  Some 35,000 sites in this country are owned by the State.  Some are unserviced and some were not even known about.  The infrastructure has to be put in place when talking about affordable houses.  At the moment, we have housing agencies, councils, developers and ordinary people trying to buy a piece of land.  When there are four people trying to bite one apple, the apple gets pretty scarce and dear.  We need to have one body that will look after the land side or use the land we have.  We are long enough talking about State land.  To be honest, the councils need to stop blocking progress in other areas.  </p>  <p>  In my opinion, affordable housing is where the State is able to supply a fully-serviced site.  I do not care whether someone is building a 1,200 sq. ft house or 1,300 sq. ft semi-detached, because that is the size they are.  Be that in Dublin, Cork or Galway the costs are roughly the same, maybe 5% to 7% more in Dublin compared with anywhere else.  When we talk about affordable housing for a house of that size, once there is a serviced site - the State needs to use its own land for social and affordable housing - a design should be drawn up that is the same for Dublin, Galway or wherever, bar the facade at the front, so we can buy in bulk.  It is wrong to have people designing houses, twiddling their thumbs and looking at changing this, that and the other.  If there are two to four bedroom houses that are the same inside, and at the back and sides, and the only thing to be changed is to comply with the architecture in each area at the front, a lot of bureaucracy would be eliminated straightaway.  We would then have a design we can move on and that can be priced in bulk in any part of the country. </p>  <p>  We have a dysfunctional banking system for what I call the small builders.  There are plenty of small builders throughout the country who are well able to build ten or 12 houses a year and who are basically pushed out of the way through the procurement set-up at the moment.  If the State has an area where there are 60 houses to be built, it could give five different builders 12 houses each.  In countries like the Netherlands the money put into a house is got back once the house is sold.  These small builders need help because all I see at the moment is one or two, or four or five, of the big builders and big announcements of 600, 800 or 1,000 houses.  The ordinary builders who have four or five people working for them are not in that category and will not give a price for that number of houses.  </p>  <p>  I heard the T&aacute;naiste talk about building more houses and fair play to him if they can do it.  I am not cutting down those who are trying to grow their businesses but, my God, if we pump another &euro;2 billion, &euro;4 billion or &euro;6 billion into the housing industry, prices will go up and we will get no more for what we are doing.  We have seen over the past year that materials have gone up by about 30% or 40%.  To get materials now, the likes of timber and so on, is the other question.  As I said earlier today, a load of timber could be coming here from a foreign country and somone in America or elsewhere could bid higher and the boat will turn.  Suppliers here who had promised something are then left high and dry.</p>  <p>  I heard Deputy Collins talk about people looking down on those in social housing, but there is a snotty attitude towards someone who is a digger driver, a pipe layer, a plasterer, a wet tradesperson, a carpenter or a plumber, of "you did not stay in school so you decided to go out to the buildings."  These tradespeople go through many courses, get their certificates and are highly skilled with their hands and they should be appreciated.  Over the years we have had a boom-bust situation, and that is the way it was in housing.  People who come from rural areas, especially, are like swallows.  They go to different places, see that Dublin might be going well and then, bang, they go away to London or somewhere else.  That is not the way it has to be.  What has really happened during the pandemic is that we shut down house building and sectors like that, while the Brits kept them going and have poached most of the digger drivers that were in this country.  We now have our tongues out trying to get digger drivers to work on sites and they are not available.  They cannot be made overnight.</p> <p>The workforce is one thing on which there must be a focus.  I hear many stories about apprenticeships and so forth.  We must introduce a new system of apprenticeship to give apprentices high recognition for what they do.  The other thing that must be done relates to houses made off-site.  We must get into that further, with factory-built houses that can be erected rapidly when they come on site.</p> <p> The one thing the State will have to do is make sure that it does not talk about an affordable house to the new poor in what I call middle Ireland.  I refer to people who are above the threshold to qualify for social housing and are not earning enough to afford a mortgage.  They are the new poor in this country.  With regard to affordable housing, I saw a reference from the Minister for Finance to the Irish Glass Bottle site - I am almost sure it was that from the top of my head - where people were referring to &euro;450,000.  Lord God, one would want two houses for that.  I will give my opinion on an affordable house in Dublin.  We must get it into our heads that the cost of the house is the same in different places, bar 5% to 10% as I outlined, if one has the site.  One should be able to build the house for between &euro;200,000 and &euro;220,000 or &euro;230,000 if the State is supplying the site.  If a couple decides down the road to sell that house and if the site is worth &euro;50,000, &euro;60,000 or &euro;70,000, they pay it back to the State.  That is the simple way of doing it.</p> <p> Another thing we need to do in the LDA is make sure we do not give cosy little jobs to people who were in the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, and the like.  We have to poach people.   That is how it was always done in the private sector.  One poaches the people who are able to deliver.  One gives them a bonus.  We should forget about salaries and just give them a good bonus to deliver, because it is about delivery.  What somebody produces, be it as a Deputy or in building houses, is what the person will be marked up on.  This is the road we must take.  Unfortunately, the councils do not have the resources at present.  The councils have been depleted over the last ten or 15 years because of the way the country was or for one reason or another.  Most councils now do not have enough people in their planning departments or in any other departments.  There is no point in talking to them about building houses when they do not have the resources to do it.  One will not get people by magic overnight who will do it.</p> <p> The one thing we must do is make sure we have houses that are affordable - in my opinion, that is between &euro;200,000 and &euro;250,000 - for the bracket of people I mentioned.  That is achievable if one does it the way I have said.  We can talk about housing for years.  I have listened to many debates about it here and about the things that are going to be done.  However, if the attitude in the Department does not change, if the shredding machine is used for ideas that have been brought forward - I am saying straight that it has been, because the Department will not go along with them - and if Ministers do not take the bull by the horns, we will dangle along in the same way.  If the same piano players are playing the same piano and they are not producing the goods in the first place, they are not going to change over the next few years.</p> <p> We need a radical review of this.  It requires joined-up thinking that involves Irish Water, the planners and the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.  The private sector must be involved to be able to produce the goods.  We must ensure we nurture and bring forward people who will work in the sector.  Every year I visit schools, as I was involved with different companies down through the years on water jobs and so forth, and try to encourage youngsters to go for water pipe-laying, blocklaying or to be electricians.  I go to the schools so that perhaps 50 youngsters would get that opportunity.  If we do not do that and put a carrot before them, they will stay doing different courses and we will end up with a problem in the housing situation.</p></speech>

There is a great deal in the Bill, and much of it is praiseworthy.  However, I will speak first about the overarching situation.  The simple fact is that there are not enough houses available for people seeking houses.  That is having two effects.  One is that people are homeless because they cannot get accommodation.  They are living in hotels, bed and breakfast accommodation and in all sorts of arrangements other than the one they want, which is a permanent home.  The second obvious issue that arises is that when something is scarce the price goes up.  That is inevitable.  Ultimately, we must deal with the supply issue.  As long as we are talking about it, but not building houses, we will not solve the housing crisis.</p>  <p>  The second issue is that this affects many people in society.  Every week people who are homeless contact me.  In speaking about people who are homeless, I should point out that there are two types of homelessness.  There are those who sleep in doorways, many of whom have social issues and, perhaps, addiction issues.  There is also the huge number of the unseen homeless - people living in all types of temporary accommodation for no other reason than that there is no accommodation available or that if they were in a rented property, the owner of the property wanted the property back for one reason or another.  We will not solve that problem until we deal with the supply issue and until the State provides social housing.</p>  <p>  In the old days we had the rent allowance, which was meant to be a temporary expedient for people who found themselves temporarily without accommodation.  It was never meant to be a permanent arrangement.  The previous Government, in an effort to reduce the housing lists, by sleight of hand said it would abolish the rent allowance and establish the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, at first and then the housing assistance payment, HAP, in its place.  However, that is still renting from a private landlord, and 80% of the people who I represent and who are in the HAP scheme would prefer to be in a local authority or a State-owned house.  The reason is security of tenure, which the Irish fought so hard for in the 19th century.  It is funny that it has come back to haunt us again.  Therefore, we must give people permanent homes, if that is their choice.  I am not saying that I have not met people who would prefer to stay in the HAP scheme.  That is their choice.  It should be a matter of choice, not a matter of being told.  Certainly, the vast majority of the people I know would prefer to have local authority housing.  The second choice is voluntary housing.  I find that most people, given a choice between voluntary housing and local authority housing, prefer the local authority housing because they can aspire to buying it.  Many people in Ireland still aspire to have what their parents had, a house they can own.</p>  <p>  I always listen very carefully to what Deputy Fitzmaurice has to say about his experience on the ground.  I often wish that people who design schemes had his type of experience at the coalface.  Certainly, with all the bureaucratic structures and the bidding and tendering processes we have established, we have managed to destroy many small builders who always worked within their capacity and who always took a steady amount of work on hand, collectively, in large and small villages across the country.</p> <p>They were happy to do the smaller projects and they provided many houses.  We must look at our bureaucratic structures to make construction attractive for those small builders again.</p> <p> The next issue we must examine is that of the delays in getting houses built.  There is an inordinate delay from the time a local authority decides to build houses to the time those houses are ready.  We lost a great deal of corporate knowledge in local authorities because many of the skilled people were let go.  The same skill sets are not to be found in respect of design and other areas in the local authorities as there was previously.  I also came across a case in my own constituency where it is going to take well over two years, some two and a half years, to develop a very small housing estate.  We must again ask why it takes so long to build standard houses.  Only half a mile away from that particular site is a school on which construction started in February 2011, I remember it well, and it opened in September of the same year.  A full, standard-sized city school was constructed in that time.</p> <p> It is funny how everything interconnects.  Timber prices have gone crazy.  Importing it is one problem, but even the price of native timber has gone up because it is so scarce and there is such a good market for it here and in Britain.  Why has that happened? It is because there is a hold-up of licences in Coillte and not because of any shortage in timber.  It is amazing, in fact, that the failure of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, including its appeals board, to deal with licences to fell timber has actually put up the price of timber in this State.  I also agree with the point regarding the workforce.  If we had planning permission in place tomorrow and we put houses out to tender, we would find that the workforce we had when we were able to build 90,000 houses does not exist any more and nobody has replaced them.  </p> <p> Many of our people in England, Australia and Canada, including skilled machine operators, blocklayers, carpenters and electricians, are now at an age when they would be interested in coming home.  We have had this argument before concerning relocation costs and barriers.  I refer to people having to sit driver tests again upon returning home and all these sorts of issues which arise.  We should look into this matter and see if we should give an inducement to people with certain trades to come home, just as we issue work permits to non-EU citizens in areas where we have critical shortages.  Why not induce some of our own to come home to build the houses?</p> <p> I will address the issue from the perspective of people looking for a house.  Local authority houses, if we went back to the previous generation, were inhabited mainly by people who had jobs.  Now, people who only have a social welfare income are the only people who can get on the housing list.  I have even come across cases where there is no income in a house except for social welfare income.  Those are exceptional cases, but they are there.  They too were above the income limits for social housing.  This situation is creating its own form of social segregation.  It is wrong.  People working on low incomes should be entitled to get social housing.</p> <p> Those people also have nowhere to go, because they will not be successful if they go to a bank to get money or go looking for a Rebuilding Ireland loan.  It is absolutely farcical that hard-working people on very modest wages are regarded as earning too much to qualify for social housing while also not being able to borrow money.  We move up then to those people who a generation ago would have been able to buy a house as a one-income family.  They would have what would have been considered steady jobs in the Civil Service, An Garda, nursing and all sorts of areas.  Such people cannot now buy houses.  It is quite a ridiculous situation.  In many cases, when these people apply to a bank, or to the State loan agency which gives money for houses when the banks fail to do so, the replacement for the old county council loans, they find out that the repayments for the highest loan possible would be much less than the current rent being paid by them and everybody else in the same cohort.</p> <p> Therefore, the people in these cases are not being refused because they are paying exceptional rent.  They are paying the going rate.  However, it is not possible to borrow an amount on which the repayments would be as big as the rent being paid.  One would think the situation would be the other way around.  Let us take the case of someone renting a house and paying perhaps &euro;2,000 or &euro;2,500 a month in rent, and it would be higher here in Dublin.  We would think that it should be possible for people in that situation to borrow as much money as would give an equivalent repayment capacity and a little bit more in addition, given that there would generally be a feeling that people would stretch themselves a little bit further if they had their own house.  We all did that when we got houses.  We all stretched our resources that little bit further because our houses became our most precious possession.</p> <p> I have not even got as far yet as the schemes in the Bill.  There is just so much to be done on the subject.  I really like the idea of affordable homes, but I have one warning and I have made this view known before to the Minister.  I will repeat it.  This scheme must not become too legally complex and cumbersome.  The only way we will properly test this scheme is by the number of people who wind up living in affordable homes as a result.  I have seen in the last decade so many attractive schemes destroyed by red tape.  The tenant purchase scheme was destroyed by petty rules.  The measure of this scheme, therefore, will be judged according to how many people manage to get an affordable house in the next five years and nothing else.  I hope we will watch the small print carefully, because that is the thing which has damned so many initiatives which looked good.  I hope we will ensure that this scheme will work as it says on the tin and that the houses really are affordable.  However, we must also deal with the loan element, because people will still have to borrow money to buy these houses.</p> <p> I could go on.  As I said at the beginning, however, the problem is simple.  If we do not build many more houses at a fair price for punters, we will not solve this problem.  In that context, we must deal with the delays in planning and in process.  Every process now seems to be slower than it was in the past.  Now that we have computers, one would think that everything would actually be faster than it was in the past, but everything seems to be more complex instead.  One of the big things we must do is to make things happen faster.  One of the biggest hold-ups to making progress on the housing front is a hidden barrier that exists and which was put there by the last Government and by the State.  It is called the national planning framework.  The reality of the way that is working out on the ground is that it is going to hold up housing in every town and village.  It might be very idealistic, but it is not very realistic.  Ultimately, those who do not have houses want realism.  That is the most important thing they want.</p></speech>

It is urgently needed and we must get it through the Houses as quickly as possible.  Over the years, I have had numerous representations from people who do not qualify to go on the housing list and cannot get a mortgage.  The people I am dealing with now are what I would describe as the new working poor.  I was working with a couple last week, one of the many couples with whom I am working.  They both have good jobs and so do not qualify to go on the housing list.  They are paying their rent, paying for childcare and trying to save for a mortgage but they qualify for nothing.  It is so difficult now.  People are working so hard but they do not qualify to go on the housing list or to get a mortgage.  This legislation must be passed as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  The other issue being raised with me is that of adult children still living at home with their parents.  They all have jobs but cannot get a house.  They do not qualify to go on the housing list and they do not qualify for a mortgage.  There is such a gap here and if we do not get this sorted now, a lot of people will never have a home to call their own.  They will be renting for the rest of their lives or staying at home with their families.  This has become a huge issue for all of us.  The income cap for Carlow County Council's housing list is only &euro;27,500 which is unacceptable.  It means that very many people do not qualify to go on the housing list and that is very unfair.  </p>  <p>  We need to get this Affordable Housing Bill through quickly.  We also need to make sure that we build houses.  The biggest issue is the lack of housing supply and that is an issue that everyone in this House has been addressing.  It is important to see affordable houses being built in one's own area because it leads to job creation and apprenticeships.  We need to get people back into apprenticeships and this Bill can do it.  We need to get it right and I totally agree with Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v in that regard.  We have to get the houses built, stay local and make sure places like Carlow and Kilkenny are not forgotten.  I know from talking to people that many are very disheartened.  Everyone deserves a home and everyone has a right to a home.  This is an area that Fianna F&aacute;il and the Government can deliver on for the country and we have to do it.  We have got to get this right.  I hope this Bill will go through as soon as possible.  </p>  <p>  I was speaking to the director of housing in Carlow County Council recently and was delighted to hear that the council is availing of the incremental purchase scheme.  That scheme will offer many families the possibility of owning their own homes.  People on the housing list want the chance to own their own home.  They work hard and they deserve that chance and we need to give it to them.  I am delighted that Carlow County Council is working to that end.</p>  <p>  The local authorities must move quickly on this once this legislation is passed.  We need to embark on an information campaign because there is a lot of misunderstanding about what can happen when the Bill is passed.  The main point is that we cannot have barriers or red tape.  We cannot have people coming back to us to say they do not qualify or cannot get an affordable house.  We must make sure that the people who cannot go on the housing list and cannot get a mortgage will qualify for affordable housing.  </p>  <p>  I have been speaking to a lot of people my own age recently who have grown-up children, many of whom are still living with them.  While that may be welcome for some, if we do not give people the opportunity to have their own home, we are doing them a disservice.  We have a duty of care.  We must look after people and make sure they can have their own home.  It is not their fault that they do not have one.</p>  <p>  I strongly support and promote this Bill and urge all Members in the House to support it.  We must get this legislation through as soon as possible and make sure that everybody has the right to a house.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-06-24a.433" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1498" speakername="Ruairi &Oacute; Murch&uacute;" time="16:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021062400051#BBB00200"><p>The first thing to say about affordable housing is that it needs to be affordable.  A number of contributors today stated the Government and Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage will be graded on the basis of the delivery of houses.  The issue is not just the delivery of houses, but of affordable houses.  Reference was made to affordable purchase but it cannot just be a heading; it needs to mean something.  In Dublin, it needs to mean regular houses costing around &euro;230,000 and outside of Dublin, considerably less.  If that is not what we are talking about, then what are we talking about?  We have heard figures in this House of &euro;400,000 and &euro;450,000 in the context of affordable housing but that is obviously not affordable.  It may be affordable for some but I do not know many such people.  That level is definitely not going to cut it.</p><p>We also have the issue of affordable cost rental and we have heard nothing but support for this particular idea.  Every speaker who contributed to the debate yesterday, including me, talked about every town and village and city in his or her constituency in the context of house prices.  Anyone who does a look-back on the Oireachtas website or on <i>kildarestreet.com</i>will find this issue time after time, the only difference being that every couple of months there is an increase in our top line figure for rent for regular families.</p><p>Affordable cost rental has to work.  Examples have been given with regard to affordable cost rental and the outworking of particular schemes that are being proposed by the Government, with rents of around &euro;1,200 per month for a two-bedroom unit.  That is not going to cut it.  We really need to be talking about figures of between &euro;700 and &euro;900 per month.  Only a couple of years ago, those figures would have seemed extravagant and ridiculous but such is the world we are in.  That is why, when we spoke yesterday about the absolutely necessity for rent control, we said it needs to happen now because the rent pressure zones are not working.  We are not keeping rent increases to 4%.  Furthermore, the 4% increase has been doubled in some cases following the Covid period, which is hammering families who are already under severe pressure.  It is not working so not only do we need a rent cap for the next three years until we get beyond what is an absolute crisis at this point, we also need to run with the Sinn F&eacute;in proposal for a tax rebate for tenants that would be the equivalent of one month's rent.  That is both fair and absolutely necessary.  </p><p>We have all spoken about homelessness, of which there are varying levels.  There are people with severe difficulties who fall into homelessness.  Some of that is because we do not provide the necessary interventions.  We are not providing the individual and family supports that are needed at an early stage before people get into acute situations.  I refer here to support around addiction, mental health issues and so on.  We always wait until it is a disaster.  When it is a disaster, it is far more expensive to deal with from the point of view of the State.  Not intervening in a timely manner is an utterly false economy.  We really need to get our act together across that area.</p><p>The other homelessness involves people who cannot afford the absolutely crazy rents and we need to get our act together in that regard too.  It cannot be beyond the Government and the State to deliver housing for affordable purchase or affordable rental and to build council houses.  This was done at particular times in this State when there was not a huge amount of money available.  It cannot be beyond possibility that the tools of government are brought to bear to deliver a solution for the people.  We cannot continue with this crisis.  </p><p>I fear that there is a belief in this Government, as there was in previous Governments, that if we tip around the edges of this problem, the market will eventually kick in and rectify the problem.  We are in an absolute crisis, however, and all of the rules are out the window.  If we do not take action, look at this strategically and do everything that needs to be done, we will not deliver for our people.</p> <p>That brings me to the crux of the matter in this legislation, namely, the shared equity scheme.  I will not shock anybody by stating that Sinn F&eacute;in has a real difficulty with this.  The difficulty is that we are backed up in this regard by the Central Bank, by the ESRI and even by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  We are talking about putting something into action that has been operated in Britain and which led to an increase in house prices.  In the middle of a housing crisis where costs have gone through the roof, we will introduce this policy, which will add further cost.  We are not sufficiently thinking in the long term, we are not solution-oriented and we are not doing all that needs to be done.  We are failing abjectly.</p> <p> It is no more than the difficulties that we and many others have with the Land Development Agency from the point of view of us getting the best bang from our buck in delivering public housing.  That means council houses, affordable mortgages and affordable cost rental.  No matter what certain commentators from the Government might state, that is what we are talking about.  We have no difficulty with anybody owning their own home.  The difficulty most people have is that they cannot afford to own their own home and they cannot afford some of the spectacularly high rents to be found across this State.  We need to deal with that; it is as simple as that.  The shared equity scheme is inflationary.  As I said, the Land Development Agency will not provide the best bang for our buck and we are going to give sweetheart deals to developers to make huge profits.  I have no difficulty with a developer that is making money on a development but when it is public land, we need to ensure that we get the best bang for our buck.</p> <p> On what is going on in the private side of the market, we still have a huge difficulty in that we have offered overly fair sweetheart deals to investment trusts.  Everybody comes back and says there is a need to deliver apartments and they talk about Berlin, Europe and the rest of it.  I will repeat what Deputy &Oacute; Broin said about dealing with one of those big investment trusts that was formally a pension trust in Berlin.  He stated that it would have no interest in investing in this State at this point in time because of the chaotic housing crisis we have.  We have a yo-yo scenario with prices that go through the roof and then drop off.  We also have rents that are sky-high and then we have a drop-off so there is no consistency.  These sort of investment trusts that are different from some of the cuckoo funds we have that come in to take what they can, make as much money as they can as quickly as possible and then leave.  The difference with these other entities is that they are looking at a return over 50 years.  They are looking at whether it is somewhere between 3% and 5% of an annual return.</p> <p> The problem is that we need a Government that is thinking in those sort of cycles of 50 years and of putting solutions in place that will be there for a considerable amount of time.  The problem is that we have short-termism in politics from a point of view that people are sometimes interested in what the next rung in the ladder within a political party is, as opposed to delivering for the people and putting long-term solutions in place.</p> <p> A number of speakers from all parties have spoken about the difficulty of those people who earn too much to get themselves on the local authority housing list, which is bunged up anyway and we have people who are waiting huge amounts of time to get local authority housing.  However, we have people who cannot meet those criteria because they earn slightly too much but then they have to try to compete in a town like Dundalk with three or four workers from the WuXi plant, for example.  Those workers are coming in to work in a plant but three or four of them are all earning so they can afford some of these spectacularly expensive rates.  They might also go up against a family that is getting HAP, as it should in order to ensure it is in housing.  The problem is that the baseline rent is being set somewhere between &euro;1,000 and &euro;1,400 or more per month, which is disastrous.  That is why we have the difficulties we have so we need to deal with that.</p> <p> It would be remiss of me not to mention a number of issues that have come across my desk in the last while, including that of people who fall into another bracket again.  Not only have we been hearing consistently about reviewing figures or rates for being able to access the local authority housing list, we also need to ensure that discretion can be shown and that scenarios in which people's circumstances have changed drastically can be taken into account.  We are all aware of people who have children with severe disabilities that require certain types of housing and which involve huge costs.  These people are trapped and will find it difficult to even get a landlord who will rent to them because they are considered to take a bit more effort.  This means they fall between stools and hit the ground.  There is no discretion and there are no write-offs for earnings.</p> <p> I know of a constituent who has been considering the job they are in for a huge amount of time.  The person is wondering if the best thing to do is to leave the job and get onto the dole because then at least, that person might be able to access housing.  Given this person has a child with severe mobility disabilities, they could at least access a house in that scenario.  If they were considered and could get the housing then that person could possibly look at going back into employment again.  Think of the mad system that allows for this to happen.</p> <p> In addition, Louth County Council has huge amount of really old housing stock.  It was built in the 1970s, some of it before that and some of it after that.  A huge amount of it needs to be upgraded and updated and the difficulty is the moneys are not there.  There are insufficient moneys for maintenance.  I accept that money has been drawn down recently for voids and that will put a considerable amount of houses that have been lying vacant across Louth County Council's portfolio for a number of years back into use.  That is what needs to be done but we need to deal with the fact that this housing stock is falling into disrepair.  The residents of those houses may never have looked for any upgrade works but now are dealing with serious situations where the maintenance budget is not there to deliver.  The problem is that we wait until it gets worse and worse and then it becomes more costly and eventually will need to be dealt with.  I acknowledge that a retrofitting programme has begun but it is small scale at this stage.  I accept that it will be escalated but it will not deal with the remedial works that are needed.  I call on the likes of Louth County Council to do a full audit on housing stock from the point of view of needing a programme of works that at least looks at windows and doors.  We talk about climate change but a huge amount of this housing stock is losing every bit of heat and is utterly costly from a climate change point of view.</p> <p> We need to get serious about all of this.  It is like the person asking for directions in Kerry who is told the person answering would not start from here but unfortunately here is where we are, so we need to take this action and there are no two ways about it.  The thresholds for local authority housing need to be reviewed.  I will return to this with the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, and I have already brought this up with the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, in the area of disabilities.  There is a separate issue in respect of disabled person's grants and I am dealing with a number of people who fall into priority 1 in Louth County Council.  I am talking about people who have severe disabilities, some of them caused by cancers.  I know of one person suffering from brain cancer who is in a really difficult situation.</p> <p>Another has considerable mobility issues following cancer care.  We are dealing with issues for people in council houses and those who own houses.  They have been accepted and assessed as priority 1.  However, the problem is the list is so great, these people may not be able to access these absolutely necessary supports for another two or possibly three years.  That is not good enough.  It is another situation where we are facing an incredibly difficult problem.  We have a health need but we do not put sufficient money in and allow the situation to get much worse.   We let the problem escalate and will then have to deal with it when to do so will be much more expensive from the State's point of view.  That is what we are doing.  We need joined-up thinking.</p> <p> I add my voice to the other scenario.  Even if we get our plans for council-led building correct, we will then need to ensure councils have full powers, are able to draw down moneys, deal with developers, put developments in place and get houses built.  We have heard from directors of services for housing in county councils throughout Ireland about the difficulty that can exist, from time to time, in drawing down money.  We know that, over the years, it has been much easier for an approved housing body to draw down the money.  It was also easier for those bodies to get planning approved.  We have created difficulties for councils in building houses.  That is before we get into the necessity to put money aside for upgrade and upkeep and whatever other resources are needed.</p> <p> We must get absolutely serious about all of these matters.  We are talking about going down individual culs-de-sac that will all end in costly failure.  I am not absolutely dogmatic about any form of housing delivery.  I am not ideologically caught up in how we deliver housing.  I am caught up in the fact we need to deliver.  The Minister will be graded on how well this works.</p> <p> I will come back to the Minister on the individual issues about which I have spoken.  There is a real issue for people who are experiencing particular issues and costs around disability.  On the wider issue, we need to use every tool there is.  We need to make sure a full Government approach is taken to delivering housing.  That must include affordable housing, affordable purchase, affordable cost rental and council housing.  We must get serious and think long term.  If investment funds are coming into the country, buying up housing estates or building unaffordable rental properties and taking all they can, we need to shift the paradigm.  We need to introduce special purpose vehicles, as has been done in other countries across Europe.  We need to ensure we create companies that are acting from the point of the State but operating in the private sector and which can draw down money, whether from the European Investment Bank, EIB, or the many other sources that exist.  We then need to deliver housing.  It is as straightforward as that.  As I said, this Government will be graded on housing delivery and nothing else.  It must deliver from the point of view of affordable purchase, affordable cost rental and council housing.  That is before we go into the wider issue of estate management.  As I have said before, we need early and clever interventions that include providing family supports, building houses or whatever we need to do.  We need to resource all the bodies that are needed to deliver.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-06-24a.436" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1584" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="17:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021062400053#DDD00200"><p>The Ceann Comhairle and I have learned a lot about housing over the years.  We have put many of those things into practice in our own constituencies over the years, and they worked.  However, approximately 20 years ago, the emphasis on the right to own a house fell away.  A great deal of emphasis and advertising went into the glories of renting and how wonderful it is to rent.  Even in recent years, it was not unusual for someone to come on "Morning Ireland" to tell us how wonderful it was to rent.  That was never the case.  Renting was always a way out of housing, a way to make it impossible for people to own their own houses.</p>  <p>  We all know that affordable housing is part of the taxation system in this country and always has been.  If people were able to afford a house, they were able to plan their lives and work without having to go back to their employers or the public service every three or four months looking for a pay increase.  They had stability.  We were able to solve any issues because we did something serious about them at the time.   We did that in a number of ways.  We built local authority housing.  We provided annuity loans and housing agency loans through the 1966 Housing Act.  Those loans were excellent.  They applied a principle of two and a half times the income of the main earner and, later, included the income of the second earner.  It worked extremely well.  It meant there was latitude there for borrowers in the event of something going wrong, for example, somebody in the household becoming ill.  It meant a family would be able to survive because they were not overborrowed.</p>  <p>  Wise people then came along to lead us in a different direction and told us those ideas were old-fashioned, that we should change all that and have a formula.  People were then loaned up to ten times their incomes.  That was a crazy situation and, of course, when the crunch came, they were the people who were hit first.  I am sure the Ceann Comhairle and everyone else in this House dealt with cases when then crash came.  The people who were way over that two and a half times their income limit when they got their mortgages in the first place were the first casualties. It was sad to see many people, poor families, being hammered in a way that was totally unnecessary.  There was no need for them to be led astray in that fashion.</p>  <p>  I listened to Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v who has the experience of having lived and worked with these sorts of situations over the years and he has learned from them.  What he said was true in that we need to get it right this time because there will be no second chances.  The public are depending on our ability to deliver.  That means we must deliver big time in the first instance.  It is no good telling people that in five, six, seven or ten years, we will have houses for everybody.  The children of today will be adults at that stage, and long since past caring whether they ever get houses.</p>  <p>  In 1992 and 1993, people were leaving this country and emigrating.  There was a shortage of housing then in the same way there is now.  People emigrated because they could not get houses at home.  People were sleeping on floors.  The parents of emigrants who returned from abroad were sleeping on floors because they had nowhere else to go and it was not possible to deliver housing in time.</p>  <p>  I believe we are only tinkering around the edges of the issue.  The only way to deal with it is commensurate with the demand and the requirements.  There is no use in saying we will make 15,000, 20,000 or 30,000 houses available if the need is for 150,000.  We need to provide houses upfront in a serious hurry.</p>  <p>  An opportunity comes up every so often to inflate house prices.  Scarcity is one way to do that and that is the way things are now.  A modest house in the Rathmines area went on the market in recent weeks for a modest asking price and eventually sold for &euro;1.2 million or &euro;1.3 million.  This is utterly crazy stuff.  It is all because people see an opportunity.  It is people with money, not first-time buyers, who are doing that.  People who bought houses four years ago, if they were able to get a loan to buy a house, can now sell those houses at a profit.  That is a danger signal.  It will displace first-time buyers who are now coming on the market.  It is a crazy situation.  It means the people who are waiting to get a house now for the first time, people with small kids and so on, may wait forever.  Nothing will happen because they have been displaced.  There is always a good reason such people cannot be accommodated now.</p>  <p> The Ceann Comhairle and I, from our experience, look at this kind of thing with a great deal of concern.</p> <p>If we now want to find out how far and where we are going to go, let us evaluate the cost of building a house.  In recent weeks, we noticed reports of increased building costs.  Once we go beyond the building cost of a house, whatever it may be on the market, a person borrowing money for a house is in dangerous territory for the simple reason that he or she is now competing in a market.  At that stage, all that person is doing is satisfying what needs to be satisfied when somebody else wants a house ahead of him or her and he or she is outbid.</p> <p> The thing to remember is this.  Incidentally, at the all-party special committee after the 2016 election, which we all attended, some of us put down a marker at the time to say we needed to build large numbers of affordable, good quality houses through the local authorities, which people could rent or buy as they wish.  Do not forget that as soon as that happens, whether a person is renting or purchasing, whoever builds the houses for them, be it the State or the private sector, it means that an income is accruing there and then from the construction of those houses.</p> <p> It is a very lucrative market for the rental sector.  People say if it was not there, we would have a really serious problem and we would.  If we did not have to rely on that, however, house prices would be  much lower.  I will digress for a minute.  I thought this was the saddest story I came across in recent times.  An immigrant returned home from abroad with a good job and profession.  That person arrived here, took time to settle down and then decided to apply for a local authority loan.  The person's income was within that scope but they were told they need six months' bank statements and income clarification because they had been out of work for the previous six months.  I thought it was a crazy attitude.  The person was in work before and was going to get a job.  This person had to get a job because there was scarcity of labour in the area in which they majored.  The result was that this person did not get a house, and still does not have a house, because the crisis raced ahead of them.  The daftness of it all is when people in that kind of situation, who could easily be helped, are not being helped, encouraged or given hope.  Hope is important to everybody, whatever their social status in life.</p> <p> I had a discussion earlier with a lending institution that had designs on somebody's home.  Hopefully, it will only be designs.  I had to say this.  The same despair applies to people at different income levels if they are not able to hold on to their homes.  It does not matter what their income is.  If they are going to lose it or if the loss is imminent, it affects them in the same way as a poorer person on a lesser income.  Everybody is, therefore, entitled to hold on to their home and do the best they can to achieve that.</p> <p> I hope we do not have many more of these debates.  I know the Minister of State is genuine in his efforts to deal with the housing situation but I would warn that will take a much bigger effort than we have anticipated.  My reason for so believing is that every so often, when it is about to become possible for many people throughout this country to realise a home of their own, something happens.  The market takes off and it is outside their reach.  Suddenly, they are competing with a market they cannot handle.</p> <p> The Ceann Comhairle will recall that we had the shared ownership loan system, which was quite good and helpful to get people onto the housing market ladder.  Some genius had a brainwave about the rental part of the equity, which was originally at a 4% interest charge or the equivalent of a local authority rent.  Some genius decided he was going to increase the rental by 4% per annum, putting it right outside people's means and making it impossible.  Entire reams of house loans went into arrears.  It was not the loan part but the rental part of the equity that went into arrears because they were no longer able to handle it.</p> <p> Can we please come to conclusion on it this time?  Can we ensure that we build houses up front?  The construction sector is well able to do this if we give it the authority, instruct it that the funding is available and ask it how many houses it can build, how quickly and for how much.  It is not rocket science at all.  It is quite simple.  The Ceann Comhairle and I did it in our constituencies and proved that it could be done at a fraction of what the cost was otherwise in the marketplace.</p> <p> I believe the Minister of State is genuine.  I think he will do everything possible to achieve the result we want, which is to make a house available to everybody as quickly as possible, not in ten or 20 years&rsquo; time.  When we tackle the housing situation for the 100,000 families on the housing list, we need to make serious inroads in the first year.  If we have to do what was done in the past in this country and import the construction sector into the country to deal with the job, then that is what we must do.  If we do not provide houses sooner rather than later, however, the tide is going to go out and it will be deemed to be a failure of the administration of the State, unfortunately, to provide for that cohort of people.  It would be a sad thing to happen.</p> <p> I appeal at this stage, therefore, to those who make the choices and decisions in certain high places - they are not the Ceann Comhairle and I - to make the decisions clearly in the knowledge that we do not have much time.  At the very maximum, we have three years to solve and break the back of the problem we have nowadays.  People start talking about how we can do it over ten years.  Over ten years, we can do what we like.  It makes no difference.  If we do not deal with the problem up front, the children of today - the adults of tomorrow - will have gone past the stage where they are going to need a house at all.</p> <p> It must be really awful for small kids to live on what is effectively a waiting list forever only to have no home of their own.  Daddy and mammy are being asked on a daily basis when they are going to have a home, and the landlord or somebody else is pressing to tell that family they need the house to sell it to somebody else.</p> <p> I will finish with this.  I was asked by one of our councillors in the very recent past if I would visit a couple who were living in a caravan, which the Ceann Comhairle and I have often done.  It was not to see for the first time what it was like but to simply see how they were coping in the circumstances.  In the middle of winter, in freezing cold weather, two adults and a child were wearing summer clothes.  All I can say is that if we do not respond to that kind of situation soon, we will rightly be blamed for failing in our duties.</p></speech>

I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to contribute to the debate today on the Affordable Housing Bill 2021.  I would love to be excited about, welcome and look forward to the difference this Bill will make to the housing crisis.  The reality is, however, that Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael would not know what affordable was even if it was part of a presentation at a golf dinner.</p>  <p>  Last week, Billy Kelleher MEP tweeted that the Dublin Bay South by-election is dictating the issues around &ldquo;free housing for everyone&rdquo;.  Will we get free houses everywhere that Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael lose seats or is it just starting from now?</p>  <p>  There was uproar on Twitter after Mr. Kelleher's ridiculous comment about free houses and rightly so.  Everyone knows that there are no such things as free houses and those who live in local authority houses pay rent.  Oftentimes, those who live in local authority homes can be living in unsuitable conditions with damp, urgent repair needs, replacement windows needed etc., but have to wait until the maintenance crew gets to them.</p> <p>Approximately 1,000 people living in social housing in Donegal have walls crumbling around them because their accommodation was built with defective concrete blocks infested with mica.  It was an accident waiting to happen.  There are, of course, at least 4,000 owner-occupied homes crumbling because of mica.  The cost of rebuilding or refurbishing one's home while continuing to pay the mortgage, and pay rent somewhere else while the repairs are taking place is unaffordable.  The 90% mica redress scheme is not fit for purpose and I reiterate my call for 100% redress for affected homes, alongside the other necessary measures such as covering rent and pausing mortgage repayments.<br/><br/>Last Monday, the Take Four blog by Unite the Union was launched, as part of which Conor McCabe wrote an excellent opening article: Why Fine Gael created a housing crisis &ndash; and who they are doing it for.  It is the most recent in a long line of reality checks being delivered to the Government about the housing crisis.  Dr. Rory Hearne, for example, has also been highlighting the culpability of the Government in the crisis.  Mr. McCabe's article begins as follows:</p><blockquote>	On 14 October 2015 Taoiseach Enda Kenny stood up in the D&aacute;il to speak against government intervention to tackle the rising cost of rents.  &quot;It is very clear that interference in the market to its detriment is not something that we should do&quot; he said, adding that &quot;if you interfere in the wrong way you make the matters worse&quot;...<br /><br />However, there is a wider context to his remarks, one that shows that what is at play here is not just ideology but the protection of a state-sponsored strategy that has led to profits of hundreds of millions of euros for private investors, to the detriment of social cohesion and stability.  <br /><br />When Kenny stood up in the D&aacute;il to denounce rent freezes, it had been two years since Fine Gael and Labour had introduced legislation to allow Real Estate Investment Trusts [REITs] to operate in Ireland. </blockquote> <p>Given the recent outrage and faux shock at the vulture funds gobbling up full housing estates, the article is an important reminder that those funds were welcomed by the Government.<br/><br/>Mr. McCabe goes on to say: &quot;[T]he REITs business model, then and now, demands an under-supply of housing that forces rents up in order to work.&quot;  He also writes:</p><blockquote>	[D]avid Ehrlich of Ires REIT was able to say in 2016 that Ireland is &quot;a great market.  We've never seen rental increases like this in any jurisdiction that we're aware of...  I truly feel badly for the Irish people.&quot; </blockquote> <p>Mr. Ehrlich may have felt bad for Irish people but he went ahead and made profits off their backs in any case.  I could quote much more from Mr. McCabe's blog but, instead, I urge members of the Government to read it for themselves.  I urge them to listen to the voices of those affected by the Government's broken housing policies.  For many people, there is no bank of mam and dad.  There is no reprieve from extortionate rents to enable them to save a deposit and get a secure home.  There are no options to stay in their neighbourhoods or community settings, where they have support networks.  For too many people, there is little or no choice when it comes to housing.<br/><br/>Mary Coogan, a 41-year-old single woman from Wicklow has been very vocal on the difficulties she has experienced in finding a home.  Mary has a good job with above average wages but she is buying alone and is finding it impossible to afford anywhere in Dublin.  She has appeared on &quot;Claire Byrne Live&quot; and other media outlets to highlight the accessibility issues for single purchasers.  On her blog, Mary writes:</p><blockquote>	Facing into a future of never having a secure home, no matter how early you get up in the morning, is grinding down tens of thousands of people in this country.  It is heartbreaking.  The housing system that successive governments have created &ndash; the refusal to tackle fundamental issues like security of tenure and rent certainty, the slavish commitment to private investors, and above all, the ideology that treats housing as a source of profit rather than as a home &ndash; is ruining people's lives.  It is fracturing our communities, wrecking our mental health, stifling creativity and innovation and forcing yet another generation to feel that their best option is emigration.  It is robbing children of their childhoods and robbing parents of the ability to protect their children. </blockquote> <p>Turning to the Bill, a number of issues struck me when I read the explanatory memorandum.  The first was the statement that &quot;the current schemes of priority (adopted by housing authorities in 2018) will cease to have effect on the coming into effect of section 11.&quot;  That is grand but how transparent will this process be?  Will people who were not housed prior to the enactment of these provisions lose their place or priority on housing lists?  There are people, including families, who have been languishing on lists for ten or 15 years.  Will they be kicked to the back of the queue?<br/><br/>The second point I noted was that applicants would be given priority &quot;on the basis of having lived some length of time in the housing authority area&quot;.  What about people fleeing domestic violence?  What about applicants who are in recovery from addiction and need to be away from their previous circles?  Will priority be given to people who are leaving direct provision or coming out of State care?  We have seen the problems that arise from the DRHE's local connection criterion for providing emergency accommodation.  The Government denied there was a problem in that regard but it was clear it was happening.<br/><br/>The third point that struck me was the explanation relating to the provisions under section 34, entitled &quot;Setting and review of rent in cost rental tenancy&quot;.  The first paragraph explains that the rent calculations will &quot;take account of any increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices&quot; and that the rents calculated in this way &quot;are upper limits, giving landlords the option to charge lower rents as circumstances allow&quot;.<br/><br/>The other essential reading when examining this Bill is the briefing paper by the always excellent Oireachtas Library and Research Service.  This paper by Dr. Sin&eacute;ad Ashe, Shane Burke, and Hari Gupta, published at the end of April this year, is entitled Proposals for Affordable Housing.  The subtitle is &quot;Briefing paper to support consideration of the proposed legislation&quot;.  Did the Minister take on board any of the key issues highlighted in that paper?  It makes for stark reading and offers astute analysis and important points for consideration.<br/><br/>In regard to cost-rental housing, the Minister has said that the provisions in the Bill are targeted at those with &quot;moderate incomes&quot;, but what that means is not defined.  Given that he seems to think &euro;450,000 is affordable for a house in Dublin, I dread to think what rents he imagines people on moderate incomes should be able to pay.  The pilot scheme in Stepaside in Dublin, for instance, has rents set at &euro;1,200 per month, which is ridiculously high.  The ESRI has said that the Minister's shared equity scheme will probably push up prices.  The Central Bank has come out against his proposals.  Neither of these bodies could be called a radical left-wing think tank.<br/><br/>For whom is the Minister introducing these schemes?  Are they, once again, for the benefit of private developers and landlords?  The Central Bank has said that an average of 34,000 dwellings must be built per year.  The T&aacute;naiste - I will call him Comrade Varadkar - promised at his party's Ard-Fheis that 40,000 houses would be built.  In fact, there were fewer homes built in 2020, when 20,676 were constructed, than in 2019.  The Covid-19 impact is likely to be drastic for construction this year and next.  There is much more I would like to say on this issue but I am running out of time.  I will just note that in 2020, the 16th annual Demographia International Housing Affordability Survey placed Dublin and Galway in the category of &quot;seriously unaffordable&quot;.<br/><br/>At the pre-budget 2022 online meeting of the Oireachtas Disability Group last week, we were informed about the housing crisis for disabled people.  Why does the Government not insist on universal design standards for buildings?  Most disabled people acquire disabilities in later life and need adaptations to their homes.  We cannot account for every eventuality in our designs, but why do we allow developers to cut corners and minimise living space or light in an effort to fit as many units onto a site as possible, instead of ensuring buildings are designed and built to a high, inclusive and universal standard?  The Oireachtas Disability Group is asking for a commitment that 7.5% of new builds will be accessible.  This is a drastic under-ask but it has decided to go with the evidence-based approach.<br/><br/>Finally, I want to refer to my submission to the Minister on the housing for all policy, in which I listed proposals that would make a huge difference to the housing crisis.  I noted of the significant funding available for housing, the majority of it is being misdirected, misspent and is far too focused on lining the pockets of private landlords.  I called for a referendum on economic, social and cultural constitutional rights.  I asked that the maximum income limit for the housing list be removed, thus giving a realistic picture of the numbers in need of housing.  I called for vacant homes to be subject to immediate compulsory purchase order and made available to people on waiting lists and first-time buyers.  I proposed that all unoccupied apartment buildings be commandeered to provide immediate housing as an emergency measure.  I urged that NAMA release all residential units to local authorities immediately for the provision of social and affordable housing.  I argued that affordability should be set to enable those on the minimum wage to buy a home.  I proposed that Central Bank lending rules should be changed such that an applicant's ability to pay would take account of years of rental payments.  I suggested that house values be set by an independent commission and that there be greater regulation of estate agents.  Finally, I argued that vendors should be instructed to undertake a structural survey prior to the home going on the market, as is the case in Toronto and Ontario, where the home inspections are then provided to interested buyers prior to their making an offer.  This means they know how much work is needed and that can speed up the process.</p></speech>

There have been wonderful words about affordable housing and cost-rental housing and all that type of language.  I have read about the subject and listened to what was said today and I can only repeat that it is like swimming in mud trying to understood all of it.  Then I stood back and wondered why that should be the case when this Bill is being described as transformative legislation.</p> <p>I am looking and what is missing here is a failure to recognise that this Government and previous Governments have treated housing and homes as commodities.  It would be bad enough if that was all that they did but their policies actively encouraged the treatment of housing or a home as a commodity.<br/><br/>From 2009 construction stopped in Galway.  I do not wish to be parochial but it needs to be put in context.  Why did it stop?  Ostensibly it stopped because of the financial crisis, but it never resumed.  Not alone did it stop and was not resumed but parallel to that we introduced different schemes that actively ensured the private market would be kept floating when it was in trouble and when prices should have continued to tumble.  We set up the housing assistance payment and told those on the waiting list it was the only game in town.  We took them off the waiting list and put them into private houses with absolutely no security of tenure.  We added to that repeatedly with various schemes.  The figure of more than &euro;3 billion has been boasted about as the highest amount of money ever to go into housing when almost half of that is going into the private landlord sector.  Again, just to pre-empt any comments, I believe we need private landlords.  They are absolutely part of the solution to the housing crisis but the other major part is the role of the State in stepping in and giving a strong message that we believe a home is absolutely the most basic ingredient of a civilised society.  Without a home, without security of tenure, a person can say goodbye to taking part in a democracy.  We, as a country, through our Governments, have completely and repeatedly undermined that.<br/><br/>I will take a little look at Galway, very quickly.  The <i>daft.ie</i>quarter 1 2021 rental report showed the average monthly rental price in Galway was &euro;1,400.  I know for a fact it is much higher than that; it is &euro;2,000 for a three-bedroom house in the area where I live.  There was a rise of 6.7% in Galway in that first quarter.  The prices for the year show the increase was 11.9%.  We will go back to HAP, which I mention repeatedly.  The Simon Community does a snapshot report every quarter called Locked Out of the Market.  There were two properties in Galway city and two properties in the suburbs that were within the standard discretionary HAP limits.  The House should remember we are giving out &euro;1.4 billion, which I am told is the cumulative figure, and it is rising.  HAP is the only game in town and there are two properties available under it.<br/><br/>Where do I go with this legislation, which I have read, and the explanatory memorandum, which I have read too, and also the digest?  The digest was produced back in April and my note tells me the Oireachtas Library and Research Service was unable to provide a full digest on the final legislation due to the short time of two working days between publication of the Bill and the scheduled Second Stage debate in the Seanad.  I thank the service for its briefing.  My colleague, Deputy Pringle, has already referred to it.  It is an excellent document and highlights 15 issues going back to when the heads of the Bill were published.  Not one of those issues has been addressed satisfactorily, to my knowledge.  I almost want to give up in relation to this because we get tied up with words and propaganda and lose the trend and the thread of what has happened here.<br/><br/>We must go back and declare a &quot;housing crisis&quot;, a term which I see the Minister is finally using in his speech.  I was elected for the first time in February 2016 and am acutely conscious of the privilege.  Before that my colleagues, Deputy Pringle, former Deputy, Clare Daly, and so on fought bravely and continue to do so to say we have a housing crisis.  Why do we have crisis?  It is because we need to change Government policy.  How do we change Government policy?  We do so by pushing and pushing each Government to do that.  Thus we finally have a recognition here by the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, that we have a crisis.  He talked about it at the beginning and the end of his speech and in between he forgets to tell us it was caused by the Government and the previous Government.  He fails to explain why he has not complied with the programme for Government, which commits to holding a referendum.  He fails to explain that in a reply this morning he told us it was now going to a commission to review that commitment to put it into the Constitution.  By the time we enshrine it in the Constitution we will have no public land left because this Bill, along with the Land Development Agency Bill, is planning to use the one asset we have, our public land, which is an integral part of the solution.  Instead of that we are giving the thumbs-up to the Land Development Agency which is being set up under statute now but which has failed to do the job it was set up to do, namely, to do an audit of all public land and give us a report.  It has not done that and now we are backing that up with an Affordable Housing Bill that is going to have housing that is anything but affordable.  Why is that?  It is because the Government is still taking its mark from the market and not from what people earn in this country and what the cost of a house is.  I am looking at the digest and from that I see the Central Statistics Office states the median average earnings are &euro;36,000.  I repeat, the median figure is &euro;36,000.  We should then look at the cost of the house and ask how we build houses and provide houses for our people that allow a person in that earnings bracket to either rent a house or to buy one.  How do we do that?  We do it by being honest and by changing Government policy.<br/><br/>There is an inbuilt snobbery in all the policy coming forward from the Government as it assumes we all want to own a house.  We do not.  We want choices.  We want a choice to buy a house if we can afford it and we want a choice to rent a house for life with security of tenure.  The best way to give a house for life is for the State to build houses.  I used the words &quot;public housing on public land&quot;.  I do not mind if it is cost rental or any of that language.  I do not mind if it is cost rental, where the rent is related only to costs of building the house but not profit and if it is built on public land to remain on public land forever.  There is absolutely no guarantee in any of this that the cost rental will not be sold off in the future.  There is absolutely no guarantee of security of tenure.  The Minister of State is sitting here telling us this is an affordable housing strategy that will transform.  It certainly will do that.  It certainly will transform our public space such that it is not public space any more, not public land.<br/><br/>I am looking at this and wondering, in the minute I have left, what else I can say.  What else can colleagues do to get behind all this propaganda and say a home is an essential unit for everyone whether it is rented for life or purchased?  A home is the most basic thing to have so we can participate and take part in society.  I am so tired of the propaganda and the twisting of language.  That twisting of language has led to there being absolutely no confidence in the democratic system or in the Government.  That for me is the worst thing that has happened.  People are losing respect for the Government and for language and believe we are all the same and that we are all in it for our own gain, and that is not accurate.  There are many good people on this side of the House who have repeatedly stood up and lost votes by standing up saying this is not the way to do it.  I have five seconds left.  I am not going to make a difference at this stage except to place on the record that this is going to make the problem worse rather than better.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-06-24a.443" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1595" speakername="Peter Burke" time="17:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021062400056#GGG00200"><p>I thank all the Deputies for their contributions.  I know the frustrations among many Deputies.  As Deputy Pringle leaves, I note he mentioned Toronto as an example of somewhere we could take ideas from.  Obviously, he has not researched the current state of play in Toronto and the housing crisis that is there.  I point out also that there is absolutely no inbuilt snobbery whatsoever in the way this Government approaches this problem.</p> <p>We are trying to provide solutions.  We are doing our best, day in and day out, to come up with the best possible solutions to try to deliver as many homes as we can for all our citizens while protecting the most vulnerable.  That is key.<br/><br/>We are keenly aware of all the housing affordability challenges facing people across Ireland but it is only by taking measures across all aspects of our housing system, including housing for purchase and rent, whether delivered privately or publicly, that we can we begin to improve affordability for our citizens across the board.  The suite of measures we are proposing and implementing is designed to provide affordable housing for all our citizens.<br/><br/>This Affordable Housing Bill and the Land Development Agency Bill 2021 will work in tandem to give people the opportunity of affordable home ownership and long-term secure rental.  These two landmark Bills are backed up by the largest housing budget in the history of the State and our most ambitious social housing targets on record.<br/><br/>I will now follow up on some specific issues raised during the debate.<br/><br/>Although perhaps attractive, the provision of one single and absolute indicator may not provide the most helpful response to the question of what is affordable<i>.  </i>There is limited academic or international support for an affordability measure that concentrates on averages alone.  This is because different groups can experience very different conditions.  As all Members will be aware, the concept of &quot;affordable&quot; is different according to each household's unique position.  Assessing affordability and the financial constraints on households is not best identified by rules of thumb or asking how much is too much, but rather by asking how much is too much for whom and in what circumstances.<br/><br/>What a number of Deputies do not seem to appreciate or acknowledge is there is no &quot;one size fits all&quot; approach in assessing affordability.  Our proposal will assess and define affordability by household and will accommodate each eligible household&rsquo;s particular family need and financial circumstances.  To this end, I broadly confirm the intention is to provide that a household can apply to purchase a modest family home using the mortgage funding available to it.  If the family cannot afford the home in question at its market value, the equity support being made available can bridge the gap between the mortgage funding and the price of the home.<br/><br/>All Deputies have agreed the development of a cost-rental sector is a welcome intervention.  By this very definition, the rents charged must be structured to cover costs.  The starting rents for cost-rental homes can and will be lowered by public subsidies to support development or acquisition.  Given the high cost of housing, it is right that public land, infrastructure and construction grants and favourable financing terms are used to ensure that rents are not excessive for the target cohort of tenants.  It is important that this Bill provides flexibility for the Minister to set certain eligibility and income parameters via regulations as opposed to placing them in primary legislation.  This flexibility allows us to quickly respond to changes in the housing market.<br/><br/>A number of Deputies raised the point that the Bill does not guarantee that new homes will be subject to cost-rental regulations in perpetuity.  The period of 40 years is an absolute minimum.  If a provider wants to offer cost-rental housing independently, complying with the restrictions without any particular incentive or support, any such commitment to the sector will be welcomed.  However, projects that receive public support will require long-term commitments.  Where our local authorities and the Land Development Agency deliver cost-rental homes, I envisage their committing homes to the sector in perpetuity.<br/><br/>The initial delivery of cost-rental homes will be undertaken by public bodies and housing charities.  The models employed for the first projects are entirely funded by State-backed debt and public subsidies.  However, if we agree that cost rental must be delivered at real scale, there is a necessary limit to what the Exchequer can manage alone.  This is not a peculiarity to our cost-rental proposals but a feature of all mature cost-rental systems.  Limited equity returns may attract non-State investors with a long-term view like pension funds providing for the retirement of workers and investors with an emphasis on environmental, social and corporate governance.  Limits on returns will be informed by the 3.5% to 5% equity return allowed in Austria&rsquo;s limited profit housing associations, which is a good example of a mature cost-rental system.<br/><br/>As I have said, one of our key priorities is the completion and roll-out of the new affordable purchase shared equity scheme.  By assisting in lowering the entry purchase price for households, this scheme will provide an equitable way of assisting people to afford their own home while also building a sustainable model that reflects the State&rsquo;s support for homeowners.  The scheme is a short-term, finance-limited measure that will boost housing supply and get first-time buyers into new homes by bridging the affordability gap faced by many.  It will help bridge the gap between the first-time buyer's maximum mortgage and the price of the new home he or she wants.<br/><br/>Extensive engagement has already been undertaken with key stakeholders to ensure the optimum design of the scheme and significant feedback has been factored in.  I am confident that the final design of the scheme can mitigate any potential inflationary risks.  All homes will be delivered below the Central Statistics Office median price ceilings and in many cases significantly so.  However, I recognise the concerns that have been raised and I confirm the scheme will be kept under evaluation and formally reviewed after one year of operation.<br/><br/>I am happy to confirm our intention to bring forward amendments to the Bill relating to Part V provisions, which will be an important way we encourage the development of more affordable homes.  We will expand Part V to encompass affordable purchase and cost-rental homes in addition to its current important role in providing social homes.  This commitment will not only add to the number of homes available in these areas but it will increase tenure options for people and will assist in providing a good tenure mix within our communities.<br/><br/>We believe that everybody should have access to good quality housing to purchase or rent at an affordable price and in sustainable communities.  The provision of more affordable housing has a profound benefit socially and economically, and the State has a fundamental role in enabling the delivery of new homes and ensuring that best use is made of existing stock.  Everybody in our society should be given the opportunity of home ownership, as has been the case for their parents and grandparents, and these measures support this aim.<br/><br/>I thank all the Deputies for the engagement on this Bill and I look forward to discussing amendments on Committee Stage soon.</p></speech>

Both are equally important and need to be achieved, and both can be achieved provided we all go in the same direction and create opportunities to do what must be done in the shortest time possible.</p>  <p>  I am strongly of the opinion that there is a need to provide renewable energy that is clean, affordable, available and that will continue to serve the community for many years to come.  This is an innovative time, much like it was in the 1920s when the Shannon scheme was introduced, only now there are different demands.  It is important we identify the ways to deal with the reduction in carbon that is necessary.</p>  <p>  There is a variety of ways to deal with this.  One is to say the answer is to bring the agricultural sector to a halt but that is not a real answer.  It is anything but an answer and the entire project will fail if we go about it that way.  However, if we encourage the agrifood sector to incentivise ways and means to provide for carbon reduction in houses, farms and throughout the country, we can have the best of both worlds.  We can ensure an adequate food supply for the future and further the means of carbon sequestration through forestry and the use and growth of hedgerows.  In that context, we should remember that no credit seems to be given at all for the existence of hedgerows and trees in the country, or at least to the extent that it should.</p> <p> We also have much grassland that can be a means towards carbon reduction.  On the other hand, it is of vital importance to note that the baseline for our carbon reduction targets was taken as a particular year.  That does not necessarily address the issue because the agrifood sector here produces food for almost 50 million people.  Ireland is unique in this respect internationally and it is because of the way the agrifood sector here is managed.  This can continue and be improved.  It can continue to ensure that we have a viable and sustainable agrifood sector well into the future.  It must be remembered that when the economic crash came, this was the sector that stood up and delivered.  When everybody thought that all was lost and we were going to starve, the agrifood sector rose to the challenge because it was sustainable, it was local, it was indigenous and it was capable of addressing the debt issues we had to address.</p> <p> The sector is also very anxious to embrace good habits for carbon reduction.  We need to engage with the agrifood sector to be able to talk with them to show them how they can improve their situation, improve carbon reduction and how they can set new targets.  Every improvement is a step in the right direction.  This must be done as a matter of course, but I have no doubt that the Minister of State is committed to this in any event.  We need to reiterate this concept regularly and make sure that we do not fall victim to the international race.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-06-24a.450" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1479" speakername="Ossian Smyth" time="18:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021062400058#JJJ00200"><p>I welcome the Deputy raising this matter.  I agree with his assertion that it is possible to achieve both goals of maintaining a sustainable agrifood sector and achieving very ambitious carbon reductions.</p><p>The programme for Government contains a commitment to an annual average 7% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions to 2030, representing a 51% reduction over the decade.  To meet these ambitions, we must reduce the level of carbon emissions across all sectors of our economy, including in the agrifood sector.  Irish agriculture has a positive international reputation in terms of producing high-quality, sustainable produce.  We need to maintain that reputation.  This will not be possible if emissions from the sector continue to increase.  We also know from the Environmental Protection Agency's State of the Environment report that much needs to be done to protect our water, our air and our biodiversity.</p><p>The Government is committed to finding the balance between environmental, climate and biodiversity needs, and supports for the farming and agrifood industries.  My Department is currently preparing the climate action plan 2021, which will identify the measures necessary to meet the programme for Government commitment in respect of carbon emissions.  In the 2021 climate action plan, far-reaching policy changes will be deployed across every sector, which will set us on the path of systemic change that is required for Ireland to become a climateneutral and climate-resilient society and economy by 2050 at the very latest.</p><p>In the agrifood sector, we need to focus on a number of key areas.  First, we must support and help our farmers to continue to roll out improvements in farming practices, an area in which Ireland is already among the leading countries.  This will make sense fromboth a consumer point of view and from a financial perspective, because higher efficiency often means less cost.  Second, we need to create a policy framework to enable farmers to make choices to avail of new diversification business opportunities in areas like forestry, the bio-economy and organic farming.  In the programme for Government, there is a commitment to allocate &euro;1.5 billion to a REPS 2 programme to encourage and incentivise farmers to farm in a greener and more sustainable way.  It will include incentives to plant native forestry, and to enhance and support biodiversity.  Third, we need to focus on gathering an evidence basis to support policy design in the area of land use.  Ireland is currently a net emitter of emissions from our lands.  We need to reverse that trend and reward farmers for doing so.</p><p>As well as developing the next climate action plan, my Department and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine are evaluating the potential climate contributions from land use improvements, to develop a land-use strategy.  Land use offers significant potential to sequester additional carbon and may provide a new source of family farm income and rural economic benefit.</p><p>With the correct policy choices in the agrifood sector, we can reward farmers for sequestering carbon, restoring biodiversity, producing clean energy and improving water and air quality while remaining profitable and competitive.  This will offer opportunities to innovative enterprises which are sustainable in the long term for Ireland and its workers.  It will also cement our position as a producer of sustainable food produce.</p></speech>

It illustrates the extent to which co-operation between the two objectives can be so helpful to the economy and to the quality of life, air and water throughout the country.</p>  <p>  I thank the Minister of State again, but I would also point out that it might not be a bad idea to engage with the farming community and the agrifood sector on a different basis altogether, to engage with them in order to point out the ways and means by which they can help themselves to achieve the targets required, while at the same time helping the economy and remaining a viable part of that economy, knowing that at some stage in the future they may be called upon again to perform the economic rescue they were able to perform in the past.  I believe that much can be achieved by way of co-operation.  Much can be achieved in the provision of wind energy.  There is nobody who does not accept that wind energy is fairly readily available and ongoing in this country and that it is a clean and viable source of energy.  Not to avail of it would be very foolish.</p>  <p>  I believe that we can do a great deal in this regard.  Many people speculate about the possibility of reducing food production.  It would be very dangerous for a country like Ireland, which produces food for almost 50 million people, to reduce food production.  Let us not forget that there are millions of people on the brink of starvation all over the world.  It is not true to say that we will not need food in the future; we will.</p></speech>

The farmers are the environmental experts.  They have been watching climate change happening before their eyes.  They know better than anyone else what is happening.  They have also seen their incomes under threat.  It is so important.  We cannot achieve these changes unless we give farmers and people who work in the agrifood industry a way out.  They need an alternative and they need new sources of income.  As the Deputy stated, there are sources of income other than food production, for example in energy production with wind and solar, in forestry, and in preserving biodiversity.  Farmers need those supports.  They need the Government and the State to come in behind them to help them.  We cannot ask people to change without giving them an alternative and maintaining their incomes.</p>  <p>  The Deputy is also absolutely right to point to the agrifood sector as the one pillar of the economy that managed to sustain throughout the last economic crisis, and that food security is vital.  There is no alternative to producing our own food.  We absolutely must have our own food supply.  Farmers play a vital role in society, and this must be respected.  Their voices must be listened to in order that we do not produce top-down policies in Dublin and then try to impose them onto farmers.  It will involve deep consultation, proper listening, and trying to find ways to create those new income sources to replace the income sources that will change as a result of a major change in the agricultural industry.  I am sure that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine will step up to the plate and will be deeply involved in this process as the new carbon budget is developed this autumn following the passage of the climate action Bill.</p></speech>

We have the N24 that, despite being in very poor condition, links the east coast with Limerick and has a link to the M8.  We have a rail line with a similar route, that also links with Cork, Limerick and the capital.  Unfortunately, the potential offered by these routes has been abandoned and ignored.  The Minister of State will be only too aware that the impact of this abandonment of regional infrastructure on communities in the region has been immense.  The Minister of State will have heard on numerous occasions, and I make no apology for pressing the issue with him once again, about the impact this had on communities such as Tipperary town.</p> <p>In this day and age it is baffling to see a road with the strategic importance of the N24 not being used to its full potential.  It is still running through the centre of Tipperary town bringing traffic to a halt and limiting the ability of people and businesses to go about their duties and hampering transport between Limerick and Waterford.  This discussion is timely, as from tomorrow option corridors regarding the N24 Cahir to Limerick Junction project will go live, while the constraints element of the N24 Cahir to Waterford project recently ended.  While this is some progress, I appeal to the Minister of State to see the sense in making full use of the potential of the N24.  It would be a cheaper alternative to the M20 and M25 motorways.</p> <p> As the Minister of State is aware, the Cork Limerick Alliance Group has advocated the development of a motorway from Limerick to Waterford with a link to the M8 junction at Cahir to Cork.  This would make obvious sense to link east to west and Limerick to Cork and would improve connectivity to Galway, not to mention the cost savings involved.  The proposal would use the existing infrastructure of the N24 and the underused M8 motorway, incorporate the Limerick Junction to Cahir proposal and would be linked by the Tipperary town bypass.</p> <p> On numerous occasions, the Minister of State has said to me that if every infrastructure proposal was acted upon there would be no money left for anything else.  This is why I ask him to give serious consideration to the proposals to utilise the upgrade link between Limerick and Cahir and make full use of the existing infrastructure, namely, the N24 and the M8.  It is another reason the speedy approval of a bypass for Tipperary town makes sense, not just for the people living and working in the town but also in terms of regional connectivity and how the bypass would link together the projects I am speaking about.  Tipperary, Waterford and Kilkenny county councils have all backed the development of the N24 into a motorway.</p> <p> Figures compiled by the Cork Limerick Alliance Group have shown the alternative ways to connect Waterford, Limerick and Cork by the M20 and M25 motorways would cost well over &euro;5 billion, while to do the same with the M24 would cost in the region of &euro;3.2 billion.  To get from Limerick to Cork by the M24 route would be only nine minutes longer than going via the proposed M20.  It would also achieve far more for the Project Ireland 2040 vision.  It would connect key cities and ports and make for a more efficient road system.  Does the Minister of State not see that this makes sense?  I appeal to him to give real consideration to it.  Above all, I want to hammer home the case for the bypass of Tipperary town to be given priority when consideration is given to the phases of the Limerick Junction to Cahir route.</p></speech>

I understand the significance and I acknowledge the importance of these routes to the Deputy's county and to the public he represents.  These routes are under consideration and have not been finalised, and this is the right time to raise these concerns.</p>  <p>  Once funding arrangements have been put in place through the Department of Transport under the Roads Act 1993-2015, the planning, design and construction of individual national roads is a matter for Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, in conjunction with the local authorities.  Overall, TII is responsible for the delivery of the national roads programme in accordance with Project Ireland 2040 and the national development plan, NDP.  In this context, TII provides the Department with regular updates on its delivery of the national roads programme.</p>  <p>  Within the overall context of Project Ireland 2040, the NDP was developed to underpin the successful implementation of the national planning framework, NPF.  This provides the strategic and financial framework for the national roads programme for the period from 2018 to 2027.  The focus of TII's activities is, accordingly, being directed towards the development of the major national road improvement schemes that are included in the NDP along with the maintenance of the existing national road network.</p>  <p>  The programme for Government includes a commitment to bring forward the review of the NDP from 2022 and to use the review to set out an updated NDP for the period out to 2030.  The review of the NDP will be aligned with the NPF and Project Ireland 2040 and work is under way within the Department, in conjunction with TII, to contribute to this review.  I will take this opportunity to highlight that all projects, including those listed in the NDP or any revision to the NDP, require statutory approval and compliance with the public spending code.</p>  <p>  The N24 Limerick to Waterford road improvement project is divided into two sections.  These are the N24 Cahir to Limerick Junction and the N24 Waterford to Cahir.  The N24 is a national primary road connecting Limerick to Waterford, running through Tipperary town, Cahir, Carrick-on-Suir and Clonmel.  The proposed N24 Cahir to Limerick Junction project would consist of approximately 35 km of road improvement works between Cahir in Tipperary and Limerick Junction.  The study area associated with the proposed project would include bypasses of Tipperary town and Bansha.  The proposed N24 Waterford to Cahir project would consist of approximately 60 km of road improvement works.</p>  <p>  These projects would address a core priority under the NPF, to enhance and upgrade accessibility between urban centres of population and their regions, namely, Limerick and Waterford city.  In addition, the proposed projects would lead to an improvement in efficiency of the N24 route, which could have positive economic and social benefits for Tipperary, stimulating employment, social inclusion and tourism in the area.  The route also forms part of the strategic link between Shannon Foynes Port via the N69 and the ports of Waterford and Rosslare Europort via the N25.</p>  <p>  Through the provision of more reliable and safer journeys, both projects would aim to enhance regional accessibility and improve connectivity between Limerick and Waterford.  The N24 Cahir to Limerick Junction project would also provide the opportunity to provide better connectivity with public transport through direct access to the train stations in Cahir and Limerick Junction, which would encourage the use of public transport in the area.  Improved journey time certainty would act as an enabler to economic growth and urban environment improvements would have positive social benefits for local residents.</p>  <p>  In addition, the proposed N24 Waterford to Cahir project would improve the quality of life of commuters and local residents, through improved journey times and the provision of new cycling and walking facilities.  It is envisaged that the N24 would connect to the Kilkenny greenway, which would run from New Ross to Waterford City.  This would encourage tourism in the region and promote physical activity.</p>  <p>  On the proposed N24 Cahir to Limerick project, technical advisors were appointed by Tipperary County Council, in association with Limerick City and County Council, and they are undertaking early planning and design work.  A public consultation on the project's constraints took place in the first quarter of 2021 informing the options selection stage, with the short-listed transport corridors expected to be unveiled in mid-2021.  Tipperary County Council has advised TII that the scheme will be going to public consultation on 25 June for a six-week period ending on 6 August, 2021.</p>  <p>  On the proposed N24 Waterford to Cahir project, Kilkenny County Council has appointed Arup as technical advisers.  The activities for phase 1, concept and feasibility, are complete, while phase 2, the route options selection, has commenced and a virtual public consultation on constraints took place from 4 May 2021 until 1 June 2021.  It is expected to have the short-listed transport corridors identified in late 2021 and the preferred route identified in the third quarter of 2022.</p>  <p>  The N20 is a national primary road connecting the cities of Cork and Limerick.  As a critical route in the region, the proposed project consists of the replacement of 80 km of the existing roadway.  The N20 is a strategically important route and the proposed project aims to enhance regional accessibility by improving the network connecting the cities of Cork and Limerick, allowing for balanced regional growth.  The NDP sets out that the N20-M20 Cork to Limerick project would provide better connectivity between Ireland's second and third largest cities, by improving the quality of the transport network, which will address safety issues associated with the existing N20 route and provide for safer and more efficient journey times.  Increased capacity and more reliable journey times provided by the project would provide express intercity bus services the opportunity to use the network, which would promote road-based public transport in the region and lead to positive environmental impacts.</p></speech>

The M20 plans as they are would create a bottleneck in Blackpool for example.  There is also the fact the M24 route would adhere to the route now known as the N24 whereas the M20 would not, and would have to run off-line into greenfield sites.  Surely the Government would recognise this is the least attractive option in terms of the ecological impact.</p>  <p>  There are towns that will need their own bypasses but I know the Minister of State has been an advocate of smaller bypasses to free up towns, and the cost savings involved in the alternative to the M20 would resolve the costs.  The Minister of State must also take rail into account.  The Limerick Junction to Waterford service suits no one.  The Ballybrophy line has untapped potential to link vast swathes of the country if properly used.  The Minister of State knows that money is one thing but using existing infrastructure in a manner that services local communities can save a lot of financial headaches.</p>  <p>  Communities living along the N24, particularly Tipperary town, must have real and immediate attention when it comes to the traffic chaos they face every day.  It is 40 years since Tipperary town was first promised a bypass and it has been repeatedly pushed back.  It is totally unfair on such a town that it has so much heavy traffic.  The Minister of State knows what it is like.  He is aware of how the town has been done a huge disservice through a malfunctioning N24 and poorly utilised railway service.  I urge the Minister of State to do whatever he can within his capabilities to prioritise the Tipperary town bypass and free the town from the stranglehold of the N24.  Tomorrow, there will be a meeting on the preferred routes and later in the year the actual route will be selected.  There is still no guarantee it will go into the national transport plan.</p> <p>The first priority is to make sure that is part of the national transport plan.  There is no point in choosing a route and then saying in 40 years' time that it was never put on the national plan.  I urge the Minister of State and Government to put the N24 at the top of their list.  It is one of the areas between Limerick and Waterford that is a bottleneck.</p></speech>

He will know the area better than I do.  I take his point that there is a serious bottleneck and that Tipperary town needs a bypass.  A bypass can, of course, be transformative.  I know the Minister, Deputy Ryan, is keen to provide towns with that relief so that they do not have trucks and cars trundling through them and can instead become more vibrant.  The Deputy is right to pursue that.</p>  <p>  I also take the Deputy's points about going into greenfield areas.  That is something to watch.  The national development plan is under review at the moment.  The review will be published this year.  The Deputy said he wants to make sure that the N24 is included.  The main thing is that nothing has been decided yet.  It is not a competition between the M20 and the N24.  Both of those routes are under consultation at the moment.  The public, the Deputy and his constituents will be listened to.  The environmental and traffic congestion problems in Tipperary town have to be acknowledged and addressed.  I thank the Deputy for bringing this matter to the House.</p></speech>

I want to preface what I am going to say by stating categorically that I am not a Catholic, but I am an atheist and I give credit where credit is due.</p>  <p>  Last week the parish council and the parish priest, Fr. Adrian Egan, of Our Lady of the Assumption church in Ballyfermot took a decision to fly the Pride flag, along with the Tricolour, outside of the church as a gesture of inclusivity for our LGBTQ+ community in the area, and for young people in the parish in particular.  Following complaints to the archdiocese and a social media campaign that in many ways was quite foul, the criticisms of the parish priest were too much even for me to bear.  As I said, I give credit to the man and parish council where they deserve it.  I recognise that everyone should be free to express his or her religion.  I defend everybody's right to express their religion, but I also defend their right to express, within that religion, their sexual and personal identity.  For some people, however, that was not enough.</p>  <p>  A rosary style protest was staged last Saturday.  Many of us were at an anti-racism event in town and were not aware of it.  When I spoke to Fr. Adrian Egan, the parish priest, about this, he was quite upset about the pile-on he was getting on social media in response to this.  I read some of it and it was quite shocking.  It was quite shocking to the majority in our community.  Therefore, we got together, under the Ballyfermot Anti-Racism Network, along with many other services, the network of the LGBTQ+ community in the area and young people, in particular, to decide on something very positive which will happen tomorrow night outside the church at the roundabout.  We will join together to celebrate Pride and send a message that this is a community that celebrates diversity and not division. </p>  <p>  This will be a big event.  It will be supported by loads of people, even if they cannot make it.  We want it to be socially distanced and for people to wear masks, but we want to be a celebration that will send a message to our young people, in particular, that they are included and welcome.  In this current period of the 21st century this is hugely important.  There was a discussion earlier about Viktor Orb&aacute;n and the oppression of the LGBT community in Hungary in light of events around soccer matches.  For us, Hungary has to be the canary in the coal mine for Europe not just in terms of marching against gay people but also the growth of the far right against immigrants and workers.</p>  <p>  It is interesting to note that the cover that is often given, as the Minister knows only too well, is that gay people are somehow dangerous to children.  It is also interesting to note that those who make that foul and despicable claim cannot stand over it.  They used a noose outside the D&aacute;il when a Bill on children's issues and the appointment of the Minister were being discussed.  That behaviour says that they want to identify paedophiles with gay people but at the same time want to return to the dark days of the control of the Catholic Church where none of them blew the whistle on the abuse that happened at an institutional level over decades in this country. </p>  <p>  This is something positive to celebrate in Ballyfermot.  Pride is happening everywhere on Saturday.  We are holding the event tomorrow evening and want to send out a very strong message of solidarity to all LGBTQ+ people, in particular young people who, during and post Covid, are struggling with mental health issues, their identity and where their future lies.  I hope this sends a positive message across the gay community.</p></speech>

We can step back for a moment and remember what the Pride flag symbolises and why Pride celebrations are so important, in terms of promoting the self-affirmation, dignity, equality and increased visibility of all members of the LGBTI+ community in Ireland and beyond.  It is those themes that the Government seeks to implement in the national LGBTI+ inclusion strategy and the national LGBTI+ youth strategy.  The aim of those strategies is to target discrimination, promote inclusion and improve quality of life and well-being of LGBTI+ people in Ireland, in particular LGBTI+ young people.</p>  <p>  Regarding the incident in Ballyfermot, the Deputy has the best insight but I understand Fr. Egan decided to fly the Pride flag last week with a particular recognition that members of his congregation were LGBTI+ themselves or had family members who felt left out and excluded by the dogma that comes from the Catholic Church.  He wanted to indicate that they would be welcome in this week of all week and that his church and their community church would be a welcoming place for them.  His motives in doing that were entirely positive and consistent with the idea of full inclusivity and equality for the LGBTI+ community in our country.  I would like to join with Deputy Smith in expressing thanks and support to Fr. Egan and the wider community in Ballyfermot who I know fully support the flying of the Pride flag.  Like Deputy Smith, I say that as an atheist.  It is important to recognise where somebody goes against the grain within his organisation in such a prominent way.  </p>  <p>  The work of community groups is important in terms of promoting visibility and making LGBTI+ people feel included and valued in their own area, and I particularly welcome that since the removal of the flag.  I want to recognise the work that Ballyfermot Anti-Racism Network and youth services are doing to support Fr. Egan and, in particular, the wider LGBTI+ community in a situation where that symbol of inclusivity has been taken down in such an important week.</p>  <p>  Deputy Smith reflected on the other ugly incidents that have happened during Pride month, such as the graffiti outside PantiBar and the burning of flags and the erection of posters in Waterford.  I had the opportunity to visit Waterford on Monday and to speak with members of the Pride committee, in particular young members.  Pride of the D&eacute;ise is only two years old.  Its member were getting into their stride.  It was a shock to them to see such a public attack on the community.  I also want to recognise the mayor and city and county councils and, most importantly, the entire city.  If a small minority thought it was making some blow against LGBTI+ rights right in this country, they got their answer from the city of Waterford.  That was a unanimous and clear answer because Waterford was bedecked in Pride flags.  It was a great honour to be there to erect two more flags, but Waterford gave its answer to the small bigoted minority.</p></speech>

I am concerned about young people in our area.  As a member of the Ballyfermot Anti-Racism Network, I have had long conversations with Fr. Adrian Egan.  I commend him on sticking his neck out and speaking.  The church has its own debates.  Those are its business and I am not trying to interfere in them.</p><p>On a given night in Ballyfermot in 2015, up to 200 people were canvassing estates, knocking on doors and asking people to think about their children, grandchildren, nieces and nephews.  We were pushing against an open door, and the results showed that.  In one ballot box from Cherry Orchard, more than 90% of people voted to recognise same-sex marriage.  In another box from Ballyfermot's main street, the figure was approximately 85%.  Overall, my constituency of Dublin South-Central voted for same-sex marriage by a staggering 72.3% .</p><p>I say this because it is the canary in the coal mine when we see people starting to attack gay rights.  Prime Minister Viktor Orb&aacute;n did not start by attacking the gay community.  He started with immigrants before moving on to attacking workers by forcing them to work as much as 400 hours in overtime per month and wait up to three years for payment.  He was not without opposition then, just as he is not without opposition now as regards the laws he is introducing against gay people, but we cannot afford to go down that road in this country.</p><p>When I read about these incidents and try to confront the rhetoric of the far right, something that sticks in my mind is a poem written in 1946 after the war by another priest, Pastor Martin Niem&ouml;ller, survivor of the concentration camps:</p> <blockquote> 	First they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out&mdash;<br /><br />Because I was not a socialist. <br /><br />Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out&mdash;<br /><br />Because I was not a trade unionist. <br /><br />Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out&mdash;<br /><br />Because I was not a Jew. <br /><br />Then they came for me&mdash;and there was no one left to speak for me. </blockquote>  <p>I am not being rhetorical in using these words.  They are important and should be in all our hearts, particularly during Pride week.</p></speech>

The Deputy highlighted Hungary, but we saw a similar situation in Poland last year and earlier this year in terms of the so-called LGBTI+-free zones.  That was condemned by the Government and across the Oireachtas.  I met the Polish ambassador this year to convey the Government's concern about what was happening and to tell her about the approach we had taken in seeking to be as inclusive and supportive of our LGBTI+ community as possible, in particular our young people.  I spoke about how difficult it must be to be a young LGBTI+ person in Poland and hear prominent members of political parties using some of the most awful language about the LGBTI+ community.  Similar is occurring in Hungary.</p>  <p>  The Deputy made the correct analogy about the dog whistle used by the far right against members of the LGBTI+ community linking paedophilia with homosexuality.  To think that it has been legislated for in a European country.  It must be scary to be an LGBTI+ person in Hungary right now and to see in one's own lifetime one's rights being eroded.  I am lucky to have grown up in this country where, throughout my life, I have seen my rights as a gay man progress.  Many among the LGBTI+ have seen that, too.  It is not finished yet and there is much more to do, as there is in many other aspects of life, but Ireland is generally moving forward in all areas.</p>  <p>  I have called these homophobic laws out for what they are.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, has spoken out strongly at the European Council.  The Government will continue doing so.  I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue.  I wish her, her community in Ballyfermot and everyone in the Oireachtas a happy Pride.</p></speech>

As he will probably be aware, Cavan Institute provided a virtual tour of its impressive college in recent months.  None of himself, the Minister, Deputy Harris, or their Department need to be convinced of the legitimacy of the argument for a new building.  However, it has been on the Department of Education's construction list for almost a decade.  Of course, we have seen the fantastic delivery of new schools across the Cavan-Monaghan constituency by the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley.  I am thinking of the Holy Family School in Cootehill, which she visited last week to see the brand new &euro;12 million investment there, and the recent doubling in capacity at Bailieborough Community School as well as Virginia College.  Last week, she announced the doubling in size of Col&aacute;iste D&uacute;n an R&iacute; in Kingscourt.</p>  <p>  The same commitment to a new building for Cavan Institute is now required.  If our secondary schools are doubling in capacity, Cavan Institute must be in a position to respond to that need for further education.  There are demands, but as the Minister of State can imagine, the doubling in size of our secondary schools will require a tenfold increase at Cavan Institute if it is to respond to the number of students passing through them.</p>  <p>  Cavan Institute was established in 1985 and has grown to become one of the largest post leaving certificate, PLC, colleges in the country.  It is important to recognise that Cavan Institute provides further education not just for Cavan and Monaghan, but the entire Border region.  A new building was built in 2006 to increase capacity to 420 students.  As the students moved into it that year, though, the institute's number of enrolments was at 700.  The need to increase the size of the new building could be seen.  Since then, Cavan Institute has been leasing multiple premises across Cavan town to deliver 70 full-time and part-time courses because it had outgrown its new building even before it moved in.</p>  <p>  This is a critical time.  Leases are expiring and commitments are required from the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science to renew the leases, but I believe that the Department must make a leap of faith and commit to a new building.  We do not want to see Cavan Institute and Cavan and Monaghan Education and Training Board, CMETB, signing up to leases for the next ten or 15 years when what they need is a new building.  Some of the buildings that Cavan Institute has had to lease for teaching and learning are in a poor state of repair and not fit for purpose in these modern times.</p>  <p>  In 2014 and 2015, Cavan Institute was approved for inclusion on the Department of Education's new buildings list and it was the intention to deliver a new building.  I hope that the Minister of State can give us some idea of the timeframe for that.  It has been on the buildings list for almost a decade.  It has far outgrown its current infrastructure.  The college was built for 420 students.  Today, it has an enrolment of more than 1,100 students.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the Deputy's strong advocacy for and championing of the cause of Cavan Institute and the region.  She has raised this matter a number of times in the D&aacute;il and directly with my Department, the Minister, Deputy Harris, and me.</p>  <p>  Cavan Institute was established in 1985 and has provided high-quality education and service to the people of Cavan and beyond ever since.  Under the management of CMETB, the institute has played a cental part in developments in further education through innovative course development and top class industry-standard facilities.</p>  <p>The institute offers courses in business, humanities, creative practices, computing, engineering, healthcare, sport, physical therapies, beauty therapy, hairdressing and science.  The institute was initially set up in Main Street, Cavan, and was formerly known as Cavan College of Further Studies.  Cavan Institute now has multiple rented locations across Cavan town, as Deputy Smyth just outlined.  There are issues in relation to some of those leases expiring.</p> <p> In March 2012, Cavan and Monaghan ETB acquired the former D&uacute;n U&iacute; N&eacute;ill Army Barracks, which is an 18-acre site, with a view to refurbishment and adaptations of the site and buildings to create a new further education and training campus.  Development of the barracks site will provide an opportunity to centralise further education and training service provision, create opportunities for expansion and eliminate the need for various rented temporary accommodations around Cavan town.</p> <p> Cavan and Monaghan ETB has secured funding to progress the development of a new further education and training centre of excellence in supply chain logistics and procurement, supporting business transformation and workforce skills being developed in Cavan in support of the north-east region and nationally.  The project is part of a &euro;3 million investment for local projects under the Border enterprise development fund, an economic stimulus package established for the border region, and additional funding from SOLAS and my Department.  The new training centre will be located at the Cavan and Monaghan ETB further education and training campus.  The project is a direct response to current industry requirements and emerging skills needs in the region, with a vision to positively impact on the region's competitiveness, job security and employment growth.</p> <p> A capital investment programme in the further education and training sector is also being rolled out.  Among the priorities being addressed are funding for infrastructure and equipment to support reskilling and upskilling needs.  Cavan and Monaghan ETB has requested capital investment to relocate its further education and training operations from Main Street and Cootehill Road to the barracks site and also for the creation of the supply chain, logistics and procurement centre of excellence, both by means of modular units.  SOLAS recommendations for capital funding in respect of each project are under active consideration in the Department with a response to issue at the very earliest opportunity.</p> <p> The Department and I are very conscious of the urgency, for which the Deputy has made the case succinctly today.  I thank her for again raising the matter and for her advocacy for the project.  I advise her the Department is concerned to ensure the accommodation needs for further education and training provision in Cavan are addressed. </p></speech>

I have to make the comment and observation that modular units are a temporary measure.  We can all acknowledge that.  They just will not cut it in leaving Cavan Institute on a building list any longer.  The modular units will house music, beauty therapy, make-up artistry, science, information technology, IT, sports, leisure, sports therapy programmes and many of the practical subjects.  Urgency for a permanent building is what is required here.  The 2006 building was built for a capacity of 420 students; Cavan Institute is now at 1,100 and growing year-on-year.</p>  <p>  I have to acknowledge the principal of Cavan Institute, Ann Marie Lacey, who, in her distinguished principalship, has been a huge driving force for her students, staff and the parents of students who attend the college.  We see terrific work currently under way by John Kearney, the chief executive of Cavan Institute, in the delivery of ETB schools right across the county and constituency.  He needs this exact type of investment and commitment to be able to deliver what is needed for Cavan Institute.</p>  <p>  Will the Minister of State commit to visiting Cavan Institute?  I am a big believer in "seeing is believing" and while it is wonderful we have that 18-acre site at the Army barracks, we need to develop it into a top-class facility, which is nothing less than Cavan Institute, and its staff and students, deserve.  The staff are providing wraparound services for student support and that, again, is a disjointed operation in the sense they are in different buildings around the town.  That cannot continue.  It can only be imagined how that college could flourish if it had the right infrastructure.  I ask the Minister of State to commit to visiting Cavan Institute and to examine the issue of any further modular buildings because they will just not cut it.  Cavan Institute needs its new building.</p></speech>

The development of the barracks site for Cavan Institute will enable delivery of a range of post-leaving certificate, PLC, programmes, including, but not limited to, music production, science, beauty, sports, animal care, sports therapy and general skills programmes.  The new further education and training centre of excellence in supply chain logistics and procurement will focus on areas such as robotics, 3-D printing, the Internet of things, blockchain technology, big data analytics and drone technology.  A canteen, sports facilities and open office space will also be available on campus to all learners and staff, all of which are required in modern society to enable modern industry.</p>  <p>  SOLAS had originally approved the modular units, which the Deputy mentioned, in 2019.  The Cavan and Monaghan ETB has been working towards its development since then.  Unfortunately, Covid-19 and the associated construction restrictions, coupled with the global steel shortage, has significantly impacted the delivery of this project.  The current target date for completion is the end of this year, 2021.  I hope that information will be of assistance to the Deputy.  I would be glad to accompany her on a visit to Cavan.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-06-24a.472" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1611" speakername="Jackie Cahill" time="18:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021062400062#NNN00500"><p>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</p>  <p>I am pleased to be allowed to present the Veterinary Practice (Amendment) Bill 2021 to the D&aacute;il.  The urgent need for this amendment to the Veterinary Practice Acts 2005 and 2012 has arisen because the Veterinary Council of Ireland made significant changes to its code of professional conduct regarding the ownership of veterinary practices in 2017.  The Veterinary Council of Ireland appeared before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture and the Marine, on 21 May and 24 September 2019.  Its presentations to the committee on why changes were made to the code of ownership of veterinary practices were very unsatisfactory.</p>  <p>  As a result of these presentations, and following consultations with all stakeholders involved, I deemed it necessary to bring forward this amendment to reinforce the original legislation, which was not specific on the ownership of veterinary practices and without which regulation of veterinary antibiotic and antiparasitic use, and other activities such as TB testing, animal welfare, etc., cannot be regulated.  It is imperative that the legislation is clear.  I stress at this point that if veterinary practitioners do not own practices, it is impossible for the Veterinary Council of Ireland to regulate them.  This is a public health issue.  </p>  <p>  On 14 December 2017, the Veterinary Council of Ireland deleted four sections of the code and one new section was inserted.</p> <p>The amendment Bill brought forward today is focused on that.  That decision was not in the interests of public health.  In cases of lay ownership it is impossible to regulate veterinary practice, which leads to inherent dangers for the consumer.  Lay ownership of practices has clearly been shown in other countries to reduce greatly the availability of 24-hour services.  We have seen that in Derry, where a corporate took over a practice, and in the lack of services in neighbouring Donegal.  It also has been shown to be cost prohibitive and, as a direct result, will have a major impact on animal welfare as animal owners will not be able to afford the cost of what will be charged by corporates for a 24-hour service.  The cost of services for consumers in both urban and rural areas will significantly increase, with a reduced service, as has proven to be the case in many other countries.  Urban practices are more financially attractive than rural ones.  They will be cherry-picked by lay operators, who will make decisions that will not be in the interests of animal welfare for rural or urban consumers.  This will lead to a reduction in services, and increased costs will be the inevitable consequence.</p> <p> A survey in January 2018 showed that 86% of veterinary practitioners were in favour of retaining ownership of veterinary practices.  All these were members of Veterinary Ireland.  Another survey in October 2020 showed that 80% were in favour of only veterinary practitioners being allowed to own veterinary practices.  Some 77% of veterinary practitioners who responded to the survey said lay ownership would be bad for the public.  Lay ownership makes it impossible for the Veterinary Council of Ireland to protect human health and animal welfare.</p> <p> I wish to make a number of points to emphasise that this amendment is essential.  Monopolisation by corporate bodies will lead to a narrowing of competition, an increase in fees and a reduction in credit terms to the public.  Twenty-four service throughout the country will be compromised.  Inefficient, out-of-hours cover in rural areas and significant increases in fees for the provision of services will have a direct impact on animal welfare.  The experience of the UK corporate model suggests the discontinuation of large animal veterinary services on a 24-hour basis.  Cherry-picking of profitable services and clients, with a significant emphasis on urban areas with a large number of small animal practices where they have the ability to increase the profit margin significantly, and discontinuation of voluntary work in agricultural shows, point-to-points and the care of injured wildlife will all be consequences of corporate ownership of practices.  There will also be the discontinuation of participation on a voluntary basis on State bodies and committees.</p> <p> Veterinary practitioners employed by corporate bodies will be constrained to use only drugs and services of virtually integrated corporate groups that own pharmaceutical companies, laboratories, referral hospitals and crematoria, which will compromise their professional discretion.  They will be required to work to protocols established by corporate bodies to maximise returns.  Investigation and treatment regimes will be dictated by management to maximise profits.  This will compromise ethical standards.  Corporate entities will be driven by the need to return profits to their investors.  It will lead to a deprofessionalisation of the profession.  The future generations of veterinary practitioners will have limited opportunities.  At present, large animal practices are having great difficulty attracting newly graduated veterinary practitioners, and if the opportunity to purchase practices is denied to these young practitioners, this will become even harder.  Newly graduated veterinary practitioners would see entering large animal practice as an unviable financial option.  Without the opportunity to purchase and buy into practices, current and future generations of graduates will choose a different career path.  In the long term it will result in a lack of professional motivation and, therefore, a fall in professional performance.</p> <p> We are very fortunate to have excellent veterinary services in our urban and rural areas at a reasonable cost to the consumer, with the highest ethical standards prevailing.  The Veterinary Practice (Amendment) Bill 2021 will ensure public health and animal welfare remain priorities and veterinary practices can be enforced and regulated.  This amendment will be attractive to young, newly graduated veterinary practitioners, as they will see career progression for themselves in both large and small animal practices.  This is essential to attract young veterinary practitioners into this part of the industry.  Most importantly, the Veterinary Council of Ireland will be able to regulate veterinary practices successfully, which will ensure public health and animal welfare standards are protected and maintained.  This is my reason for bringing forward this amendment.  I believe it is essential to ensure the high ethical standards of our veterinary practices are maintained and protected.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-06-24a.474" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (Senator Pippa Hackett)" time="18:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021062400063#OOO00200"><p>I thank Deputy Cahill for bringing forward the Veterinary Practice (Amendment) Bill 2021 and for the opportunity to discuss the effective regulation of the practice of veterinary medicine in Ireland.  The roles of the farmer and the vet are the most crucial in all the agrifood sector.  There is a symbiotic relationship built on trust, respect and mutual appreciation.  One cannot function without the other and both appreciate each other.</p>  <p>  However, it is not just at farm level where our vets play such a crucial role.  The highly skilled and trained veterinary practitioners uphold the integrity of our global food network as a food-producing nation that exports 90% of what we produce.  Through certification functions, veterinarians deliver assurances to our international trading partners regarding food safety and authenticity.  Their role will become ever more important in the post-Brexit trading environment.  In working with the farmers of Ireland, they assist in ensuring animal health and welfare standards in the livestock sector are maintained at the highest levels, supporting their farmer clients in optimising animal-based production and thus farm profitability, while mitigating the negative impacts of poor animal health on climate and the environment.  Outside the agrifood sector, veterinary practices around Ireland also provide ongoing support to the pet-owning public.</p>  <p>  The issue of ownership of veterinary practices has arisen in recent years and was examined extensively by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine during the term of the previous Oireachtas.  This followed a clarification by the Veterinary Council of Ireland, VCI, that its remit did not extend to the ownership of veterinary practices.  The VCI is the statutory body under the aegis of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, established under the Veterinary Practice Act 2005, as amended, with responsibility for the regulation and management of the practise of veterinary medicine and veterinary nursing in Ireland in the public interest.  The council is made up of 19 members: nine elected veterinary practitioners, one elected veterinary nurse and nine appointed members.  The appointed members are four nominees of the Minister of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, one of the Minister for Education, two of the National University of Ireland, one of the Director of Consumer Affairs and one of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland.</p>  <p>  The principal function of the VCI is to regulate the practice of veterinary medicine and veterinary nursing in the interests of animal health, animal welfare and veterinary public health.  Some of the main functions of the council include protection of the public through the oversight of veterinary education, the maintenance of the register of veterinary practitioners and nurses, the registration of veterinary premises and disciplinary action in cases of professional misconduct.  The role and remit of the council are to ensure the highest standards of veterinary medicine through the regulation and management of the professions.</p>  <p>  Section 54(2) of the Veterinary Practice Act contains provisions regarding offences relating to the practice of veterinary medicine or use of professional veterinary titles.  This section was the subject of much debate in the recent past, particularly in the area of ownership of veterinary practices.  Ownership of a veterinary practice is not referenced in section 54(2) of the Act.  Consistent with the statutory remit of the VCI, the section refers specifically to the practice of veterinary medicine.  On the matter of ownership of veterinary practices, I am aware this has been a sensitive topic in recent years.  In January 2018, the VCI clarified in its code of professional conduct that the legislation does not speak to the ownership of practices and thus the council has no legal authority in determining the ownership of practices.  In essence, the parameters of the VCI&rsquo;s powers as established under the Veterinary Practice Act 2005 do not extend to the area of ownership of practices.</p>  <p>  Following concerns raised by industry stakeholders, the council engaged in a period of consultation and further analysis.  The issue was extensively assessed in a 2019 Grant Thornton report, commissioned by the VCI, entitled Analysis of the VCI Consultation on the Corporate Ownership of Veterinary Practices.</p> <p>The public consultation for the report undertaken by the council in early 2018 included a survey of the general public; a consultation process whereby any interested parties could submit their views; a survey of the veterinary professions; research and analysis of other veterinary regulators internationally; and research and analysis of other regulated professions in Ireland.  I understand the council also benefited from legal advice on the matter, and all of these inputs, together with the results of the consultation process and survey of the public, were consolidated into this report.</p> <p> Overall, the responses to the introduction of ownership of veterinary practices by corporate entities in Ireland were divided, with some opposed while others favoured the idea.  Responses indicated that stakeholders' perspectives on ownership by corporates or non-veterinary professionals can vary depending on the circumstances.  There were different views on corporate entities depending on whether the corporate might be in the ownership of veterinary practitioners.  Analysis of other professions in Ireland, in addition to veterinary professions in other jurisdictions, is also reflected in the report.  Consultations were held with different jurisdictions globally to understand the issue of corporate ownership.  It was apparent from the consultations that corporate ownership is prevalent internationally, but how it is regulated varies across the jurisdictions.  Most other professions examined do not prohibit corporate ownership.</p> <p> Regarding any perceived deficiencies concerning existing legislation on the matter, the Grant Thornton report explained that there was no requirement to bring greater legal clarity to the issue.  Its view is that the provisions in section 54(2) of the Veterinary Practice Act 2005 do not impact on the matter of ownership directly and that the legislation is broadly consistent with legislation underpinning other regulated professions in Ireland and the veterinary professions in other jurisdictions, in line with the Veterinary Council of Ireland&rsquo;s role.  The Veterinary Council of Ireland code of professional conduct states that veterinary services can only be provided by veterinary practitioners and that they must practise veterinary medicine at and from a registered premises.  Practising standards are to be found in the council&rsquo;s code of professional conduct and the regulations which underpin certificates of suitability which are issued by the Veterinary Council of Ireland in respect of registered premises.</p> <p> For those veterinary practitioners hoping to provide services at and from specific premises, a registered person must apply for and be in possession of a certificate of suitability issued for that premises by the Veterinary Council of Ireland.  A certificate of suitability for the veterinary premises is required before any veterinary service to the public may begin at and from that premises.  The certificate of suitability issued in respect of any premises from which veterinary services are provided may only be held in the name of a registered person, namely, a veterinary practitioner or a veterinary nurse.  It cannot be issued in respect of a corporate body or in the name of any person who is not a registered person.  The regulations relating to that certificate of suitability are a primary means by which the council regulates veterinary services to the public.  The code of professional conduct also provides other means by which the Veterinary Council of Ireland regulates.</p> <p> Veterinary services to the public, the performance of which forms part of the practice of veterinary medicine, must always be provided by the veterinary practitioners who usually practise veterinary medicine at and from the registered veterinary premises.  The clinical discretion of the veterinary practitioner is paramount, acting at all times in the interest of animal health, animal welfare and public health.  The council&rsquo;s clearly stated position is that the practice of veterinary medicine is undertaken by a veterinary practitioner at and from a premises, certified and licensed by the council.  I am open to proposals which can further strengthen the regulatory framework for the practice of veterinary medicines, if and where evidence is presented of particular regulatory challenges where legislative change may be needed.  In that regard, my Department engages in ongoing consultation with the Veterinary Council of Ireland to assess whether any specific amendments are deemed necessary to strengthen the Act.  I am happy to consider any such proposed legislative amendments as they arise.</p> <p> The Veterinary Practice (Amendment) Bill 2021 proposes to amend current legislation such that a veterinary practice can only be owned by a veterinary practitioner.  I understand that the central policy reasons cited for proposing to restrict ownership of veterinary practices to registered veterinary practitioners only are that ownership by non-veterinarians leads to increased prices and a diminution of the services provided to Irish farmers, such as a lack of 24-hour cover, and to protect the provision of large animal veterinary services in rural Ireland.  The availability of veterinary services and ensuring that there is a competitive market are worthy objectives.  The introduction of primary legislation, however, requires careful consideration and scrutiny of all kinds.</p> <p> Ownership of veterinary practices was the subject of a recommendation from the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, in 2008 which is still outstanding.  This Bill may benefit from scrutiny on Committee Stage to determine whether its provisions are consistent with the CCPC recommendation.  The provisions of this Bill seek to restrict ownership of veterinary practices to "eligible veterinary practitioners" only.  It is unclear what impact this would have on existing practices which are not owned by veterinary practitioners and this aspect will need to be considered further.</p> <p> All veterinary practices, regardless of ownership, are commercial concerns that can only continue to provide services to the public if they are economically viable.  This is consistent with other providers of regulated professional services.  While there is an ethical and legal requirement to comply with standards set by relevant regulatory bodies, businesses can only continue providing services if they remain economically viable.  These two conditions of providing regulated services are not mutually exclusive and are, indeed, complementary.  Professional service providers, such as Ireland&rsquo;s highly respected veterinary professionals, recognised as operating to the highest standards are likely to retain and increase their client load.</p> <p> I note the concern that ownership of veterinary practices may be perceived to lead to a diminution of services to the public, such as the requirement to offer 24-7 services.  However, it is a legal obligation of every veterinary practice, regardless of ownership, to provide that 24-7 cover for veterinary services.  This is a condition in the Veterinary Council of Ireland&rsquo;s determinations on whether to approve an application for a certificate of suitability, which I referred to earlier.  Under the Veterinary Practice Act 2005, a certificate of suitability can only be held in the name of a registered person and the certificate holder is accountable to the Veterinary Council of Ireland in this regard.</p> <p> As well as restricting ownership of veterinary practices to veterinary practitioners, the Bill also proposes that a certificate of suitability may only be held by an eligible veterinary practitioner.  An eligible veterinary practitioner is defined as a veterinarian who is registered with the Veterinary Council of Ireland, owns a veterinary practice in whole or in part and seeks to obtain certificates of suitability for veterinary premises from which that practice can deliver the practice of veterinary medicine to the public.  Existing legislation permits a certificate of suitability to be granted to any registered person.  A registered person refers to a veterinary practitioner or veterinary nurse who is registered with the Veterinary Council of Ireland.</p> <p> The continued sufficient availability of veterinary services in rural areas is a concern across many countries in Europe and beyond.  However, the Department sees this as a separate issue which is not related to ownership of veterinary practices.  As an action arising from the national farmed animal health strategy, the Department researched the distribution and accessibility to farmers of large animal veterinary services in rural Ireland.  This analysis suggests large animal veterinary services are available within 20 km of more than 95% of Irish farms.  My Department continues to monitor this position closely to ensure Irish farmers are adequately supported with the provision of veterinary services in the best interests of animal health and welfare.</p> <p> I again thank Deputy Cahill for introducing this Bill and I look forward to listening to the contributions of Deputies.  The key for all of us here is to ensure that our animals, both large and small, are cared for by trained, qualified and committed veterinary officials in the four corners of Ireland.</p></speech>

I commend and thank Deputy Cahill for introducing this Bill to the House.  As a member of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, I express my thanks to Deputy Cahill for his steady chairing of the committee.  We do not always agree on everything, as I am sure the Deputy will acknowledge, but I have found him to be incredibly fair with all members of all political parties.</p>  <p>  This Bill is a good example of Deputy Cahill seeing a potential problem for Irish agriculture and bringing forward a pragmatic proposal to address it.  To my mind, this Bill is introducing nothing new or controversial.  It is simply bringing us back to the position we were in before the Veterinary Council of Ireland revised its guidelines in 2017.  My understanding is that the council revised those guidelines when it came to understand that there was no statutory basis to limiting the ownership of veterinary practices to veterinary practitioners.  The current network of veterinary practices in Ireland has been referred to as the hold-out against the trend of corporate ownership which has developed elsewhere.</p> <p>There is good reason for Ireland to hold out, given that locally owned veterinary practices complement our unique family farm network.  The Minister of State essentially acknowledged that the horse has not bolted yet but indicated, in many respects, that we will wait until it has bolted before doing anything about it.  This legislation is timely and it is apt that we are discussing it now.  There are good practical reasons for seeking to limit the ownership of practices to vets.  </p> <p> We know that internationally, where corporates have acquired local practices, there has been a derogation of the services offered.  In February 2018, an attorney from the legal affairs division of the department of consumer affairs in the state of California issued a lengthy legal opinion stating that corporate ownership had amounted to corporate entities ultimately "practising the licensed profession of veterinary medicine".  She went on to state that the employment agreements contain net revenue percentage incentives to sell the corporation's animal care products that may or may not be in the best interests of the animal and that this creates an environment where veterinarians may believe that their employment is at risk if they are not selling those products.  A 2019 survey of the veterinary profession carried out in Britain heard concerns from many practising vets.  One said that it was a great mistake to allow non-vets to own practices because as soon as they take over, the "prices go sky high".  Another said that the ability of huge corporates to do just as they please will continue to get worse.  There are references to a "commercialised profession" more interested in commercial gain for large conglomerates than in caring for patients and clients.  When corporate ownership was permitted across Britain, the proportion of corporates went from 0% to 10% of all practices between 1999 and 2009.  It had grown to 50% by last year and is forecast to eclipse 70% by next year.  It is quite clear that we need to make sure that this horse does not bolt.</p> <p> These are the same corporate players that are currently just dipping their toes into the Irish water.  We have witnessed what large-scale corporate ownership could mean for rural communities with the experience in the Minister's constituency of Donegal Animal Hospital.  Having been acquired by a corporate, we saw a situation develop which almost resulted in the loss of the 24-hour service in that county.  Fortunately, that situation was resolved but it was local veterinary practitioners who ensured that the service was maintained, not the new corporate entity.  We cannot allow a situation to arise whereby corporate entities can put pressure on local vets to increase margins through either delivering a poorer service to smaller or more peripheral farms, or even through incentivising the sale and use of veterinary medicinal products we are seeking to decrease reliance on.</p> <p> Our farmers practice, and rightly so, the highest standards of animal husbandry anywhere in the world.  We need practitioners in this field to rely on their own expert judgment rather than the interests of a new and separate master whose primary motivation will always be profit.  It is important to note that this Bill is supported by Veterinary Ireland, while the majority of vets oppose corporate ownership entirely.  I encourage all Members to support it, not simply because vets agree with the proposal before the House but because it is quite clearly the right thing to do.  Some aspects of society, and particularly of the corporate world, need to be tightly regulated and this is quite clearly one of them, especially in the context of what could become a global crisis in antimicrobial resistance.  We must ensure that the people at the coalface who are prescribing medicines for animals on farms and for our pets have a long-term interest in the community and in the welfare of those animals.</p> <p> On the issue of veterinary medicinal products, I ask the Minister of State to urgently seek to resolve the impasse between the Department and those in the licensed merchant sector with regard to EU directive 2019/6.  So-called "responsible persons" in the licensed merchant sector and pharmacists are expertly trained to provide services locally that meet the highest standards and the needs of our farming communities.  Many of them watched the hearings of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine and saw the cross-party unanimity on the question of a continuing role for them, particularly in the context of an almost identical regime in the North, and of Britain availing of a derogation that the Irish Government chose not to.  I understand that those people who graduated in September 2019 from a course that cost &euro;995 were addressed by none other than the current Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  I have no doubt that at the time that the Minister spoke to them about how their hard work and study would pay off as they embarked on new careers.  What does he intend to ask them to do with their costly training, which now appears to be pointless?  What will the Department do to rectify that situation?</p> <p> Again, I commend Deputy Cahill on bringing forward this very important legislation.  I encourage and implore the Minister and the Minister of State to approach this constructively and positively.  I look forward to further deliberations on Committee Stage to make sure this Bill is as robust and strong as possible and can withstand any challenges that may present.  The horse has not yet bolted.  We are in a unique situation whereby we know what will happen if this type of legislation is not introduced.  We have seen the consequences elsewhere, across the water, in other parts of Europe and across the globe.  Now is our time to make sure that the bolts are tightened and that we have a veterinary system in this country of which we can all be proud.</p></speech>

He has been a very fair Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, of which I am also a member.  I also welcome the Minister of State to the House.</p>  <p>  The network of Irish family farms has a unique and personal relationship with the country's vets.  Our vets know the farms that they deal with.  They know the history of the livestock, the kind of land they are dealing with and the farmers' needs and demands.  This unique relationship must be protected.  We must ensure that this important relationship, which works for everyone involved, continues unimpeded.  One thing that is certain when it comes to the welfare of our agriculture sector is that nothing can be left to chance.  We have seen that at the aforementioned Oireachtas committee in the context of the demands of our foresters and the situation in which they find themselves.  We have also seen it when it comes to the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, and how seemingly small details like the wording of parts of the good agricultural and environmental conditions can have a huge bearing on the ability of farmers to farm their land.  Of course, we have seen how the setting of ambitious targets without adequate preparation have left those industries reliant on horticultural peat in fear of their livelihoods.  </p>  <p>  In 2017, the VCI analysed its code of conduct and clarified that contrary to previous interpretations, there is no statutory basis for requiring the ownership of veterinary practices to be limited to practising vets.  This has the potential to open the door to corporate ownership, which could have a severe and detrimental impact on animal health and the ability of our farmers to get the help they need when they need it.  Why do we have these fears?  First, there is the corporate mentality that has the habit of putting profit margins ahead of the common good.  Right now, veterinarian-owned practices have a unique relationship and bond with our farmers.  They feel that it is an absolute necessity to ensure that a 24-7 service is available to all farmers and that the same high standards would apply, no matter the size of the farm.  If such decisions were left to corporate-owned practices, then profit margins could dictate who is worth calling to and who is not.  This would have a significant impact on small farmer's livelihoods.  This is not the kind of service that would be good for our farmers, their livestock or the industry as a whole.</p>  <p>  Second, there is the matter of standards.  Right now there are concerns that corporates incentivise the sale of antibiotics.</p> <p>We are in a time when the animal welfare policies in the EU and Ireland are moving in opposite directions.  The EU is trying to ensure that antibiotics are only used where absolutely necessary.  Otherwise, their effectiveness may fall and an animal health crisis will be on our hands.</p> <p> Then there is the issue of oversight.  Individual vets are overseen by the Veterinary Council of Ireland but corporate practices themselves are not.  This could put vets in an uncomfortable situation, being torn between the demands of their employers and those of the regulatory body.  Veterinary Ireland is in favour of practices being owned by vets and a Behaviour &amp;amp; Attitudes poll from March 2019 found that the majority of vets are against corporate ownerships.  This is not without good reason.</p> <p> History shows that once corporate ownership of veterinary practices takes hold, their growth is rapid.  Thankfully, only ten practices in the South are owned by these businesses but in Britain and the North, the rate of corporate ownership went from 0% to 10% between 1999 and 2009, and grew to 50% by 2020.  It has been forecast that this could reach 70% by 2022.  We cannot risk this happening and that is why I am supporting this Bill to prohibit anyone other than a veterinary practitioner from owning a practice.  Our family farmers are under enough pressure.  They do not need any more unexpected challenges coming their way.</p></speech>

As well as bringing this Bill forward, he is Chairman of our committee.  With Deputies Carthy and Martin Browne and the Senators on the committee, we might have disagreements but it is an enjoyable committee to be in, and I have been on three of them.  Deputy Cahill is very constructive.  He raps us on the knuckles when we need it but he is a fair Chairman so I want to compliment him on that.</p>  <p>  The first thing is that we need cattle in the country for all vets to survive.  On the beef exceptional aid measure, BEAM, scheme, the Minister will notice that his Department sent out letters to farmers at different times to tell them how they were getting on.  Farmers and their sons might have joined their herd numbers together and there are farmers that have dealer numbers as well.  They have hammered it all together in May and they have blown a lot of farmers out of it with the BEAM scheme.  I do not know if it was designed that way or what the reason is.  The message went out in January or February that everything was sound and lovely.  When couples could not get married they decided to marry their herd numbers in recent weeks.  This ended up blowing up the BEAM scheme for a lot of farmers who had applied for it so I ask the Minister to look at that.</p>  <p>  Deputy Carthy touched on the licensed merchants.  These people need a solution.  I endorse everything Deputy Carthy has said for the simple reason that they have done their courses.  We can say that nothing is changing and that if one has a piece of paper, one can go anywhere.  That is right and they stayed on but one will look well if one goes to the vet and asks for a prescription before going to Johnny down the road in the co-op.  Farmers will have a puss on them if that happens.  That needs to be looked at.</p>  <p>  On this Bill, one will get a vet quicker than a doctor in this country and that is the reality.  If one has a cow calving at 2 a.m, 3 a.m., 4 a.m. or 5 a.m. on Friday, Saturday, Sunday or any night of the week, within 15 to 20 minutes one will have a vet on the scene.  One could wait three, four or five hours for a doctor.  That service is great, as is the relationship between the vet and the farmer.  The vets around the country who are giving that service must be commended.  Problems have started happening in cities but it has moved to certain counties and we are aware of it because the Minister was on the Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine in the previous D&aacute;il.  We are aware of the problems that have started in other areas.  The Minister of State stated earlier that 24-7 cover is required and that is true but a vet can provide 24-7 cover and tell someone that he or she will be with them in three or four hours because he or she is with Johnny, Paddy and Mary before that.  That still ticks the box that covers the vet.  It does not provide the service that there is now.</p>  <p>  I have a near relation who is a vet.  As a youngster he worked in different countries and he was down in the south of England.  I just happened to be talking to him one weekend when he was on call and they had to cover about 80 or 90 miles.  They were going into the side of London and some of that farmland is not as intensive as it is here.  That showed me that when corporate entities are looking after something or taking over something, money is the bottom line for the likes of them.  We have a seriously good relationship between vets and farmers around the country.  There is a trust in every farmer to ring one's local vet and there is a relationship there.  The vet nearly knows the cattle the farmer has in most situations to be frank about it and he or she knows the type of farmer involved.</p>  <p>  However, when an entity comes in, let us be blunt about the fact that some of them are coming in from other countries that want to take over the different practices here.  There will be the odd vet who will look at the money.  They will ask to be shown the money and they will want to take it but we have to think of more than the vet in this.  We have to think of the farmer, the service and the country.  If one listened to the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, she talked about Ireland.  We export a lot of product and we need vets to certify everything that goes out.  We have a high standard of animal welfare and we need to keep that going because we are competing with other countries.</p>  <p>  We need to make sure that we keep this relationship between the local vet and the local farmer going, because we need to think of animal welfare.  If a cow is calving and she is left for seven or eight hours, what situation would she be in?  At the moment, within 15 minutes one will have a local vet on the scene no matter what hour of the day or night it is, if one has a ewe lambing for example.  This is the service we get throughout the country and we need to appreciate that.  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission is mighty at shoving its nose into some things but when it came to competition in the beef trade, it was not half as fond at looking at the likes of the factories.  It likes to rattle the farmer then, however, and it would nearly leave them with no vets if it could, only big corporate entities in different places.</p>  <p>  We cannot have the west of Ireland or a county with one vet on call at weekends and shut down the rest.  I will mention the likes of County Galway, for example, where I live.  It is as near for me to come to Dublin as it is for me to go to Connemara where Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v is.  One cannot have one vet on call in a county if the corporate entities take over all the practices and that is what is shaping up, whether we like it or not.</p>  <p>  We have seen the first red flag that has been raised and we are lucky that we saw it.  It was in the Minister's county that the first flag was raised of problems arising.  It is good to get a warning and one can learn from a warning or if a mistake is made.  We are legislators and we should let this Bill into the committee.  I am sure Deputy Cahill will bring us through all of it, along with the legal people and everyone, and we will thrash it out.  I ask one thing of the Minister,  I have heard a few bits of stuff here and there about this being a Private Members' Bill.  I will ask the Minister to send it into our committee as soon as possible, because the clock is ticking on what is happening.</p>  <p>  I understand that there are certain practices in cities that are looking at the small animal sector.  I understand there is pretty good money to be had from giving a bit of Ivomec, or whatever they give them, to dogs or cats.  These guys are trying to hone in on that sector and they have diverted people.  If one looks at England as an example, it has gone down the road of getting people to insure the small animals.  This is the new craic that is going on.  People are insuring the dog, donkey, pony and everything.  The vet will come out then and he or she will nearly bring the animal to the operating theatre to do everything with it but the bottom line on it is that the ordinary person is paying.  When one looks at a farmer, he or she could not be insuring every ewe and cow in the place.  We need to do realistic things.  Farmers would not be able to afford the way that these new corporates are bringing people.  Let us not fall into the trap that other countries have fallen into.</p> <p> Let us make sure that we stand up for, and give credit to, the type of service we have got in recent years.  I ask the Minister, the Taoiseach or whoever chooses to push Bills forward or hold them back, to put this Bill into our committee as soon as possible.  That way, we will get the ball rolling.  The clock is ticking.  There have been warnings in Donegal and in cities around the country where things are happening.  We need to make sure we stay ahead of it.  As Deputy Carthy said, we are lucky insofar as we can get ahead of these issues if we take action now through working together in the Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  We will take input from the Minister and anybody else because we are always willing to listen.  We should get working on this Bill as soon as possible, get it through the D&aacute;il and into action to make sure we protect the farmers who rely on vets and the service they give.</p></speech>

I recognise the tremendous commitment he has made and his investigation into, and assessment of, this issue as a member of the previous agricultural committee.  I also recognise the work he has done in drafting this Bill and bringing it forward on Second Stage so that it can proceed to Committee Stage.  I thank everyone who has made a contribution on the Bill.</p>  <p>  As the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, outlined earlier, the relationship between farmer and vet is truly unique.  The vet exists because of the farmer and the farmer exists because of the assistance of the vet.  There are few relationships like it.  A farmer can make a phone call and the vet is likely to be in the yard within 15 or 20 minutes.  It is that speed, that skill and that relationship that ensures that a calf or lamb lives or dies.  I think I speak on behalf of everyone here tonight when I say that this is the key priority for all of us.  We must protect and maintain the world-class service our vets provide to the farmers across Ireland for both large and small animals.  </p>  <p>  Confidence in the ethical provision of veterinary services has never been more important than in today&rsquo;s modern society.  Our expectations of how animals are cared for has never been higher.  Veterinary practitioners and veterinary nurses are central in supporting farmers and the animal-owning public in caring for their animals to the highest standards.  When representing Ireland internationally and in trade discussions with prospective partners, I can always speak with pride of the robust food safety and authenticity systems we have in place.  These are underpinned by veterinary certification procedures that allow Irish food to be marketed as a premium product around the world while supporting the livelihoods of thousands of people in every part of Ireland.</p>  <p>  I am encouraged to note from the VCI that we have never had more vets registered to practice in this jurisdiction than is the case at present.  As of March this year, there were 3,061 vets registered with the VCI.  Over 66% of those were associated with 769 private practices providing services to the public.  The data suggests Ireland is in a good position in terms of the availability of veterinary expertise in serving the public, which should promote healthy competition.</p>  <p>  A concern raised in respect of the Bill relates to the perception that ownership of veterinary practices by non-veterinary practitioners could lead to a loss of competition and, therefore, result in higher prices or a drop-off in services provided.  That is not something anyone here or in the farming community wants or needs to see.  The Minister of State referred to the fact that the Companies Registration Office identifies a significant number of veterinary practices that are now incorporated.  It is fair to surmise that many of these practices are owned by non-veterinary practitioners.  The VCI is the State&rsquo;s independent statutory body responsible for the regulation and management of the practice of veterinary medicine and veterinary nursing within Ireland in the public interest.  In order to offer veterinary services from a practice, it must first have attained a certificate of suitability, COS, granted by the VCI.  The COS can only be granted in the name of a registered person, that is, a veterinary practitioner or a veterinary nurse.  Part of the VCI&rsquo;s conditionality in approving a COS application is that the practice must commit to providing 24-7 emergency service to their clients in compliance with the code of professional conduct.  This requirement is incumbent on all veterinary practices regardless of ownership.  Department officials work closely with the VCI on policy issues and are open to considering additional measures which can further boost the existing regulatory framework for the practice of veterinary medicine in Ireland.  Separately, I note Deputy Cahill&rsquo;s concerns in respect of the provision of large-animal veterinary services in rural Ireland in support of our farmers.  </p>  <p>  As I said at the outset, any farmer in Ireland will tell of the value of their vet and their services which can be called upon often in challenging circumstances in the middle of the night.  Farmers often remark , as Deputy Fitzmaurice mentioned, that it is sometimes easier to get a vet than a doctor at difficult times.  The adequate provision of large-animal veterinary services is something my officials and I will continually assess and it is something to which I am deeply committed.</p>  <p>  Thankfully, analysis to date indicates that rural Ireland is well served with veterinary services which are critical in supporting animal health and welfare.  We must ensure that this network is protected into the future, through whatever means necessary, so that this generation of farmers as well as the next can be safe in the knowledge the vet will be on the other end of the phone at 3 a.m. when they are needed in the farmyard.</p>  <p>  I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  I thank Deputy Cahill for his work in bringing it forward.  I look forward to seeing it progress to Committee Stage when the various issues it raises will be further examined and teased out.  I also look forward to Deputy Cahill's closing remarks.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-06-24a.487" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1611" speakername="Jackie Cahill" time="19:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021062400067#SSS00400"><p>I thank the Minister and the other Members of the House for some of their comments about the work required to bring forward this Bill and the work of the agricultural committee.  There are three other members of the committee here and I enjoy working with them.  We have done a lot in that committee in the past 12 months.</p>  <p>  I will address a few points.  The Minister and the Minister of State made the point that the Companies Registration Office has identified a significant number of veterinary practices that are now incorporated.  That is correct, but the vast majority of them are owned by veterinary practitioners.  Those practices become limited companies for various business reasons.  While a number of practices in this country have been bought by laypersons and corporate interests, the number still is not huge.  We can close this door.  As Deputy Carthy stated, the horse has not bolted yet.  We can still close the stable door before it is too late.</p>  <p>  These companies have come in and are picking rich companies.  They started with equine practices and moved to small-animal practices.  They will move on to large animal practices in strong agricultural areas.  That model has not worked in any other country so how can we expect it to be any different here?  It is a more immediate concern in urban areas.  People who take their pet for a service in a local veterinary clinic will find that the prices area an awful lot higher.  I have been talking to a large number of vets in my research for this legislation.  There have been instances where a corporate buyer has taken over a small animal specialist clinic and services have become restricted while the costs have gone up significantly and quickly to exorbitant levels.  One of the pet projects of those corporate buyers is to sell pet insurance.  As soon as a corporate buyer takes over a small animal practice, the main job in the practice is to sell pet insurance.  The latter makes the profit margins a great deal more attractive.</p> <p>The principal issue and concern I see with this is the Veterinary Council of Ireland.  The Minister, Deputy McConalogue, will be aware that the Veterinary Council appeared before the Joint Committee on Agriculture and the Marine on two occasions in 2019.  It gave reasons for changing the interpretation of the legislation that was in place and change it did.  For a number of years, the Acts interpreted that only veterinary practitioners could own a veterinary practice.  That existed for virtually ten years after the legislation was passed.  It changed that legislation and changed its interpretation of that legislation.  After then allowing a number of high-profile practices to be bought, the Veterinary Council set about a consultation process with stakeholders within the industry.  This was definitely a case of putting the cart before the horse.  Then, after that consultation, it decided that the changed interpretation was correct.  I fundamentally disagreed with that, as did the vast majority of committee members.</p> <p> By allowing laypeople to own veterinary practices, the regulation of those practices will be beyond the powers of the Veterinary Council.  That is the nub of the issue.  If one is going to regulate, one will need professionals in charge of those practices.  The only way a professional can be in charge of the practice is if he or she is the owner.  A case was highlighted recently where a practice owned by a layperson was left without a vet for a month to six weeks.  It had no vet on hand but a large quantity of drugs were owned by the practice.  The Veterinary Council had no ability to regulate that or control those drugs.</p> <p> We are seeing huge controversy with another aspect of the agricultural industry at the moment with regard to the doping of racehorses.  Our committee will have hearings on that issue in the next two weeks.  The Veterinary Council's principal job is to regulate the industry and ensure that food safety and animal welfare are sacrosanct.  Allowing laypeople to own these practices diminishes its ability to do that.  It takes away the Veterinary Council's ability to do it because it regulates veterinarians, not laypeople.</p> <p> That is the fundamental point of why this legislation must be passed.  Yes, we have costs, whether they are to farmers or pet owners.  We have the availability of services in rural areas.  We have all those questions.  If corporates take control, they will just look at the bottom line.  They will not look at the quality or costs of service.</p> <p> While those are important reasons, the fundamental reason is regulation.  Our reputation as food producers is paramount and our veterinarians are an integral part of that.  The Veterinary Council being able to regulate veterinary practices to keep the ownership in veterinarians' hands is absolutely essential.  That, therefore, is why I appeal to the Minister and the committee to proceed with this legislation as quickly as we possibly can.  It is essential, for all the reasons that have been laid out tonight, that this amendment is put on the Statute Book.  It is essential for one reason above all else, which is to preserve our reputation.  As the Minister and Minister of State said, our reputation on the world stage is very good.  To give the Veterinary Council of Ireland the proper authority to maintain that reputation, it is essential that veterinary practices are owned by veterinary practitioners.</p> <p> I very much thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving us the opportunity to bring this Bill forward to Second Stage.  It is an essential piece of legislation, which will ensure our practices and the reputation of our industry are maintained.  As has been clearly said, our veterinarians deliver a great service to us.  They have an extremely high reputation on the world stage.  We have an extremely high reputation for producing top quality-food.  Our veterinarians give it a stamp that is recognised worldwide.  Let us ensure that we keep that reputation intact.</p> <p> The amendment to this legislation, namely, the Veterinary Practice Act 2005 and Veterinary Practice (Amendment) Act 2012, will ensure that is the case.  Hopefully, we can get this Bill through Committee Stage quickly and back onto the floor of the D&aacute;il to get this amendment put into the legislation, which will be of benefit to consumers, the industry and veterinarians alike.</p></speech>
