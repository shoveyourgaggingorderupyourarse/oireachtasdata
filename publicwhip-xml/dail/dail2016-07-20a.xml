    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-07-20a.6" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1359" speakername="Finian McGrath" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016072000003#A00200"><p>I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>  <p>  I warmly welcome the opportunity to address the House today on Second Stage of the Health (Amendment) Bill 2016 which is a technical amendment to the Health Act 2007 and has the sole purpose of extending by two years an existing transitional period in respect of the registration of centres for people with disabilities.  I will also take this opportunity to say a few words about the broader issue of the safety and protection of vulnerable people in the care of the State which is of paramount importance to me and this Government.  There have been a number of cases coming to light in recent weeks and months which have given me significant cause for concern.  I am joined in this reaction by other Deputies in the House today.  Unacceptable events and practices, mainly historical but also more recent, are coming to light following the RTE Prime Time programme.  It reflects an attitude in the past to people with a disability.  I have major, urgent concerns and during my watch I will protect and guarantee the rights of all people with physical and intellectual disabilities.  It is important.</p>  <p>  Let me make it clear today, I am determined that the utmost priority will be given to the full protection of people with a disability in the care of the State.  Furthermore, I am determined that historical issues will be comprehensively examined and addressed.  The cases in recent media reports are of serious concern but it is important to note they are now coming to light because the system has changed.  Things are far from perfect but in recent years we have introduced new policies and regulation to attempt to prevent this kind of event from happening again.  Since 2013, all residential centres for children and adults with disabilities must be inspected by HIQA.  The regulator is a shining a light into every corner of every centre where our most vulnerable citizens live.  Notwithstanding the reports we read in the media, most of these centres are providing very good person-centred care and support.  </p>  <p>  The inaugural annual report by HIQA on the regulation of centres for people with disabilities published last week found evidence of a high standard of care and a focus on individual residents' needs and preferences in many cases.  It stated that regulation has brought a cultural change to the sector and has steadily led to improvements in the standard of care provided to residents.  My objective will be to ensure that residents are protected from all kinds of abuse.  There are exceptions to this and some HIQA inspection reports do not make for easy reading.  I totally endorse the work of HIQA.  There have been cases where massive improvements have been demanded by HIQA and there have been cases where HIQA has cancelled the registration of centres that are unable to meet the standards required.  I emphasise that regulation is a work in progress and it takes time to bed down these new systems.  The Bill before the House today is a small component in this system.  I will return to its specific provisions shortly. </p>  <p>  On Monday of this week, the Minister, Deputy Harris, and I met with HSE officials.  We made very clear and outlined our serious concerns about the recent allegations in the Prime Time programme and we listened to the HSE on a range of measures that are being implemented and have progressed in recent years to improve these matters.  The meeting on Monday was very tough and difficult but we had to put it on the line to ensure the safety of all residents.  This includes the Transforming Lives agenda, which is driving the move towards person-centred, community-based care and the roll-out of the critical policy of safeguarding vulnerable persons at risk of abuse.  In addition, the HSE confidential recipient, Ms Leigh Gath, is working diligently to assist people who need to approach a person in confidence to have a concern addressed.  The confidential recipient is another key part of improving safety for residents.  Ms Gath&rsquo;s first annual report set out a range of cases in which she has been involved and was able to assist people with concerns.</p><p>I urge all Deputies, if they have any concerns or issues, to contact Ms Gath.</p> <p> Regarding some of the allegations, I expect to receive shortly from Mr. Conor Dignam, SC, the report which will feed into the terms of reference for a statutory commission of investigation.  This will be established as a priority following agreement on the terms of reference and the approval of the Oireachtas.  When this happens, I will be looking for cross-party support in regard to the commission of inquiry and the terms of reference.</p> <p> I will also receive shortly the independently chaired inter-agency review in regard to the case of "Mary", who lived in a former foster home in the Cork-Kerry region.  As soon as the facts are established, I am determined that every required action will be taken.</p> <p> Actions and developments are in progress.  It is important that everybody is reassured regarding these matters.  None of these vital changes can take effect overnight; all are works in progress.</p> <p> I am committed to developing the framework of regulation and investigation to safeguard and protect people with a disability in the care of the State and one part of this Health (Amendment) Bill 2016 which I will now discuss.  </p> <p> The Health Act 2007 provided for the establishment of the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, its inspection and regulation of designated centres and the framework for registration of these designated centres.  The measures provided for in the Health (Amendment) Bill 2016 relate exclusively to residential centres for people with disabilities.  It was planned that all such designated centres for people with disabilities would be inspected and registered by HIQA, or be refused registration, within a three-year period of the relevant section of the Health Act 2007 coming into effect.  This period is now due to expire on 31 October 2016.  Due to the complexities of the disability sector and, in some cases, the significant quality and safety issues identified by HIQA in the first two years of regulation, HIQA alerted the Department of Health in 2015 that it would not be possible to complete a final registration decision for all designated centres which had been deemed to be registered in this way by the end of the transitional period on 31 October 2016.  There are 1,000 residential centres for people with disabilities throughout the country and by June 2016, 556 had been registered.  HIQA estimates that more than 350 centres will not be registered by the end of October 2016.</p> <p> It is important to understand the very serious consequences if the deadline is not extended.  Under the existing legislation, HIQA would be obliged to cancel the transitional registration of a large number of centres.  The Health Service Executive, HSE, would be required to take over the running of these centres and to make alternative arrangements for residents of the centres taken over.  This would have major implications for the affected residents but also significant budgetary, administrative and staffing implications for the HSE and Department of Health.</p> <p> The Health (Amendment) Bill 2016 is simply a technical amendment to the 2007 Act with the sole purpose of extending by two years the transitional period which sets out the final deadline for registration of centres for people with disabilities.  The Bill has no impact on the registration or regulation of residential centres for older people or children.  The exact same standards of safeguarding and protection will continue to exist for residents of the centres for people with disabilities.</p> <p> The proposed two-year extension will not limit or diminish the responsibility of providers to manage and operate the services under their control, nor will it limit HIQA in the application of its sanctions and powers of enforcement.  HIQA is in full agreement with the extension of the transitional period proposed in the Bill and that is why I ask the House for its support today.  Furthermore, there is no additional cost to the State involved in extending the timeframe for registration by HIQA of centres for people with disabilities.</p> <p> The Health (Amendment) Bill 2016 is relatively short legislation, providing only a minor technical amendment to section 69 of the Health Act 2007.</p></speech>

I hope it will be possible for this Bill to receive broad support and I  commend it to the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-07-20a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1262" speakername="Margaret Murphy O'Mahony" time="10:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016072000004#B00400"><p>As the Minister will be aware from taking the Bill through the Seanad, Fianna F&aacute;il will be supporting this Bill.  However, it is somewhat disappointing that the Bill is necessary and that more time is needed to render residential centres compliant with Health Information and Quality Authority regulations.  Not all disability residential centres will have achieved the standards required to be registered by 31 October 2016 and, therefore, it has become necessary to move the deadline out by two years.  Are the Minister and HIQA confident that all will meet this new deadline?</p>  <p>  It must be said that we would all like to see more people with disabilities living independently and that fewer residential centres would be needed.  However, as long as we have them, it is important that they are well regulated and compliant with that regulation.</p>  <p>  We cannot ignore the background against which we are debating this Bill.  There have been many shocking revelations in the past week and it is crucial we tackle these issues head on.  On Thursday night last, the "RTE Investigates: Lost in Care" programme exposed how the HSE failed in its duty of care and protection to hundreds of adults with intellectual disabilities - some of most vulnerable people in the country.  Many viewers will have reacted with anger and disappointment.  Sadly, there may not have been great surprise at the revelations as we are witnessing yet another failure of care by those whom we trust to provide it.</p>  <p>  The Minister has had a number of meetings with HSE officials in recent days.  I trust he gave them the clear message that this cannot go on and that rather than have these matters exposed by whistleblowers or leaks, we need to know now what other deficiencies remain in the system.  What other internal reports are there?  Is there more to come?  What reassurances can the Minister offer?  Has the HSE offered him reassurances and, if so, is he reassured?  The Minister must have doubts because we all do.  It is simply outrageous that, in many cases, the HSE did not even have a file on the individuals in question and, in some cases, where files existed, the detail and the record keeping were completely inadequate.  It is shameful.  It is as if the 200 defenceless and vulnerable citizens our health service would not even dignify with a record were seen as non-persons.  </p>  <p>  In one case, the absence of information led to a vulnerable woman being frequently returned without any supervision to her family home even though it was known that she had been sexually abused in childhood by a family member.  We also learned of a man with Down's syndrome who spent his whole life in residential care and went for 16 years without any contact from officials.  The HSE states there are no current safeguarding issues.  However, I suggest the Minister follows the policy of trust but verifies issues.  After all, it is just over 18 months since the &Aacute;ras Attracta expos&eacute;.</p>  <p>  Last week's revelations came in the wake of other revelations earlier this year about "Grace" and allegations that children and adults with intellectual disabilities, some of whom are mute, were seriously sexually assaulted at a foster home in the south east.  This resulted in almost the last act of the previous D&aacute;il being the establishment of a commission of investigation into the allegations.  Five months on, the commission is yet to get up and running and there have been concerns expressed that its scope will now be too narrow.</p>  <p>  Is there a case, in view of last week's programme, to set up a more wide-ranging commission to look at all residential centres?  Surely, we need to be honest with ourselves and find out the full truth of what happened.  Can the Minister or anyone be confident that more revelations will not be made in the months and years ahead?</p>  <p>  The Bill we are debating amends the 2007 Health Act which provided for the establishment of HIQA incorporating a new and independent inspectorate and registration authority for residential services.  While the 2007 Act was steered through by the former Minister, Ms Harney, the establishment of HIQA was a key element in the health reform programme initiated by Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin when he was Minister for Health.</p>  <p>  It is all about standards and their enforcement and the need to ensure that an independent organisation with teeth was created to provide accountability.</p><p>The purpose was to ensure that the standards set would be applied consistently and on a national basis and, where necessary, action could be taken quickly and effectively to protect service users.  It is fair to say HIQA has had an impact.</p> <p> Early last Thursday, before the RTE investigation programme was broadcast, HIQA published its annual overview report on the regulation of designated centres for adults and children with disabilities.  It pointed out that the initial inspections in 2014 led to the finding that residents living in many large congregated settings were not being adequately protected or kept safe and that institutionalised care practices, ongoing for years, had an adverse impact on the quality of life for residents.  However, it is welcome that HIQA is now reporting that regulation has brought cultural change to the sector, steadily leading to improvements in the standard of care provided to residents.  The report really highlights the need for further action to help support people with disabilities to live in a community environment.  The report makes it clear that regulation has helped bring about steady improvements in the standard of care provided to people with disabilities, although it nonetheless highlights that further work is needed.</p> <p> The recommendations made through the 2011 HSE report on congregated settings are yet to be implemented, with congregated settings or institutions with ten or more residents being replaced with supported placements in the community.  It is estimated that approximately 3,000 people with a disability were living in congregated settings as of December 2014, at the time of the &Aacute;ras Attracta programme's transmission.  Sadly, not much has been achieved in moving people into community-based environments since.  The HSE prioritised the transition of just 150 people from congregated settings in 2015 and yet it only managed to move 112 people last year, which is wholly inadequate and must be addressed.  Regrettably, the Government has not made this a real priority in the programme for Government.  It is unlikely to make any serious inroads as the reduction targeted is only in the region of 900, which represents just a third of the total figure.  At this rate it will be 2031 before congregated settings come to an end.  I urge the Minister of State to step up the campaign to bring the practice of outdated congregated settings to an end.</p> <p> The Minister of State might agree that we cannot wait until 2031 for this to happen.  I have praised HIQA and its achievements but I know some people feel it could be doing more for people with disabilities.  In February 2015, Inclusion Ireland published The Distant Voice working paper, which analysed the HIQA inspection of 123 units providing residential services for over 700 people with disabilities across Ireland during 2014.  Inclusion Ireland claimed that only 11% of residents across 50 reports were asked about communication needs, which is in stark contrast to the position in the UK, where persons with a disability are part of the inspection process.  Is this something that can be provided for so we can ensure people with a disability are represented in the inspection process?</p> <p> Fianna F&aacute;il will support this Bill but if a further extension is required in 2018, there will be great disappointment and many questions will be asked.  There is much we must do during this D&aacute;il to improve the lives and opportunities of people with disabilities.  That is a priority for me and my party.  Before the end of the year I look forward in particular to the promised legislation for ratifying the UN convention on the rights of persons with disabilities.  I welcome that the Minister of State with responsibility for the disability brief is at Cabinet, although Fianna F&aacute;il wants to see a Department with disability inclusion specifically in the title.</p> <p> Since my appointment as Fianna F&aacute;il spokesman on disability, I have met representatives of a number of organisations working in the disability sector and all these groups have expressed their frustration at the slow pace of change in the area.  They also pointed out there is a need for real political leadership to drive forward positive and inclusive reform of the disability sector in Ireland.  People with disabilities must be prioritised in the upcoming budget.  The Government must demonstrate its commitment to improving the lives of people living with a disability.  We want an Ireland in which people with disabilities are given the resources they need to live their lives as full and equal citizens.  It is our goal to realise this objective.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-07-20a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1269" speakername="Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in" time="10:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016072000005#C00200"><p>The impact of austerity policies on people with disabilities and their families has been devastating.  I know the Minister of State knows that to be the case.  The mobility allowance scheme was closed and educational supports, including resource teachers and special needs assistants, diminished.  Medical cards have been targeted and the mainstream public services upon which those with disabilities disproportionately depend have been decimated.  People with disabilities remain more than twice as likely to be unemployed compared with the typical population and just 15% of people with an intellectual disability are in employment.  Sinn F&eacute;in has a vision for society in which all citizens, including those with disabilities, can play a full and independent role in all aspects of life, relying as far as possible on mainstream services for health, education and employment but with the support of tailored disability services where necessary.</p>  <p>  The Health Act 2007 provided for the establishment of the Health Information and Quality Authority, known popularly as HIQA.  It provided for inspection and regulation of designated centres and the framework for registration of these designated centres.  The introduction and establishment of such a body as HIQA was very positive.  The measures in the Health (Amendment) Bill 2016 relate exclusively to residential centres for people with disabilities.  I understand there are 1,000 residential centres for people with disabilities throughout the country and by June 2016, some 556 had been registered.  HIQA estimates that over 350 centres will not be registered by the end of October this year.</p>  <p>  We in Sinn F&eacute;in will vote in favour of the Health (Amendment) Bill 2016.  We would of course have wished for all centres to have been registered by 31 October 2016, although we understand some of the complexities associated with such a process and we will therefore support the extension of time request.  However, we have a number of concerns that we would like the Minister of State to address.  I ask him to note these questions.  We appreciate the major administrative task involved in the process but are other specific factors leading to such a delay?  In 2015, HIQA reported to the Department of Health that it would not be possible to complete all registrations by the prospective timeline.  Is it a question of resources?  If so, why were more resources not directed to HIQA to allow it to complete the work within the initial agreed timeframe?</p>  <p>  Following consultation with Inclusion Ireland, a body with which the Minister of State is well familiar, it has come to my attention that there is a list drawn up by the HSE of centres that it has already accepted will never meet the criteria required for registration.  I ask the Minister of State to note this important fact.  Will he comment on this?  Given some of the controversies and scandals uncovered by the media and HIQA in recent times and not exclusively in disability residential settings, but across the social care sector, we have deep concerns that more than 400 residential settings have never been inspected.</p><p>We are aware that HIQA has returned to facilities that received unfavourable and damning reports many times, yet this large number of facilities remain uninspected, with the potential for service users to be at unrecorded and increased risk.</p> <p> As recently as last week it was reported that three residential centres for people with autism have now been taken over by the HSE at the direction of HIQA due to serious non-compliance.  It is extremely concerning to learn of the significant failings found by HIQA relating to the care and welfare of 47 adult residents with autism living in three farm-based centres.  These centres were inspected on a number of occasions over the past 18 months and particular concerns were raised regarding inadequate measures to ensure residents were protected from assault, ongoing risks to residents that were not being appropriately managed or responded to, poor governance and oversight leading to negative outcomes for residents, and poor management of staffing resources and inadequate staff training.  Adults with special needs and their families require and deserve the highest standard of care.  To hear of such non-compliance is extremely distressing.  I am anxious that the extension of two years provided for in this Bill may mean that many other centres will continue to operate without being inspected for a considerable period, potentially leaving vulnerable people in facilities that are simply not at the standard required.</p> <p> In the context of this Bill, we are of the strong belief that there is a great need to move the focus from congregated settings to the community, and not just to smaller settings but to full integration.  Congregated settings are facilities where residents live in close proximity to each other and with an institutional mindset.  They are inappropriate homes for anyone, particularly those with complex needs.  The focus needs to shift from centre-based services to supported mainstream integration.  The focus may be on empowering service users to take as full a role in life as possible.  Resources are also needed to support families.  This process of decongregation is happening but at a very slow pace.  It must be accelerated and funding redistributed so that the main focus is on community rather than specialised settings.</p> <p> I would welcome a response from the Minister of State to some of the points I have raised.  In particular, I lay emphasis on the question of whether there is a HSE list of centres or an understanding that there are a number of centres that will never meet the criteria for registration.  I ask again if this is the case.  Does such a list exist?  If it does, we have the alarming and incredible situation of residents who need care living in substandard care conditions with no prospect of the situation being appropriately addressed while those facilities remain in service.</p> <p> I have a great respect and regard for HIQA and its work.  It is appropriate and important to register that fact here this morning.  I hope the issue of resourcing, to which I have referred, strikes a chord with the Minister of State.  I believe it does and hope that in his position as Minister of State with responsibility for the disability sector he will help to ensure that HIQA is resourced and empowered to carry out all the important work it must do in the interests not only of those who cannot voice their own concerns and needs but of all citizens who depend on the State's health and care provision.</p></speech>

I know the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, is one of those who has had to fight every step of the way to ensure their children will have the same rights and access as children who do not have a disability.  I thought the stories from those in the industrial schools and the ladies in the Magdalen laundries were the worst we would hear about how we treat vulnerable people.  However, we are hearing more heartbreaking, devastating and disturbing stories of what has been happening to those with an intellectual disability.  Even more heartbreaking is that we know it continues today.  However, I acknowledge those organisations, homes, front-line staff and intellectual disability nurses who have been instrumental in the giving of high-quality care.  It is unfortunate that their positive work is being taken from by those who have abused their position.</p>  <p>  It is vital that the registration process has an opportunity to be completed, but registration in itself is pointless unless there is follow-up.  It is disappointing that the registration was not completed within the timeframe, which now needs to be extended by two years.  HIQA mentioned various complexities with regard to quality and safety issues and the consequences if the deadline was not extended for the HSE.  It stated that it would have to make alternative arrangements for the residents and that that would have major implications for them.  We are speaking about vulnerable people in settings that are their homes.  They have become used to these facilities and have visits from their families there, and those family members are satisfied with the standards.  When people become settled and used to a routine, it can be difficult for them to handle change.  I therefore support the provision of this extension, but it is disappointing that it is required.  In the meantime, it is important to have a mechanism to address issues in unregistered homes.  I know the Minister of State has made a commitment in this regard.  However, we do not want to be hearing these stories for the first time in the media.  We need to be more proactive so that the Government and the authorities know about them first.</p>  <p>  The review by the National Disability Authority refers to the demands on service providers when applying for formal recognition.  It mentions the time commitment involved in the paperwork.  That is replicated in many voluntary organisations, which find it onerous, particularly voluntary management boards.  I accept the need for regulation but I do not believe good paperwork necessarily equates to high-quality care.  I have been involved in voluntary work for quite a long time and I know that organisations are overwhelmed by the extent of the bureaucracy and paperwork required.  It is almost as if there is an agenda to try to remove as much of the voluntary effort as possible, something which would be very disappointing.</p>  <p>  With regard to congregated facilities, the HIQA report notes that 70% of residents with a disability in designated centres are living in congregations of ten or more residents.  They are the ones that are more likely to be non-compliant when the inspections take place, rather than the smaller residential institutions.  We know that a smaller setting is better but we must be cognisant of the existence of centres with ten or more residents that have worked well and in which the residents are happy.  The relationship between the staff and the resident, the standards in the home and the programmes available for people with intellectual disabilities are the most important aspects when looking at inspections of these homes.</p><p>Regrettably, after a certain age people with intellectual disabilities can be left with nothing to do and nothing to stimulate them day by day.  Various organisations have referred to the challenges for the disability sector, such as those around registration and inspection, but there are challenges for those who work with people with an intellectual disability too.  I deal quite a bit with people with an intellectual disability and I know how time-consuming and challenging it is.  The voice of those with a disability should be part of all the processes. </p></speech>

The Minister of State said it was a technical amendment to the 2007 Act with the sole purpose of extending the transitional period but the necessity of the amendment is certainly not technical in the lives of the people affected.  I and everybody else throughout the country who watched the programme on &Aacute;ras Attracta were rendered speechless.  Being rendered speechless is not a good position for a legislator to be in.  I had the experience of being present at the redress board relating to a number of institutions.  It is an offence to talk about the details of that but I will talk in general terms.  A charity in Galway which looked after people with a disability was before the redress board and the abuse we heard about was horrific.  That was some time ago but what have we and the Government learned?  I welcome the Minister of State's strong statements and his promise that he will take charge and not let this happen again under his watch.  However, I have heard such speeches before from different Ministers.  What will be different this time?  It seems to me that no matter which Government is in power, it will make decisions based on resources and vulnerable people will suffer each time.  We do not realise that we will use up scarce resources in following cases up with commissions of inquiry and reviews, Garda investigations and so on.  I have returned to the theme of money on many occasions since I came into the D&aacute;il four months ago and have spoken of how we end up spending more money in the long term in any event.  In our new politics, will the Minister of State have an influence in pointing out that we will save money in the long term by valuing people who have a disability?  We can learn from such people on a daily basis, given their strength in surviving with disabilities of which we know little.  Our role is to give them the chance to thrive and to allocate funding to enable that to happen.  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in asked about resources.  Is the bottom line the fact that we are not allocating enough resources?  If that is the problem, let us get it out into the open and discuss it in this Chamber as intelligent beings, so that we can make decisions.</p>  <p>  We have dragged our heels for years on the UN Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities and still have not ratified it.  I am delighted that we have now given a commitment to do it before the end of the year but we have been forced to do it.  It has not been a proactive policy by any Government and the move to give it priority has come from pressure applied prior to every election, local and general, by people who work on a voluntary basis.  I support the amending legislation but would like the Minister of State to respond to the more general issues I have raised.  </p></speech>

I give them a commitment to listen to their points of view and to respond to the issues they have raised.  I absolutely share the deep concerns Deputies have expressed about the care by the State of vulnerable people with a disability.  This Government is committed to the protection and safeguarding of children and adults with disabilities and I am determined that historical issues will be comprehensively examined and addressed.  We have to change the mindset in Irish society and bring in real equality for all people with disabilities and that is part of my broader vision for the reform of services for people with disabilities.</p>  <p>  A range of measures have been put in place in recent years to improve the care provided to the most vulnerable citizens and this will be progressed and improved.  The system is clearly far from perfect but the fact that these issues are coming to light and are being investigated points to the fact that our oversight and regulation are getting better.  My Department will receive a number of reports and reviews in the coming weeks which will shape and direct the way the disability sector is regulated.</p>  <p>  I will now deal specifically with some of the issues raised by the Deputies.  Deputy Margaret Murphy O'Mahony raised the issue of abuse and I agree that we have to ensure the protection of our citizens.  She also raised the issue of congregated settings and I totally accept that we need to focus on them.  However, the process is being supported this year by &euro;20 million in capital funding from the Department of Health while assistance with transitional costs is being provided by the service reform fund to the tune of &euro;45 million, with support from the Department of Health and Atlantic Philanthropies.  The Deputy also said we needed more reform and more positivity in our health and disability services and some of the reports I will be receiving will deal with these issues.  I hope there will be evidence of this reform come the autumn.</p>  <p>  I appreciate the support of all Deputies on this issue.  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in asked about resources.  The answer to his question is "Yes".  Disability services have been devastated for the past ten years.  We need to up our game and to invest in services.  He also asked about the inspection of services by HIQA, a very important question.  All centres had been visited at least once by April 2016.  The Deputy also raised the case of a number of centres of autism being taken over by the HSE in recent months.  This shows that the system of regulation works and that there is a procedure in place to deal with centres which fail HIQA standards.  There is no exception in the case of centres covered by section 69 of the 2007 Act.  HIQA will continue to monitor and inspect all centres and will expect centres with the greatest challenges to meet the standards that have been prioritised for decongregation.  The centres with the worst level of services, where physical space is often the issue, will be prioritised in the context of decongregated settings.</p>  <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in also mentioned mobility allowance.  The Department of Health has prioritised the development of the transport support Bill in line with the commitment in the programme for partnership Government.  The heads of Bill are in an advanced stage of development.</p><p> The Deputy mentioned the resource issue with regard to the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA.  That is an issue we have to fix; it is a reality.  I give a commitment that I will support HIQA on access and resources, because it is the guardian of citizens.</p> <p> Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan raised the issue of abuse.  She acknowledged that we must have a strong, professional services but also acknowledged the good work that takes place.  Many of us have experienced high quality services in the disability sector, but that is due to the staff - the right people doing the job in the right services.  That issue continues to arise.  I accept that Deputy O'Sullivan is disappointed about the extension, but I want to ensure that these services are up to standard.  She also raised the quality of the day services.  Yesterday, I met representatives of the National Disability Authority and they accepted that we had a very good discussion.  We came up with a major programme for the end of December to examine the standards, because there is a variation of standards within day services.  I am aware of many centres that have a structured day service with a high-quality timetable, and young adults with intellectual disabilities love the centres.  Equally, in regard to other centres, I had a complaint recently where for one family it was costing the Health Service Executive &euro;180,000 a year for a service that was appalling.  The mother of that young person with an intellectual disability said that for half that amount of money she would get a better service.  There is much inconsistency in the services, but we have high-quality day services.</p> <p> I appreciate Deputy Catherine Connolly's support and I take her point.  While I referred to a technical amendment to the 2007 Act, the wider view is that we have to ensure that respect for, equality and reform of the services must be developed.  The Deputy asked whether the Government had learned a very important lesson from what happened in the past.  I hope to God we have, because I have become very frustrated with some of the situations I have come across recently.  I agree with the Deputy on that.  Deputy Connolly also made a strong point about high costs.  I know we will probably have to go down the road of a commission of investigation, but it annoys me that we have to spend that money.  Who will get the money?  It will not be the services for adults with intellectual disabilities; it will be sections of the legal profession, but that is another debate.  We might have to do that in this particular case.  The Deputy made the strong point that if we invest in high-quality services it will save us money in the future.  That is a reality and a vision we need to bring to the issue.</p> <p> When it comes down to savings and resource issues, as I said to Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, these are important things that we have to change, and we must change the mindset also.  Disability has to be brought to the top of the political agenda.  I try to do that every day.  It is very difficult at times but we do make progress.  I hope we will make progress on these matters.  Those were the issues and concerns raised.</p></speech>

It is more about dealing with outdated services, and my view is that they have been prioritised.  I believe there are around 165 places on that particular list.</p>  <p>  The purpose of the Bill is not to change any of the fundamentals of the HIQA inspection, regulation and registration regime, which is working very well.  HIQA regulation has brought a cultural change to the sector and has steadily led to improvements in the standards of care provided by facilities.  This Bill will simply extend the deadline by which residential centres must be registered in order to allow HIQA the necessary time to ensure that every centre is inspected fully and properly.  HIQA will in no way be limited in the application of its powers and sanctions.  I want to reassure parents, families and TDs interested in this section that it will retain its ability to inspect and, if necessary, cancel the registration of a residential centre that persistently fails to meet the required standards.  I hope I have addressed the concerns expressed in the debate and that the Bill will receive broad support from all sides of the House.</p></speech>

We raised the issue many times in the discussions on the programme for Government, on the Order of Business and at other times here, but nothing has changed in Kerry with regard to improving home help services.</p>  <p>  This Government will be judged on its ability to make a difference to the people we represent.  I believe that the people who need home help are not getting a sufficient number of hours.  I know of many cases where the husband and the wife are trying to stay in their home but they are not getting a sufficient number of home help hours.  A half hour in the morning and a half hour in the evening for five days is not sufficient in terms of helping people to get out of bed, give them a meal or whatever.  Very little can be done in that short time.  The home helps are wonderful people and they stay longer than they are paid to do.  I am aware of an elderly couple that is using the pension of one of them to provide a home help.  That is not acceptable.</p>  <p>  Very few people get a home help on a weekend.  That is not acceptable.  They do not get a home help on bank holidays.  I mentioned previously that home help was taken from people on Christmas Day, St. Stephen's Day and New Year's Day.  That is a time of peace and goodwill when we are all supposed to look after each other, but especially elderly people.  That is the service our State is providing.</p>  <p>  It appears to me that there is no accountability in this area.  The HSE is not accountable to the Minister for Health, but the buck should stop with the Minister.  If we raise an issue in this House the Minister should address it and see how it can be approved.  If we do not help our elderly people to stay in their homes for as long as they possibly can, we are not doing our duty.  Kerry has been badly let down with regard to the provision of a sufficient number of home help hours.  I ask that this matter be addressed.</p>  <p>  On another issue, Deer Lodge is a new facility that was built 12 months ago at great expense in St. Margaret's Road, Killarney, to deal with people with mental health problems, but the door has not been opened yet.  That brand new facility has been lying idle for 12 months.  I want the Minister to make a statement on when he will open the doors of that facility.  Our county is riddled with suicides, and I am not saying that facility will stop suicides from happening in our county, but it is not acceptable that its doors are not yet open.</p><p><i>11 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p> <p>As an elected representative, I promised many people that we would do our level best to ensure the facility would be up and running.  The facility was completed in June of last year and was supposed to open in July of last year but the doors and gates are closed and it has not yet opened.  I want the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, or the Minister of State, Deputy McGrath, to make a statement on when it will be opened.  That is the question we are being asked day in, day out.</p> <p> Another serious problem is manifesting itself regularly.  Consider a person who has had a heart attack and goes to Cork University Hospital in the hope of having a triple or quadruple bypass.  I have a constituent who was waiting for three weeks and who had to return home many times during those three weeks because when he went to the hospital, there was no bed available and the operation was cancelled.  Imagine the stress and trauma that family had to endure wondering if he would get another heart attack.  The operation was cancelled several times.  That was not fair on the family, the patient or the patient's poor wife who could hardly sleep for those three weeks all because a bed was not available to cater for that patient following the operation.  Those matters need to be addressed.</p> <p> Members elected to this Chamber highlight these concerns but nothing is happening.  The Minister needs to make a statement on what he will do about these serious matters.  I am not alone in raising these issues but I ask that they be addressed and that the Minister makes a statement on them.</p></speech>

When he said that all centres had been visited by April 2016, does the word "visited" equate with the word "inspection"?  I note the nod of his advisers that that is the case.  The information I have been given is that the process is not complete and I will go back to check that detail.  I was trying to establish that there were no semantics regarding the words "visit" and "inspection", etc., and that we had absolute clarity that none of the entities to which I referred have not had an inspection by HIQA.  Will the Minister of State clarify that?  I will seek to confirm this with HIQA.</p>  <p>  My second point relates to the list to which I referred.  In his reply, the Minister of State said that there was no list but went on to advise that there was a list.  In regard to the 165, or whatever the number the Minister of State referred to, is it the case that within that figure, it is now known that a particular number will not cross the line within the two year extension for HIQA to progress the issue of registration?  Will the Minister of State confirm that a number of facilities will not cross the line?  Therefore, as I said earlier, we are allowing a situation where people who cannot speak for themselves and people with intellectual disability of varying degrees are being retained and kept in substandard circumstances that have no believed prospect of improving within the extended time provided for by this legislation.  That is a very worrying point.  Does the Minister of State have anything further to say regarding that matter or, more importantly, is there is something he can do about it?</p></speech>

An extra &euro;12 million was returned to the fund for the Vision for Change for mental health services.  Surely, this would be an opportunity.  Deputy Danny Healy-Rae also spoke about the issue of waiting for heart operations in Cork University Hospital.  I will bring that issue back to the Minister for Health as it is not under my brief.</p>  <p>  In regard to HIQA, as far as I know, the word "visited" in this context means "inspected".  I assure Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in that I was not playing word games.  When I said all centres will have been visited at least once by 2016, I interpreted that to mean HIQA visiting, monitoring and inspecting the facilities.  I will ensure that all the centres are inspected to ensure safety and high quality of standards.</p>  <p>  In regard to the figure of 165, I think I misread that.  What I meant was that the &euro;20 million which is being spent in different centres throughout the State was being used to take 165 people out of congregated settings and to put them into smaller community-based housing and service schemes.  The figure of 165 refers to the particular people involved in those arrangements.  I appreciate the Deputy's point but it is important to remember that in the first round of funding, we have prioritised the disability residential services and congregated settings that are in the worst condition.  We felt it was important to start with those.  However, it is not acceptable to have people still living in them.  Part of my project over the next year or two years is to deal with these issues and ensure quality services for people.</p>  <p>  We are doing much catching up on investment in services after the past seven or eight years and I accept the points made earlier.  I thank Deputies for their support for the Bill.  I understand they have concerns, which are shared by many of us, but we will do our best to deliver quality services for all people with physical and intellectual disabilities.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-07-20a.44" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1224" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="11:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016072000010#J00200"><p>We all remember the infamous photograph of Deputy Ruari Quinn outside Trinity College Dublin in advance of the 2011 general election, when he signed a big banner and the students' petition, saying he would cut rather than increase student fees.  Of course, subsequently, when he took office as Minister for Education and Skills, he blatantly and cynically disregarded that commitment.  Ever since then third level funding has been on a cliff.  It is in a seriously difficult situation.  Pupil-teacher ratios have got progressively worse, going from 16:1 to 20:1.  There is little or no capital investment, apart from the Grangegorman campus, in third level education.  The central role of third level education in economic development is not reflected in current Government policy and has not been for some time.  It is indisputable that over the past 40 years investment in third level education was central to economic and social development, particularly in attracting foreign direct investment and in developing small to medium sized companies and giving young people a chance in life.  The great success story of modern Ireland has been the degree to which we have opened up third level education through institutes of technology and universities to far more young people than was the case in the 1950s and 1960s.</p>  <p>  The quality of the experience for students is in decline.  That is a real worry for those in charge of the universities and for those who have analysed this.  There will be more young people going into third level education in years to come.  Population growth and the numbers coming through second level all point to far greater numbers attending.  The quality of the experience should be good.  We have been slipping in some of the world league tables of university rankings and that is a considerable worry.</p>  <p>  The report of the expert group on future funding for third level education, the Cassells report, has highlighted much of this and pointed to the urgent need to restore and enhance quality.  It has recommended an immediate increase of &euro;120 million per year over the next five years.  It recommends spending &euro;5.5 billion over the next five to six years on capital infrastructure in third level education.  Students need additional supports.  Postgraduate students should be prioritised and their grants restored.  I have been saying this for the past three to four years.</p>  <p>  Do the Taoiseach and the Government accept the recommendations of the Cassells report?  As discussions and negotiations begin about the forthcoming budget, will the Government reflect significantly increased funding of approximately &euro;120 million to the third level education? </p></speech>

That is through the educational system, which is not perfect but which has more than measured up against any of its competitors around the world.  Primary, second and third level are all important parts of that jigsaw.  From the evidence of my engagements with business abroad, Ireland&rsquo;s reputation is a very important cornerstone, more so than tax in many respects, for people who want to invest here and work with the young Irish.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, has received the Cassells report, which sets out three options.  The report will go to the Oireachtas Committee on Education and Skills for consideration and discussion.  Deputy Martin is well aware that most of the universities raise significant sums of money themselves for their capital programmes, assisted in part by the State.  There is always a balance to be achieved between the output from universities and the challenge to provide sufficient money for them.  We did not have this capacity for many years.  I do not want to predict the outcome of the budget allowances but this report will be considered very carefully because that is in the country&rsquo;s interests. </p>  <p>  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has signed off in general with Ministers in respect of the budget for 2017 but it is an issue that concerns Government because the future years will in many ways depend on a world that is changing so rapidly and upon Ireland&rsquo;s flexibility to deal with those challenges and changes.  The third level sector has to be at the core of that.  The report will go to the committee and the Minister looks forward to hearing the views of the Deputies and parties and their observations on the priorities.  The budget will be outlined at sectoral level at the committees and will be presented by the Minister in October.</p></speech>

There are three options, each of which calls for increased State funding.  The third level sector is in financial crisis.  The Committee of Public Accounts last year identified some institutes of technology as being in dire financial straits.  I do not want to name them here and create further embarrassment for them but they are in trouble.  It is a question of priorities and prioritisation.  We nailed our colours to the mast on this in our manifesto and have subsequently said there has to be a direct increase in allocation to the third level sector.  Otherwise we are storing up big trouble for the country.</p>  <p>  I asked the Taoiseach if he accepts the recommendations of the Cassells report.  Does the Government accept them?  There has been no statement from the Government, the Taoiseach or the Minister for Education and Skills other than that it is being sent to the committee.  Does the Government accept the recommendations of the Cassells report and will they be reflected in an increase in the forthcoming budget?</p></speech>

The expert report makes clear that doing nothing is not an option.  The Deputy would accept that it would not be fair for the Minister to say at this stage that he is nailing his colours to option A, B or C.  There are downsides to all the options and they are not without significant challenges.  It is only right and proper that, having accepted and received the Cassells report, which has been published, and members of the public and various bodies are sending in their views on it, that the Members of this House should have their say because these matters need to be teased out and there are no easy options yet something has to be done.  The Deputy knows that if we follow the concept of a student loan scheme the higher postgraduate achievers can add greatly to their earning power.</p></speech>

I recognise the scale of the challenge, as universities have pointed it out over the past number of years.  The Minister, Deputy Bruton, is focused on getting a ten year consensus on where we want to be with the education sector which includes a capital programme to provide for the many changes and challenges to come.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-07-20a.51" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1330" speakername="Gerry Adams" time="11:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016072000011#K00400"><p>Yesterday, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government released the State's latest homelessness figures.  Last month, 6,358 people were living in emergency accommodation, a shocking 2,206 of whom were children.  Child homelessness has increased by over 70% in the past 12 months.  Children are sleeping night after night in cramped hotels or unsuitable hostels.  These figures do not include those who are living in overcrowded housing, sleeping on someone else's floor or sofa or those waiting for emergency accommodation.</p>  <p>  Why are these people homeless?  It is not an accident or an act of nature.  Rather, it is because the Government and Fianna F&aacute;il before it failed to build social housing, tackle spiralling rents and help those in mortgage distress.  The Government ignored all the warnings about this pending crisis when Sinn F&eacute;in and others brought it to its attention.</p>  <p>  Yesterday, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, launched his action plan for housing and homelessness.  It has some merit, and Sinn F&eacute;in has welcomed its positive elements.  Clearly, the Minister is making a genuine effort to tackle the housing crisis, but it is results that count.  The Minister, like the Taoiseach, seems restrained by an ideological reliance on the market.</p>  <p>  What is not in the plan is as important as what is.  Crucially, it fails to address the most urgent aspects of the crisis.  It is not ambitious enough and not enough social housing will be built.  Gone is the dedicated court to tackle mortgage distress promised in the programme for Government.  There are no proposals to tackle spiralling rents.  Crucially, it commits a mere &euro;150 million in extra capital spending for social housing next year.  At the very best, that will deliver an extra 833 social houses next year.</p>  <p>  Whatever the longer-term impact of this plan, one thing is very clear.  Those in need of housing today, those sleeping in emergency accommodation tonight and those who will struggle to pay their rent at the end of the month are offered very little comfort by this plan.</p>  <p>  Why did the Government ignore the Committee on Housing and Homelessness which called for a moratorium on home repossessions?  The committee included members of the Taoiseach's party.  Why is he walking away from the programme for Government commitments to help families in mortgage distress to stay in their homes?  If they are forced out of their homes, that will make the crisis even worse.</p>  <p>  Why did the Taoiseach ignore the call of the Committee on Housing and Homelessness for the introduction of rent certainty, linking rent to the consumer price index?  Why is the Taoiseach once again refusing to invest enough money in social housing to build and buy the homes so desperately needed by children living in emergency accommodation?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-07-20a.52" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1245" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="11:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016072000011#K00500"><p>Deputy Adams is well aware that what happened in this country over quite a long number of years left us in a position whereby we had neither the money nor the capacity to build what was needed in terms of affordable and social housing and to deal with the rising challenge of homelessness.  It is a complex issue.</p>  <p>  The Government spent quite an extensive period of time putting together all of the elements that relate to housing, be they homelessness, social and affordable housing, mortgage arrears, renters, voided dwellings and houses that are not in use for whatever reason.  All of these factors have been included in the action plan for housing, the first chapter of which deals with homelessness.  As Deputy Adams knows, the reasons for homelessness are not as simplistic as statistics might suggest.  There are stories behind each of the cases of homelessness that the Government wants to address. </p>  <p>  That is why, as the Minister, Deputy Coveney, pointed out yesterday, the detail of the first chapter of the action programme deals specifically with homelessness.  We know from the report of the housing authority that 4,152 adults used State funded emergency accommodation nationally during one week in June 2016.  That survey identified 1,078 families in emergency accommodation, consisting of 1,457 adults and 2,206 dependents.  The number of homeless families increased from 620 in June 2015, a 74% increase, while the dependent figures increased by 67% and were 1,318 last May.  Details of homeless families have been recorded since July 2014 when a total of 344 families with 749 dependents were homeless.</p>  <p>  It is the recognition of these kinds of statistics that have brought about the significant investment by the Government.  The challenge is to prove that the action plan works and will be implemented.  That is why 47,000 social units are envisaged, with a spend of &euro;5.3 billion to deal with this issue in a comprehensive way.  Social units alone will not solve the problem.  Rather, we will provide opportunities for those who are homeless to be housed with quick build and rapid build solutions, voided solutions, repairing houses, the acquisition of houses that are empty and, as the Deputy said, the opportunity to deal with mortgages.  Significant numbers of previously distressed mortgagees are now paying their way.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Justice and Equality will introduce a new service in respect of MABS for the thousands of cases - I understand the total is 35,000 - where there has been no communication between borrowers and lenders for whatever reason.  We need to be able to deal with that in a different format rather than people receiving formal notices from banks.  There is a solution to these problems, but they need to be worked on.</p>  <p>  In respect of the discussion that took place yesterday and will take place again tomorrow, the challenge for the Government and everybody else is to make this work.  I commended Deputy Curran and the Committee on Housing and Homelessness.  The Government did not accept all of the recommendations, but a special appendix was inserted which dealt with each of the proposals made by the committee, which we welcomed.  Not all of them were accepted, but they were commented upon favourably.</p></speech>

It started when this and previous Governments reneged on the State's responsibility to provide homes for citizens.  That is the crucial element to all of this.</p>  <p>  Yesterday, the Taoiseach tried to blame local councils for the lack of social housing, yet the Government has failed to provide sufficient funding to allow councils to build and buy houses.  He is still not providing sufficient funding.  The plan promises to meet the needs of 131,000 families over six years, but 94,000 will remain in the private rental sector and will be subsidised by the State through HAP, RAS and leasing.  How is that not an over-reliance on the private sector, guided not by housing need but rather by the ideological position of the Government?</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach commended the Committee on Housing and Homelessness - it is the most commended committee in the D&aacute;il.  A lot of nonsense is talked about new politics.  The Taoiseach did not take on board some of the major findings and recommendations of the committee.  The number one priority recommendation of the committee was to increase the housing stock by 10,000 units per year every year.  The Government's proposal falls 40% short of this.  Government Deputies signed up to the plan.  The Taoiseach has ignored this issue. </p>  <p>  He also ignored my other questions.  I asked the Taoiseach to tell me why the plan falls 40% short of the number one priority recommendation of the committee.</p></speech>

He is well aware that in the so-called boom times up to 90,000 houses were built per year, and the figures collapsed to fewer than 10,000.  This is the most comprehensive and significant investment in the history of the State in terms of dealing with construction, housing and homelessness.  The plan also includes mortgages, renters, voided units, ghost estates and so on.</p><p>This is a genuine attempt, taking into account the views right across the spectrum, of the Government to drive this process so that people can have a home and a roof over their head, so that they do not have to be in bed and breakfasts or hotel rooms and so that those who are on the streets are looked after, but also there is an opportunity to provide affordable houses for those who need them and opportunities for local authorities to deal with the situation.</p> <p> I served on a council myself many years ago and at that stage it was building more houses than were required both in isolated areas and in towns, but councils lost the ability to provide houses in numbers for people.  Housing associations do a good job, but it is about time county councils got back into the business of providing houses.  They have been given the money, the opportunities and the incentives to open sites that are currently off limits, and they must get on with the job.  This is a challenge for everybody.  It is a real priority for the Government.  This is the biggest investment in the history of the State in this area.</p></speech>

I outlined my concerns and those of politicians, trade unions, civil society and NGOs.  The main concern was TTIP's aim to remove any regulatory barrier to profits and the profit-making potential of multinational and transnational companies.  There were also concerns about banking, agriculture, the environment, food safety, workers&rsquo; rights and education.  Of particular concern was the investor-state dispute settlement mechanism, ISDS, which gives foreign investors the right to sue a sovereign state with a democratically elected government for loss of profits resulting from public policy decisions.  I asked for a debate, and six months later we got two and a half hours in the last week of the previous D&aacute;il, which was then dissolved.</p>  <p>  The latest round of talks on TTIP began recently.  We know that the US President, Mr. Obama, wants to speed up the TTIP agreement process.  That is in spite of the fact that more and more voices are expressing concern, including some leading EU politicians, and that the protest against TTIP is gaining momentum.  There are also implications from the outcome of the Brexit referendum, because the UK was one of the main EU supporters of TTIP.  There is a worry that TTIP will erode the gains developing countries have been making through the World Trade Organization, such as some of the sustainable development goals.  Trade policies have a role to play in eradicating poverty but they can also contribute to further poverty and inequality.</p>  <p>  In the meantime there is CETA, the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement.  I question the rush to support CETA.  The line and the spin seem to be that there are opportunities for Irish businesses, but that is to ignore the concerns people have about the agreement.  Those concerns are economic, financial and also constitutional.  The ISDS settlement will create a new legal power to make a charge on the state.  Article 29.5.2&deg; of the Constitution says that the State must seek the approval of the D&aacute;il to sign up to an international agreement that is likely to place a charge on the State.  We have an example from Egypt, where the government was trying to increase the minimum wage and it now faces a lawsuit from a multinational company for the extra costs on it.  We face a provisional application of CETA, and if we sign it, that means the agreement will come into effect in this country and in other EU member states before the D&aacute;il and the other parliaments in the EU have a chance to debate it or vote on it.  I suggest that we do not allow the agreement to come into effect without thorough investigation and clarification of the economic, financial and legal implications, and also in the interests of our constitutional integrity.  There is a real fear that CETA and TTIP will benefit a global business model over local people, and that could also have an impact on our efforts to solve the housing and homeless crisis.</p></speech>

Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan is well aware of the Canadian deal, CETA.  It was originally assumed to be a done deal and that it would just be signed by the European Commission.  In fact, it has been determined to be a mixed agreement which includes both European and national competencies.  Therefore, the elements that are appropriate to Europe will be dealt with by it, and the government of each country will have to approve the agreement in terms of its own provisions, which will obviously require lengthy discussion in some countries.</p>  <p>  In respect of TTIP, there is a great distance yet to go in that regard.  Work is starting on the 14th chapter.  It was originally agreed to start the discussions when Ireland held the Presidency of the Council of the European Union in 2013.  There were two very good teams, on both the American side and the European side, and they began to discuss the many complex areas involved in TTIP.  It was assumed that the agreement could be concluded towards the end of this year but, personally, I doubt whether that will happen.  It will probably go some distance beyond that.</p>  <p>  It is a precondition of the negotiations that there can be no dilution of standards in labour conditions, the environment or health.  It is an issue that is proposed to be completed.  It is different from the old type of dispute and the way settlements can be arranged.  I assume that if and when the discussions on TTIP are concluded, the opportunity for a couple of million jobs either side of the Atlantic is one attraction, but there are issues that need to be teased out.  On the European side, we have reading rooms close to Government Buildings and all of the information and notes are online for everybody to read, assess, understand and comment on.  There is no secrecy in any of the deliberations from the European end in respect of TTIP.  That does not apply from the American side, as it takes a different view.  For us, the negotiations are all in public and up front.  For those who wish to involve themselves in a deeper way, we have provided specific reading rooms for elements of the chapters that have already been concluded and those that are currently under discussion.</p></speech>

We cannot provisionally apply CETA for a number of reasons.  First, the EU is waiting for the decision from the European Court of Justice on the EU-Singapore free trade agreement, and that is not expected until the end of this year or early 2017, and there is also an issue with the legal analysis that ClientEarth has done.  I urge the Taoiseach to look at that, because it found that the proposal was in violation of EU law.  In addition, a German political party is filing a lawsuit against CETA in the German constitutional court.  Will the Taoiseach indicate at the Council of Ministers meeting in October that we will not sign up to the provisional application of CETA, and in the meantime could he seek a ruling from the European Court of Justice on the ISDS?  Under Article 218.11 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Ireland can seek to clarify the legality of the investment arbitration proposals in CETA.  There are significant implications for Ireland if the ISDS goes through, because corporations and multinationals can sue the State for loss of profit and potential profit.  The Taoiseach has agreed to have a debate on the issue.  I hope we do not have to wait six months for the debate on this aspect of the agreement as we did for TTIP.</p></speech>

The European Commission negotiates on behalf of the Union in that regard on the basis of specific mandates of instruction given to it by the Council of Ministers.</p>  <p>  The TTIP proposal is one of a number of new-style trade agreements, as the Deputy is aware, that the EU is negotiating that not only covers tariffs, services and investments but also regulatory coherence and co-operation.  It would be the world&rsquo;s largest bilateral trade and investment deal.  A recent EU study showed that this country would gain approximately 1.4% in GDP from the deal.  This is not about reducing standards or increasing costs for SMEs; it is about setting down world standards for trade for the coming years.  There is some distance to go in the negotiations, which are still ongoing.</p><p>I will come back to the Deputy in respect of his comment about the European Court of Justice.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-07-20a.69" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1347" speakername="Mattie McGrath" time="11:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016072000013#M00200"><p>The South East Economic Monitor report produced by the Waterford Institute of Technology, WIT, school of business confirmed that unemployment in the south east is at crisis levels and is rising.  It currently stands at 12.5% compared to other regions that are experiencing a national trend of 8.4%.  The report finds further that the quality of employment in the south east is dramatically lower than the national average and continues to deteriorate.  The report also identifies that the reason the south east economy is struggling is due in large part to the inactivity of the IDA, Departments and Enterprise Ireland in the region over the last three decades.  The south east is missing a total of 6,312 IDA-supported jobs.  I am delighted the Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy John Halligan, is here because he understands this.</p>  <p>  In Tipperary alone in the last few months, we have seen the closure of Suir Pharma in Clonmel with the loss of 134 jobs, Ranbaxy in Cashel with the loss of 140 jobs and of Clonmel Chemicals and Gleesons in Borrisoleigh.  Two of those companies were indigenous, homegrown companies that had survived a number of recessions and gave valuable employment over the years.  </p>  <p>  The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, in his previous incarnation as Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation announced an action plan for jobs for the south east and that the IDA would, over five years, invest &euro;150 million in a capital investment programme to help attract more multinational jobs to the regions.  Yet, there was no mention of County Tipperary in that report, even though the Minister, Deputy Bruton, came to Tipperary for a wife.  I am surprised he forgot about us.</p>  <p>  The south east and County Tipperary, in particular, cannot endure this level of underachievement and underinvestment.  The focus of the IDA must be improved.  Will the Taoiseach and the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor, escalate the activity of the IDA to drive inward investment into counties like Tipperary and restore fairer and more sustainable regional balance in terms of unemployment?</p>  <p>  I was delighted to be a part of the Taoiseach's negotiations on the programme for Government.  The goal of the new Government will be to deliver 200,000 jobs by 2020, of which 135,000 will be outside of Dublin.  I think that is very important.  I am not anti-Dublin but it is vital that we work to eliminate the two-tier economy that is emerging in our country.  This is even more important in light of the inevitable economic impact of Brexit after the recent referendum.  Will the Taoiseach, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and all Departments to look at rural-proofing any legislation they introduce and insist that the IDA step up to the mark, carry out more visits to County Tipperary and be more encouraging and supportive of businesses?</p></speech>

Yesterday, the Government approved grant assistance for an expansion of an industry in Tipperary.  In general, unemployment in the south east is down from more than 20.1% in 2012 to 11.9% at the end of 2014.  There are 23,200 additional people in employment from the south-east region since the launch of the Government's action plan back in 2012.  There was an 18% increase by 2014 in firms supported by the south-east local enterprise office.  The Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, informs me that a comprehensive proposal will be put together for the south east.  People from Tipperary were represented at a meeting held in Kilkenny recently where the presidents of WIT and Carlow IT and others came together to focus on what they can do collaboratively to continue to make the area more attractive as a location for investment.  This involves local authorities, Enterprise Ireland, the IDA, other NGOs and organisations, chambers of commerce and so on.</p>  <p>  Revenue from overseas visitors increased by 20% to more than &euro;200 million between 2011 and 2013.  In the hospitality sector, the south east is going to add immeasurably to Ireland's Ancient East in the time ahead.  There is a lot of activity.  The Action Plan for Jobs continues and is monitored by my Department.  It is Government policy to spread the vast majority of new jobs outside the major cities.  The broadband proposal, opportunities for power, communications and water are all things that are important in making a location attractive.  As Deputy Martin said this morning, the importance of young graduates coming through from third level colleges is an added incentive and bonus there.  Deputy McGrath can take it that the south east, no more than any of the other region, is a focus and a particular priority for the Government and will continue to be so.</p></speech>

Part of the reason for the continuing stagnation of the economy in the south east is down to the administrative burden being placed on SMEs and other business ventures that are having their entrepreneurial vision and passion restricted or crippled.  In reply to a parliamentary question I recently submitted, I was told that the various Departments identified the cost of the administrative burden for businesses nationally at approximately &euro;320 million annually.  That is a frightening figure.  I know that during the talks on the programme for Government, the Taoiseach mentioned a reform of the public services and all of the agencies.  We need that figure to be driven down because people need support, not restraint.  They have the initiative and the energy but they want to be allowed to do their job.  Some &euro;320 million is an astonishing figure that could be spent on, or could do, many other things.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach mentioned Ireland's Ancient East and all of those ideas.  They are wonderful and there is wonderful buy-in from rural communities as well.  However, this is about investment, attracting FDI, site visits and visits to the county by the IDA.  All of Tipperary and I expect that the county will get a fair share of the cake; no more, no less.</p></speech>

When one looks at the entire sector, unemployment is down from 20% to 11.9%, although that is still too high.  Every region has its attractions and its strengths.  The comprehensive programme being referred to by the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, is another opportunity to build on that.</p>  <p>  In respect of the Brexit outcome, the Government has decided to increase staffing numbers over time in our overseas offices, particularly in regard to trade.  It will be necessary to reach new markets and so on for goods and products that we produce.  I met with the IDA and Enterprise Ireland quite recently, both of which are powerful agencies.  World standards apply in both their cases.  They have full Government support to continue working with companies here that are exporting and with FDI coming into Ireland.  Yesterday, the Government approved sizeable grant assistance for an industry in the Deputy's own county of Tipperary.</p></speech>

That is from the programme for Government.  The Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, ward watch figure for this week show a spike in trolley numbers for the second week in July.  It shows an increase of 38% compared to the same week in 2015.  The figure was reduced for the month of May by 14% and the month of June by 24%.  However, last week's figure confirms that 1,839 patients admitted for care were on trolleys compared with 1,336 for the same period last year.  Will the Taoiseach confirm that this bed capacity review has commenced, and if not, when it will commence?</p></speech>

He met with the HSE last Friday regarding measures to tackle waiting lists and hospital bed capacity.  The Minister requested the HSE to prepare an action plan setting out specific measures it will implement, in conjunction with hospitals, from now to the end of 2016 in order to tackle waiting lists.</p>  <p>  The bed capacity review is part of the overall presentation of where we want to be with the health system over the next ten years.  I am glad that most Members and the parties here generally buy into what kind of health system we want to have over the next ten years.  I will give Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin an update on the commencement date and progress that is being made. </p></speech>

The programme for Government makes numerous commitments about the management of hospital referrals.  However, the MRI unit in Cork University Hospital recently sent letters to Dr. Nick Flynn, a general practitioner in Hollyhill, Cork, detailing the patient referral system operating in that unit.  The letters say that patients referred to the unit by a GP will not receive an appointment.  Referrals have to be made by a consultant in order to obtain a scan.</p>  <p>  However, one of the letters goes on to state that GP referrals would be accepted where the patient was willing to self pay or had health insurance.  Therefore, wealth, not health, is the decisive factor.  As the Taoiseach knows, in some cases the waiting time is two years.  Will the Taoiseach ask the Minister for Health to investigate this downright offensive act of medical discrimination whereby vulnerable patients are not given their scans or referrals as required?</p></speech>

The Government wants the best outcome to be made available for all patients.  That is why the universal health system should apply to all.  The Minister for Health is focusing on a ten-year programme.  In addition, the &euro;300 million which was put into the budget last year and the extra &euro;500 million this year will go to deal with many of the more difficult issues that have been in the health system for some time.  I am sure the Deputy welcomes the announcement yesterday of legislation on medical cards for recipients of the domiciliary care allowance.</p>  <p>  As regards GP referrals, we have had a two-tier health system for so many years.  That is why the Government's emphasis is on providing a universal health system that applies to everybody.  In that way, people can have medical attention as close to them as possible when they need it.  That is where the Minister's focus and priority will be.</p></speech>

The point of those provisions was to provide a legal basis for people to trace their natural parents where possible.  There is a growing consensus in the House that it is the right thing to do.  The Taoiseach will remember that this matter was championed by the former Deputy, Anne Ferris, and was supported by Deputy Joan Burton.</p>  <p>  I understand that the Government has decided to separate these provisions from the remainder of the adoption (amendment) Bill in the legislative programme published to date.  Can the Taoiseach give the House an assurance that the provisions on tracing will be brought before the House, and when that will happen?</p></speech>

The recommendations show that the commission's name is apt and well-earned.  It is, indeed, the low pay commission.  In any case, there has been talk in recent times of leprechaun economics and here it is - pots of gold for tax-evading multinationals and insulting pay recommendations for the little people.</p>  <p>  I have a question on promised legislation as follows.  My understanding is that there is a requirement to amend minimum wage legislation in order to change the rates.  Is the Government prepared to reject this recommendation and go for something which would take low-paid workers out of poverty?  These are poverty pay rates, so is the Taoiseach prepared to go above that and settle on a rate which is far more in line with what low-paid workers need?  </p>  <p>  The House's budget committee-----</p></speech>

The Deputy will be aware that, before his time here, the previous Government reversed the cut to the minimum wage and increased it subsequently.  The Low Pay Commission has made its recommendations, taking into account its view of the economic road ahead, including the consequences of Brexit.</p>  <p>  Yesterday, the Government agreed to give approval for publication of the report, and I expect it will be discussed here.  The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation has three months to respond and will consider carefully this recommendation from the Low Pay Commission.  The Minister will return here in September, as is required under law, in respect of the proposal she will make to Government arising from the recommendation of the Low Pay Commission.  </p>  <p>  There was also a minority report as part of the recommendation.  The reason for establishing the Low Pay Commission was to have an objective, structured way of recommending increases.  Work should be seen to pay, so it is important to have that incentive for people to go to work.  Clearly, however, when one increases the minimum wage, it has a knock-on effect further up the line for those on low pay.</p></speech>

I refer to one in particular, security of tenure for people who are currently subject to repossession proceedings.  When will the new court be in place?

What is the position concerning people who are currently the subject of repossession proceedings before the courts?

In fact, the promise is to increase the number of speech therapists by 25%, bringing the number to over 1,100.  I raised this matter a couple of weeks ago with the T&aacute;naiste.  On that occasion, she informed me that a lot of money was being put into it and it was hoped to make progress.  However, the problem was that they could not find adequate and properly qualified people available.</p>  <p>  Since then I have been contacted by many people who tell me they are on a HSE panel for speech therapists.  That panel has over 300 speech therapists on it, but the problem is that they are not being sanctioned for recruitment.  That is the case all over the country.  </p>  <p>  In my particular area, many people are waiting for speech therapy services, including preschool children in particular, but they cannot get them because there are no speech therapists since they are not being recruited.  I want a commitment from the Taoiseach and the Government that before September speech therapists and occupational therapists will be recruited.</p><p>I understand there are more than1,000 of them on a HSE panel waiting to be appointed but these appointments are not being sanctioned by the Government.</p></speech>

The position adopted by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources does not stand up to any independent scrutiny.  The proposal has been carefully couched so as not to contravene European law.  The hoary old chestnut of a reply that there is no clear definition of what constitutes contemporary Irish music in all its diversity that would convince the EU authorities that we have legitimate case for legislating for a quota in Ireland is wrong.  Why was it possible for France to do it?  Perhaps in the context of Brexit the European Commission will cop itself on and realise that we have some degree of independence, particularly in our culture and music.</p><p>Surely the Department is aware that the EU authorities have already sanctioned the definition of contemporary Irish music submitted by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland to the Commission in the last decade of the last century.  What blocked that proposal was an objection from the independent Irish radio sector, which felt that the awarding of the quota if sanctioned by the EU might be used as a legal tool to discriminate against the predominant form of popular music that they were promoting in their stations throughout Ireland, particularly in Dublin.  The quota is now down to 3%, even though the original contract provides that it should be 30%.  We have sat on our hands and allowed this to happen.  We have the legislative tools to deal with this issue, particularly this Bill.</p><p>This legislation is tightly framed, but there is no proposal that cannot be improved by amendment.  I was careful to remain within the legal parameters of what is permissible under EU law.  The definition provides: &quot;.....the music and lyrics should be composed and performed by persons in authentic sympathy and in tune with Ireland's unique cultural ethos&quot;.  As stated by Johnny Duhan, because our songs are now primarily written in English, it is often alleged that Irish music culture is part and parcel of a link or nexus with the UK or the US.  That is not the case.  We have a rich musical culture of our own, stemming from our Celtic past, which we have developed in a modern way through engagement with other national cultures.</p><p>I should point out that nowhere in the Bill is the nationality of the proponents of Irish music specified.  As such, Ministers who come forward with that excuse are ill advised or do not understand what the Bill seeks to achieve.  A lot of prominent Irish musicians and composers who know the situation on the ground endorse the idea of introducing a quota, including Danny McCarthy, Christy Moore, Paddy Moloney, Brendan Grehan, Paul Brady, Mary Black, Frankie Gavin, M&iacute;che&aacute;l &Oacute; S&uacute;illeabh&aacute;in, Steve Wickham, Jimmy McCarthy, Sean and Delores Keane, Finbar Furey, Finbar Wright, Sean Tyrell, M&aacute;irt&iacute;n O Connor, Peadar &Oacute; Riada and Louis Walsh.  I intend to hold a press launch in respect of this Bill in late September and to meet with all Deputies and Senators to discuss why it is necessary.  I will hold a meeting in the AV room at the end of September for that purpose, and, perhaps, an impromptu concert as well.</p><p>I know that people were shocked by the viewing figures of over 500,000 for RTE's &quot;Late Late Show&quot; country music slot.  Mr. Tubridy was in awe in that regard.  While he often travels beyond the Pale, he might want to travel further afield to the real country, where he will discover the importance of country and western music.  Venues across the country are packed out, including in Westport, which is in the Taoiseach's area, and in Ballinrobe.  In Ballymore, which is in my own constituency, the August weekend music festival is one of the largest in the country.  I invite my colleagues to attend.</p><p>Traditional c&eacute;il&iacute; music and Irish dancing are flourishing.  There will be more than 350,000 people in Ennis for the national fleadh next month.</p><p><i>1 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p> <p>John Creedon covers it in short programmes.  Irish TV covers it for two or three hours every night.  It is time our national broadcaster got its finger out.  Folk music is similarly well acknowledged across the country.</p> <p> This quota covers Irish music of all genres.  Thousands of the finest Irish musicians are being excluded from our airwaves simply because we have allowed ourselves to be steered by musical trends and fashions constructed primarily in the US and Great Britain.  In the context of the new make up of the D&aacute;il, the current political dispensation and the supposed new politics, I look forward to seeing this Bill become fully fledged, important legislation on the Statute Book.  It will protect our musical heritage for future generations of our citizens.  They deserve nothing less.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-07-20a.138" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1232" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="12:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016072000016#P00900"><p>I move:</p><blockquote>That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to regulate wind turbines through providing limits on the exportation of product generated from wind turbines; protecting nearby dwellings from noise and shadow flicker by providing minimum set back distances; allowing access to public consultative processes and related matters.</blockquote><p>This issue has huge implications in rural areas.  Never mind regulations, the previous D&aacute;il and the previous Government failed to put in place guidelines for this industry.  We urgently need regulations for wind farms.  They continue to be built, particularly in the midlands, without proper guidelines or regulations.  Four Ministers worked over a period of five years and failed to put them in place.  I and other Deputies raised this issue continually in the past two and half years and promises were made to us.  The result is Wild West-type development of wind farms in Counties Laois, Offaly and Westmeath.  A large development is planned for Cullenagh in County Laois with no protection for the landscape or rural dwellers in that area.</p><p>We are hoping to introduce some common sense.  This Bill seeks to introduce practical regulations that can be implemented so that wind farms are located in the right places.  The regulations would allow for sensible development and the protection of our landscape and rural dwellers.  The Bill deals with excess product.  Where there is a surplus, this can only be exported when approved by a Minister.  It is a very serious issue.  It is only where the Minister for communications, climate change and natural resources deems that there is an excess that it can be exported.</p><p>The location of wind farms is dealt with.  The set back distance will be ten times the height of the wind turbine to the tip of the blade.  Noise levels would have to be within WHO limits and shadow flicker from a propeller would not be permitted to pass over a house.  It deals with the issue of public consultation so that it is real public consultation with local communities rather than cosmetic consultation.  Crucially, it gives back power to local authorities which was taken away by previous Governments in which Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin took part and the last Government in the noughties.  The Critical Infrastructure Bill took away the power to zone land for wind farm development from local authorities.  This Bill would give back the power to make those decisions to elected councillors.  The issue of co-ownership is dealt with.  The Taoiseach will have noticed that wind farm developments have come up against huge resistance because there is no element of local ownership.  In line with the practice on the Continent and other continents, our Bill provides local communities, particularly those within 4 km, with the opportunity to buy up to 20% of shares in the company and get a return.  This could help disadvantaged areas such as areas with marginal land and sparsely populated areas.</p><p>We are putting this Bill forward as a sensible and practical approach to deal with an issue that has met with huge resistance.  We see the need to have some wind farm developments and for them to be part of meeting our targets for green energy but we do not see them as the complete solution.  Other methods such as solar power and hydro power need to be developed.  I ask the Government and Fianna F&aacute;il to accept the Bill in good faith, take it on board and allow it to go to the next Stage.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-07-20a.146" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1254" speakername="Ruth Coppinger" time="12:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016072000016#P01700"><p>I move:</p><blockquote>That leave be granted to introduce Bill entitled an Act to end religious discrimination in admission to primary and post-primary educational establishments and to provide for full participation of pupils of all faiths and none in primary and post-primary educational establishments.</blockquote><p>We live in a State where in school admissions, it is perfectly legal to discriminate against a child based on that child's parents' religion or lack thereof.  This Bill seeks to end that discrimination.  We live in a State where we have a multitude of religious beliefs and a growing number of people of no religious belief yet in our schools we can segregate and discriminate on the grounds of religion.  We live and work side by side with people of different beliefs yet our schools are separating people on the grounds of religious division based on parents' belief.  This Bill would end that.</p><p>This Bill seeks to recognise that we live in a diverse society.  Society has changed hugely since schools were established in many cases and since the Equal Status Act gave permission to schools to segregate on religious grounds based on parents' belief.  There is a huge demand for change that has been shown by numerous polls.  Equate Ireland has published polls showing that 62% of people agree that school patronage in Ireland should be a key priority for this Government and that it is seen as something that must be changed, 82% of people agree with the concept that the Irish education system should be reformed so that no child is excluded because of their religion or lack thereof and 87% of people agreed that the State has a responsibility to ensure children do not experience religious discrimination in the school curriculum.</p><p>This D&aacute;il is very much behind that curve.  It seems that the Government is attempting to back track on what was the perceived belief in the previous Government that there would be a change to section 7(3)(<i>c</i>) of the Equal Status Act which permits this discrimination.  Instead, it would seem from reports that the Government plans to introduce a new system that would allow patronage to remain largely in the hands of the Catholic Church, retain segregation and not get rid of what is called the baptism barrier.  I think this is wrong and regressive.  It is timely that we bring forward this Bill to put pressure on the Government to recognise that society has changed and that it should reflect that change.</p><p>As well as removing the baptism barrier and the deletion of section 7(3)(<i>c</i>) of the Equal Status Act, the Bill also deals with some of the provisions in our Education Acts that take no account of children's religious viewpoint or lack of religion when they enter a school and allow them to be discriminated against throughout the school day.  There is a constitutional right to opt out of religious instruction but that right is not facilitated in schools on a daily basis.  It is a particular problem when large parts of the school timetable are given over to religious ceremonies, particularly First Holy Communion.</p><p>Those not of the Catholic religion or those not taking part in the ceremony are segregated within the class.  In many cases, what happens is that a child is put at the back of the class and must still listen to all of the religious instruction that is given to the other children.  The opt-out has to be facilitated and there has to be change in the education system whereby a school ethos does not prevail for all students throughout the school day.  We need an opt-in system, not an opt-out.  School facilities can be given over to parents who want to practise their religious beliefs after the school day ends.  I am absolutely in favour of that.  As a socialist, I stand for freedom of religious expression but I also stand for a complete separation of church and state.  A person's religion or personal belief should not be imposed on others by the State's laws and at the taxpayer's expense.  Who is paying for these schools?  These are all taxpayer-funded schools.  The staff and all the other facilities are paid for by the taxpayer.  We also need to amend section 37 of the Employment Equality Act to end religious discrimination against school staff.  This is a very important Bill and the Government should take note of it and move with the times.</p></speech>

The Bill I am introducing seeks to reverse a particularly bad decision of the former Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly.  Last year he made a very controversial amendment to the Planning and Development Act which allowed the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, for the first time in planning history, to place specific planning policy requirements on local authorities.  This amendment essentially gave the power to the Minister to impose very detailed planning proposals on local authorities irrespective of what the democratically agreed councillors in those areas had agreed to in their county development plans or local area plans.  Members will remember that this amendment was used only once, very controversially, to reduce the minimum apartment size that local authorities are allowed to approve in planning, which obviously will result in substandard and sub-sized apartment accommodation into the future.  What this Bill seeks to do in a very simple way is to repeal the controversial power that was given to the Minister by himself and by the Government of the day, and also to allow local authorities to determine, as is their statutory responsibility and democratic entitlement, the most appropriate planning frameworks for their development plans or local area plans.</p></speech>

The meeting provided the new Irish Government and the new Northern Ireland Executive with the opportunity to meet formally for the first time and exchange views on a wide range of issues of mutual interest and concern, especially in light of the recent UK referendum decision to leave the EU.  We had a detailed discussion on the potential impact of the UK referendum result.  It was agreed to work together to ensure that Northern Ireland&rsquo;s interests are protected and the benefits of North-South co-operation are fully recognised in any new arrangements that emerge as regards the United Kingdom&rsquo;s future relationship with the European Union.  Ten specific actions were agreed to optimise North-South joint planning and engagement on key issues arising following the UK referendum result.  This will include a full audit of key North-South work programmes to establish risks and likely impacts arising from the UK&rsquo;s planned withdrawal from the EU.  In the margins of the ministerial council meeting, I had brief bilateral meetings with the First Minister, Arlene Foster, and the Deputy First Minister, Martin McGuinness.  We agreed on the need to work together to preserve the benefits of the peace process in any future negotiations.</p>  <p>  While proposals for an all-Ireland forum were not discussed at the ministerial council meeting, the Government believes that there is a need for the widest possible conversation on the implications of the referendum result for Ireland, North and South, and for North-South relations.  We will continue to explore options to achieve this in a way that is not divisive.  I hope to bring forward proposals on this shortly and I will discuss these with all parties.  </p>  <p>  There is a clear need for broader public dialogue, including on an inclusive all-island basis, on all of the many issues that may face the people of the island, North and South.  There will also be an ongoing engagement with other parties in the Oireachtas.  This is in addition to the engagement with the Brexit stakeholder group, which has already  been meeting for some time now.   </p>  <p>  On Friday, 24 June, the then UK Prime Minister, David Cameron, telephoned to inform me personally of the result of the referendum and of his intention to resign.  He thanked the Irish Government for its support all through the process.  Irish and British officials met in Dublin following a commitment made by the Prime Minister and I to early bilateral engagement at senior official level on a number of issues arising in the context of the result of the UK&rsquo;s EU referendum.</p>  <p>  I spoke with the new British Prime Minister, Teresa May, by telephone on 13 July.  I offered her my congratulations and best wishes following her appointment that evening.  We discussed a range of issues of mutual interest, including the importance of continuing to work together to build on the excellent relationship that now exists between Ireland and Britain, our joint support of the peace process, and the wider development of co-operation between our two countries.  We also discussed the important challenges that arise from the recent vote by the UK to leave the European Union.  I outlined Ireland&rsquo;s key areas of concern and shared my perspective on the challenges that lie ahead in the forthcoming negotiations.  We agreed to stay in touch and that we would meet each other in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

Sinn F&eacute;in is a united Ireland party.  Fine Gael once described itself in this way also.  In the wake of the Brexit vote, we said that an opportunity existed for a referendum on Irish unity as contained in the Good Friday Agreement.  I welcome the Taoiseach's comments about the potential or possibility for a referendum on Irish unity arising from the Brexit decision in Britain.  I also want to welcome the Fianna F&aacute;il leader's move to this position.  The SDLP and the Irish Labour Party have expressed support for this.  I appreciate that the Taoiseach says this is not the time for such a referendum, and that is fair enough.  Achieving it will depend very much on political will.  That means the parties and Independents in this State and the wider society must work alongside people in the North to ensure all of this is on the agenda of the negotiations around Brexit which could be over two to four years, so we have a bit of space.  We need to be open, imaginative and inclusive in all these matters.  I also welcome the Taoiseach's commitment, which he reiterated today and at a meeting with party leaders last week - which I thought was a positive engagement and a good meeting - to establish an all-Ireland dialogue or forum to bring in as many sectors as possible.  I spent Monday afternoon at Stormont and there is big concern among many sectors - I know the Taoiseach picked this up himself - and fear in some cases about the impact that pulling the North against its will out of the European Union on the basis of a decision taken mostly in England will have.</p><p>Of course, there are challenges but I think the Taoiseach will be surprised at the number of sectors, who traditionally would not see themselves in this position, starting to think themselves into a different space.</p> <p> I put it to the Taoiseach that we need to ensure this is not put on the back-burner.  When would the Taoiseach see the first meeting of this forum taking place?  When would he see the dialogue commencing?  We must be persuaders on these issues; we cannot be passive.</p> <p> If I may say so, the issue of Irish unity is bigger than any of us.  It is bigger than any political party or anyone else.  There are challenges and there are opportunities and we face into them very positively.</p> <p> Perhaps the Taoiseach could also indicate, if it is feasible, when he will meet the new British Prime Minister, Theresa May, and when the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, will meet his counterparts in the North.  The lead British Ministers all voted in favour of getting rid of key elements, such as the Human Rights Act 1998, voted against or expressed dislike for elements of the European Convention on Human Rights which is integral to the political infrastructure of the Good Friday Agreement, and the British Prime Minister has made a point of emphasising and reiterating her Unionist credentials.  Therefore, we really need to be on our game, not only around the consequences of the vote to the leave the European Union but also in regard to the Good Friday Agreement consequences with what is arguably a more right-wing British Government in place in London.</p></speech>

I noticed a report published in the<i>Belfast Telegraph</i>on 28 June which indicated that there are now 100,000 children living in poverty conditions in Northern Ireland - some 25% of all children in that state.  The report indicated that 395,100 persons, or 22% of the overall population of Northern Ireland, in the year 2014-2015 were living below the poverty line.  If I was asking the question of Sinn F&eacute;in, I would ask Sinn F&eacute;in quite sharply how it defends being part of a government and presiding over a system that delivers that level of poverty within the state but my question is to the Taoiseach.  Obviously, we, on this side of the House, would argue that the solution is for working-class people, North and South, Catholic and Protestant, to organise to fight and to challenge the social conditions, the austerity and the capitalist property relations that lie behind them.  My question to the Taoiseach is whether these issues featured as part of his discussions and what solutions, if any, did he discuss with the political parties in the North as a means of addressing them.</p></speech>

It needs to be put back to the reform committee during the recess.  It is not fair to anybody trying to have meaningful discussion about these issues.</p>  <p>  There is broad agreement now about the need for an inclusive process to help define and address the many threats posed by the Brexit vote.  The new Northern Secretary, Mr. Brokenshire, stated on Monday that he could see everything being handled at the level of the North-South Ministerial Council.  This goes completely against the spirit of what is required.  It is an issue that goes beyond business as usual and there is no way it can be dealt with by a body which meets infrequently and has a different remit.  That is a body for discussion between two official entities.  It is not capable of the sort of broad inclusive dialogue that we need and that the Taoiseach articulated in his response.  Employers, unions, professional organisations and wider civic society have a wide range of concerns and they have to be listened to.</p>  <p>  I put it to the Taoiseach that we should have a form of national dialogue.  We do not need a politician-focused approach.  Equally, we do not need the type of forums we have held in Dublin Castle in the past.  It cannot and should not be State-heavy.  It should include business and other members of civic society, including younger people.  It should be fast, accessible and practical in terms of that dialogue around Brexit.  Will the Taoiseach outline any developments on this matter and what is to be done in the next two months to move it forward?</p>  <p>  To be absolutely clear, I do not favour an immediate Border poll, as advocated by Sinn F&eacute;in in the immediate aftermath of Brexit.  Some 55% voted to remain in the European Union.  One cannot automatically say that 55% would vote tomorrow morning for a united Ireland.  We need to be straight-up about that.  A united Ireland is about unity of people.  It is about persuasion, consensus and bringing people with us, not to now inflame passions unnecessarily or create unnecessary divisions.  The focus at present must be Brexit and ensuring that community groups, business people, trade unions and workers all have an input in trying to articulate their concerns and needs and then working a way through that.</p>  <p>  I asked the Taoiseach about the UK Presidency.  The British Government has stated it will not be taking that up.  I put it to the Taoiseach three weeks ago whether he would consider Ireland agreeing to participate as part of a multinational replacement Presidency.  Has anything happened on that matter and have we held discussions with the President of the European Council, Mr. Tusk, on what will happen next in that regard?  At some stage, the Taoiseach might answer, in the context of Question No. 4, whether or not he alerted the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade of the forum idea.</p></speech>

Fortunately, there was 20 years of good growth in trade and commerce between North and South and South and North.  Those businesses in the Border region - I am familiar with those in the two southern Ulster countries of my constituency, Cavan and Monaghan - that are heavily dependent on exporting to Northern Ireland and to the British market have already been hard hit by the weakening of sterling.  The Government and the Oireachtas need to focus on the immediate issues hitting business at present and there must be a case for some support for small and medium-sized enterprises that are heavily dependent on exporting to the sterling area.</p>  <p>  In this whole discussion, we all are mindful of the difficulties that will arise for exporters to the sterling area.  We must also be conscious of the exporters who will send their products through Britain to further destinations.  If there are customs and tariffs, products exiting Ireland and transiting through Britain to Asia and elsewhere will meet with additional costs.  Even if there are not hard borders, there will be customs and tariff regulations to be met.  That all generates additional costs.</p>  <p>  As the Taoiseach will be aware, the British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body was established in 1990.  The Taoiseach was a member early on, as I was.  We worked together, both representatives from the Oireachtas and from Westminster, in very difficult political times in the early and mid-1990s.  That body now is the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly and it has representatives from the Oireachtas, Westminster, the assemblies in Northern Ireland and Wales, the Scottish Parliament and from Jersey and Guernsey.  It was established in 1990 as a forum for discussion for Members of Parliament and members of political assemblies to discuss and consult on issues and areas of mutual concern and interest.  The British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly could be given an additional remit in ensuring that we use the parliamentary processes that are already in place.  We are not only talking about North-South.  Unfortunately, we are also talking about an east-west dimension as well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-07-20a.189" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1353" speakername="Brendan Howlin" time="12:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016072000018#R01100"><p>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for facilitating all of us.  These are really important questions.</p><p>As has been mentioned by a number of other speakers, representatives of all parties and groups in this House gathered in Government Buildings last week at the Taoiseach's invitation to discuss the implications of Brexit for the island of Ireland.  It was a very useful and constructive meeting and, surprisingly, there was much consensus.  There was unanimous agreement that a forum or dialogue between those North and South of the Border to tease out in real terms the implications of Brexit was urgently needed.  It was further agreed that the forum should be as broad-ranging and inclusive of all strands of society as was possible.</p> <p> I am trying to get my head around what has happened since.  I read the remarks of Deputy Martin and the Taoiseach's reply to questions at the MacGill Summer School.  It seemed to me that he is now in support of the Sinn F&eacute;in proposal calling for a Border poll.  The Taoiseach's comments yesterday in this House seemed to move back from that, and there was further clarity from Deputy Martin this morning.  The suggestion immediately infuriated Unionists in the North, who were already sceptical of the all-Ireland dialogue proposal.  It was unnecessary and unhelpful to inject fears about the objective of a forum into this, as it really would be a forum that would be to everybody's benefit on the island of Ireland.</p> <p> As Deputy Martin indicated, the Good Friday Agreement enshrined consent as the principle on which matters in Northern Ireland relating to constitutionality are to be determined.  There is not a majority in the North that would now vote for unification, according to all opinion polls, and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has made it clear there is no intention on behalf of the British Government to call for such a poll.  Plainly, it will not happen.  It is unfortunate in that context that there is in any way a connection by some between a proposal and a reality.  All of us would like to see the day arrive when such a poll would carry in the North.  To have any connection in the eyes of Unionists between proper and open dialogue on the impact of Brexit and how we can continue deep and meaningful co-operation on the island of Ireland, and a fast-track to a constitutional poll, would be unhelpful.</p> <p> I ask the Taoiseach to put things back on track and advance the idea agreed by all parties and groupings in the House in the Sycamore Room in Government Buildings last week to advance the dialogue we spoke about and return to serious thinking about relations that are inclusive, welcoming and not frightening for anybody on the island of Ireland.  Perhaps we can then think about preparing to accommodate Unionists in a united Ireland when that becomes a real possibility.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-07-20a.191" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1245" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="12:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016072000019#S00200"><p>Deputy Adams raised a number of points.  We had a good meeting last week with the different leaders of the groupings here.  It was a positive and constructive engagement.  I should make it clear that what is actually unique in respect of our position here is the Good Friday Agreement, as we are a co-guarantor of the Agreement with the British Government.  It deals with all the aspects of life in Northern Ireland and, by implication, North and South and east and west.  My point in Donegal was that the authors of the Good Friday Agreement in their vision put a clause in the agreement, and at some point in future - we are nearly 20 years on now - a Secretary of State might have evidence that would trigger that clause.  That evidence is not there now.  My following point was that, were it to happen at some point in future, the negotiations as part of the overall reflection on the Good Friday Agreement should ease the way if the majority of people in Northern Ireland said they wanted to leave the United Kingdom, and, having found themselves removed from the European Union and wishing to join a country - the Republic of Ireland - that continues to be a member of the Union, the road should be made easier for them.  It is just that point, and it might never happen.  As part of the overall discussions, the position should be catered for.  Clearly, there is no evidence of a majority in Northern Ireland voting for that now or in the immediate future.  One can consider the discussions we will have, and the Good Friday Agreement is central to that.  It is an issue the original authors foresaw and, whether it happens or not, they put in a clause that will allow for it to happen.  I am just continuing that for the time ahead.</p>  <p>  I would like to think we could have this engagement and conversation in September.  I agree completely with everybody that this is far bigger than any individual party, as it is about all the people.  This process should be enthusiastic, forward-focused, welcoming and inclusive, allowing for every person's view, whether he or she is an entrepreneur, a researcher, a farmer, a worker, a housewife or whatever type of citizen.  It is much too important not to have that happen.  In the 1980s, when the New Ireland Forum was set up, not all the parties agreed to join, and I remember the McGimpsey brothers attended on behalf of the Unionist party to give evidence in a personal capacity.  When one considers the implications of what we may have to deal with, it is very important that people have the opportunity, or whatever term we put on it, to have their point of view put forward.  Whether it is an island conversation, conference or opportunity, the issues need to be heard so that everybody understands the scale of what we are at.  I am receiving much interest from businesses North and South that want to express their opinions.  I would like that to be done in a non-divisive way, as it is in the interests of everybody that this should happen.  I am quite sure the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Flanagan, has been in touch with his counterpart asking for a meeting, and I spoke with British Prime Minister, Theresa May, saying that when it is appropriate, and as early as possible, we should arrange a meeting to build on the relationships we have had for quite some time.</p>  <p>  With regard to Deputy Barry's question, we have the North-South Ministerial Council, cross-Border activities and agencies working with each other because of social issues, as they reflect on the challenges, disadvantages and unfairness in many areas of society.  That is why the peace process has been backed by the European Union for all these years, and there is &euro;3 billion on the table between now and 2021 for fragile communities coming out of a conflict situation in which 3,000 people lost their lives over 30 years.  The overall intention is that Northern Ireland should be peaceful, prosperous and outward-looking and should be able to provide opportunity for its citizens.  That involves trade and business.  That is why we have the many discussions and activities going on and why we support, in both monetary and political terms, the likes of the A5 project and the north west gateway.  It is why we continue to be strong supporters of the Narrow Water bridge, the Ulster Canal and so many other activities North and South, including medical, educational and infrastructural projects.  These are social issues that have an impact in enclaves and areas where there have been difficulties - where the peace walls apply and outside them.</p><p>Cross-Border trade is of greater importance to firms in Northern Ireland dealing in goods and products with companies and people down here than <i>vice versa</i>.  The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation has been in touch with both IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, which have contacted their companies and small and medium enterprises individually.<br/><br/>The point made by Deputy Brendan Smith made is true.  One can leave the Republic with a lorry load of machinery and drive to the Ukrainian border but if controls and checks are in place, they will add to the amount of paperwork on the way in and out.  While hard borders have disappeared in many cases, there is the capacity with modern technology to track the movement of goods and conditions apply in terms of country of origin for raw material, products sourced for manufacturing and so on.  Ireland has improved greatly in terms of its competitiveness and we do not want to see anything happen that would damage it.  For us, one of the outcomes following Brexit should be that Britain would be as close to the Single Market as possible because that impacts on us and our interests including the common travel area, trade links, the peace process, the common Border and the opportunity to continue to expand.<br/><br/>We have discussed it before and I agree with Deputy Martin that the kind of conversation we should have should be about the future.  It should involve as many as is possible from across the spectrum, including young business entrepreneurs, academics, researchers, politicians and so on.  I agree it is not a static forum such as that of the 1980s, but it is an opportunity to be able to reflect on the many issues.<br/><br/>The British Government has stated that it is not accepting the EU Presidency now.  I know that others have expressed an interest.  Belgium has been referred to in this context.  There may be a statement later in that regard.</p></speech>

I understand it has been mentioned but I do not have confirmation of it.</p>  <p>  The British-Irish Interparliamentary Body, which is now the British Irish Parliamentary Assembly, the British-Irish Council and the North-South Ministerial Council present opportunities but we need a different sense of contact in respect of what we have to deal with here.  I was a member of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body in the beginning.  The idea was that we would become acquainted with the system and the members of the House of Commons and talk about issues.  It was a big success.  We should also not forget the North-South Interparliamentary Association which was set up by the former Ceann Comhairle and the speaker of the Executive.</p>  <p>  I agree with Deputy Howlin in respect of North-South dialogue.  It should be inclusive and broad-ranging in everyone's interest.  We are co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement.  The point he makes is important.  Comments about a Border poll or having a discussion about the future of the island, North and South, should not be connected or linked to an attempt to influence people's thinking in the North about an all-island situation.  This is much more immediate and of profound consequence.  It is important that we have access to the advice and views of the businesses and people of Northern Ireland.  I do not see why we cannot have that, while not interfering in any way with the politics or priorities of the parties in Northern Ireland or down here.  This is about people, North and South.  I agree it should be inclusive, comprehensive and welcoming and it should allow everyone to set out their stall.  Until such time as the British Government sets out its objective and its own horizon, it is difficult for Europe to respond in detail.  I note in some cases that it has referred to Article 50 not being triggered until the new year.  I think that might be the cause of some frustration in some European countries.  The Prime Minister will make a statement when she has reflected on it.</p>  <p>  From that point of view, I would like to speak to the leaders about my set of propositions and to have a conversation early in September.  We need it then so that we can move on, build on the consensus we have and get that of our friends and colleagues in Northern Ireland, while respecting their views.  It could be in everyone's interest.  I will work hard on it over the next few weeks.</p></speech>

Is a united Ireland something that cannot be named?  Is it something for which we do not have a responsibility?  Are we always to behave like Slattery's mounted foot and rubbish Sinn F&eacute;in's proposition, only to go for it later?  This is bigger than all of us.  We should become persuaders for Irish unity because we will not have a workers' republic, nor any kind of real republic, without the unity of the people of this island.  That is the Connolly proposition for those from the William Walker school of gas and water works socialism.</p>  <p>  We need to have an inclusive discussion in this House about new relationships.  The Taoiseach talks about people joining this State.  Does he think the people in the North are mad?  We want a new Ireland but look at our health services.  Why would any thinking person, in the Unionist community or otherwise, want to leave the public health service they have, for all its faults, to come to what we have here?  The same applies to all the other social and economic issues, such as homelessness, which press down upon us.  Partition created two conservative states on this island and while the focus has historically been on the Orange state, this one, as a result of the counter-revolution, was just as bad.  Let us reimagine Ireland not just as one part joining the other part and not as a 32-county free state, but as a new imagined Ireland to which the founders of the Fine Gael, Labour and Fianna F&aacute;il parties, as well as the party of which I am part, subscribed.  I say this provocatively because we need to be a bit provocative in looking at these matters.  We also need to expedite funding issues in this space.  It is not good enough that the failure of the British to start negotiations should put so many people under so much pressure, whether it is in respect of the Narrow Water bridge project, some other project in the Border corridor where capital investment is needed, or people on the PEACE or INTERREG programmes.  We need to push all of those ahead but, most important, we need to set aside time in this D&aacute;il to discuss these matters in a reasonable and rational but robust way.</p></speech>

I thought we had a broad agreement last week on an invitation to an inclusive dialogue without preconditions for people to ask about the implications of this profound change in the status of the United Kingdom for the people on the island of Ireland.  We invited people, whether farmers, industrialists, workers or employers, to come and talk to us.  Over the weekend that seemed to change.  The suspicion of Unionists and the dismissal by the DUP of the proposal were not well handled and it was not the Taoiseach's finest moment.  Notwithstanding that, the linking of this notion to the idea that it might speed up a Border poll and somehow hasten a vote on unity move what was suspicion to a feeling of being threatened.  This damages the prospect of it being as inclusive as we would want.  It has been characterised as a Sinn F&eacute;in proposition.</p></speech>

It is one thing to have a Border poll but it is another thing to win it and there is no point in posturing about polls that one knows will not be won or will not even take place.  James Connolly said the working class were the incorruptible fighters for Irish freedom.  In saying this, he understood that unity meant having a consistent line of defending and promoting the interests of working class people North and South and needed to be built from below by winning over Protestant workers to a united fight against inequality North and South of the Border.  Connolly was primarily an internationalist and his motivation was to break from empires, rather than siding with them or going into Government with people who were loyal to empires.  If we want unity we should start not by looking for corporate tax reductions, which will only come at the expense of working class people, or having a race to the bottom in the area of pay for working class people but by siding consistently with working class people, North and South, in the fight against austerity and inequality.</p></speech>

There is never anything wrong with talking about these issues.  I take the Deputy's point fully that there should never be a correlation.  There will be no Border poll now.  There is no evidence of a majority wanting to join the Republic.  My point is a different one in that it is about catering for the future, in whatever number of years.  If that were ever to be triggered, there is an opportunity to deal with that consequence in the discussions.  That is all.  It has nothing to do with immediacy in terms of a border poll.  People of the Unionist persuasion are fully entitled to their views and there should not be a false understanding that there is some kind of an attempt to have an immediate border poll to pressurise them into joining the Republic of Ireland.  That was never the intention and is not the case but in the interests of the island of Ireland and the people of Northern Ireland and the Republic, we should at least be able to discuss and hear their view of the challenges that will be faced now because of the consequence of the vote, particularly when Northern Ireland voted to remain a member of the European Union.  We need to have a rational, commonsense, inclusive way of doing that and I hope we can get that going in the interests of everybody.</p></speech>

Ireland has moved from 7th in the IMD&rsquo;s World Competitiveness Yearbook, up from 16th.  Our improved competitiveness has been central to recent strong economic growth.</p>  <p>  However, as the National Competitiveness Council has warned in recent months, the global outlook is precarious.  The recent UK referendum result adds to the uncertainty in the external environment.  The key challenge for us now is to remain focused on the addressing the competitiveness policy areas that are within our control domestically.  A programme for a partnership Government is committed to sustaining the focus on structural reform across the economy and to attaining a top tier competitiveness position.</p>  <p>  As a first step, last week I brought the council's forthcoming Competitiveness Scorecard to Cabinet where it was discussed.  It was also considered by Government yesterday.  I will be working with Ministers on the key issues identified by the council.  The Government is committed to ensuring fiscal sustainability.  We will step up investment in infrastructure.  We will drive the implementation of our research strategy Innovation 2020.  I will be, and I am, working with the enterprise agencies, IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, on consolidating our trading relationship with the UK and on broadening our trade and investment footprint in growth markets.</p></reply>

There are two areas I want to focus on in my supplementary question, first, the tax environment for entrepreneurs, that is, Ireland versus the UK.  It is widely accepted by investors that the UK is more competitive than Ireland on taxation incentives for entrepreneurs and attracts more businesses.  The UK has a more attractive income tax regime, for example, share option treatment, to attract multinationals and entrepreneurs.  That is an issue we have to examine.  Capital gains tax incentives for entrepreneurs are also much more favourable in the UK, as the Minister will be aware.  For example, the Irish capital gains tax, CGT, rate for entrepreneurs who sell their business is 20%, limited to the first &euro;1 million of gains.</p>  <p>  Second, in regard to corporation tax, in budget 2015 the UK Government set a policy objective of reducing it to 18% by 2020 and it has since announced a target of less than 15%, which challenges our corporation tax environment.  Given the regime for entrepreneurs and the regime for corporations, what does the Minister believe will be the effect of the reduced corporation tax envisaged in the UK on this country when we are competing for foreign direct investment?</p></speech>

There is huge uncertainty around this issue.  The Deputy asked me about capital gains tax and corporation tax.  I can assure him that I am working with the Minister for Finance and the Department of Finance.  We have put in a submission, as have other interested parties, and we will be following up that in the budget.</p></speech>

To rebut some of what the Minister said, in the World Bank rankings for ease of doing business across 189 economies, we dropped four places to 17th in 2016.  At our highest point we were ranked 10th out of 189 and we are now behind Estonia and Macedonia in world rankings.  The World Bank report states: "Ireland made paying taxes more costly and complicated for companies by increasing landfill levies and by requiring additional financial statements to be submitted with the income tax return."  It went on to outline the complexities of red tape and cost of compliance, which ultimately impacts on our competitiveness.  We have dropped to 17th in the rankings and we have also slipped six places in a ranking on how easy it is to start a business.  What is the Minister, her colleagues beside her and the Department doing to improve Irish competitiveness, which will help our entrepreneurs and job creators and society as a whole to progress and compete better on the international stage?</p></speech>

He quoted some figures which I will take on board.  The World Bank's annual Doing Business report measures and tracks changes in regulations affecting business.  Ireland has achieved an ease of doing business ranking of 17 out of 189 economies.  That is up two places from the previous year.</p>  <p>  The Deputy also asked about tax and, obviously, it is hugely important.  UK tax issues are a matter for the UK administration and Parliament.  However, we are working on it with the Department of Finance.  Our competitive 12.5% corporate tax is underpinned by a competitive regime.  That 12.5% rate sticks; it is absolutely written in stone.  Our world class research and development tax credit and our best in class OECD compliant knowledge development box are there to make sure that we are competitive.  Our low rate applied to a broad base ensures sustainable economic growth which will maintain tax revenues.  Ireland's foreign direct investment policy, of which tax is but one part, has attracted real and substantive operations to Ireland - the kind that brings real jobs.  We have has an enviable track record.  Ireland's transparent and competitive tax regime and our membership of the EU continue to provide a certainty that is valued by business.  Ireland has an English speaking business environment, ease of doing business and access to talent and consistently performs well on key international indices.  Ireland has a certain, stable and competitive offering.  Ireland is, and will remain, a member of the EU and the euro zone.</p></speech>

The Low Pay Commission was established last year through the National Minimum Wage (Low Pay Commission) Act 2015.  Its principal function is, once a year, to examine the national minimum hourly rate of pay and to make recommendations to the Minister in respect of the rate, ensuring that all decisions are evidence-based, fair, sustainable and do not create significant adverse consequences for employment or competitiveness.</p>  <p>  The commission submitted its first report in July 2015.  Its recommendation to increase the minimum wage from &euro;8.65 to &euro;9.15 per hour was accepted by Government and the increase came into effect on 1 January this year.</p>  <p>  In its first report, the commission recommended that anomalies in regard to PRSI which could adversely affect employer costs should be addressed.  To that end, adjustments were made to PRSI in budget 2016, which have been provided for by my colleague, the Minister for Finance.  These changes will assist employers in reducing costs, thus ensuring a continuing positive climate for job creation.  Measures were also introduced to ensure that the benefit of the increase was not lost to taxation for the employee.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the commission&rsquo;s second report on the national minimum wage was submitted to Government yesterday and the recommendation made by the commission that the national minimum hourly rate be increased by ten cent to &euro;9.25 will be considered by Government in the context of budget 2017.</p>  <p>  I reiterate that the independence of the Low Pay Commission is firmly established in the National Minimum Wage (Low Pay Commission) Act 2015.  The commission can only operate in accordance with that statutory remit and make recommendations to the Minister in accordance with the criteria that are clearly and explicitly set out in the Act.  I want to make it very clear that I cannot speak for the commission and I stress the value of its independence.  Clearly, the commission has to look at the matter across all the criteria of the Act.  We will look at the report over the next three months and the Minister will make a decision on it in respect of budget 2017.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-07-20a.285" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1327" speakername="Maurice Quinlivan" time="13:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016072000023#W00600"><p>I thank the Minister of State.  In the summer economic statement, the Government has given a commitment to increase the minium wage to &euro;10.50 per hour over a five-year period.  How does one get from the current minimum wage rate of &euro;9.15 per hour to &euro;10.50 over five years with a ten cent increase?  The answer is that it is impossible to do that.  On the other hand, if the Government is making statements about the projected increase in the minimum wage over a five-year period, then what is the function of the Low Pay Commission?  If the Government is going to set the rate, there is no need for a commission.  Therefore, what is the role of the commission?</p>  <p>  Yesterday's recommendation is an insult to workers.  It is a disgrace that a commission which costs the taxpayer almost &euro;0.5 million would propose a ten cent increase to minimum wage for low paid workers.  More than 70,000 people in the State depend on the minimum wage.  The living wage is &euro;11.50 per hour.  At this rate, it will take 23 years for a minimum wage worker to achieve a basic living standard.  Combined with the Government's deferral of addressing the situation of zero-hour and low-hour contracts this month, this recommendation tells us two things, namely, that the Low Pay Commission is not fit for purpose and that the Government has no interest in tackling low pay, poverty and inequality.</p></speech>

That is exactly what is laid out in the rules in the National Minimum Wage (Low Pay Commission) Act 2015, as passed in the D&aacute;il last year.  The independence of the commission must be respected and observed by all, including the Government.  Obviously, all the criteria must be taken into account in the legislation but the commission is independent.  It has met on 18 occasions since February 2015.  It has examined the available data and the 33 responses it received.  There was public consultation and it held meetings in Monaghan, Galway and Dublin and it met with a wide range of groups.</p>  <p>  Under the Act, the Minister must, within three months of receiving the recommendation in the report, make a decision and make the necessary order.  If the Minister departs from the recommendation or declines to make an order, the Minister must prepare to lay this before both Houses of the Oireachtas and state the reasons for his or her doing so.  I stress once again that the commission is independent.  I cannot speak for the commission nor can the Minister, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, and that is extremely important.</p>  <p>  The Deputy asked what considerations the commission takes on board.  It takes on board a wide range of considerations when it makes decisions, which are not made lightly.  The commission has looked at all the areas of concern for the employers and employees.  The commission's role is to ensure the wage is appropriate and is one employers and employees can sustain, which is extremely important.</p></speech>

However, I received a reply to a parliamentary question yesterday which stated that there were 22 meetings, so there is a slight difference there.  Is the Minister of State aware that the chairman of the commission earned &euro;22,493 from 2015 to the first quarter of this year?  In that period, according to the response we received, the chairman attended 22 meetings, which works out at approximately &euro;1,000 per meeting.  This is the person who is chairing the Low Pay Commission which yesterday recommended a ten cent increase for workers on the minimum wage.  Surely to God, if there was ever an example of gross hypocrisy, this is it.</p></speech>

The aim of the minimum wage is to have an incentive to work, which is extremely important.  A rate has to be set that is fair and sustainable to help as many people as possible without having a significant effect on the economy or a negative effect on employment.  That is where the commission is coming from.  It is made up of nine people, three representing the unions, three from the employers sector and three academics with expertise in the area.  We must support their independence.  They have made this decision based on what is fair and sustainable.  It is now up to the Government.</p><p>I am sure the Deputy has seen the report.

The Minister will be aware that my party tabled a Private Members' motion on this some weeks ago.

I will answer that in the supplementary reply.  He asked for the timetable for the review of the book of quantum and that is the question I will answer now.  The Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, is an independent statutory agency and, as Minister, I am not permitted in my executive function to interfere in any way with the day to day operations and functions of PIAB.  Section 54(1)(b) of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act 2003 sets out the principal functions of the board: &quot;to prepare and publish a document (which shall be known as the 'Book of Quantum') containing general guidelines as to the amounts that may be awarded or assessed in respect of specified types of injury&quot;.</p><p>The book of quantum was last produced in June 2004 and data was sourced by independent consultants on behalf of PIAB from a number of sources including the Courts Service, the insurance industry and the State Claims Agency.  PIAB is reviewing the book of quantum and has engaged outside consultants to assist in this work and it is due to be published in the second half of 2016. </p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">The book is not a recommendation for compensation levels but rather a reflection of the prevailing level of awards</font>, <font color="#2F2F2F">compensation values awarded by the courts, settlements agreed by the insurance industry, settlements agreed by the State Claims Agency, and settlements agreed through the PIAB process. </font></p></speech>

I would have thought it was fairly obvious from my question on the book of quantum that it was linked to the very obvious issue of motor insurance premiums and the scandal of the rip off at the moment.  I appreciate that PIAB is independent and I have met with it but as the Minister pointed out it has not updated the book since 2004.  There are several problems with car insurance.  Many claims are settled outside PIAB and the courts and the insurance company pay-outs are invisible.  Implicit in the information we do have on the claims pay-outs are the injuries and the levels of awards that are visible.  Unfortunately, the book of quantum seems to be very out of date.</p>  <p>  What will the Minister do to address the spiralling insurance costs?  Has she considered the model operating in the United Kingdom, care and not cash?  This applies to minor injuries.  The book of quantum will come up with a guide.  It will not be definitive or be a blueprint but it will help I hope to force down premiums.  Under the care not cash model, care such as rehabilitation and physiotherapy are awarded rather than a cash payment.  Has the Minister, the Department or the Government considered that in reviewing the book of quantum and the spiralling costs? </p></speech>

The objective of the review is to recommend measures to improve the functioning and regulation of the insurance sector.  The review will include an examination of the factors contributing to the cost of insurance.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, has established a task force in the Department to undertake the review.  The first phase of that review, dealing with the framework for motor insurance compensation, has now been completed and I understand the Minister for Finance expects to publish the report in the coming weeks.  The next phase of the review will focus on the factors contributing to the increasing cost of insurance.  This phase of the review will be overseen by a working group chaired by Minister of State, Deputy Eoghan Murphy.  The group holds its first meeting today and has scheduled further meetings for early September and the coming months.  It is proposed that an interim report will be provided to the Minister for Finance by the end of 2016.</p></speech>

There was an attempt last week to introduce an au pair Bill that would prevent those workers having access to the industrial relations machinery of the State.  I am very concerned about certain companies establishing here and practising which are paying workers well below the minimum wage and refusing them access to the Workplace Relations Commission.  I am talking in particular about Deliveroo.  How can the Minister regulate that and stop these things happening?</p></reply>

Most employment rights legislation does not apply to independent sub-contractors with the exception of health and safety and equality. </p><p>Ireland has a well-resourced and proactive labour inspectorate, which now forms part of the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC.  There are already existing mechanisms in place to tackle this issue.  Inspections are undertaken on the basis of risk analysis which identifies certain areas of focus.  Where the WRC inspection service receives complaints in relation to bogus self-employment or bogus sub-contracting, they are forwarded to the Revenue Commissioners and-or the scope section of the Department of Social Protection for investigation either solely by the recipient or jointly with the WRC. </p><p>In most cases, it will be clear whether an individual is employed or self-employed.  Where there is doubt in relation to the employment status of an individual, the relevant Departments and agencies will have regard to the code of practice for determining employment or self-employment status of individuals.  This code was drawn up and agreed in 2007 by the relevant Departments with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, and the Irish Business Employers Confederation, IBEC.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the Department of Finance and Department of Social Protection have recently conducted a joint public consultation on the use of intermediary-type structures and self-employment arrangements.  </p><p>There is a convergence of interests with my Department.  Apart from the significant losses to the Exchequer, the practice has serious implications from an employment rights perspective.  In this respect, it is important that individuals are correctly designated so that employees are not deprived of employment rights.  This is particularly the case for vulnerable workers. </p><p>The case highlighted by the Deputy is one example of the changes that are emerging in the world of work.  The European Foundation for Working and Living Conditions, Eurofound, has identified nine distinct new forms of employment.  The work of Eurofound reflects a common problem at EU and international level, and not just in Ireland. </p></reply>

According to the contract, the people who work for it are self-employed, so they do not deserve the minimum wage but are on &euro;4.25 or &euro;4.50 an hour.  They have no recourse or access to the WRC, and if any person attempts to go to the WRC or any other State machinery such as the Employment Appeals Tribunal, Deliveroo is indemnified against any costs or claims the person may make.  Deliveroo is a growing company.  I have a leaflet that was distributed to every home in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, not just restaurants.  It exploits, in a hyper way, young people, foreign students and very young students in this country.  A wage of &euro;4.25 an hour is unacceptable, as is not having recourse to State legislation.  Are we back to 1913?  Can the Minister of State give us some guarantees that this will stop?</p></speech>

There are new forms of employment all over Europe.  It is a problem for Europe, one with which Eurofound is dealing.</p>  <p>  The Revenue Commissioners examine the taxation problems for such workers and the scope section of the Department of Social Protection has the function of deciding whether a person is an employer or an employee.  It is important to point that out.  In the code of practice we discussed, there are criteria in place to determine whether a person is an employer or an employee.  I can send the information on to the Deputy.</p>  <p>  The WRC has a statutory authority to share information with Revenue and the Department of Social Protection.  A total of 575 joint operations took place between the two bodies in 2015 and 353 took place in 2014.  Many more inspections have taken place.  As the Deputy rightly pointed out, many problems arise in the food and hospitality sector.  The WRC has 56 inspectors to carry out this work.  I am satisfied that it has the necessary resources.</p></speech>

It is not that long ago that there were more dog wardens in the country than labour inspectors.  I worked for a union, tutoring in labour law.  We were acutely aware of the lack of resources for inspections.</p>  <p>  I do not want to take up too much of the Minister of State's time, but we have to go a bit further with this.  We need a mechanism in labour law which will insist that if a watchdog such as the WRC receives enough complaints from the public it can carry out a thorough investigation into the activities of any company, such as those I have mentioned, and the hyper-exploitation of young people.  If we let this happen, why would all bus drivers, teachers and nurses not be on self-employed contracts?  We are hurtling in that direction if we do not stop this.</p></speech>

There is employee sharing, job sharing, interim management, casual work, ICT-based mobile work, voucher-based work, portfolio work, crowd employment and collective employment.  I am satisfied that the WRC is doing its job.  Problems that previously took two years to solve now being dealt with in three weeks.  The WRC has the necessary resources and manpower, and we should let it do its job with the assistance of the Department of Social Protection and the Revenue Commissioners.

Prior to this, the lease had passed through number of State agencies since a 65-year lease was first taken out in 1969.  Carrisbrook House was 85% vacant for a number of years, despite having been actively marketed by Forf&aacute;s and the IDA.  The building was difficult to sublet, partly on account of the high cost of refurbishment.  The IDA also did not have vacant possession of the entire property due to an existing lease with a tenant which runs until 2025, thereby limiting its marketability further. </p>  <p>  After carefully considering the best course forward, the IDA decided to exit the lease with effect from December 2015 as it was the least costly option for the State.  The alternative was continuing to meet contractual obligations to pay rent over the remaining lifetime of the lease until 2034, together with meeting additional liabilities that arise in the context of the full repairing and insuring lease.  While the payment of &euro;9.4 million to exit the lease was a significant amount, it represents a saving to the State of an estimated &euro;13.65 million in comparison to maintaining the lease until completion.</p></speech>

It would represent a saving, but how was this allowed to happen?  What was the Minister's knowledge of it?  When did it come to her attention or that of the previous Minister?  How could something like this be allowed to happen, where &euro;10.4 million of taxpayers' money was spent on a property that is empty?</p>  <p>  The Minister has given me the background to the case, which I appreciate.  I appreciate that she is trying to do her best, but is she standing over this waste of taxpayers' money?  When did the Department become aware of it?  What have we learned from it?  Is this being repeated in other buildings?  We had this experience with the HSE in Galway, where it had to break a lease and pay almost &euro;1 million.  There is something seriously wrong with Government Departments that tolerate this type of policy.</p></speech>

The IDA commissioned the services of a professional property company to review a number of options, including the early surrender of the lease.  The agency carefully considered this advice, along with that of a real estate company and a financial services consultancy which also provided professional options.  After almost two years of discussions, and following intensive negotiations, the agency and landlord came to an agreement in late 2015.  Had the IDA decided to remain in the lease, it would have continued for an additional 19 years.  A tenant was in place that could not be moved.  The IDA tried to lease the building but failed to do so.  The building was vacant.</p></speech>

I became aware of the situation in the past number of weeks.  The decision to enter into this lease was taken a very long time ago, in 1969.  Given the nature of the lease and its terms, the State's hands were very much tied in terms of options to exit its contractual obligations.</p><p>Clearly, there is a need to prevent such a scenario from happening again.  I am confident that through the lessons learned we will make sure that this does not happen in the future.</p></speech>

The potential absence of the precautionary principle is also very worrying, as exposed in the leak by Greenpeace recently.</p></reply>

Such an agreement would be the world&rsquo;s largest bilateral trade and investment deal, and a successful conclusion is expected to benefit Ireland more than any other EU member state.  Ireland&rsquo;s enterprises are particularly well placed to take up opportunities to trade more easily with the US.  An independent study commissioned by my Department and carried out by Copenhagen Economics in 2013 suggests that the benefits to Ireland will be proportionally greater than in the EU as a whole.  These findings are backed up in a comprehensive independent report contracted by the European Commission, carried out by Ecorys and published on 13 May 2016.  Ireland strongly supports the negotiations and is working to ensure that our interests are fully reflected in the texts of the negotiations.</p>  <p>  Regulatory compatibility and co-operation is not about reducing standards or deregulation.  Rather, it is about facilitating increased business and trade opportunities between Europe and America and will make the trading landscape easier and more predictable.  That is particularly important for SMEs.</p></speech>

There is no real evidence whatsoever that Ireland will benefit from the TTIP.  Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan raised the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA, with Canada, which seems to be an attempt to get a foot in the door before the TTIP is agreed.  CETA includes an investor-state dispute settlement mechanism, ISDS, which would allow corporations to bypass the normal court process, which is a privilege members of the public could not possibly get.  If the agreements go through they will give corporations an incredible advantage in getting their way in any state in which they operate.</p></speech>

However, the treaties are foundation documents for all European decision making so TTIP negotiators must be cognisant of those in all negotiations.  Any final agreement will be subject to scrutiny by every individual government across the European Union.  Each of the 28 member states will be able to raise objections to any matters they consider might breach principles of the EU treaties such as the precautionary principle.  Added to that, if the democratically elected Members of the European Parliament feel that any proposed agreement undermines that clause, they may fail to ratify it.</p></speech>

I went to the reading room in the Department and compared the released document with a similar document in the agreement.  I was not allowed to bring anything out of the reading room but I was able to make comparisons.  I discovered that the Greenpeace document was 100% accurate, which is even more worrying.  The truth of the matter is that climate change, the environment, workers' rights and consumer protection will be undermined by the agreement.  The Minister said we would be able to change the agreement by voting on it, but the Council of Ministers will make the decision and the agreement can be ratified even without each member state's parliament voting for it.  The agreement would automatically be introduced for three years and much damage would be done even if we chose to vote against it in this country.  The situation is very worrying.  I do not blame the Minister but we must take the issue much more seriously.  We should be very concerned about what is coming down the tracks.</p></speech>

The EU-US free trade negotiations are the most open and transparent trade negotiations to date.  Reports relating to each round of discussions with all information on the EU position in the negotiations are published on the European Commission's website.  Unlike the EU, the US does not publish its negotiating texts and the US has separate protocols for reading its documentation, effectively limiting access to Members of Congress.  Special reading rooms have been created in capitals around Europe to allow equivalent access to European and national parliamentarians to review the consolidated EU-US versions of the negotiating texts.  I have written to the Ceann Comhairle and I have invited Deputies to come and view the documents.  Members are very welcome to do so.

The Minister said she had written to the Ceann Comhairle and to all Deputies inviting them to take up her offer of a briefing from her Department and to visit the reading room.  I did that and I found it interesting, to say the least.</p><p>Given the lack of public awareness about the exercise which is being undertaken and its potential, does the Minister not think that it would be a good idea to do a public awareness roadshow around the country and visit the regions?  The Minister's Department divides up the country into various regions.  If we look at the Action Plan for Jobs, which the Minister's predecessor launched and she is continuing, it is broken down by region.  The Minister visits the various regions and focuses on and emphasises each one as she visits.  Given the enormity of TTIP and the potential and consequences on both sides, as it is a big debate that is out there, we should all try to make a value judgment call on it.  We need to have more public consultation.  That requires visits to the regions as part of a public awareness consultation.</p></speech>

Will the D&aacute;il have the opportunity to debate this hugely important trade agreement and will we have a vote on it?  I believe this agreement has major implications for workers' rights.  Labour standards are not on this agenda.  It also has major implications for public services and perhaps most worryingly it proposes to give privileged rights to foreign investors and corporations to sue states.  Under CETA, foreign investors will have more rights than any other group in this State.  Foreign investors will also be able to bring claims against regulations in the public interest that impact their investments.</p></reply>

On 5 July 2016, the Commission published its proposals for signature, conclusion and provisional application of CETA, which are available on the EU Commission&rsquo;s website.  I ask that the public look at that website.  Given the position taken by Ireland and other member states, I note that the commission has now decided to submit CETA to the council for decision as a mixed agreement.  This means that the agreement contains provisions that fall under both EU and member state responsibility.  It will be a matter for the Council and the European Parliament to decide on the signature and provisional application of CETA.  Following a decision by the council with the consent of the Parliament, it will be possible to provisionally apply CETA.  Its full entering into force will be subject to the conclusion by the EU, through a Council decision with the consent of the Parliament and by all member states through the relevant national ratification procedures.  This means that the Oireachtas will be part of the final decision to ratify the agreement.  That means that we will vote on it here in the Chamber.  The process will require that I, as Minister, move a motion in the D&aacute;il to ratify the agreement and that there will be a vote.</p></reply>

Since being appointed as Minister of State, I have placed a strong emphasis on ensuring that we have the talent and skills available to meet enterprise needs.  I am working closely with my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills.  I am pleased that, under the auspices of the apprenticeship council, the first enrolments on the new apprenticeship programmes will commence in autumn of this year.  The number of undergraduate ICT places will increase this autumn.  I also recently launched the new web portal, Tech/Life Ireland, which is funded by my Department, to attract skilled professionals to this country.</p>  <p>  In addition, the expert group on future skills needs, EGFSN, reports to me and to the Minister for Education and Skills regularly.  The EGFSN plays a key role in advising the Government on the current and future skills needs of the economy.  Recent EGFSN reports have anticipated future job opportunities arising from both expansion and replacement demand for a range of occupational roles.  These include ICT, data analytics, manufacturing, medical devices, pharmaceuticals, food and beverages.  Future opportunities are also anticipated in international sales and marketing, project management, freight transport, distribution and logistics and the hospitality sector.  I met the Irish Road Haulage Association over the last number of days.</p>  <p>  Co-operation between employers and the education and training system is crucial in developing effective responses to skills needs and the regional skills fora will be important in that role.</p></reply>

I want to flag one particular aspect of that report, because I have received correspondence about a shortage of chefs.  The Restaurants' Association of Ireland says there is a shortage of up to 5,000 chefs in this country, so the situation is coming to a critical juncture.  When frequenting pubs and restaurants, we can see for ourselves that the vast majority of staff, particularly chefs and other kitchen staff, are non-Irish nationals.  They have come to this country to fill a void.  Has that problem appeared on the Minister of State's radar?  The Restaurants' Association of Ireland has called for the re-establishment of CERT, the Council for Education, Recruitment and Training.  CERT ran valuable courses and produced chefs and people with associated skills, of which there is currently a huge deficit.</p></speech>

He is correct.  A number of weeks ago I launched an initiative programme for chefs who have gone through a three- or four-year apprenticeship in Tallaght.  The indications are that over the next four, five or six years the hospitality sector will require perhaps 8,000 to 10,000 chefs.  There is no doubt that this is an important issue.  The hospitality sector provides some of the most important services in the economy.  It employs approximately 158,000 in 16,000 enterprises.  I have asked Enterprise Ireland to prepare a report on how small and medium-sized businesses feel about economic growth in the next couple of years, including the exact number of chefs and other staff that will be required.  They will report back to me hopefully by September. </p>  <p>  If the ability is there to create so many jobs in that sector, which I believe there will be, we will not be founding wanting in that regard.</p></speech>

Basic apprenticeship schemes for carpenters, plasterers and bricklayers completely diminished over five or six years, down to about 4,000 or 5,000.  In September, we will be launching 25 new apprenticeship schemes, many of which will be in the sectors the Deputy mentioned.  I have written to employers' groups asking them to indicate whether employers are in a position to take on apprentices in those areas, which have the capacity to create a substantial number of jobs.  As the economy progresses there will be more building projects, so it would be unacceptable if we could not have basic apprenticeship schemes for electricians, carpenters and bricklayers.  In September, we will have 25 apprenticeship schemes which include many of the jobs referred to by the Deputy.</p></speech>

A central co-ordination unit in regard to Brexit has been established in the Department of the Taoiseach.  In regard to my own Department, given the breadth and diversity of policy and operational areas that are relevant to the United Kingdom's decision to leave the European Union, this is a matter that has an impact on, and is being monitored by, all the divisions across my Department.</p>  <p>  Since the announcement of the UK referendum result on 24 June, as part of my contingency plans, I have established a co-ordination group within my Department consisting of relevant enterprise, Single Market and trade officials, together with the chief executive officers of the IDA and Enterprise Ireland, to oversee the management of our immediate response, including messaging to businesses both at home and overseas.  I chair this group and will continue to do so as part of my Department&rsquo;s ongoing response as developments unfold at EU level and bilaterally with the UK.  In addition, the EU affairs unit of my Department exercises a dedicated overall co-ordination role across all the relevant policy areas, and represents my Department in the work that is being undertaken at cross-government level, led by the Department of the Taoiseach, in response to the outcome of the referendum.  This facilitates the framework for my Department&rsquo;s interaction with other Departments in this regard.</p>  <p>  The North-South unit of my Department, which co-funds and provides strategic oversight for InterTrade Ireland, the North-South enterprise development body, is actively working with that body to ensure that it will review and adjust its supports if necessary as new trading rules and regulations emerge.  I have met with representatives of InterTrade Ireland.</p>  <p>  The management board of my Department, chaired by the Secretary General, meets weekly and co-ordinates the Department's own response across all its divisions to the referendum outcome.  As I have previously indicated, a team of senior officials from my Department visited London on 1 July to discuss Single Market and trade issues in light of the referendum outcome.</p></speech>

I welcome the concentration of resources and effort on this matter.  However, I must flag the necessity for collaboration and co-operation within various Departments on this matter.  The Brexit decision has many facets, including the North-South and east-west dimensions, as well as international relations and the EU negotiations themselves.  The particular focus of my question, however, is on the risk to jobs and industry, as well as other economic factors which come within the remit of the Minister's Department.</p>  <p>  Brexit is here and it is real, so we will have to deal with the consequences.  It is worth recalling some of the figures involved.  Some 400,000 jobs depend on trade between Ireland and the UK.  For small Irish businesses seeking to expand, the UK is usually the first target market, as it is for 43% of our exports.  The UK is our nearest neighbour and largest trading partner.  The consequences of Brexit, while worrying, must be dealt with now that they are here.</p>  <p>  I agree with ISME's call for a dedicated unit within the Department to co-ordinate activities related to the challenges and opportunities arising from the Brexit decision.  Many other bodies have also called for a co-ordination of such activities.  </p>  <p>  I was concerned by a reply to a parliamentary question tabled by my colleague, Deputy Niall Collins-----</p></speech>

While there are many factors involved, the most significant is the impact of large multinational retail chains on small business.</p>  <p>  Has the Government considered the introduction of a progressive rates system which essentially gives a break to small and medium enterprise and gives them a leg up in terms of the competition they face from large multinational companies?  This is commonplace in places like France, Scotland and elsewhere.</p></reply>

A key priority of this Government is to improve the living and working environment of local communities and to increase their potential to support increased economic activity into the future.</p>  <p>  My Department provides many supports to assist small businesses to start and grow.  The 31 local enterprise offices offer financial and soft supports in the form of training and mentoring to small and microenterprises across the country. </p>  <p>  The implementation of the eight regional action plans will greatly benefit local economies, facilitating the development of local businesses and thus encouraging occupancy in work space and commercial properties in towns across the country.</p>  <p>  Through the work of the retail consultation forum, which I chair, I support the work of the town centre revival working group.  This group, the membership of which includes retail representative bodies and public sector bodies, is working towards the preparation of a framework for town centre revival.  The framework will encourage collaboration between key stakeholders to implement initiatives to create and support vibrant town centres. </p>  <p>  However, responsibility for planning rests with my colleague, the Minister for housing, planning and local government.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, has responsibility for the retail planning guidelines which duly recognise that vibrant and viable town centres are the lifeblood of the local community and local economy.  The guidelines set out the key policy objectives which should guide planning authorities in addressing retail development within their development planning role.</p>  <p>  I come from a small village in County Galway where many of the shops that had been there for up to 70 years are now closed.</p></reply>

My own personal view is that that only tinkered around the edges of the issue.</p>  <p>  I refer the Minister to the preliminary census figures released in the last number of days.  One of the most striking statistics is that there are almost 200,000 vacant dwelling units around the country.  In Limerick, there are 8,500 vacant dwelling units, many of which are accommodation units above shops in our towns and villages.  The core has been hollowed out of our small towns and villages consistently over the last number of years.  What I am trying to impress on the Minister is the need for a bigger plan such that we are not just tinkering around with the commercial rates issue.</p></speech>

I am glad there are so many Limerick Deputies in the Chamber today.</p>  <p> Given the proliferation of large multinational retail chains, we are working on a town centre revival framework, including an action plan for the town centre revival.  The action plan for towns is tasked with establishing town teams to carry out health checks, prepare town strategies and to identify and signpost supports that retailers can avail of.  The primary concern of this group is to assist struggling towns by increasing footfall and the vibrancy of the town centres.  As Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, I cannot support either retail or the local authorities directly.</p><p>However, I am working with the Minister for regional development, rural affairs, arts and the Gaeltacht to ensure the work of this group is aligned with the aims of her Department's town and village regeneration fund.  I will also be working with the Minister for housing, planning and local government in terms of his responsibility for overseeing the local authorities to communicate the recommendations of this working group and to ensure that the work of the group is complementary.</p></speech>

I am asking for a change in the way we administer rates.  In Scotland, rates were changed to give preferential rates to smaller businesses.  A total of 60% or 70% of small businesses benefitted and got reduced rates as a result and it has helped reinvigorate small towns.  This is a fairly standard policy in France, which is why its town and village centres sustain themselves far better than many of our town and village centres.  I suggest that as part of this framework for supporting small and medium enterprises in towns, the Minister must think about a new rates system that distinguishes between a bank that might have the same square meterage but has massive profitability and turnover and a small flower shop or shoe shop.  The Minister gets my point.</p></speech>

In our county, the vacant commercial premises incentive scheme involves the council refunding rates for businesses in premises that have been vacant for over six months.  It gives 75% for the first year, 50% for the second year and 25% for the third year.  Business priming funding is available for micro-enterprise within the first 18 months of the start up.  There are businesses other than shops in D&uacute;n Laoghaire or any other town.  They include financial businesses.

Significant progress has been made in the Dublin region.  Since the national action plan for jobs was launched in 2012, more than 70,000 additional people are back at work in Dublin.  This compares with job losses of 90,000 in the period from 2008 to 2011.</p><p>The process of rebuilding the capacity of all the regions was started with the roll out of eight regional action plans for jobs during the past year.  The action plan for the Dublin region was launched last January.  The plan aims to increase employment in the Dublin region by between 10% and 15% over the period to 2020, resulting in the delivery of 66,000 additional jobs to the region in that period.  Key sectors targeted as part of the plan include areas like technology, financial services, life sciences, manufacturing, tourism, retail, &quot;smart cities&quot; and the creative industries.</p><p>The plan will be monitored and driven by an implementation committee comprising representatives from the enterprise sector, the local authorities, enterprise agencies and other public bodies in the region.  Collaboration between the private and the public sector has been a core element in the plan's development and will be central to its delivery.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>By supporting SMEs, continuing to attract foreign direct investment and providing assistance to start-ups to grow and develop, we will see our recovery take hold which will result in improved standards of living for the people of Dublin.</p></speech>

As he is aware, we are talking about a region with a population of 150,000 or so.  The Minister of State will appreciate that the unemployment figures I read out are very high.  Could he look at some of our more traditional industries?  The Cadbury Mondelez plant in Coolock was threatened with a series of job losses.  I raised this issue on numerous occasions with the former Minister in the previous D&aacute;il.  The last update I received from the Department about the plant was in March 2016.  I was told that Enterprise Ireland was in contact with the company.  What has happened on foot of that?  Cadbury's was taken over firstly by Kraft and then by Mondelez, which is a Brazilian company.  What is happening in this case of this plant?</p>  <p>  There are many logistics and transport companies in Dublin Bay North.  I heard the Minister say earlier that she is taking particular steps concerning Brexit.  Has the area of logistics and transport been looked at given that we will be dealing with a different regime?

The implementation committee is a collaboration between enterprise and public service groups and is led by Caroline Keeling, chief executive of Keelings, with Ronan Harris from Google is vice chairman.  The Deputy is very well-known in the area.  There is no point in me dishing out ten pages of statistics relating to the particular area.  If the Deputy feels there are groupings of people the Department should meet to see how the region is affected, there is no problem with him bringing in interested bodies to meet the Department in August or September.

Although they are at an early stage, it is clear that the proposal raises a number of practical, legal and technical issues.  These will need to be addressed over the coming months.  Until we know the scope and content of any final EU measure, it is too soon to consider national measures on this type of public reporting.  However, Ireland is already to the fore in introducing similar reporting obligations for large multinational companies.  Under the Finance Act 2015, certain Irish-resident parent companies and subsidiaries of non-Irish companies must file a country-by-country report on tax with the Revenue Commissioners each year.  The first of these reports are due to be submitted to the Revenue by the end of next year.

Already, even before that, our contribution to the EU is grossly inflated and distorted because it is, in proportion to population, double that of countries such as Portugal and others due to the tax avoidance strategies of multinationals based in this country.  It is in our interests to have public country-by-country reporting of the big multinational companies to stop them engaging in aggressive tax avoidance.  Yet, incredibly, when offered the opportunity to do that by the European Union, we used the spurious excuse of subsidiarity to reject that proposal.  What the Minister seems to be saying is that we cannot do it on our own.  I agree with that, but why the hell did we not sign up to a pan-European proposal to do it, instead saying that we could not sign up to it because it infringes our sovereignty?  It does not make any sense.</p></speech>

We cannot do it on our own.  If we were to publish the figures the Deputy is referring to, it would allow some companies to gain a possible commercial advantage over others because matters would be deemed to be commercially sensitive.  Other jurisdictions might not share the information with us if they knew we were going to publish the reports.  It would not help the tax transparency agenda and a system of country-by-country reporting.  I cannot do it.</p></speech>

We cannot leave it pushed out to 2022.  It is three years this month since the courts ruled on the bypass and the way was cleared for the land purchase to begin.  In the meantime the land purchase has been moving along slowly, little by little.  At this stage, three years on, it is a bit over halfway.  Late last year there was great fanfare when Government Deputies were telling us we were on the new programme and were promising us everything was going to go ahead and was hunky-dory.  However, there was no start date, which was of great concern for locals.  Earlier this year it was very worrying for locals when the moneys allocated for the land purchase were reduced from &euro;5 million to &euro;3.8 million.  To date, much of that allocation has already been spent.  Up to this morning, &euro;3.426 million of this year's allocation had been consumed and we are only as far as July.  Transport Infrastructure Ireland really let the cat out of the bag in recent weeks when it met with Cork County Council.  It said, "It is TII's intention to appoint a contractor for Dunkettle in 2018, as it is their top priority project, with a view to commencing in 2019/2020 while the N22 and N28 will be post 2021".  That means it is not on the current programme but post-2021, which is the next programme.  That is a serious setback for locals, who are keen to be unburdened of traffic by having the Macroom bypass built.  It causes serious distress for people.</p>  <p>  I ask the Minister to prioritise the Macroom bypass.  Various Ministers have moved it through the different stages, and I ask the Minister to release it to tender for construction and raise it at Cabinet level, and possibly, if he has an opportunity-----</p></speech>

It is something I have raised here on numerous occasions over the last five and a half years.  I did so with my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Michael Creed, on a number of occasions on Topical Issues and during Question Time.  It was really good news to learn last year that the N22 was being put on the capital plan for 2016 to 2021.  It was very positive.  Various dates are being thrown about now for the start of this vital socioeconomic project for the entire south-west region.  A date of 2022 was given to Cork councillors by TII; a date of 2020 was given to the chief executive of Kerry County Council by TII; and, at the most recent meeting of the transport committee, the Department indicated a date of post 2018-2019.  Can the Minister give us an indication of what the date will be and if this matter will be prioritised?  Logistically, from an engineering point of view, the N22 is a far more straightforward project than the Dunkettle project, which was referred to, or the Ringaskiddy road.  There is no reason this road cannot go ahead in the very near future.  There is no reason it cannot be started by the end of 2017.  It is nearly shovel-ready.  The need is well proven.  From a socioeconomic point of view it would be a massive boost to the entire region.  Figures I obtained last year from the NRA showed that there had been 41 fatalities since 1990 on this stretch of road, so the reasons are compelling.  We need the Minister to ensure this is a priority project.  When the capital plan was announced I went to the people of Kerry in good faith to tell them this road was on the capital plan, and my objective is to get it built as soon as possible.  The Minister could help us with this and make sure it is a priority project.  That is why I am raising it here today.</p></speech>

I am very aware that Deputy Griffin raised this consistently in the last D&aacute;il.  It is a legitimate running sore for those who represent the area, and I will try to address the problem as adequately as possible in the time that is left.</p>  <p>  As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I have responsibility for overall policy and funding of the national roads programme.  The construction, improvement and maintenance of individual national roads, such as the N22 Ballyvourney to Macroom scheme, is a matter for Transport Infrastructure Ireland under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2015 in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.  Within its capital budget, the assessment and prioritisation of individual national road projects is a matter for TII in accordance with section 19 of the Roads Act.</p>  <p>  The Ballyvourney to Macroom scheme involves the construction of 22 km of new carriageway from just east of Macroom to west of Ballyvourney, including a bypass of Macroom town.</p><p>Ireland has just under 100,000 km of road in its network and the maintenance and improvement of national, regional and local roads places a substantial financial burden on local authorities and on the Exchequer.  There have been very large reductions in Exchequer funding available for roads expenditure over the past number of years because of the national financial position.  For this reason, the focus has had to be on maintenance and renewal rather than major new improvement schemes.</p> <p> The capital plan published in September 2015 outlined proposed transport investment priorities to 2022.  I understand that the transport element of the plan was framed by the conclusions reached in my Department's strategic investment framework for land transport.  This report highlighted the importance of maintenance and renewal of transport infrastructure, together with targeted investments, to address particular bottlenecks and critical safety issues.</p> <p> The capital plan provides &euro;6 billion for investment in the roads network in the period to 2022, with &euro;4.4 billion earmarked for the maintenance and strengthening of the existing extensive network throughout the country and &euro;1.6 billion for new projects.  Given the funding limits, the decision made by my predecessor was to provide for a mix of projects across the country to address particular constraints, including bottlenecks and port connectivity.</p> <p> While it will not be possible to address all the demands for improvement schemes over the capital plan period, the plan provides for a number of important projects in the Cork area which are scheduled to commence construction within the plan period, including the upgrade of the Dunkettle roundabout and the N22 road between Ballyvourney and Macroom.  In addition, the plan also provides that the N28 upgrade scheme will also commence subject to necessary approvals.</p> <p> The transport element of the capital plan is based on a gradual build up in capital funding for the road network from the current relatively low base towards the levels needed to support maintenance and improvement works.  Funding will continue to be tight in 2017, with a step up in 2018 and 2019 and then a significant ramp up from 2020.  As Minister, I must work within the capital budgets included in the plan and Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, in planning the construction schedule for individual projects, must also take account of the annual budgets available.</p> <p> As regards the Ballyvourney to Macroom scheme, the scheme has full statutory approval and land acquisition is under way.  Construction on this scheme is due to start in 2020.</p> <p> As I have indicated previously, we all are conscious that the recovery of the economy is generating spending pressures across the government system, including capital investment needs.  As part of a programme for partnership Government, there is an increased emphasis on the need for spending on public services but the Government still must operate within the EU fiscal rules and this does constrain options.  There will be a mid-term review of the capital plan and this will provide an opportunity to assess progress and consider what scope there is for increased levels of investment depending on economic growth.</p></speech>

There are various dates floating around on it.  Cork County Council has been given a date of 2021 or later for the construction of it.  TII and Cork County Council, the bodies at the coalface dealing with this on a daily basis, are saying it will be post-2021.  Will the Minister sit down with representatives of TII to clarify, and impress on them, that it is a priority for TII that the Macroom bypass is started immediately?</p>  <p>  Will the Minister release the bypass to tender for construction because we cannot afford to have it waiting much longer than it is?  As outlined earlier, it is a dangerous road on which there have been far too many fatalities.  Since the compulsory purchase order, CPO, was made by the Minister more than three years ago, the number of people killed on that road would fill the entire front bench where the Minister is sitting.  While I have been a public representative, and in my own area alone, the number of people killed on that road would fill that front bench, the one behind the Minister and the one behind that.</p>  <p>  Will the Minister release this road to tender for construction without delay?  Even 2020, if one goes by that date, is still a number of years away and one is looking at further danger and further fatalities.</p></speech>

As a Deputy for the county of Kerry and working with my colleague across the border in Cork, I am pleading with the Minister to do what he can to prioritise this project, which is badly needed.  What it has going for it is that it is almost shovel-ready.  There is no reason this should be delayed any further.</p>  <p>  While I welcome the clarification of a possible 2020 date as distinct from the 2022 date that was bandied around earlier, and with some point-scoring from certain quarters earlier in the week and last week, it is still too far away.  It is four years away and there is no reason we should have to wait four years for this.  There is no reason this cannot start in 2017.  Where there is a will, there is a way.</p>  <p>  Primarily, my fear is lives will be lost but the significant socioeconomic boost that this will give the region cannot be overlooked.  What this will do for the south-west region is that it will open up a whole world of possibilities on both the Cork and Kerry sides.  I urge the Minister to go back to TII and ask its representatives to find a way to move this forward.</p></speech>

They must understand funds are short.  There is clearance for many roads but there is no funding for them.  This is, of course, a priority.</p>  <p>  The confusion is difficult to understand but the Deputies have heard all I have to say about that.  I am meeting representatives of the TII in the next two weeks.  I will ensure when I meet them that this is on the agenda, not only whether there is any need or compelling reason to hasten this up or whether there are any funds for that - I doubt if there is - but to sort out the mix-up in the dates, which is a legitimate point made by both Deputies.  When I have discussed it with them at my meeting, which is definitely in early August, I will communicate with the Deputies.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-07-20a.445" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1369" speakername="Peter Burke" time="14:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016072000032#FF00700"><p>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this important topical issue.   On 26 April 2016, a press release appeared on the Inland Fisheries Ireland, IFI, website announcing that it intended to cease its operation in fish farms.  This was issued at a time of significant political uncertainty and paralysis and in the backdrop of a caretaker Government.</p>  <p>  At that time, I consulted the then Minister of State, Deputy Joe McHugh, in regard to this and he advised me that he communicated with the chairperson of the board of IFI that no further action was to take place until there was broad consultation with all the stakeholders and, importantly, with his Department.  However, on 5 July 2016, a notice of public consultation appeared on the IFI website explicitly stating that IFI will exit fish farm operations.  This is not meaningful consultation.  Indeed, it is an insult to the stakeholders, the people and, indeed, the Department involved in this area.</p>  <p>  People might be aware that in 2015, a report was commissioned by Canadian Aquaculture Systems, Inc. which found that there was no explicit reason for IFI to cease its operation in fish farms.  Indeed, it found that the operations were comparable to those of the private sector.  When one considers how dated the plant is in Roscrea, it was a significant achievement.  The report also explicitly stated that in the past, IFI issued a public tender for the supply of rainbow trout for put-and-take fisheries and there were no responses or bids to the tender.  This clearly states that there is no alternative to the current operation and, therefore, a view being advanced that we should look to the private sector to fill in the void does not hold water.</p>  <p>  The CEO of IFI normally states there are opportunity costs.  I would put to him clearly the opportunity cost of the assessment in the unique position held by IFI in having minimal access to large volumes of high-quality water.  Water supplies are available at the fisheries at little or no cost, relying on longstanding arrangements.  If these arrangements are terminated, these will almost certainly not be repeated in any sector.  A conservative estimate of the volume of water used by the three fisheries amounts to 25,000 cu. cm per day which would cost in excess of &euro;35,000 per day.  What is the opportunity cost of that?</p><p>A socio-economic study into recreational angling indicates that angling is responsible for &euro;750 million in revenue per annum and in excess of 10,000 jobs so what is the opportunity cost of compromising that sector?</p> <p> I want to be very clear about this.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, has been exceptional.  He came to Mullingar yesterday evening and attended a public meeting with all the anglers' associations and concerned representatives.  We took a tour of the fish farm in Cullion and we could see clearly its self-sufficiency.  There have been workers there for generations who have brought together a strong strain of trout that they have spent 40 or 50 years breeding.  Why should we compromise this to import fish from outside Ireland that could bring germs or diseases?  There are no pumps at Cullion as the water is brought in from Lough Owel, going to Lough Ennell through the Brosna.  It is operated with natural gravity.  We must stand up and be counted on this issue, making it very clear to the board of Inland Fisheries Ireland, IFI, that this will be done at its peril.  It is a key industry that must be protected.</p></speech>

Inland Fisheries Ireland, IFI, is the State agency responsible for the protection, management and conservation of Ireland's inland fisheries and sea angling resources.  IFI was formed on 1 July 2010 following the amalgamation of the Central Fisheries Board and the seven regional fisheries boards into a single agency.  Ireland has over 74,000 km of rivers and streams and 128,000 ha of lakes, all of which fall under the jurisdiction of IFI.  It has a long history of providing rainbow and brown trout to support the fish stocking requirements of Ireland's trout angling stakeholders.  IFI's main fish production unit is located at the IFI fish farm near Roscrea, with a supporting facility, which mainly supports the maintenance of broodstock, located at Cullion in Mullingar.  There is also a small operation at Lough Allua.</p><p>The proposal around rationalising the fish farm operations of IFI is a day-to-day operational matter for the board of IFI, although I acknowledge the major impact on the local economy across the country but particularly in the midlands.  It should have been taken into account by the board of the IFI.  IFl advises that from a structural perspective, the fish farming operation is based on physical structures and facilities designed and built in the late 1950s and since then and has been meeting the increasing demands of operational and regulatory requirements from facilities that are dated.  In that context, I accompanied Deputy Burke and Councillor Andrew Duncan on a visit to IFI's Cullion broodstock and hatchery facility in Mullingar yesterday evening to review at first hand the existing facilities, where we were briefed by a member of IFI's senior management team and the operator of the farms.</p><p>I am advised by the board of IFI that it is IFI's intention to exit fish farming operations over the coming years at current locations, with the agency maintaining one aquaculture facility at Cong, County Mayo, which will be used for research and conservation stocking.  This site has been identified as having the most potential due to the quality and quantity of its water supply, which is an important consideration for fish production.  Ultimately, the IFI hatchery at Cong is expected to be upgraded to a facility capable of housing modern hatchery and research operations.  IFl also advises that it was always intended that the phase-out plan will include consultation with affected stakeholders.  The former Minister of State had written to the chair of IFI noting IFI's intention to consult with affected parties prior to any action and that a report of the consultation would be made to the Department.  I recently met the board of IFI to reinforce the requirement that a full report be made to the Department before any action is taken.  However, I regret the lack of consultation and the wording of the consultation when it was advertised.  It was seen as a sort of <i>fait accompli</i>rather than a full public consultation to assess the future of the very valuable resource at Cullion and Roscrea.</p><p>IFl has written to affected stakeholders, advising them that the farms are operating as normal for 2016.  It is important to clarify that the decisions of the board were not prescriptive regarding a timeline or a particular option as to how IFI might exit commercial production.  In consultation with the chairman of the board of IFI and on the advice of the chief executive officer, I have decided to extend the deadline for the consultation to 19 September.  I ask all interested parties to participate in the consultation.  I will shortly meet the chairman of the board and the chief executive officer when he returns from a break to discuss the issue further.  I understand the grave concern about the decision made by the board in the interregnum between the election and the formation of the Government.  I know there is deep unease and unhappiness about this but I intend to consult fully with the chairman of the board and the chief executive officer to see if we can resolve the issue.</p></speech>

The Twenty-six Counties of Ireland benefit from the stocks in these farms, so it is a vital resource in Ireland.  If we appoint an independent company to commission a report into the sector but do not heed its advice, what is the point in having that process?  The company was clear that there is no alternative in the private sector, so there will be a compromise on that front.  The water values being brought to the farm may not be achieved in future.  We have heard much about how the fish farms are loss-making but let us do an audit on the figures.  I am surprised as staff will be redeployed and I understand staff are included in the figures cited.  There may be national and scientific costs that should also be included and that must be examined closely.</p>  <p>  I understand a former Deputy's book has a chapter on the rod war and the difficulties of the time.  This has the capacity to escalate to that level if it is not dealt with urgently because this is a natural resource.  As Councillor Andrew Duncan articulated so well at the meeting last night, we are highly dependent on the quality of our lakes with regard to the revenue brought in through tourism.  Do we want to throw that away?  We are trying to throw away 50 years of work in generating resilient breeds of trout to put into those lakes.  Anglers come to our lakes because of the experience and the quantity and quality of fish in those lakes.  They will not come if we back away from the industry.  We must be very clear.</p>  <p>  It is reprehensible for a chief executive officer or board to take a decision as drastic as this when a Government is being formed.  The disrespect shown to the Government is also reprehensible and we should stand up to it.  We must take urgent action.  I thank the Minister of State for his reply.</p></speech>

They represented the fishing rivers in Dublin, Louth, Mayo, Galway and other places.  Although the facilities in Cullion and Roscrea are doing a job, there have been decades of under-investment.  I have seen the facility at Cullion but I have not been to the Roscrea facility.  The Cullion facility is functioning, as I noted at the meeting, but it is antiquated and needs investment, particularly in the existing buildings.</p><p>I raised the issue of public consultation but when I met the board on 30 June, I was not informed by anybody - either the chief executive officer or any member of the board - that a week later the public consultation would be advertised as a <i>fait accompli</i>.  The Deputy is correct in that there are 50 years of research and breeding in the facilities.  I advocated to the board and chief executive officer that before any decision should have been considered regarding any cessation, there should have been a plan to ensure the valuable fish stock and resources being put into the rivers locally would be replaced with an alternative.  There is none, as far as I can see.  There is talk of private operators but there is no clear alternative in place.  Once the chief executive officer is back from the break I will sit down with him and the chairman to push the issue of planning further.  There is widespread disquiet and I have extended the period of consultation to 19 September.  I hope to use that period to consult further about the future.  I recognise the Deputy and thank him for the invitation to yesterday's meeting and to visit the facilities in Cullion.</p></speech>

At the time, the president of PayPal, Mr. David Marcus, described the company's relationship with Ireland as an everlasting honeymoon and the Dundalk facility as being the heart of eBay.  I hope the Minister will today confirm that this still is so and that it wishes to remain there.  The company had plans to grow to 450 staff in Dundalk at the time.  We are all aware of the division of eBay and PayPal.  We are appreciative of the value that this leading company, PayPal, has been to Dundalk and the surrounding districts of Drogheda, Newry and Dublin.  I am advised that the company wishes to utilise the space currently being occupied by the eBay side of the business and, hopefully, this will result in additional employment at PayPal.</p> <p> I believe that eBay has viewed properties in the area that are suitable for its operation and I have confirmation of that from leading auctioneers.  There is a strong belief in the area that, although such accommodation is available in the Dundalk and Drogheda area, eBay has been induced by State institutions, with no doubt a little political coaxing, to consider places such as Sligo and Castlebar as options, and perhaps I should throw Athlone into the mix also.  Regrettably, I cannot seem to get confirmation to the contrary from any company or State body to confirm or deny this rumour.  Nor can I get such confirmation from some of my colleagues in this House who may well be better informed than other Deputies at this stage.  A constituency colleague in the Government from my local town has caused alarm by admitting to the media that he has known about this for more than eight weeks, as has the Minister.  Will the Minister assure this House that IDA Ireland and its senior management have not used a range of methods such as grants, employment incentives, credits and discounts to move eBay from its present location to another area of the country?</p></speech>

There are a lot of rumours about the future of eBay, which employs 200 people, and its revenue.  It shares a site at the Xerox Technology Park with PayPal, although it parted company with it two years ago.  It is a highly successful business and its revenue is expected to be in the region of $2.2 billion.  In February 2013, eBay announced it was creating 450 jobs in Dundalk with the establishment of its new European operations centre.</p>  <p>  There is a lot of speculation about the future intentions of eBay.  These could be entirely without foundation, but it has been suggested that because of the separation of PayPal and eBay the latter now needs its own site.  Workers, local businesses and families are understandably worried about the uncertainty.  Will the Minister clarify the situation, end this damaging speculation and give firm assurances that these jobs and projects, which have benefited people not just in Dundalk but right across the Border up into County Down, will stay there and that the Minister and IDA Ireland are focused on ensuring that this is the case?</p></speech>

I also thank Deputies Fergus O'Dowd and Peter Fitzpatrick, who have raised it with me also.  As they will know from my statement in the D&aacute;il yesterday in response to Deputies Martin and Adams, I have been in touch with the CEO of IDA Ireland to discuss the concerns of both the employees and other stakeholders in the Dundalk area.</p>  <p>  In September 2014 it was announced that eBay and PayPal would split into two entities by 2015.  The official split happened on 17 July 2015 and both companies began trading as separate entities on 20 July.  I understand that the two entities wish to operate from separate premises and, to facilitate this, IDA Ireland is working with eBay to find a suitable premises.  My concern is to ensure that eBay stays in Ireland and, therefore, I have asked IDA Ireland to work with the company to facilitate it in any way possible in finding a suitable premises in which its operation can continue here.  However, the final decision lies with the company alone.</p>  <p>  As part of my remit in the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, I am responsible for driving regional development.  I wish to ensure that we have a good spread of jobs countrywide and away from the greater Dublin area.  Dundalk has done very well in recent years in attracting foreign direct investment, and that is a testament to all the hard work done in making Dundalk an attractive place to do business.  In fact, County Louth stands out among the Border counties for its successes in job creation, with 21 IDA Ireland companies supporting 3,245 jobs.  This has been a real success story for IDA Ireland.  As a further example of this progress, in June 2014 PayPal announced that it would add two new strategic functions, with the employment of an additional 400 people at the Dundalk site to support business growth in North America and global credit functions support in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.  The addition of these 400 new jobs will bring total employment at PayPal in Dundalk to 1,400 by 2017.  Recruitment for these new positions has already started.</p>  <p>  Since my appointment as Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, my focus has been on driving forward the regional action plans.  The north east north west action plan, which includes County Louth, was launched last November and aims to increase employment in the region by 10% to 15% over the period to 2020, resulting in the delivery of 28,000 additional jobs.  Other key targets of the action plan include increasing the number of start-ups by at least 25% through targeted initiatives and programmes to support enterprise, and increasing the number of IDA Ireland investments by between 30% and 40% to 2019.  While these are ambitious targets, they are also achievable and well thought out.  The agencies under my remit will continue to strive to facilitate the needs of both multinationals and indigenous companies to maintain existing jobs and increase the number of new ones while also ensuring a good spread of employment throughout the regions.</p></speech>

I also recognise eBay's right to make its own decision.  I put it that the reason the region has been doing so well is a result of the work of the local authority, the Louth Economic Forum, the Chamber of Commerce and the presence of Dundalk Institute of Technology in the region.  However, the Minister has not answered my question.  I put it to her categorically that I want an assurance that neither IDA Ireland nor its management is using a range of methods to attract investment to various regions that are contrary to what should be happening in the development of industry in Ireland - namely, inducements to people from outside these regions.  All I am looking for is a fair playing field and for eBay to recognise, as it did from the start, that Dundalk is at the heart of its operations and decide, given the workforce in Dundalk and the development that has taken place, not to move on.  We all recognise that PayPal will expand and that is great.  The bottom line for most of the Oireachtas Members and the people of the region is that we want to retain eBay and expand PayPal.  Everyone benefits from that regional approach.</p></speech>

I do not think that is an issue.  There is no question of its moving.</p><p>Dundalk is an area of considerable disadvantage but it has a very innovative and skilled workforce and lots of local leaders from the Institute of Technology, the economic forum, the local chambers and Louth County Council.  It lies on the main corridor between Belfast and Dublin and is close to the airports and is in the Border region.  There are other sites close to or in Dundalk and, while the Minister says it is up to the company to take its own decision, it can be influenced, as it was in the first instance to locate in Dundalk.  I ask the Minister to look at the particular needs of this area and the success of this project and to give an assurance that she will do her utmost to ensure it stays where it is at the moment, or at least in the general Dundalk area.</p></speech>

He will come out towards Tallaght and Kiltipper on the right.  Following the river to his left he will see the Glenasmole valley going past Bohernabreena where a lot of the water we drink comes from.  He will then get into the valley, which is one of the most spectacular places in this country and matches anything in County Mayo, such as Croagh Patrick, in its beauty.  It is a stunning wilderness and there is nothing there - not a shed and hardly a fence.  It is a wildlife reserve to match any other.  If one walks up to the source of the Dodder, which is hard to find on account of there being so many pools and tributaries, one will arrive at the top under Kippure mountain which is spectacular and looks out over Dublin.  It is a huge wide valley with huge history, lore and heritage.  No other capital city in Europe, or maybe the world, has what we have, which is the sea and the mountains, and this is an integral part of the mountains.  The valley sits surrounded by 200,000 hectares of the Wicklow National Park which is a patchwork of areas including Lough Bray and Glencree.  It is up for sale at the moment but we cannot let it go for sale and have to keep it in State ownership to be added to the Wicklow National Park, which it would grow by some 10%, providing an amazing facility for the people of this city and the whole country.</p>  <p>  What contact has the Department had with NAMA on the subject of this land?  The land came into the ownership of the State through a developer who was involved in the Dundrum town shopping centre and was not able to hold onto it.  NAMA has put it up for sale with an auctioneer but we have to make sure it is not sold.  It is of no development potential.  Some 93% of the land is in the Wicklow SAC and one can do nothing with it, such as put up a wind farm or buildings.  It is under freehold at the moment and we should get back control of it to use it as part of the Wicklow National Park. </p>  <p>  There is only one difficulty, which is that it is in Dublin.  If we can see beyond borders it could also be part of a Dublin mountain uplands park, as proposed by South Dublin County Council.  Last week the council announced this as the centrepiece of its tourism strategy, suggesting it could bring in some &euro;26 million and create 2,500 jobs.  The Dublin mountain partnership, which I was involved in setting up, has been an amazing achievement in the past ten years.  People walk, cycle and engage in all types of activities in the Dublin mountains and these 5,000 acres would be an incredible facility.  I ask the Minister to make sure the National Parks and Wildlife Service intervenes and recognises that this has huge value to the State.  NAMA cannot sell it as a social requirement was stitched into the legislation.</p>  <p>  I am keen to hear what the National Parks and Wildlife Service thinks of this resource and what mechanisms we can find, at this late stage, to make sure it is not sold but kept for the people of this country to whom it belongs.</p></speech>

Accordingly, it would not be appropriate for me to discuss the role of NAMA.</p>  <p>  I can, however, provide some background to the role of my Department regarding the land surrounding Glenasmole, which I understand incorporates much of the land known as the "Featherbeds".  The land in question encompasses some 4,900 acres, as outlined in the advertisement issued by the firm handling the sale of the land.  The majority of this land lies within a special area of conservation and a special protection area and for that reason is a very important site for nature conservation.  The land also adjoins the Wicklow Mountains National Park, Ireland's largest national park.</p>  <p>  In February 2014, the predecessor of the current Minister for arts, heritage, regional, rural and Gaeltacht affairs met with officials from Mountaineering Ireland, at which the question of lands near Wicklow Mountains National Park held by NAMA was discussed.  After this meeting, officials from the Department approached NAMA to discuss those lands, with a meeting held in April 2014.  On foot of the meeting, in early May 2014 the Department expressed an interest in acquiring the lands in question.  NAMA responded by indicating that the board of NAMA had recommended that NAMA engage, where feasible, with other State bodies, where that body has expressed an interest in acquiring a property for a purpose specifically linked to its statutory functions.</p>  <p>  Between May 2014 and September 2015 there was intermittent contact between officials from the Department and NAMA.  Discussions in August and September 2015 related to the valuation of the land in question.  In June 2016, I understand there were media reports regarding the proposed sale by NAMA of the lands in question.  I also understand a separate commercial property management firm is handling the sale and has advertised the property for sale by private treaty.  Given its closeness to Wicklow Mountains National Park and given its importance for nature conservation as an SAC and SPA, the land in question would be very important to the national park.  However, given the scarce resources available for capital investment in our national parks and nature reserves, I am mindful of the need to focus on the core responsibilities relating to the management of the parks and reserves.  For that reason, the Department could only consider acquiring this property if the price fell within a certain range.</p></speech>

If officials and NAMA have been involved in talks and been haggling over price, which I presume is what the Minister of State said, how have we let it be publicly put up for sale?  Media reports suggest it has an asking price of some &euro;2.5 million but the problem is that, when it is opened up to other bidders, it will be difficult for the State to get the price right between the National Parks and Wildlife Service and NAMA, though I hope there will not be any difficulty in this regard.  The Minister's response confirms that we are all agreed on the fact that this makes absolute sense.  A national park beside the existing national park would increase the park by 10% and is a perfect fit for what we already have.  It would add huge value to the State.  How does the Minister of State propose entering into talks with the Minister for Finance and NAMA to stop this and not allow private people to come in?</p><p>If the price reported in the newspapers is correct, it is only about &euro;500 an acre.  I believe the Minister has done some work in auctioneering and he will know that is not a high price.  In terms of some of the benefits that would accrue, this site is located beside a huge population and is used frequently for recreational purposes.  The health benefits alone of encouraging people to walk there and enjoying the natural benefits of it would mean we would get a very quick return on that price.</p> <p> I ask the Minister to intervene directly in this matter.  I know there are sensitivities around NAMA in terms of how he can approach it and so on, but this is a perfect example in that there is no possible commercial development.  It makes sense for us to get hold of it, finish this quickly so we can stop a private bidder coming in and increasing the price to &euro;3 million or &euro;4 million.  If that happens, we will have real difficulty in getting it back to the State.  How does the Minister of State think he might do it?</p></speech>

In the NAMA Bill politicians were exempt, and rightly so, from interfering with or talking to NAMA.  However, the Minister for Finance can do that, and I will tell him the Deputy's concerns about this issue.</p>  <p>  I want to put on the public record that I agree with the Deputy but I worry about NAMA's valuations with regard to this particular piece of land.  The Deputy is correct.  With the special areas of conservation, SACs, and the habitats directive it will not be used for development; there will be major restrictions in that regard.</p>  <p>  My budget this year for the National Parks &amp;amp; Wildlife Service is &euro;2.5 million so I do not have the resources.  I will have to talk to the Minister for Finance.</p>  <p>  I am dealing with another situation where it is in the public interest, and I repeat that I worry about the valuations NAMA is putting on these properties.  I cannot interfere, and I cannot make that point to NAMA, but I can make it in the D&aacute;il.  This is in the public interest.  I would like to see this property being acquired by the State but with the price I am told NAMA is looking for it is not commercially viable.  I will ask the Minister for Finance to intervene with NAMA.  I cannot personally do that.  I will ask my officials again to talk with NAMA, the Minister for Finance and officials in the Department of Finance to see what can be done because what the Deputy stated is correct.</p>  <p>  I will travel to Wicklow National Park next week where I will have an opportunity to examine the area.  I have visited it in the past.  It is a beautiful area and I would love to see this land being bought by the State.  I cannot intervene but I will ask my officials to talk to the Minister for Finance.  I will ask the Minister for Finance what we can be done with this land.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-07-20a.472" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1217" speakername="Barry Cowen" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016072000037#LL00300"><p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&quot;</p><p><b></b>I wish to introduce this short Bill and my colleagues, with whom I will share time, will elaborate on its contents and the reasons behind it.  They have suggestions which I hope the Minister will consider when initiating a review of the tenant purchase scheme which came into effect earlier this year under the previous Government.  It was welcomed at the time because we had not had one since 2012.  When one considers the number who have availed of it to date, just 73, it begs the question as to its effect or the restrictive nature and conditions associated with it.  It would appear they are quite evident based on the representations I have had from my constituents and from many colleagues in my party who have raised the issue of the restrictive nature of it in regard to incomes and age barriers over the last number of months.  However, my colleagues will elaborate on these.</p><p>If this Bill is accepted, it will give all tenants in local authority owned social housing an opportunity to purchase their homes.  It will give tenants in local authority homes acquired under Part V specifically the option to apply to seek to purchase that home.  Those tenants in Part V homes were excluded from the Government&rsquo;s recently introduced tenant purchase scheme under the guise of preserving mixed tenure in these developments, many of which date back to 2002.  They number almost 4,000 at this stage.</p><p>A clear path to home ownership should not be the sole preserve of the private market.  Owning a home is a vital asset for families and represents a positive transfer of wealth towards low income groups.  Mixed tenure housing estates are a key part of the Fianna F&aacute;il vision for strong families and stable, thriving communities.  However, the exclusion of Part V houses by the Government in its tenant purchase scheme discriminates against lower income households in mixed communities.</p><p>The Bill, if accepted, will give local authority tenants the right to make a long-term investment in their community by owning their own homes.  Far from depleting the social housing stock in an area, the sale of local authority homes via the tenant purchase scheme actually provides an opportunity to replenish and enhance the public housing stock anew.  That is especially pertinent, considering the launch yesterday by the Minister, on behalf of the Government, of the housing strategy.  The aspirations contained within the strategy seek to replenish our stock and to address the stop gaps and the failings of previous strategies and plans by seeking to do what had been originally promised.  We wish that strategy well.  We debated it yesterday and will continue to do so this evening when my colleagues will contribute to the debate.  They will highlight not only the positive aspects within the strategy but also some of the gaps.  We will seek to implore on the Government to close those gaps before budget.</p><p>The tenant purchase scheme releases equity from the sale of council owned homes and removes the costs associated with the maintenance and upkeep of those homes, funding which can then be reinvested in new social housing.  I would expect that any sales from tenant purchase schemes to date and into the future, including Part V, should be retained by the local authority in which the tenants reside.  There should be discretionary spending within the housing departments of the local authorities to ensure adequate funds are in place to meet the maintenance demands of other housing stock - in the case of those tenants who are not in a position to seek to purchase their home at that time.</p><p>My colleagues will elaborate and will raise other issues on the Bill.  I seek support for the Bill so Part V occupants can purchase their homes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-07-20a.473" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1218" speakername="Shane Cassells" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016072000037#LL00400"><p>Home ownership is at the heart of this Bill, which was moved by Deputy Cowen.  Owning ones home is at the very core of who we are for historical reasons, which do not need to be repeated here.  The dream of owning a home has gone out of the reach of many people over the past five years.  Even after the announcement of the housing strategy yesterday, there is a feature in today's <i>Irish Independent </i>where a young mum, Paula Saul aged only 28, admitted that it was too late for her to ever own her own property.  The article stated that although she is on the waiting list for a council house, Paula and her four-year old daughter are going down in the list of priority rather than up, when they were revaluated by the council.  It took Ms Saul one year to find housing that would accept rent allowance.  When the issue of home ownership is addressed today, it is people such as Paula Saul who are uppermost in my mind.  Unless we broaden the opportunities for people to realise the dream of home ownership, we will see an entire generation for whom the dream will remain just a dream and no more.  The headline that screamed out from the pages of the <i>Irish Independent</i>this morning, &quot;I'm afraid that it's already too late for me to ever own my own property&quot;, will continue for years to come.</p><p>We are trying to give people such as Paula some hope.  We have to hope that the encouragement provided in the strategy published by the Minister will see a re-emergence of private construction of homes.  Despite the verbal waffle of some Deputies yesterday, such that by Deputy Boyd Barrett who seems to think that storks deliver houses as nixer to delivering babies, I fully appreciate the need for a healthy construction sector if we are ever going to see the number on housing waiting lists come down.</p><p>On top of this, there is a housing crisis for people have the financial means to purchase a home because of the sheer lack of supply.  Please God we will see a recommencement of construction and that we will then see Part V play an important part in the delivery of homes for those on council housing waiting lists.  If that happens, why should those who availed of Part V homes be treated differently from those allocated council-constructed homes and not be allowed to purchase them at some stage in the future?  Why should the dreams of people like Paula and her daughter be smashed by virtue of the category of home allocated to them?</p><p>I have listened to my constituency colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government with responsibility for housing, Deputy English, speak in the Chamber about the reasons people in Part V homes are not allowed to purchase them.  He explained it was because of the need to maintain a mixed tenure, but he has stated that he remains open to having his mind changed, and I hope the Minister will too if a good argument is presented.  The story of that young mum in today's <i>Irish Independent</i>is the good reason.  The young mums and dads whom I and Deputy English meet in Navan, Trim, Oldcastle and Castlepollard and all over our constituency are the good reason.  There will not be a mad rush to buy up all of these homes by local authority tenants just because the option exists, so why would the Minister set his face against the idea of allowing people the option to purchase their homes?  There is no need to hold firm against the idea simply because it does not sit with the primary legislation.  The Minister should think of the people we all meet every week in our constituency offices and allow them to dream - allow Paula and her daughter the hope of purchasing a home.  The Minister should not let that headline in the <i>Irish Independent</i>be the mantra and the smashed dream for so many people.  He should make the option of purchasing a home a reality and give those people a chance.</p></speech>

The reason given for excluding Part V houses from the tenant purchase scheme was to ensure that the aim of Part V - that is, to have social housing stock available in private housing developments - was not diluted.  If, however, the logic of that reason was followed we would not have a tenant purchase scheme at all.</p>  <p>  There is a separate debate to be had about the sale and resulting reduction of the limited social housing stock we have, but that is for another day.  What is not sensible or appropriate public policy, however, is for the Government to cherry-pick which tenants get the chance to purchase their homes while other tenants are frozen out of the possibility of owning their homes.  It should be obvious that equality of treatment must be at the heart of Government policy across all areas, but particularly in respect of housing.  A functioning republic is correctly assessed on equality of all citizens before the law.  Public policy on housing must be transparent and fair.  It should have been obvious to the previous Fine Gael Government that its tenant purchase scheme was not transparent and fair but, as it was not, Fianna F&aacute;il will honour its duty to the people who put us here as reflected in this Bill.</p>  <p>  There were previous versions of the tenant purchase scheme in local authority systems.  In Wicklow the moneys received were known as internal capital receipts and used to fund other housing-related activities such as refurbishments.  The extension of the tenant purchase scheme to all who have the capacity would increase the moneys available to local authorities to reinvest in their housing stock, so from a financial perspective also this is a no-brainer.  It is a simple Bill, a one-page, equality-based proposal.  I cannot for the life of me think of a single reason to oppose this Bill, even from the political perspective of the Government.  Considering that this is a new D&aacute;il with, hopefully, a more pragmatic and inclusive approach to policy formulation, I ask the Minister to convince his colleagues to support this Bill.</p></speech>

Housing, as we all know, is probably the most important issue facing us at the moment.  I wish the Minister well in what is a very big challenge and the plan he announced yesterday.  It is important because it is an issue we all face every day in our constituency offices.  Moreover, the issue of whether tenants should be allowed to purchase their own homes is becoming more widespread.  If accepted, this Bill will give all tenants in local-authority-owned social homes the opportunity to buy their homes.  It will give tenants in local authority homes acquired under Part V schemes the right to apply to own their own homes.  This is something that people across the country want, but are deprived of doing.  If people were given a Part V house, why should they be excluded because they happened to get what is now an unfortunate or unlucky allocation?  We should fill that legal lacuna and grant these people an opportunity to buy their own homes.  Over the past 13 years, acquisitions of social and affordable housing units under Part V amounted to almost 16,000.  The majority of purchases were of affordable housing units, while social housing units accounted for 38%, including acquisitions by the approved housing bodies.</p>  <p>  The Bill before us today will affect some 4,000 households.  The rule that prevents people from purchasing their homes is a result of the new tenant purchase scheme that was introduced in January 2016 and replaced the 2012 scheme.  Those in Part V schemes were unfairly excluded.  Fianna F&aacute;il believes this is a senseless bureaucratic restriction that needs to be overhauled.  The idea behind this restriction is to ensure residential communities remain as mixed-tenure developments, but this does not appear to be in keeping with the aim of the scheme.  Indeed, the tenant purchase scheme as it stands discriminates against lower-income households in these mixed communities by stating that it is only the right of higher-income households in mixed communities to have an opportunity to own their own homes.  This is fundamentally wrong and unfair.</p>  <p>  All Deputies in this House will agree that communities work best when people take pride in their community and locality.  People are stronger when they have a place to call their own and have the opportunity to buy their own homes.  Local authority tenants are an important aspect of this.  For this reason, primarily, Deputies from all parties and none should support this Bill.  Critics of tenant purchase schemes claim that they deplete housing stock, but the evidence shows that this is not the case.  If tenant purchase schemes are operated properly and prudently, they can actually add to the housing stock.  The length of tenure in a council-owned social home usually covers the entire life cycle of the household tenants.  Once a family is allocated to a local authority home, it usually stays in that home until the couple or single person heading that household dies.  Indeed, it is relatively rare for tenants living alone in three- and four-bedroom houses, for instance, to apply to be placed on the social housing transfer list.  Furthermore, it is neither feasible nor right to encourage or force older people whose children have moved out and are living alone in two-, three- and four-bedroom council houses onto a transfer list.  In my constituency, people have been restricted in this way under the current tenant purchase scheme.  This is not to do with the Bill being proposed here, but there are people who want to buy their own homes who might be in a four-bedroom house but because only three bedrooms are being used the council excludes that family from purchasing their own home.  There are many underlying issues in addition to what we are speaking about today which are unfair and discriminatory, including on age.  If adults have moved out of a house and other family members are still working and want to purchase their own home, they should have the opportunity to do so if they can.  That has to be considered in the context of the legislation introduced previously in addition to the amendment we are proposing today.  Council tenants usually occupy their social homes for a period of anywhere between ten and 40 years.  During this period, in practice the occupied home is taken out of the social housing stock.  Whereas voluntary or co-operative housing bodies use social housing stock with existing tenants as collateral to borrow private finances, local authorities do not do this.  Therefore, far from depleting the social housing stock in an area, the sale of local authority homes via tenant purchase schemes actually provides an opportunity to replenish and enhance the public housing stock.</p>  <p>  There are other cases, such as one I saw last week, of families who received an adaptation grant for a person with a disability but have since been excluded by the council from purchasing their homes on the basis that the council wants to retain housing stock that has been upgraded through adaptation grants.  The Department and the Minister need to consider why the adaptation grant is not being progressed for new housing stock tenants who cannot get the adaptation grants they want and are trying to progress.  That is extremely unfair.  People are being excluded on the basis of age and the natural progression of families, or because someone in the family has a disability.  That is wrong.</p>  <p>  This measure was introduced in Statutory Instrument 485 of 2015.  It is punitive and unfair and it sends the wrong message.  For a Government that has introduced a Minister with responsibility for disability, who sits at the Cabinet table, to exclude people with a disability from purchasing their home is wrong, unfair and needs to be reviewed, together with the issue of age discrimination and so on.</p><p>As has been mentioned, only 73 applications have been made via the new scheme.  It needs to be overhauled.  It has not worked and I hope the Minister reviews it.  <br/><br/>Ultimately, the pathways to home ownership should not be the preserve of the private market.  This Bill will allow thousands of families to realise their dream of home ownership.</p></speech>

The review will commence in January 2017 and the intention is to complete it by 31 March 2017; and<br /><br />(b) the opportunity, in the context of that review, to consider the proposal, as set out in the Housing (Sale of Local Authority Housing) Bill 2016, to include Part V houses for sale under the 2016 Tenant (Incremental) Purchase Scheme.&rdquo;.</blockquote></blockquote><p>I thank Deputy Cowen for providing this opportunity for Members to discuss the important issue of tenant purchase of local authority housing.  I have tabled an amendment to the motion, which recognises the commitment outlined in the programme for Government to review the operation of the new tenant incremental purchase scheme following the first 12 months of its operation, with the review to be completed by 31 March 2017.</p><p>The amendment also notes that the review of the scheme will provide an opportunity to fully consider all issues relating to the purchase of Part V houses.  This will include, in particular, consideration of the impact the inclusion of Part V houses in the new tenant purchase scheme would have on the policy objectives of Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000 and the most appropriate management of social housing stock generally, in a time of increasing demand and stock shortages.</p><p>I fully acknowledge the importance of tenant purchase schemes in providing an opportunity for social housing tenants to become home owners and also as a means of promoting sustainable communities.  The new scheme for existing local authority houses has been well received since its introduction last January and is a very good scheme.  Local authorities have reported considerable interest from tenants in all areas, and this will be reflected in the activity data for the scheme during the first six months of implementation which I will be in a position to publish on the Department's website shortly.</p><p>The Housing (Sale of Local Authority Houses) Regulations 2015 set out the detailed terms and conditions of the new tenant purchase scheme for existing local authority houses, which is provided under Part 3 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014.  The regulations provide for a number of specified classes of houses to be excluded from sale under the scheme.  These exclusions were determined by my Department following considerable analysis undertaken during the development of the scheme.  Broadly, the exclusions relate to houses which have been provided to fulfil specific policy objectives, stock that is in short supply or houses that have been provided to meet the particular needs of certain groups of households. </p><p>The exclusions include houses provided for older people; group housing which has been provided for occupation by Traveller households; and housing for people with a physical or intellectual disability transitioning from institutional care to community-based living in line with the Government policy as set out in the housing strategy for people with disabilities and the HSE document Transforming Lives.  In addition, local authorities have discretion under the regulations to implement local exclusions in order to facilitate the proper management of their housing stock.</p><p>The Bill refers to Part V housing.  The regulations specifically provide for the exclusion of these houses under the scheme, and there is a clear basis for this approach.  Part V of the Planning and Development Act aims to deliver social housing as part of new developments and promote integration and sustainable mixed tenure communities across the country.  The housing strategy which each authority is required to prepare under that Part must, among other things, encourage mixed and balanced communities in order to counteract undue social segregation.</p><p>In considering the Part V agreement in the case of a particular development, a planning authority is required to consider a number of things, including the need to counteract undue segregation in housing between persons of different social backgrounds and the area of the authority.  The authority must also consider whether the agreement will contribute effectively and efficiently to the achievement of the objectives of the housing strategy, whether it will constitute the best use of the resources available to it to ensure an adequate supply of housing, any financial implications of the agreement and its functions as a housing authority<font color="#808080"> </font>and whether the agreement is in accordance with the provisions of the development plan.</p><p>I consider that the sale of houses to tenants secured under Part V would go against the objectives of Part V, as these houses could be sold on and would no longer be available for people in need of social housing support.  This would, over time, erode the original policy goals of Part V and reduce the tenure mix in relevant estates and communities.  For this reason, the regulations governing the new tenant incremental purchase scheme provide that houses transferred under an agreement under Part V may not be sold by a housing authority.</p><p>Deputies will have had time to review and consider the action plan for housing and homelessness published yesterday.  Accelerating delivery of housing for the private, social and rental sectors is a key priority for Government, and the plan therefore sets out practical and readily implementable actions that will increase housing supply to create a functioning and sustainable housing system.</p><p>One of the key pillars of the plan is to ensure better utilisation of our existing social housing stock in order to achieve optimum occupancy of the stock, whether social or private housing.  The retention of existing Part V units and future Part V delivery is an important component of the plan and consistent with Government policy of delivering sustainable communities and the promotion of tenure diversification.</p><p>Ultimately, there is no doubt that we all want to ensure the new tenant purchase scheme is a success for tenants and the communities in which they live.  That is why my Department is monitoring the implementation of the scheme very carefully in conjunction with the housing authorities.  As outlined in the Government&rsquo;s amendment to the motion, we will undertake a full review of the new scheme in conjunction with the CCMA and the Housing Agency.  That will commence in January 2017, a year after the scheme has been in existence.  I intend to have the review completed no later than 31 March 2017 and I will bring forward any changes to the terms and conditions of the scheme which are deemed appropriate based on evidence and data gathered.</p><p>As part of the review, I intend to examine, with the housing authorities, alternative options which may be available for existing tenants of Part V houses who wish to purchase a local authority house and to consider issues around the allocation of Part V houses by local authorities consistent with the terms and conditions of the tenant purchase scheme.  I look forward to engaging with Deputies in regard to that review.</p><p>I have a lot of sympathy for the sentiments expressed by Members opposite in terms of trying to provide the opportunity of home ownership to everybody who wants it.  We also need to balance the other pressures that we as a country face.  We have a dramatic shortage of social housing in Ireland.  We are trying to change the way in which we provide social housing and how communities interact, and have private and social housing next to each other.  </p><p>The idea that we would, without a lot of thought and examining what the review says to us, simply allow for the sale of Part V houses which, in many ways, goes against the policy we are trying to achieve, that is, to create vibrant communities where social housing becomes a normal part of the mix in private developments and simply reduce the number of Part V houses in public ownership by allowing for the sale of them, would be contradictory.  It would go against what I said yesterday about the big idea behind the rebuilding of Ireland plan, which is not only to build a lot of social houses but to ensure that they are in social-housing only housing estates and instead to try to create proper integration.</p><p><i>5 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p> <p>We need to weigh one objective up against the other.  I am sure some individuals who have been lucky enough to get social houses in private developments want to buy out their homes and I respect that ambition but my job is to work with local authorities to make sure we have enough social houses to be able to meet the demand.  If, for example, a family has moved on and one person is living in a house with four bedrooms, is it the right thing to do to sell the house to that person when we need to fill those bedrooms with people who are currently on social housing lists?  The State owns those houses.  We are renting them at the moment to social housing tenants and if we make a decision to sell such houses, we will have fewer houses in our stock.  Until we have a system that will deliver a new social house for every social house that is sold or even two or three new houses for every one that is sold, we must think very carefully about whether we would allow for the sale of Part V units.</p> <p> Let us look at the history of Part V.  When it was introduced initially for all the right reasons, we allowed flexibility in order that developers could buy themselves out of the responsibility on the assumption that the money would be used to build more social housing but in many cases that did not happen.  We could potentially slip into that type of flexibility again and reduce the number of social houses in new private developments by allowing their early sale.  That is a potential cause for concern from a policy point of view and we want to wait until at least the end of the review period in order to make an informed decision on whether we should change the rules for Part V.  That is the reason I propose the amendment to the motion.</p></speech>

We do so because it keeps families in local authority estates, in particular as their income increases and their ability to purchase homes increases.  As the Minister indicated very clearly, that contributes to more sustainable communities with a greater income mix, which is good housing policy.  However, a badly designed tenant purchase scheme can do far more damage than good.  While I accept the good intentions behind the introduction of the Bill, it is important to understand the negative aspects of what is being suggested.  In order to meet the housing need at any one time, the State needs a minimum of 200,000 social houses.  That is not my view; it is the view of the National Economic and Social Council, NESC.  What happens when one&rsquo;s social housing stock falls below that is that it restricts the ability of individual local authorities to meet housing need on an ongoing basis.  Waiting times grow and the ability to respond to emergency needs reduces.  Currently, we have a social housing stock of just under 140,000 units and that includes the 23,000 from the approved housing bodies, so we are already well below the critical threshold of what is needed simply to meet the current need.  It is simply not the case to say that once families are allocated a house, they will remain there for the duration.  When one studies local authorities, it is evident that there is an ongoing level of churn as people move in and out and stock becomes available for allocation.  Therefore, if one sells off houses in the wrong way or too fast and one does not replenish the stock, that creates real difficulties for those with acute housing needs.</p>  <p>  The tenant purchase scheme that was introduced early this year is badly designed.  The discounts are far too generous.  It is not the case that by selling those houses, we will generate sufficient income to replenish stock.  In fact, in many instances, the discount is so great that the return to the local authority would be &euro;60,000.  On average, it costs &euro;180,000 to provide council housing in this State.  Therefore, for every three tenant purchases, the stock would only be replenished by one and that is if the local authority recycles the money but given the pressure on roads and other crucial aspects of local authority expenditure, it is doubtful that the money would even be returned to housing.</p>  <p>  It is also important to emphasise that there are other exclusions.  Local authorities exclude in many cases one-bedroom and four-bedroom accommodation and adapted units for people with special needs.  They do that because it is good housing policy to manage the stock appropriately.  None of that is an argument against the legitimate position put forward by Fianna F&aacute;il that people have a desire to own their own home but one must balance that against the overall management of the stock.</p>  <p>  The other crucial point to make relates to another misunderstanding in the Bill, namely, that allowing families in large mono-tenure local authority estates to buy their homes creates an income mix.  Not allowing families in private housing estates to purchase Part V units also allows one to maintain an income mix, so while they appear to be opposite policies, they produce the same objective which is a sustainable level of income mix.  In Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s view, the 10% social housing requirement that was introduced by the previous Government is far too low.  Sinn F&eacute;in introduced a Bill two weeks ago to increase it to 25% and that is not just to provide more houses but to ensure private housing estates have a greater level of mix.  Sinn F&eacute;in does not support the effect of the Bill.  While we support the idea of people having a right to buy their home, there are simply too many downsides.</p>  <p>  At the Committee on Housing and Homelessness, we were part of the minority that wanted the current scheme suspended until the overall stock of social housing is brought up to the right level and then one could start a sensibly designed tenant purchase scheme, as long as the stock is replenished according as it is sold.  However, having said that, we understand it is an important issue.  We think it is appropriate that it is considered in the context of the Government&rsquo;s review and on that basis, we will support the Government's amendments.  I say very genuinely to the Deputies across the Chamber that I accept the sincerity of the proposition they have put before the House but before they rush into trying to convince the rest of us of the merits of their proposition, they should look at the impact on overall social housing stock management and the negative impact of selling off too much stock on the ability to meet the needs of those who have no home or inadequate housing because they are very real issues with which we all need to grapple.</p></speech>

We also know that Part V housing has dried up because there is no private development and even though there is a need, because of house prices at the moment, it is impossible for builders to construct houses as it would cost them more than they would get for them.  All of those issues have forced people into the private rented sector and that has driven up rents, which has created the current crisis.  Due to the cap on rent allowance, many families come to the Minister&rsquo;s office and to the offices of the Fianna F&aacute;il representatives and all other Members in this Chamber because they cannot get landlords to sign up to the rental allowance scheme, RAS, and the housing assistance payment, HAP, and because landlords do not take rent supplement tenants in the necessary numbers to deal with those who require social housing.  That is the perfect storm we have at the moment.  That is the nature of the housing crisis we are all trying to address.</p>  <p>  I accept there has been some positive movement by the Government in recent times and while it does not go far enough, at least some action is finally being taken to address the housing crisis.  In part, that is due to all parties coming together to discuss the issues, as was the case at the Committee on Housing and Homelessness that examined all of the issues.  While all parties do not agree with all of the proposals, let us at least celebrate the fact we have some movement.  What I do not support, however, is a move to reduce housing stock at this juncture.  That would be a bad idea.  A couple of weeks ago, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin said in this House that we need to start building council houses again and yet the Bill would actively reduce the number of council houses in the State.  I do not see the logic of that approach, given the crisis we have.</p>  <p>  I do not have enough time to address the Bill in detail.  When one only has three or four minutes available, one can only address the broad points.  My other two colleagues will make similar points.  Like Teachta &Oacute; Broin, I agree that the Bill was introduced with the best of intentions but, unfortunately, its outworking would have the net effect of reducing the amount of social housing stock in the State at a time when we have a housing crisis and I do not think that is the solution that is required to deal with the problems faced by the people in my constituency of Waterford and elsewhere in the State.</p></speech>

Societies in which people have home ownership are generally wealthier societies.  In many other countries in which people rent for all their lives, much of the money a person makes in his or her lifetime is given to a landlord and is funnelled to the top of that society.  There are very wealthy landlord classes in many countries around Europe and the middle classes end up without any equity after working all their lives.  In Ireland, we have a system that is different and the opposite of that.  It comes from a tradition in which many people want to own their own homes.  That is very positive and is something we need to encourage and support.</p>  <p>  I have one point to make in regard to the notion that we should allow people to purchase Part V houses.  I principle, I agree with it.  The problem is that we are now in a housing crisis and that has to be borne in mind.  We are in a situation in which there are very few houses being built in the private sector and absolutely none being built in the public sector.  When all of that is considered, we have put ourselves into this position in which a number of people in Part V houses want to buy their own home.  Of course they should be able to do it.  However, the problem is that in doing that, we totally deplenish the housing stock that we have.  We have to recognise that that is a huge problem.  This can only be done in the context of an overall review of everything that we are doing.  The housing policy that was announced yesterday is a part of that.  The review will be out by next March.  We need to look at it in the round at that point.</p>  <p>  The present incremental purchase scheme is not a good one.  I remember the old scheme that most councils had whereby, if a person lived in a house, for every year that he or she was paying rent, he or she got 3% off the price of the house, up to 30% after ten years.  It meant that most people did not set out to buy their houses until they had been there for seven, eight or perhaps even the ten years, at which stage they were very settled in the community.  The present scheme means that a person can actually buy a house after living there for 12 months or two years.  I do not think that is a good thing.  The other issue that has to be borne in mind is that very many people who wish to buy their own houses do not have access to finance at the moment to do so.  There are bigger issues here that need to be dealt with than just the purchase of Part V houses.</p>  <p>  While I absolutely appreciate the spirit of the motion that is being put before us, I believe we need to act in an overall context of examining everything around how houses are purchased in Ireland, from the point of view of local authority houses, people who are in more working-class families and people in the lower middle classes who want to try to buy their own home and pursue that option because they live in local authority houses.  That is something we need to deal with.  There are also people out there who just want to buy a private house and cannot do so right now because there is no access to capital anywhere.  That is another big issue that we have to bear in mind.  I absolutely agree with the spirit of the motion but I believe it is ill timed.  It needs to come in the context of a review of the overall process and the overall plan that we are bringing forward.  The Government's proposal, as set out in the amendment, to postpone looking at all of this and look at it in the round next March, or whenever the review comes to a conclusion, is the right way forward.</p></speech>

Irish governments over the last ten years have failed at this in many regards, but none more so than in housing.  The current crisis is years in the making but its origins lie in the decisions of the past and present governments not to get involved in building houses and to allow the private sector to supply the basic needs of housing.  The small sop given to social housing was the provision of Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000, which was to enable the development of mixed-tenure and sustainable communities in order that when private firms were building our estates, local authorities would have a dividend of social housing which therefore helped the wider community at large.  In line with this, Part V units are excluded from the tenant purchase scheme to ensure that units delivered under this mechanism will remain available for people in need of social housing support and that the original policy goals of the legislation are not eroded over time.</p>  <p>  The house purchase scheme just introduced allows for the main tenant, partner or spouse to purchase a property based on his or her income.  This clearly discriminates against older people in particular, who will not get approval on the basis of age and future earnings.  The previous scheme allowed for other members of the family in the tenancy to raise the necessary finance, which allows for a greater mix in ownership.  With regard to this Bill by Fianna F&aacute;il, it seems that we are going back in time to a situation in which social housing is left once again at the mercy of private developers.  The whole premise seems strange in that a person who receives a Part V social housing unit could after a year go out and purchase it at a discount, mainly on the basis of earnings.  It goes against the whole idea that initially underpinned Part V.  Sinn F&eacute;in believes that any money obtained under the house purchase scheme should be ring-fenced to build further social housing and not end up in a kitty.  Any sale of housing stock should be replaced one for one.</p>  <p>  In relation to the amendment by the Minister proposing to review the tenant purchase scheme after one year in operation, it is difficult to see how one could review a tenant purchase scheme of this nature after a year.  However, we are not opposed to the Government&rsquo;s amendment, as it will achieve what needs to happen with regard to the original amendment.  In the context of the review in one year, it shows that it is another exercise of kicking the can down the road by the Government-----</p></speech>

I thank the Fianna F&aacute;il members for giving us the opportunity.  I believe we need to think through issues of this kind.  Everybody here supports mixed tenure and wants to see more mixed communities rather than having all of the social housing tenants in one part of a city or town and private occupiers and owners in other areas.  This discussion also raises the issue of maintenance and replenishment of local authority stock.  That is an important policy issue.  We cannot have policies around tenant purchase in isolation, separate from the activities of local authorities in actually building and acquiring houses.  I would like to see some clear guidelines in the context of the review of the tenant purchase scheme whereby local authorities would be required to consider the maintenance and replenishment of their stock in the context of their decisions about the sale of properties to tenants.</p>  <p>  I have a bit of a problem with the specificity of what can and cannot be sold, as set out by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, although I understand some of the reasons for refusing the sale of certain categories of property.  I would prefer to see the local authorities having a bit of discretion as well as responsibility in making these decisions.  I hope it would give them some encouragement to be more proactive in building units and taking up opportunities that are there.  For example, a provision was set out earlier this year whereby, if one were building 15 units or less at a value of &euro;2 million or less, one needed only one application process with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  It was clearly designed to speed up the building of small groups of houses and apartments that local authorities could get down to building quickly.  Yet, as I understand from the response to a recent parliamentary question, there has not been one single application from a local authority under that scheme.  It would not be any harm at all if local authorities had to balance in some way the replenishment of their stock with the selling of their stock.  On the other hand, there are obviously the people who want to buy their own homes.  That has to be put into the mix as well.  It has to be a balance.  That is why the exclusion of Part V units does not seem to me to be something that should be set in stone.  I agree with the principle that Part V units should be saleable.</p><p>I do not think it will make a huge difference at the moment in terms of housing stock because I doubt there are very many Part V units.  As the Minister said, under the Government led by Fianna F&aacute;il, developers were allowed to pay money to local authorities instead of building houses.  In most cases, that money never turned into houses for local authority tenants.  Since then there has not been an awful lot built.  I have not tabled too many parliamentary questions on this matter, but I wonder how many Part V houses there actually are.  I doubt if there are many.</p></speech>

I therefore doubt if much of that housing stock is going back for recycling within the social housing system.  It is important to have this debate and I agree with Deputy Martin Kenny that there are bigger issues surrounding this that need to be considered.  In the short term, this particular measure does not make a huge difference.  In that regard, I do not have any great problem with the Minister's amendment, because it is only putting it off for nine months.</p>  <p>  There are bigger issues.  I agree that getting permission for a tenant purchase loan can be quite difficult.  One of the things that bothers me is that while people have great difficulty in getting loans from banks to purchase houses, there is also a local authority loan system that very few people seem to be able to access.</p></speech>

It seems particularly strict and restrictive.  That wider context needs to be examined because local authority loans should be an opportunity for those on relatively low or middle incomes to purchase a house, be it a former local authority house or a private one.</p>  <p>  People have said that 73, the number of people who have applied under the current tenant purchase scheme, is a small number.  It is not a particularly small number, however, considering the scheme only began in January.  I assume that the numbers will increase.  There are other issues, including whether people on long-term social welfare incomes should have that income included.  There is a case for that because, if it is a long-term payment then, generally speaking, it stays with the person for life.  A number of things need to be examined with regard to this Bill.  Overall, I would prefer to see more discretion and responsibility at local authority level, rather than centrally.  The situation can be different in various areas.  For example, in my own constituency, where we have had a significant regeneration programme, the council has purchased quite a number of houses in private estates, not under Part V but directly.  The same issue would arise there as to whether the people living there are allowed to purchase and how much it would affect the social mix in those estates.  </p>  <p>  While there are a number of wider issues, overall it is important to have this debate given the importance of having a much better supply of local authority houses than we currently have.  I support what Fianna F&aacute;il is seeking to achieve, but there is an argument for giving it a bit of time.  We will certainly need to review the overall scheme in the context of the amount of local authority housing stock that we have.</p></speech>

I would not particularly like to thank Fianna F&aacute;il for bringing this Bill before us because, of all the motions and Bills we need on the housing crisis, this one would be last on my list.  Rent controls, penalties for land hoarding, and a challenge to the EU fiscal rules barring us from spending money that we have on building social housing would be preferable.</p>  <p>  The Fianna F&aacute;il Bill applies to Part V and aims to sell off our public housing.  I was a councillor for many years, so I can understand why tenants want to buy their houses.  It is to pass them on to their families and in some cases to save money.  That is because at one point some tenants were paying more than the differential rent in Blanchardstown, with two or three young adults working in the house, and more than their neighbours were paying on their mortgages.  It was therefore a practical consideration.  Generally, tenants of 30 years' duration will say: "Oh my gosh.  Look at what I've paid for this house and I don't own it."  In the case of Part V we are not talking about that longevity, but about tenants who have been housed recently.  The key problem, however, is that we are talking about a massive drop in social housing stock in the last ten years, and Fianna F&aacute;il is bringing forward a proposal to sell off even more of it during the biggest housing emergency that we have ever had.  Extending the ability to sell off public housing during a housing emergency is really irresponsible.  It is akin to cutting down trees without replanting them.  That is the reality.</p></speech>

I will tell him the damage this Bill will do.  Anyone who deals with homeless people every day will say that the only source of permanent social housing now is existing council stock that becomes vacant.  There is absolutely nothing new being built.  Figures from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government's website show that in 2014 the number of properties obtained for social housing through local authority construction and acquisition amounted to 285; the number obtained through retrofitting was 44; the numbers obtained through leasing and RAS, which is not permanent social housing, were 1,062 and 2,173, respectively; and the number of casual vacancies was 3,650.  Do Deputies need any more proof that the only way people can get a permanent house in the community is through the passing on of existing council stock?  Yet Fianna F&aacute;il is proposing to get rid of that as a source, at a time when they know that nothing is being built.  It is absolutely incredible.  It is a vote-getting exercise at the expense of people on the housing list and the homeless.  It will make life much more difficult for public representatives such as ourselves who are besieged every day by people seeking housing.</p>  <p>  The Committee on Housing and Homelessness did not recommend this.  It recommended a review of the tenant purchase scheme.  I would be in favour of suspending tenant purchase during the housing crisis, but let us review it.  Included in the review should be information about how many houses were sold on after they were bought.  I see that happening a lot in council estates.  Anyone who is familiar with council estates will know that private rented housing is the biggest issue in them.  A review should include all of that plus the idea that councils are acquiring houses and selling them at the same time.  This proposal is lunacy.</p></speech>

An ideology is being sold to us that somehow everybody must own his or her own house.  I do not know if it is a hang-up that goes back to Michael Davitt and the Land League, but I think it is more political than that.  It is an agenda that has always been driven, particularly in the last few decades, by those with a vested interest in development and building.  In fact, however, one should look to other European countries.  I lived in Germany for a while and people there rented all their lives.  They rented with strong legislation that stopped landlords from putting up the rent.  The legislation also ensured that tenants lived in decent conditions and could not be evicted at the drop of a hat.  One would never hear of a landlord in Germany saying: "Oh Jesus, I need to sell this place, so you have to go," which is what is happening to tens of thousands of families across this country at the moment.</p>  <p>  While there is a social housing policy in Germany, there is also a big focus on ensuring that people live in decent conditions with security of tenure and fixed rents.</p><p>This is typical of European cities.  In Ireland, we have a hang-up about owning our own home.  I say that hand on heart because in the 1970s or 1980s my parents bought the house in which I grew up, having lived in and paid rent on it for 30 to 40 years, which was typical across Ireland at the time.  In a housing crisis of the type with which we are faced today, we will be making a big mistake if we go down the road of allowing more council houses to be sold off.  The Part V provision is a bit of a joke in terms of how it was abused by the developers, many of whom, as stated by a Deputy earlier, were allowed to pay a fee rather than hand over houses, and many of them did.  Many developers never passed on that money.  There are real difficulties in terms of the approach being taken in this area.</p> <p> In 2006, some 11% of the entire housing stock in Ireland was social housing that was in the hands of the local authorities.  Since then, as a result of the housing crisis, demand for social housing has increased but the stock available to us has shrunk.  This Bill will do nothing to address that issue.  It will only worsen the situation.  I would have thought that at the very least Fianna F&aacute;il would recognise that their friends in the construction industry are not developing and building and so what we have we should hold onto for as long as we can to meet the desperate need of social and affordable homes required by people on the housing waiting lists.  </p> <p> I am strongly against the adoption of this Bill.</p></speech>

In regard to the myth that we will have a huge influx of people looking to buy, that will not happen for the simple reason that people will first need to have the money to buy.  The sale of these houses will provide councils with the funding needed to build more housing for people who need it.  We should look at this proposal in a more positive way.</p>  <p>  In regard to the current scheme, there are people in my constituency who wanted to buy their council homes but owing to the many clauses in that scheme, including that the purchaser must have X amount of income and so on, they could not do so.  Many of them were approved for credit unions loans, under stringent rules, but this was not accepted.  I am not suggesting the houses should be sold cheaply, rather they must be sold at a price which ensures we take in sufficient money to assist in the construction of more houses.  In regard to the statement that people in Ireland are hung-up about owning their own homes, that is true.  It is what we are used to.  A person who buys a house with a view to renting it out does so to make money.  In regard to the idea that we are on a bit of a fun trip in terms of buying houses and renting them out with a view to owning them in the future, no person buys a house to lose money on it.  That is the reality.  Let us live in the real world.</p>  <p>  If we were to aspire to everybody in the country living in social housing we would never have enough money to make that happen.  We need to live in the real world.  If we can pull in enough money to assist us in the provision of houses for people who need them it will be a win-win situation for everyone.</p></speech>

I find it incredible that it advocates a broadening of the tenant purchase scheme to sell-off social housing at knock down prices at a time when we are faced with a massive housing and homeless emergency.  I understand there is demand from tenants to buy their homes but surely the priority now is not just retention of our inadequate 120,000 social housing stock but the construction of more social housing and the maintenance of an adequate level of social housing stock into the future.</p>  <p>  The key reason for the current crisis is the disastrous decisions of successive Governments and local authorities to divest themselves from social housing provision and to abandon their responsibilities to provide good quality, well-maintained, low-cost housing to those who need it.  There needs to be a reversal of the group think and ideological bias against local authority housing that lies at the heart of the current crisis, namely, local authority housing bad and private housing good.</p>  <p>  The housing and homeless strategy launched yesterday by the Government includes a proposal to build 47,000 social housing units over the next five years.  In my opinion, this is about 50% of what is actually required.  Let us for a moment assume that the 47,000 social houses are built and allocated.  Are we then going to repeat the mistakes of the past by initiating a scheme to sell them off at knock down prices only to be faced in ten years with the same situation with which we are faced today?  I am not a supporter of tenant purchase schemes unless they are well constructed and provide that when a tenant buys a house the money derived from the sale is used to buy back or build a new council house.  They should also include strong clawback clauses in situations where houses are resold within five or, perhaps, ten years.</p>  <p>  The issue of an elderly person living in a three bedroom house was mentioned.  Why are we not building small clusters of ten or 15 units in our communities for elderly and disabled people?  This would allow elderly and disabled people to sell their houses to the council and move into a secure environment, if they want to, thereby providing more housing stock for the council.  We must resist the demands for Part V social housing.  It is not the priority.  I am amazed that any serious political party could come forward with such a proposal given the crisis we are faced with.</p></speech>

It will do nothing to address any of the problems in our broken housing system or to better the housing options for the 130,000 people in need of social housing and the thousands of people in emergency accommodation and homelessness.</p>  <p>  There is a need for crucial legislation in relation to the voluntary housing bodies.  We were promised by the former Minister with responsibility for housing, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, who is in the Chamber, and by her successor, that legislation on the administration of the voluntary housing bodies would be introduced but that has not happened.  Perhaps Fianna F&aacute;il could have taken this opportunity to bring forward such a Bill today.  </p>  <p>  The outlook continues to be very bleak for people who are urgently seeking social housing.  Up to the last week of June, there were 1,078 homeless families, including 2,106 children.  Homelessness is primarily a problem in Dublin and the surrounding four counties.  The Government has not addressed this issue.  Like many of my colleagues, I have had a look at Rebuilding Ireland.  While in general terms it is a step forward in that the Minister, Deputy Coveney, has at least begun to look at the problems, it is far too little, far too late.  In regard to the output figures provided in the strategy, I made a submission to the Housing and Homelessness Committee on 10 May, which I subsequently sent on to the Minister, in which I sought expenditure of &euro;10 billion.</p><p>I thought that was the kind of expenditure we needed to ramp up social housing to address the real problems that I and other colleagues in this city deal with week in, week out.  I asked the Minister to declare a housing emergency and to go after the housing issue in a FEMPI- like manner.  He has not done that.  He has mentioned the word "emergency" in various speeches and interviews but he has not declared an emergency and said "let's go for it".  </p> <p> Yesterday, the Labour Party produced a Bill based on the Kenny report, which should have been implemented.  I commend Deputy Jan O'Sullivan on bringing forward the Bill.  The Labour Party had five years to bring it forward and do something drastic about the price of building land.  All parties in this House recognise that the Kenny report was a solution to a huge part of the housing problem.  It has to be said that we always seemed to have a housing crisis.  There has always been a housing crisis going back to the 1970s and 1960s.  When I began representing people in the 1980s, there was a housing crisis.  We never had enough homes in the social housing area.  I noticed how closely the Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il parties are working on this issue.  Deputy Cowen has said that unless the Minister introduces such and such into "Rebuilding Ireland" in time for the budget, this plan will not come into effect because we will all be out campaigning in a general election.  Both sides of the House must be brought along in respect of what is effectively a Fine Gael-Fianna F&aacute;il Government.  </p> <p> However, the numbers will not do very much for the people I represent week in, week out.  The Minister talks about an output of 12,600 units last year and 14,000 this year.  This year has been very disappointing.  The target for 2017 is 18,000 and increases to 22,000 and finally in 2020, which will be a great year when everything happens, we will produce the very basic figure of 2,500 units per month.  The previous Government signally failed to meet that target.  </p> <p> My fundamental criticism of "Rebuilding Ireland" and even the legislation before us today is that we are relying on the same old systems, the same old failed developers, the same old speculative model of finance and the same old land systems.  It is the same old, same old.  The Minister may be doing with a bit more brio than his predecessor but he has not come forward with anything really innovative which would solve the problem for those 2,000 children who will be in homeless accommodation tonight, tomorrow evening, the following weeks and through to 2017.  The Minister says that hotel accommodation for the homeless will be fairly rare in 2017 but the reality is that we have an emergency.  The Minister had the opportunity to come in here like the Minister for Finance and his predecessor, the late Brian Lenihan, did and say that this is a terrible crisis, we must act now and house our homeless and our most vulnerable families, go through X, Y and Z of what needs to be done and do whatever is necessary in terms of changing the Constitution or bringing in the Labour Party Bill introduced yesterday.  Those kind of measures include local authorities building again.  Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il discouraged local authorities from engaging in direct build.  When one looks at the figures in the Minister's report, is it not deplorable that we turned out 95,000 units during the Celtic tiger and wondered how we could fill them but only 4,000 or 5,000 of those units were social housing units?  Unfortunately, I can only give the Minister a D plus.</p></speech>

We will be housed out of it before we are finished, pardon the pun, but that will not give any houses to the homeless.  I remember when Part V was introduced.  I was a member of a county council in south Tipperary and was a big supporter of it because the boom was going strong and we needed to get a grip and get some houses for local authorities.  I remember being involved with a lot of schemes and helping smaller builders who always played their part and were glad to do so.  There was a lot of resistance from the Construction Industry Federation which did not want Part V.  As I said last night, it is the same today.  We have builders, small builders and developers.  Deputy Wallace is not here but last night he did not know whether he was a developer or builder.  He was confused and I did not meet him today to find out which one of them he is now.  Large builders and developers did not want Part V.</p>  <p>  I do not have any hang-up about selling these houses and I think I can support the Bill because there is discrimination between people in social and affordable housing and Part V housing and those in local authority housing.  Small schemes with 10% might have only two houses and one might be social and affordable while the other is a straight local authority house whereby if somebody leaves a house, a tenant is appointed.  The person in the social and affordable house would have bought it because they were able to buy it with a housing assistance loan, local authority loan or a mortgage so why not have equality and parity of esteem for tenants?  I know about the argument that we do not want to denude Part V estates of private tenants but I think it is unfair.  There are all sort of anomalies in the scheme whereby older people who are trying to buy their house cannot do so.  Schemes are so ridiculous that somebody with life savings who wants to buy the local authority house in which they might have lived for over 30 years is not allowed to do so because they must go for a loan for which they will not qualify because of their age.  Most pensioners only have the old age pension and many do not even have the contributory pension.  How are they going to get a loan?  They have the money.  The vulture funds can come in and buy with money that could be from anywhere.  It could be from money laundering and bank robberies.  They can buy a whole street or estate.  </p>  <p>  We must look at housing and it will take a bit of time and effort.  I again appeal to the Minister to look at it.  I bumped into an auctioneer in a hotel not far from here.  He said that what we are discussing here is amazing and that he could not fathom us but there was nothing new about that.  One of the main drivers of the strategy was that we would not have families living in hotels.  The man told me that he once owned a hotel but got into difficulties and sold it for &euro;800,000 a couple of months ago.  He said that the new buyer is signing a lease for ten years with Dublin City Council which will use it to house families.  Where are we going?  What is going on?  Does one hand not know what the other is doing?  The man sold it because he had to and we are bringing in policies that will mean that there will be no more people in hotel accommodation.  The best part of it is that a ten-year lease at &euro;750,000 per year adds up to &euro;7.5 million.  At the same time, we are in a flurry here talking about how there will be no more children in hotels.  Are we really dealing with the problem or are we just playing games?  Are officials in Dublin City Council and other councils so out of touch that they do not know what is the Government's policy?  I know Deputy Danny Healy-Rae disagrees with me about whether councils got the money to build houses in the past number of years.  A Minister from Tipperary announced money like it was falling out of the sky.  The county manager was smothered with the money the local authority was getting to build houses.  He did not know whether he was coming or going and he did not build a house.  I told him months previously that he would not build a hen house.  He built nothing because it was just announcement after announcement with a big fanfare and nothing being delivered.  We need a lot of soul searching and thinking and this Bill is an effort to bring about fairness in the middle of it all.</p></speech>

It is not acceptable.  I deplore the fact he said that the local authorities had lost their ability to build houses.  They could not build houses when they were not able to access money.  The tenant purchase scheme, which was a great scheme that allowed tenants to purchase their houses, was dropped for three or four years.  The new scheme is not accessible to many tenants who wish to purchase their houses.  As Deputy Mattie McGrath said, old age pensioners are not allowed to purchase a county council house even though they might have savings achieved over a number of years.  For the last three years, we have had no tenant purchase scheme but now these people are being denied the right to purchase the house they have lived in, repaired, modified and brought up to a standard over their lifetime.  They cannot buy the house because this scheme, as set out, is designed so that old age pensioners or people on social welfare do not qualify.  Another category of people who will not qualify are people who were in arrears with their rent over the last three years for one reason or another.  That happens to people and they catch up again but they are being denied the right to purchase their house or go into a purchasing scheme.  What that scheme actually meant for the likes of Kerry County Council was that the money that was accrued from the tenants purchasing their houses went back into the repair of voids or vacant houses.  As the Department was not giving the local authorities any funding, it meant there were many houses lying idle around the county and people were asking us why such houses were vacant for such a long time.  There was no money being accrued because there was no tenant purchase scheme.  It is only a little better now and I am asking the Minister to modify and clear the blockages that are preventing tenants from purchasing their houses.  It is having a double impact in that the voids are not being brought back to standard and cannot be offered to tenants who are waiting on the list with their thumbs up looking for some place they could call home and have security of tenure.</p><p>I raised the national spatial policy with the Taoiseach yesterday.  Where is the Minister directing the local authorities to dezone lands, especially around towns where there was phase 1 and phase 2 zoning?<font color="#F52B97">  </font>It is becoming apparent that in many of the phase 1 zoning, there is trouble with NAMA, ownership and people getting money to go forward.  Phase 2 are now going to be dezoned so we will finish up with no land to build houses on.  We cannot build houses if there is no land zoned to build them on.  I appeal to the Minister to look at that.</p></speech>

It is something that is ingrained in our culture and something we all work towards achieving.  It is considered a very important goal and milestone in one's life.  It is my belief, and one shared by many citizens, that it is incumbent on our State to assist our citizens to have their own home and not to put obstacles in their way.  The current legislative position with regard to the tenant purchase scheme does exactly that; it erects a barrier to people owning their own home for no apparent good reason.  It blocks tenants who acquired homes under Part V schemes from accessing the tenant purchase scheme which is a clear discrimination against lower income households.  The reason we are being offered as to why Part V homes were excluded in the first place is that it is to ensure that all residential communities remain mixed tenure developments.  I do not buy into that reason; it is not as if we will end up with all mono-tenure developments.  It will just not happen.  Even if it was a genuine reason, it is simply not a good enough reason to expressly exclude or block certain tenants from owning their own home, given the importance of owning one's home to an individual, their families and communities.  We have to strike a balance between our desire to maintain mixed tenure developments, which is understandable and desirable, and people's need for their own home.  The reality is that many of these tenants and people have been living in these homes for many years.  It also goes a long way towards building sustainable communities by offering people in Part V homes the opportunity to purchase that home if they wish.  It is manifestly unfair to limit the social mobility of any person or family motivated by our desire to ensure they remain in social homes because we think it looks better.  Is that not a very easy thing for us to say when we are not in that position?  If people want to aspire to own their own home, we should not be preventing it.  This Bill seeks to rectify that problem by amending the primary legislation to allow local authority homes or local authority tenants in Part V homes the opportunity to purchase that home.</p>  <p>  I hope to see cross-party support for this Bill.  This change is also very positive for our local authorities and far from depleting the housing stock, which has been suggested, it would have the opposite effect because it would enable the local authority to replenish its housing stock by giving it additional resources in terms of finances.  It would release equity from those homes and it would also release the local authority from the cost and financial burden of maintaining those homes.  In reality, those homes are not really in the social housing stock because many of these tenants stay there for very long periods of time ranging from ten to 40 years.</p>  <p>  There are only positive aspects to this Bill.  It is a win for local authorities, citizens and tenants.  It is important to note that Fianna F&aacute;il highlighted this deficiency when the scheme was first up and running.  We are now trying to fix that problem which affects thousands of potential buyers across our country.</p></speech>

I want to bring a bit of reality to the situation.  The reality is that what we are talking about is just over 2% of the overall housing stock, approximately 3,960 houses.  The purpose of the Bill is to allow tenants the same rights as other tenants.  I cannot understand why, if Sinn F&eacute;in supports tenant purchase, as Deputy &Oacute; Broin said, it would not support this Bill.  Why would it want to create a two-tier tenancy system?  Effectively, this is discrimination based on what type of tenant one is.  Anyone should be able to aspire to own a home.</p>  <p>  Some of the comments by AAA-PBP amaze me but do not surprise me.  I listened to Deputy Coppinger, who unfortunately is no longer in the Chamber to hear this debate, talking about the need for housing.  She talked about her time on Fingal County Council.  In her time in Fingal County Council, she never once supported a development plan; she voted against every single development plan.  In her constituency of Dublin West, she opposed every single development there.  Her colleagues continue to do likewise in Fingal.  Members of AAA-PBP are the very last people I would take any advice from on sorting our housing problem.  The reality of the situation regarding the Part V arrangement, which Deputies Coppinger and Joan Collins bemoaned earlier, is that from 2002 to 2015, if one takes out the difficult four or five years when there was very little construction, more than 16,000 units were provided under it.  That is 16,000 family homes, the majority of them affordable houses where people own them.  There is also a claw back for future sale.  We are trying to level the playing pitch for tenants and to ensure there is not a two-tier system.  If anyone could explain to me why it is right to discriminate between social housing tenants, I would not support this Bill.  This Bill is about rectifying that and removing that discrimination.  The whole idea that we will deplete the stock is nonsense.  The figures do not bear that out; it is 2.33% of housing stock.  Is anyone saying that should this Bill pass, there will be an immediate push towards purchasing those 3,961 houses?  The future sale of these houses would derive their own claw back also.  It is allowing families to set down roots; it is as simple as that.</p><p><i>6 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p> <p>The Government should allow the Bill go through on Second Stage.  We can work on certain aspects on Committee Stage.  While the Government wants to delay this for a further nine months, most will agree that the Irish in general will aspire to home ownership.  Others can bemoan that and state that should not be the case, but it is the case.  Why should someone not be secure in the knowledge that he or she owns his or her own home?</p></speech>

A home is a vital asset for families and represents a positive transfer of wealth to low-income groups.  Mixed-tenure housing estates are a key part of the Fianna F&aacute;il vision for strong families and stable, thriving communities.  However, the exclusion of Part V houses by the Government in its tenant purchase scheme discriminates against lower-income households in many communities.  By stating that it is only the right of higher-income households in mixed communities to have an opportunity to own their own homes, in effect, the Government tenant purchase scheme isolates tenants in Part V social houses in private developments.  The Bill, if accepted, will give all local authority tenants the right to make a long-term investment in their community by owning their own home.  The Bill amends the primary legislation to allow local authority tenants in Part V houses the opportunity to purchase their homes.</p>  <p>  The application of mixed tenure guidelines to refuse tenants the right to purchase their social houses in their communities, in which they may have lived for most of their lives, stigmatises those in social houses.  The exclusion of such tenants is telling these families and individuals that they may never do as their neighbours do and own a home in their community.  Giving all tenants the opportunity to buy in their neighbourhood is good for communities.  It gives everyone a long-term stake, encouraging families to make long-term investments by participating in the communities in which they live.  In my experience as a councillor for many years, I do not know of any Part V houses that came back into local authority stock.  I have never seen any.</p>  <p>  If there is any flaw in the current tenant purchase scheme, it is the provision that the tenant concerned must have been getting social housing support for one year.  If that was five years, maybe it would show a greater commitment by those living in local authority houses to their area.  That might be considered as well.  I believe that the tenant purchase scheme discriminates against those on social welfare.  I accept that the income stipulation is &euro;15,000, but &euro;7,500 of that must be earned income.  I am aware of families in which parents who are caring for children with disabilities and special needs are receiving carer's allowance and cannot go out to work because of the care and attention they must give to their children.  Those people are being discriminated against as well, and it is unfair.  Those people deserve the chance to buy their homes the same as anybody else, or the same as anyone in this House or around this building.  They should have the opportunity to purchase their houses.  That is something that should be looked at so that we can give those people such an opportunity.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-07-20a.525" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1329" speakername="Fergus O'Dowd" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016072000046#UU00300"><p>This is an important debate.</p>  <p>  This Fianna F&aacute;il Bill is not coming at the right time.  Indeed, on the production of the new action plan for housing, what Members on this side of the House and most of the Members on that side of the House were talking about was building houses for people who cannot house themselves and about the provision of housing, particularly in the social housing area.  The fact is that the Government is committed to building 47,000 social housing units between now and 2021, and there is also a significant commitment in an earlier Government plan of 75,000 homes to be provided for housing applicants or those who would qualify for home supports, such as the HAP or rent allowance, by approximately the same time.  Right now, it is all about supply.  It is all about making sure that those houses are built.  That is why the Bill is coming at the wrong time, particularly as Deputy Cowen will be aware that the Government has accepted the recommendation of the committee of which we were both members that the tenant purchase scheme should be reviewed.  The Government commitment, as the Minister outlined, is to have that review take place by early next year.</p>  <p>  The Fianna F&aacute;il speakers opposite all are missing the point that, unlike them, the country has changed.  There has been a significant shift in home ownership over the past number of years.  If one looks at the statistics, one will see that in the 1990s approximately 90% of people owned their own homes but, according to the 2011 census, the percentage of Irish people who owned their own homes was 69.7%, which is a little below the corresponding figure of 73% in the United Kingdom.  It is not true to say that the majority of people own their own homes.  There has been a significant reduction.  In fact, there was a 47% reduction in the number of people who owned their own homes in the 2011 census.  As for the number who rent, at that time - the new census was published only this week - more than 470,000 people rented their own homes.  It is wrong to say that people do not aspire to rent homes.</p>  <p>  With regard to the influx of immigrants into the country during the boom, the number who have remained here since the Fianna F&aacute;il bust is significant.  Many of the immigrant population come from countries where the preponderance of home rental is upwards of 90%.  Notwithstanding the fact that buying a home is a good aspiration if one wishes to do so, it is not the case in Ireland right now, and that is a significant change.</p>  <p>  On the broader issue of a review of the tenant purchase scheme, not even the Fianna F&aacute;il members opposite would disagree that it is important to look after significant groups.  Indeed, Deputy Scanlon mentioned one specifically, and I support him in his point about people with disabilities being able to purchase or, indeed, to live in a home that is suited and adapted to their needs.  That is one of the biggest problems facing me in my constituency work.  People who acquire a disability during their life as they age or people who are born with disabilities cannot get adequate or proper housing.  That is why it is important in the review of the tenant purchase scheme to examine the retention of homes that are adapted for disability.  Regardless of where such houses are, whether they form part of Part V housing or any other housing, we should insist that houses that are adapted for disability are never sold to anybody and that they be available for those who need them.  I hope the Minister, in this review, will look at the designation of a proportion of houses that are in public ownership, be they Part V or otherwise, for people with disabilities.  We all know of people who, as they get older, or even because of illnesses, would like to be near facilities such as the shops, the church or the school.  These are issues that we need to look at also.  In this review, it is important that we examine potentially advantageous locations for people with disabilities in terms of local authority housing, be it Part V or otherwise, and reserve them as never to be sold but to be retained for people who need them.</p>  <p>  Another important point is that the capacity of people, as they age, to live independently is most important.  I do not agree with the way society is going - the idea that after a certain age one ends up in the nursing home.  We need much more assisted living.  We need much more independent living.  In the review of the tenant purchase scheme, it would be useful if we looked at designating houses to be used for assisted living for older people or, indeed, people with disabilities.  We should designate, and never sell, those homes.  In fact, in terms of our planning reform, we should be looking at reserving a proportion of houses in all estates that would meet their needs.</p><p>There is absolutely no doubt those are the trends needed and the changes we must make.  Selling all the houses in a particular estate, whether public or private, is not necessarily the best action to take.  I point out to the Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies opposite that housing agencies like Respond! never sell their homes.  People go into them because they are happy to rent.  There is a significant and increasing number of people who are happy to rent their homes and stay in them.  There is not the demand indicated by Fianna F&aacute;il for this.</p> <p> The question of housing policy is changing.  The size of houses is changing and our families are getting smaller.  There is a much greater need for apartment living.  Although I do not have the statistics, I presume a significant portion of Part V units would be apartments.  We should really look at designating properties for communities and people that need them rather than selling them off.  There should be proportionality, as if something applies in one estate, there is no reason it should not apply in all estates.  These are the fundamental and core markers of a caring and democratic society that provides houses for people who need them while ensuring that those who are least able to purchase a home will have one in the right place, with all the services required.  For example, location is very important for people with disabilities.  There is no other answer than we must do this.</p> <p> The Fianna F&aacute;il Members will want to put this to a vote but we need not necessarily divide on these issues.  Some of us are members of a housing committee so we should debate all the issues, bringing people in to consider objective and clear analysis of the future as we all face it.  I was in local government for many years and Deputy Scanlon was probably there for a similar period.  I am 42 years in public life, for my sins, and all of them in public life are mortal.</p></speech>

That did not work as families could not live in those high-rise apartments.  It did not make sense but at the time they were the best thing since the sliced pan.  In our county, there were houses built with prefabricated structures and after ten years they began to fall apart.  Perhaps Deputy Scanlon remembers how we built houses with no chimneys because at the time electricity was so cheap there was an idea that we could run them on it.  That did not work either and we had to retrofit chimneys to hundreds of houses.</p>  <p>  We have been here before and we do not need to go there again.  The Labour Party Members have left but as Minister, former Deputy Jimmy Tully did a fantastic job in housing.  He dealt very effectively with a major housing crisis.  I ask Fianna F&aacute;il to think again about this.  We could make much progress across this House rather than dividing, which is what Fianna F&aacute;il wants to do.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-07-20a.533" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1311" speakername="John Lahart" time="17:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016072000047#VV00800"><p>I thank my colleague, Deputy Cowen, for bringing this Bill to the House.  My party and I believe this is a progressive Bill and I hope it will receive support from all sides of the House.  As many speakers have said, we have a real longing to own our own homes, which is good.  Owning a home offers people security for themselves and their families.  It also gives people, and families in particular, a sense of pride and buy-in to the community.  My colleagues and I believe people with the willingness, means and support to purchase their own homes should be allowed to do so.  The exclusion of Part V houses by the Government from the tenant purchase scheme does the opposite, as it prevents people who wish to become proud owners of their own homes from making that further step in their local communities.  It is not an example of the Ireland for all that my party wants to see develop.</p>  <p>  We believe families and communities are stronger when people have a place to call their own.  We believe allowing tenants in Part V houses the opportunity to buy these houses and make them permanent homes gives everybody involved a greater stake.  It encourages families to become more involved in local clubs and activities and it helps the family to become embedded in the community.  It signals a commitment to the area.  I know in my own local authority in south Dublin, one of the biggest costs is in maintaining local authority housing, as Deputies across the House realise.  The costs are absolutely colossal.</p>  <p>  I understand there are almost 4,000 households affected by this Part V clause and more than a fifth of these are within the four local authorities in Dublin.  There are 80 in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, close to 250 in Fingal, over 250 in south Dublin and close to 300 in Dublin city.  It is a total of well over 850 households in Dublin alone that are not being awarded the same opportunity as the many thousands of other families across the country.  It is not a fair or equitable approach that is proposed by the Government.  By offering these 4,000 households across the country the opportunity for ownership, we will also, critically, be offering them the opportunity for stability and control over their own living environments into the future and free from the constraints of the local authorities.  We will be offering them the chance to make their house a home.  Allowing a tenant to purchase a house also gives low-income households the right to own a financial asset of significant value, helping low-income householders accumulate wealth.  It is a form of economic safety net for them and their families so they can grow, build and integrate into the community.</p>  <p>  It is almost ironic that yesterday we had the launch of the Government's housing action plan.  As well as getting people out of emergency accommodation and tackling homelessness, it also has plans to help people to purchase their first homes.  On the one hand, the Government is making provisions for people to get on the property ladder but on the other it is preventing people from doing so, stigmatising these people in the process.  A clear path to home ownership should not be the preserve of the private market.  Owning a home provides a vital asset for families and represents a positive transfer of wealth towards low-income groups.  We unapologetically subscribe to that.  Mixed tenure housing estates are a key part of our vision for strong families and stable, thriving communities.  However, the exclusion of Part V houses by the Government in its tenant purchase scheme discriminates against lower income households in mixed communities.</p>  <p>  The positive effects this Bill will have on thousands of families across the country more than justifies not just my support, but the support of all the Members in the House.  Financially, the Bill allows for the release of equity from the sale of these houses, which may be redistributed and reinvested by the local authorities.  There is also the removal of the cost associated with maintenance, which allows the money to be reinvested into new social housing.  At this time, when housing and homelessness is one of our major challenges, exclusion is not the answer.</p></speech>

In particular, I thank those who sought to support the Bill.  For those who do not support it, I make the following observations.  The Minister stated he had sympathy for us as proposers of the Bill.</p><p>However, he stated that he could not support it because he was constrained by a commitment in the programme for Government to review the scheme in its entirety in January, that all the issues raised during any such review would be dealt with and that the review would take two months.  He also stated that given the data offered to him by the Department, with which he concurs, having studied it obviously, the scheme is being well received and is proving very popular.  If that were the case, we would not have heard much of the evidence of my colleagues on it, for example, it having only approved 73 applicants.  It would hardly have one riding high on the polls, if it could be translated into any such thing.</p></speech>

He is pre-empting the work of any review group when he gives an opinion this far out from the review taking place at all, let alone giving it during this debate.  That convinces me that in no way should we support the amendment, which commits to a review of this issue among others.  It convinces me that we on this side of the House should continue to bring forward Bills such as this one to effect the sort of change we think is necessary to address the deficiencies which exist.</p>  <p>  Deputy O'Dowd spoke about those who have been allocated units or homes by approved housing bodies.  He stated they only wanted them because they only wanted to rent a house.  They only wanted those homes because they were the only thing ever offered to them.  Approved housing bodies have taken the place of councils to the detriment of the aspiration of those who would like to own their own homes.  Based on the strategy produced yesterday and the timelines associated with it, I am glad that we have a watching brief to ensure there are improvements because what we have heard before in such plans has never materialised.  We will be holding the Government to account and bringing forward other legislation to fill the gaps left vacant in yesterday's publication despite the best of intentions and the many good things contained within it.</p>  <p>  The big problem relating to the housing crisis and the massive waiting lists that exist throughout the country is that houses are not being built.  The people who want homes do not care where they come from as long as they are built.  There is a duty and an obligation on everyone who has the power to insist that happens to do so.  There is also a right to at least aspire to own one's home.  If a person does not want it, that is fair enough.  He or she does not have to take up the offer.</p>  <p>  We cannot have discrimination.  We heard examples of discrimination not only against those in Part V housing but also against those with disabilities.  That is the ultimate and absolute discrimination.  It is disgusting and should be addressed.  It should not be allowed to continue another day.</p>  <p>  Other Deputies - the triple As and the PBP - would have us believe-----</p></speech>

We all accept that we are operating in a new politics and Standing Orders must evolve to deal with situations which would not have arisen in the past.  The particular issue being addressed in this motion arose in the context of the Central Bank (Variable Rate Mortgages) Bill 2016 put forward by Deputy Michael McGrath and the obligation to consult the European Central Bank, ECB, on legislation of this nature.  The House will recall that the Minister for Finance undertook to consult with the Attorney General on the topic.  The Minister subsequently wrote to the Ceann Comhairle regarding the matter and this motion to amend Standing Orders is the outcome.  </p><p>In summary, the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union confers an advisory function on the ECB with regard to draft legislative provisions within its fields of competence and an obligation on legislators to consult the ECB.  The relevant articles of the treaty are clear.  Among other things, Article 127(4) provides, &ldquo;The European Central Bank shall be consulted by national authorities regarding any draft legislative provision in its fields of competence, but within the limits and under the conditions set out by the Council in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 129(4).&rdquo;Article 282(5) provides, &ldquo;Within the areas falling within its responsibilities, the European Central Bank shall be consulted on all proposed Union acts, and all proposals for regulation at national level, and may give an opinion.&rdquo;</p><p>The ECB has issued a useful guide on the topic which is available on its website.  The guide makes it clear that national parliaments have to decide on the basis of their own rules of procedure how to comply with the obligation to submit for the ECB&rsquo;s prior opinion on draft legislative provisions which have been proposed by one or more of their members and which fall within the ECB&rsquo;s fields of competence.  This motion provides for an amendment to Standing Orders which will ensure parliamentary consultation with the ECB as obliged under the EU treaties.  The ECB guide notes that the obligation to consult is designed to operate as a preventative system to forestall problems of potentially incompatible or inconsistent national legislation with EU treaties or the European System of Central Banks Statute.  However, it should be noted that ECB opinions do not have binding force.  Nevertheless, the consultation must take place when the legislative provision is still at a draft stage and, more particularly, at a stage when the ECB&rsquo;s opinion can usefully be taken into consideration by national authorities involved in the preparation and adoption of legislation.  Accordingly, it is considered that prior to Committee Stage is the appropriate stage to consult with the ECB.</p><p>As Deputies are aware, usually with a Government Bill the consultation will take place when the Bill is being prepared and section (5) acknowledges this.  However, in the case of a private Member&rsquo;s Bill, to date there has not been a process in place which would ensure that the ECB is consulted when appropriate.  Therefore, the amendment sets out a process which ensures that a Bill which has passed Second Stage is not given Committee Stage consideration until the ECB has been consulted.</p><p>It ensures that the relevant committee will undertake this consultation and provides it will specify a time limit for the ECB response, preventing unnecessary delays in the consideration of the Bill.  It should be remembered that the obligation is on the country and the national authorities to consult.</p> <p> I consider that the motion is a proportionate response to the new political reality that Private Members' Bills have a greater chance of being passed into law.  It puts in place a process to ensure that our obligations to consult with the ECB are met.  When the ECB has responded to the committee, the committee will consider the opinion of the ECB and report on this consideration to the D&aacute;il.  Once this report has been made, Committee Stage of the Bill can proceed.</p> <p> I consider that this amendment to Standing Orders should ensure that Bills are better developed and considered when they come to Committee Stage and that a broader perspective will have been achieved, as well as actually ensuring that our obligations are met.  I commend the motion to the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-07-20a.556" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1229" speakername="Billy Kelleher" time="17:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016072000049#XX00200"><p>I am taking this on behalf of Deputy McGrath, who is otherwise detained and sends his apologies.  Fianna F&aacute;il supports this motion but it is important to put it into context.  The result of the general election, the minority government Administration and the unprecedented importance of Opposition legislation present fresh challenges on how we bring forward legislation and how it is dealt with.  The Fianna F&aacute;il Bill to address the variable mortgage interest rate rip-off has prompted this change to Standing Orders.  It showed that we can have real influence from these benches on issues that affect people's lives on a day-to-day basis.  That is our parliamentary duty and obligation as well.</p>  <p>  The changes included in the Standing Order must not be allowed to act as an infringement on State sovereignty and we must make this clear.  It is crucial to note that the opinion of the ECB must be considered but is not binding.  This House, elected by the people, is the ultimate arbiter of the laws of this State.  The ECB has a central role in setting out the monetary contexts of our decisions and helping to develop a coherent EU-wide strategy on fiscal policy but it should not become the source of inordinate delays or undue opposition to laws passed by the consent of the democratically elected Members of the Oireachtas.  That would only serve to deepen the cynicism at EU level at a crucial time when we need to reconnect the European institutions and the ECB with the citizens of Europe.  </p>  <p>  In this light, I will highlight some concerns that should be taken on board.  A series of measures around D&aacute;il reform included a specific commitment to limiting to ten weeks the legislative time lapse between passing Second Stage and taking Committee Stage.  This was intended to avoid scenarios where Bills would pass Second Stage and disappear into the administrative limbo of the Oireachtas, where they would be ignored by an uninterested Government or one that was hostile to the proposal.  It is vital that the ECB referrals are not allowed to prolong that period and the ten-week deadline should be inclusive of any ECB time demands.  The minimum deadline for the ECB's opinion is one month and we should use that as a maximum period, with extensions given where required.  Following the inclusion of a Bill on the Order Paper, following the first stage of the process, the Department of Finance should make its opinion public on the issue of referral to the ECB for observation.</p>  <p>  There are some concerns around whether the Standing Order will be sufficient to comply with the demands of EU law.  There is a possible issue around the definition of "substance".  Article 4 of the Council decision of 1998 states that the ECB opinion must be taken into account at an appropriate stage, prior to taking decisions on the substance.  The principles of a Bill are generally agreed on Second Stage while Committee Stage tinkers with the Bill itself.  The substance of the Bill is on Second Stage so we have to ensure the opinions of the ECB are sought in advance of Second Stage.</p>  <p>  The EU can seek a time extension to that set out by the relevant authority and I have advocated that we restrict this to a minimum of one month to limit delays.  However, there appears to be a potential clash between the Standing Order change and EU law in this regard.  EU legislation states clearly that the time extension shall not be unreasonably granted while the Standing Order states that it should be given due consideration.  This could become an issue if the committee refuses an extension and it should be borne in mind by the relevant committee.</p>  <p>  We support this motion as we must ensure we adhere to our EU obligations.  We have had a very major upheaval in the past couple of weeks with the Brexit vote in the UK, which has changed the dynamic and the views of many citizens across the UK and Europe.  The ECB gives its opinions on legislation but we must make sure that, at the end of the day, the primary responsibility for setting legislation in this country lies with the Oireachtas.  We have to redefine the relationship between the European institutions, including the ECB, and sovereign states because there is a democratic deficit and we do not want those who are opposed to Europe to use the referral of Bills to the ECB as another example of the latter infringing on our sovereignty and on that of other nation states.  We agree with the motion but I urge the Minister to look at some of the points we have raised.</p></speech>

Le hachan bhliain a th&eacute;ann thart, c&iacute;fimid go bhfuil an t-ardceannas sin ag sleamhn&uacute; uainn.</p>  <p>  Chuala muid &oacute; p&aacute;irtithe &aacute;irithe, go h&aacute;irithe na p&aacute;irtithe a labhairt cheana f&eacute;in san d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht seo, nuair a bh&iacute; muid ag pl&eacute; reifrinn difri&uacute;la agus na treaties difri&uacute;la a bh&iacute; ag teacht &oacute;n Aontas Eorpach, n&aacute; raibh seo ag tarl&uacute; agus nach mbeadh s&eacute; seo ag titim amach.  Ach c&iacute;fimid anois amach go bhfuil s&eacute; sin ag tarl&uacute;.

This is not, however, the place to go over past referendum debates.  Legally, it seems clear cut that the two paragraphs in the motion compel national authorities, including parliaments, to consult the ECB regarding proposals in its field.  In fact, according to a reply from the Minister the ECB has given 33 opinions at the request of the Ministers for Finance or Public Expenditure and Reform and that does not include the times the ECB gave an unsolicited opinion.</p>  <p>  The guidelines are clear, though, that "National parliaments have to decide on the basis of their own rules of procedure how to comply with the obligation to submit for the ECB's prior opinion draft legislative provisions which have been proposed by one or more of their members and which fall within the ECB's fields of competence".  That is what we are doing here today and I believe, as an Opposition finance spokesperson, that the approach taken is an attempt to make the best out of a bad situation.  In this new political reality, where Opposition Deputies and motions can win support, that means a new system to consult the ECB is required.  At least the motion before us today allows a committee to set its own timeline for the ECB to respond to it.  The ECB has to be asked its opinion but by no means does it have to be listened to and nothing here today will change that.  I disagree completely with the Fianna F&aacute;il position that we should consult the ECB prior to Second Stage as that would prevent legislation being tabled by the Opposition.  The consultation should take place after Second Stage.</p>  <p>  As a member of the banking inquiry, I must contrast the cast-iron requirement of this Parliament to consult with the Central Bank on issues related to it with the ECB's absolute refusal, at first at least, to engage with the banking inquiry set up by this Parliament.  When eventually it did co-operate it was in a tokenistic way and on its own terms.</p><p>When it eventually engaged with us it was very much on its terms.</p> <p> As an institution, the European Central Bank is unaccountable and secretive in its operations.  We know too that it played an important and extremely damaging role in this country's banking crisis.  The ECB is no friend of this country.  Let us be clear about that.  It is one of the reasons bondholders were paid despite the fact that we are told that should never happen again.</p> <p> Earlier this year I was in Brussels at a conference organised by my colleague Matt Carthy, MEP, and it was clear that it is not just Irish people who see the ECB as a problem institution.  There is Europe-wide disillusionment with the seemingly untouchable nature of the ECB and its policies.  It needs to be reformed and its mandate reviewed so that it takes employment and solidarity into consideration rather than having a pure focus on managing inflation.  We should listen to what it has to say because we have to - that is what the law states - but that is where its role should end in terms of this country's law making process.  From that point of view, I have no problem supporting the motion because it is just a case of ticking the box and moving on.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-07-20a.559" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1281" speakername="Mick Barry" time="17:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016072000050#YY00200"><p>We are discussing a new Standing Order which would require that Opposition Bills relating to banking, Central Bank currency and such like would need to be referred to the European Central Bank for an opinion before proceeding through the various Stages in this House.</p>  <p>  I will begin by registering our view of the body we are being asked to send Bills to, namely, the European Central Bank.  The European Central Bank was part of the troika which implemented and forced austerity measures on this country.  It was part of the most hardline wing of the troika when it came to implementing austerity here.  It was involved in forcing 1% of the population of the European Union to carry the can for 42% of Europe's banking debt.  When burden sharing was put on the agenda - the idea of burning some bondholders - we were told by the head of the European Central Bank at the time that a financial bomb would go off in Dublin if that measure was to be taken.  The ECB has an agenda; it is a neoliberal agenda.</p>  <p>  This proposal is a control mechanism.  I notice that both Deputy Kelleher and the Minister of State, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, were silent.  They did not mention that a refusal to co-operate with this measure means that infringement proceedings against the State can be taken, which would mean fines being levied on the State.  They did not mention either that if the recommendations and opinions of the ECB are ignored, if an individual takes a case to the courts against the State about the legislation, the ECB opinion that was ignored can be used as part of the evidence in that case.</p>  <p>  We have been told that there must be consistency and that 33 items of Government legislation have been sent to the ECB already.  It seems the ECB wants a control mechanism over Government Bills but now over Opposition Bills as well.  We believe that is undemocratic and we will call a vote on this issue at the end of the debate.</p>  <p>  What has brought us to this point?  It was a Bill from Deputy Michael McGrath on variable mortgage rates, which would mean that the Central Bank might be in a position to give some measure of relief to 300,000 householders paying variable interest rates on their loans.  We supported that Bill.  We criticised it as well because we felt it was a very mild measure, but it aimed to turn the tables to some extent - instead of favouring the banks at the expense of ordinary people, it would have favoured ordinary people at the expense of the banks, although not nearly to the extent we would have liked.  That is the Bill that caused the problem, and that is significant in and of itself.  I would be interested to know if it was the Minister who contacted the Attorney General for a decision or if the ECB contacted the Minister - whether by phone or e-mail or in conversation - to ask that this be dealt with.</p>  <p>  I am not surprised but I note that the mood in the Parliament has been that this is not a big deal; there has been a certain shrug of the shoulders.  I have to say that criticism expressed by the Sinn F&eacute;in Deputy in the debate was very mild.  In fact, he said they would be supporting the motion.  That is out of step with the view of ordinary people regarding this issue.  I believe that when ordinary people read and hear about this, they will be shocked at the level of surveillance we are talking about from the European Central Bank.  The Deputies and the parties in the House underestimate the feelings of people on this issue.  This is now about the reality of the capitalist European Union and surveillance of the budgets of member states.  Only a few weeks ago our housing committee felt it could not propose that 50,000 houses be built from State funds for fear it would transgress European Union fiscal rules.  Tonight we see a stifling and overbearing level of surveillance from the European Central Bank regarding not just Government Bills but Opposition Bills as well.  We will be calling a vote on this measure.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-07-20a.560" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1366" speakername="Thomas Pringle" time="17:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016072000050#YY00300"><p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this amendment to Standing Orders.  I would disagree with Deputy Barry on the reason this has come before the House tonight.  He said it was because of the Fianna F&aacute;il Bill that was introduced some weeks ago, but that is not the case.  If we had had a functioning Parliament from 2009 onwards, this would have been in Standing Orders from that time after the Lisbon treaty was passed by the people in a referendum.  Such a measure was not required in the past because of the reality that a Private Members' Bill would never have seen the light of day beyond Second Stage.  It is happening now because it is possible for Private Members' Bills to move beyond Second Stage.  That is a factor in view of the minority Government that we have in place.</p>  <p>  Ordinary people are shocked and surprised by this measure.  One of the characteristics of the European treaties we have been adopting here is that people do not actually know what they contain.  It is only as years pass and the outworkings of what people voted on become clear that we see that the German Parliament sees our budget before we do and gets to consult on it and that the ECB, which is unaccountable to anybody within the European Union, has to see our Bills also before they come before these Houses.  That is what shocks people, but they do not make the connection between the decision they made in voting for this treaty and what is happening now, namely, the undermining of our sovereignty across the board, which I always outlined in the past when European treaties came before the people in terms of their far-reaching effect.  We saw it last year in the decision of our Minister for Foreign Affairs to go along with a European motion attacking the Palestinian Authority.  We signed up to the Common Foreign and Security Policy so we went along with that decision and gave up our traditional independence in our foreign affairs dealings.  These situations are the outworkings of the treaties we have passed, and that is what people find disturbing.</p>  <p>  I welcome this debate in the House because it will widen the public view of the way the European Union has undermined this State's sovereignty.  It might also make people more aware of this if a treaty ever comes before us again, because it seems the European Union will be working very hard to make sure that a democratic vote will not have to be taken on any future treaty changes.  I am sure our Government and the establishment parties in this House will work to ensure that there is no risk that the people will be asked to make a decision on a treaty again.  It is important in that it shows the undemocratic nature of the European Union and the unaccountable nature of the ECB.</p><p>It is something we are legally obliged to do but I do not believe we should do it willingly.  More debate is needed on the implications and workings of European treaties and to bring that knowledge to the people so they can understand the true nature of the European Union when the time comes to make decisions in the future.</p></speech>

It was going to go through the House without debate, which would have been a very retrograde step.  I am not surprised by this action by the ECB and the EU because that is they way they have been behaving.  As a man who campaigned over the years for various treaties - Nice, Lisbon one and Lisbon two - I certainly will be more aware, and I hope the public will be more aware, of the bully boy tactics, the controls and the tentacles which are reaching into every aspect of Irish society.  It is unwarranted, unnecessary and it is unhelpful.  We saw where our friends were when we hit trouble.  We saw the money they charged in terms of an interest rate for the so-called bailout, which was a clean out.  We got money from the International Monetary Fund at 2.67% and our so-called friends in the EU charged us almost 6%.  With friends like that, I wonder who needs enemies - we certainly do not.  It is a ridiculous state of affairs.  How long are we going to have to wait?  Are we going to have to go cap in hand in the context of Private Members' business if there is any item of expenditure?  We did not last five years with the last Government.  When any Bill was moved by the Opposition, when an amendment was proposed to legislation or when anything was asked for, we were told it would be a cost to the Exchequer and could not be accepted.  Amendment after amendment was ruled out of order.  Now we have big brother in Europe.  Is it any wonder there was a Brexit?  The people in the UK are not going to put up with that nonsense.  This is why we have the mess now.  Unelected bureaucrats are bringing in these laws but we to Brussels and ask, "Where do we sign, how fast can we sign and can we sign three or four times?".  We have been the good boys of Europe.  I will not say the word but such and such is all the thanks we get, and Deputies know what I mean.  It has the audacity to try to interfere in our democratic process.  This is the centenary of 1916 and we should be celebrating gaining our freedom and our sovereignty but this is the kind of treatment we get.  It is disrespectful and proves a disconnect.  I wonder what our Irish MEPs are doing out there?  I understand that it is a big Parliament and there are only a small number of Irish MEPs but they have a role to play, especially  to stop this kind of nonsense.  By its actions, the EU is saying that any Private Members' motion put down by a Deputy in this House could wreck the European project.</p>  <p>  At our Business Committee meeting discussion on this matter, it was said that a timeline should be put on it.  We are not going to wait until Christmas two years from now for a reply.  If there is no reply by a prompt date, we will move on.  I believe we should move on anyway and to hell or to Connacht with the ECB.  We should tell it to go where the monkeys jump for sixpence.</p>  <p>  This is supposed to be a sovereign State and we are supposed to be able to control our own destiny.  The Proclamation is read in every school in the country and yet we are kowtowing to these mostly unelected people.  We saw how they reacted to the outcome of the Brexit vote.  Three or four of the big boys wanted to drive on and to hell with the Brits or anybody else.  I think it is proper order that they have moved back from that position now.  We are going to have to assert our position that this is a sovereign Parliament and we can do what we want or else we might as well close up the Parliament and go home.  The D&aacute;il is going into recess tomorrow, so why are we bothering to come back?  We could have the Europeans ruling the roost with the aid of plenty of ready, willing and able officials from the Departments who add five or six statutory instruments to every piece of legislation that comes from the EU.  Other countries do not do that.  France is one country that does not listen to the rules telling it not do this or that, especially regarding the environment and agriculture.  I am not suggesting we should be reckless in the areas of environment or agriculture but consider the ridiculous situation in Northern Ireland where a railing can separate the boundary between the North and the South and one can spread slurry on one side but not on the other.  We are overzealous in being good Europeans and our thanks is that we have to go down on our knees and pay homage to the masters in the EU.</p>  <p>  The electorate in Ireland will have a wake-up call and any further treaties in the EU will not be passed easily.  We will not be sold a pig in a poke.  We will not be going back to vote a second time if a treaty fails to get the result the EU wants.  People are waiting in the long grass as they waited for Fine Gael at the last election.  Now they are waiting for the eurocrats to come back and they are ready to deal with the European bureaucrats.</p></speech>

In wrapping up the debate, it is essential that we acknowledge</p><p>that the obligation to consult with the European Central Bank on matters in its field of competence is a legal requirement under the EU treaties.  As legislators, we must abide by the laws of the land.  In a wider sense, it is important that all draft legislation is properly considered to ensure that it achieves its objectives, with minimal adverse effects.  This requires the proper drafting of legislation to ensure that it is consistent with wider national and EU legislation and also that the legislation is constitutional.  Additionally, it is our responsibility, as legislators, to consider the potential unintended consequences of legislation and to ensure that we mitigate these consequences where we decide to proceed with draft legislation.</p><p>The consultation with the ECB is only one part of this wider necessary consideration of legislation.  We must also consider the economic and social effects of legislation.  Too often we consider the initial beneficiaries of a well-intended, targeted measure without considering the wider costs to citizens both as taxpayers and those reliant on public services.  Particularly in banking matters, it is vital that we consider the costs of regulation to the economy and the cost of credit to all consumers of finance, personal consumers, business consumers and the SMEs, that create the majority of jobs in our economy.  It is a reality that the cost of credit directly feeds through to our international competitiveness in labour costs and capital costs.  The Government is committed to supporting a financial system that strikes a fair balance between sustainably low cost credit and necessary consumer protections.</p><p>Deputy Kelleher asked about consultation.  The obligation on authorities of member states to consult the European Central Bank on matters in their field of competence is a legal requirement under the EU treaties.  The draft legislative provisions within the ECB&rsquo;s field of competence include: currency matters; means of payment; national central banks; the collection, compilation and distribution of monetary, financial, banking, payment systems and balance of payments statistics; payment and settlement systems; and rules applicable to financial institutions in so far as they materially influence the stability of financial institutions and markets.</p><p>If we do not consult the ECB on these matters, we would be in breach of the EU treaties and this could lead, as pointed out by Deputy Barry, to infringement proceedings being taken against Ireland as the member state.  The ECB&rsquo;s guide states:</p><blockquote>In those member states in which individuals have the right to initiate proceedings to annul a national legislative provision on the grounds of a serious procedural defect, individuals should also have the right to seek to annul national legislative provisions adopted in breach of an essential procedural requirement of Union law, such as the prior consultation of the ECB.</blockquote><p>In view of the serious consequences arising from a failing to consult with the ECB, it is important that we agree the proposed motion and its amendments to D&aacute;il Standing Orders.  The failure to consult the ECB is only relevant in a legal challenge if the State fails to consult the ECB.  During the debate on Deputy McGrath's Bill, the Minister for Finance raised the need to consult the ECB.  The Minister then followed up the matter with a letter to the Ceann Comhairle.</p><p>Reference was made to interest rates.  The IMF funds were closer to 6% and the EU funds were closer to 2% to 3%.  That is why Ireland refinanced out of the IMF funds last year and why the Government reduced the rates.  I would recommend that Deputy Mattie McGrath look at the banking inquiry report.  The Deputy should also be careful when he casts such aspersions to scapegoat the authority of this Parliament, where there is such authority.</p><p>We can have this consultation without interfering with our own legislative timetable, authority or sovereignty.  The ECB opinion is not binding.  We are the primary makers of legislation and we should not be afraid to consult, where necessary, whether we are in government or not.</p></speech>

Before I go into detail of the draft order before the House today for approval, I would like to briefly recap on the circumstances that have led to the need for it.</p><p>The Commission of Investigation into Irish Bank Resolution Corporation was established by the Government on 16 June 2015, following approval of a draft order by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The commission&rsquo;s terms of reference were developed by the Minister for Finance.  However, following consultation with the Opposition, the Department of Finance was encompassed within the terms of reference.  At that point, it was agreed that the Taoiseach would be the specified Minister under the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004.</p><p>Mr. Justice Cregan, sole member of the commission, submitted an interim report on 13 November 2015, which was subsequently published.  The interim report raised a number of significant difficulties which had arisen in the course of the commission&rsquo;s work, including in relation to its terms of reference.</p><p>The Taoiseach engaged in detailed consultations with the Opposition on the issues raised in the interim report, as well as further consultation with the commission itself.  This process considered various options for proceeding, as well as certain risks and implications of each approach.  Following those consultations, it was agreed to draft urgent legislation to address certain matters raised by the commission.  Deputies will be aware that the Commission of Investigation (Irish Bank Resolution Corporation) Bill 2016, which provides for additional powers to be given to the commission, has completed its passage through this House.</p><p>It was also agreed in the course of consultations with the Opposition that changes would be made to the commission&rsquo;s terms of reference.  As the original terms of reference were included as a schedule in the order establishing the commission, an amendment order is required to change them.  The draft order before the House today provides for the original terms of reference to be revoked and replaced by the revised terms of reference.  Mr. Justice Cregan has been consulted extensively on these changes and has consented to them as required under section 6 (1) of the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004.  In summary, it is now proposed to adopt a modular approach in which the commission would initially be asked to report on the Siteserv transaction, which has been extensively raised in the Oireachtas as a matter of significant public concern.</p><p>This would include the issue of share dealing as set out in paragraph 2(e) of the current draft terms of reference.  In relation to interest rates, the commission will be asked to report on principles and policies within IBRC in respect of the setting of interest rates generally.  In addition, at the request of the commission in its interim report and, in subsequent consultations, a number of essentially technical changes are being made to the terms of reference.  Following consultation with the commission, a timeframe for reporting at end-2017 is envisaged, at a tentative cost of over &euro;10 million.  This represents a considerable commitment of taxpayers&rsquo; money but the consensus view in discussion with the Opposition was that it was necessary to ensure the investigation proceeds.</p><p>I believe that the changes to the commission&rsquo;s terms of reference, taken together with the new legislation before the Seanad, provides a basis for an effective investigation.  I commend the draft order to the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-07-20a.568" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1335" speakername="Dara Calleary" time="18:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016072000052#AAA00300"><p>We will be supporting the motion which implements the modular approach concentrating in the first instance on the Siteserv sale by the Commission of Investigation into the IBRC.  The commission has encountered problems of legal and professional confidentiality that have impeded the completion of its work.  This motion helps address those barriers and will aid the commission in issuing a report by the already delayed October 2016 deadline.</p>  <p>  Serious questions, however, have to be asked again as to why these hurdles are being dealt with at the end of the commission's operation phase rather than at its establishment, which would have prevented the delays we have encountered.  These new terms of reference must be watertight and must not be subject to further delays.  It is vital to ensure the commission is now enabled legally and through resources to overcome legal constraints to expedite the publication of the final report and to meet the deadline.</p>  <p>  Some weeks ago, I asked questions about the Siteserv controversy and do not intend to ask them again.  I note, however, the most overused phrase in the Minister of State's remarks was consultation with the Opposition.  I put it to him that one of the biggest symptoms of the dysfunction of the last D&aacute;il was the steamrolling of any input from the Opposition into any legislation.  This Bill is a symptom of that way of doing business.  Concerns were raised by Deputy Catherine Murphy and others about the model proposed.  Many of the difficulties encountered and the delays incurred were identified at the outset by Opposition voices but because they came from this side of the House they were steamrolled, ignored and the Government carried on as normal.  That is why we are here putting Band Aids on the original legislation and that is why there have been delays.  That has to stop.  We cannot keep running in here to deal with bad legislation when the weakness were pointed out at the outset.  I am not sure where new politics is or what its definition will be but surely that would be something it could achieve, that when the Opposition puts forward constructive suggestions and proposals, or an idea that something may not work, it is not ignored because it is the Opposition which does so.  Had that been the case in the previous D&aacute;il, we would not be here this evening.  We support the motion to try to bring this important work to an end and shine a light on what happened.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-07-20a.569" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="18:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016072000052#AAA00400"><p>It is now four years and three months since I first raised, through a parliamentary question, the write-downs of IBRC to certain individuals.  At that time, I noted the &euro;100 million write-off and the &euro;4.96 million pay-off to the shareholders.  Obviously, the write-down was in respect of Siteserv.  It was within days of the transaction.  The Minister's reply at that time was pathetic and it still is.  In the normal political establishment response to any issue of potential corruption in the State, the Minister retreated into the old rhetoric of the IBRC operating at arm's length and the board and bank are satisfied with the bid.  Political responsibility was shirked from day one.  Here we are, more than four years later, still trying to get the truth, despite the work of people such as Deputy Catherine Murphy, in terms of digging, making freedom of information requests and including issues we and others have raised about this case.  If all of that sounds familiar it is because it is a process being repeated before our eyes with the refusal to inquire into the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, through a commission of investigation.  Like the IBRC, NAMA's sale of its Northern loan book requires a commission of investigation.  Last October Fianna F&aacute;il was all in favour of this.  This month it was against it.  I am not sure what its position is this week.  We will wait and see.</p>  <p>  My party rejected the first attempt at setting up this commission of investigation under its terms of reference because it was a half-hearted attempt made under political pressure.  Last November, the interim report proved us right.  The commission was never empowered to do the job people expected it to do.  That was not a failure of Mr. Justice Cregan but it was a political failure.</p>  <p>  IBRC was set up to manage the accumulated debts of two banks that were mangled together to create it, Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society.  One more infamous than the other for the damage they did to Ireland and to its economy.  The debt of these banks, which were the worst of the worst, was never wound down, even though the bank was.  That debt remains on our books.  The past and present of IBRC remains an issue for the Irish people.  We have to cut our cloth where we are.  Siteserv is the most critical issue of public interest.  That is why we support the adoption of the modular approach and, in particular, the focus on Siteserv as an element of that module.  I note too the inclusion of the principles and policies regarding the setting of interest rates.  There is no reason to believe the suspicions regarding Denis O'Brien's affairs with IBRC are an isolated case.</p>  <p>  The legislation was passed here last week and should be seen in conjunction with this motion.  A key element of that was the new powers for the Minister to direct special liquidators.  I wonder if another liquidator had been appointed would this have been necessary.  The idea that the auditors of Irish Nationwide Building Society were the appropriate people to oversee the special liquidation of IBRC is laughable.  They have been paid &euro;5 million to date for their work and yet the interim report, published last November, was a list of problems and objections they were creating.</p>  <p>  I support the new terms of reference as offering some chance that the public interest will be satisfied about the truth of the Siteserv issue and the issue of the suspiciously low interest rates being offered by IBRC will also be revealed.  The last time I spoke about the original terms of reference, I spoke about information I had received regarding the interest rates on the financial dealings being charged to Denis O'Brien.  Since then, I have received further information on one of the IBRC's largest debtors, a developer who had debts almost to the sum of &euro;0.5 billion with that financial institution.</p><p>The information I have received is that part of some of the debts he had with IBRC showed he received multimillion euro loans with interests rates as low as 0.71%.</p> <p> Other documentation shows that in 2012, a loan of more than &euro;80 million from IBRC had its interest rate nearly halved.  This is a new attempt to fix a mess by an arrogant Government that never really wanted these issues examined.  The commission deserves our support.  It is in the overwhelming public interest to remain alive to this and want to see the issue resolved. </p> <p> I fear that module one will be all we will ever see and that we will only see practices in regards to interest rates examined.  We will never deal with the documentation I have on why IBRC cut an individual's interest rates by almost half on a loan of more than &euro;80 million and why it charged an interest rate of less than 0.75% on a number of loans at a time when the bloody country was going through the worst austerity it has ever seen.</p> <p> These are questions that the Irish people deserve to have answered.  We will support the terms of reference as a start to getting answers.</p></speech>

He told us that even with these pieces in place, it will still take until the end of next year to complete this module.  A very large amount of work is involved and work had been ongoing up to now to narrow the focus.  Clearly, the terms of reference have been narrowed substantially and the Siteserv module will be front-loaded.  I share some of the concerns about further modules but we will wait and see what happens.</p><p>There is also a nod to a general report on the principles and policies within IBRC and interest rate setting.  I would have liked to have seen a far more detailed investigation into the practical application of interest rates to specific borrowers but that is a matter for another day.  It is not ideal but I hope the general report may lead to subsequent models of investigation delving deeper into the application of the various rates depending on individual cases.  The freedom of information documents I received revealed that Department officials had serious concerns about the poor execution of some very large transactions.  For example, Blackstone, an American company, was brought in to price and value assets.  It was then allowed to purchase those assets.  That kind of practice is incredible.  Other transactions like Topaz also featured.</p><p>I am concerned that we have not yet managed to address the shortcomings in the regulation of the Irish Stock Exchange, despite my raising the matter throughout the establishment of the commission.  There was a spike in share dealing in Siteserv in advance of its sale.  Last Sunday, Colin Coyle's piece in <i>The Sunday Times</i>once again highlighted the flaws in the regulation of the Stock Exchange.  My concerns revolved around the unusual share activity in Siteserv in the months and weeks leading up to the sale.  According to Colin Coyle's piece, the Stock Exchange had noted the activity as suspicious and yet declined to refer it on to the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.</p><p>The information held in the Stock Exchange is very deficient.  When I asked the Stock Exchange to investigate, it sent me to the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.  I was then sent to the Central Bank and so on.  It was a merry-go-round.  I still have serious questions around that area on which serious work needs to be done.  Such work may require legislation or an institution may need to be nominated to properly regulate the sector.</p><p>The terms of reference are very much directed at scoping out Siteserv as a bellwether in the context of the relationship and practices within IBRC and an attempt to get to the bottom of what the Department called decisions of questionable quality regarding a number of significant large transactions.  I voted in favour of the terms of reference when they were put in front of us last year.</p><p>In hindsight, we should learn something about the scoping-out of inquiries in advance because clearly a very large piece of work is needed.  I have read all three of the interim reports and a very large volume of material has to be examined.  This is the first inquiry of its type that has dealt with the financial sector and I do not think it will be the last.  We have to learn some lessons and narrow the focus in order that we get timely results.</p><p>I do not think we can have accountability if we do not have transparency.  The parliamentary questions process, whereby Deputy Doherty, I and others received replies, was very deficient.  There needs to be a game change in that area in terms of answering questions in a complete way.  I trust that the Cregan commission will endeavour to provide answers in this model and into the future.  I am sure the report and recommendations for further modules will have to be brought before the House when that work is complete.  I wish the judge well.  A sizeable amount of work will be done.</p></speech>

It is evident that all Members of the House have a strong desire to ensure that the IBRC commission of investigation conducts an efficient, effective and timely investigation into important matters of public concern.  As I mentioned at the outset of the debate, in its first interim report, the commission raised significant issues regarding its investigation and terms of reference.</p>  <p>  Today's debate and the points made by Deputies largely reflect the constructive consultations that were engaging the Government and Opposition party leaders to address issues raised by the commission.  The consultations that took place covered the commission's terms of reference and the legislative changes required and which are being dealt with in the Commission of Investigation (IBRC) Bill 2016, which has completed its passage through the House.</p>  <p>  Following the necessary D&aacute;il and Seanad resolutions, it is the intention of the Government to make the order changing the commission's terms of reference before the summer recess.  The making of the Government order, in tandem with the enactment of primary legislation, will enable the IBRC commission of investigation to progress its work in a focused and coherent manner.  It would not be appropriate for us today to, in any way, try to prejudice or pre-empt what the findings of the commission will be.  These are matters that must be left to the commission alone.</p>  <p>  The commission is entirely independent and its sole member, Mr. Justice Brian Cregan, is an eminent member of the Judiciary who is well qualified to carry out the task that has been assigned to him.  In accordance with the statutory provisions set out in the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004, Mr. Justice Cregan will send his final report to the Taoiseach as a specified Minister under the Act responsible for certain administrative matters regarding the commission.</p>  <p>  The report will be published by the Taoiseach as soon as possible after it is submitted to him, subject, of course, to the advice of the Attorney General and any legal issues arising.  I look forward to the IBRC commission completing its work and considering its final report in detail in due course.  I again thank all Deputies who contributed to the debate.</p></speech>

The amendment was comprehensively discussed on Committee Stage.  On the conclusion of the discussions, Deputy Lawless, on behalf of Fianna F&aacute;il, stated that he was satisfied with the position as outlined and, in particular, he welcomed the proposal that the committee would review the operations of the commission.  He then withdrew the amendment.</p>  <p>  I can only repeat what I outlined on Committee Stage which seemed to be acceptable to all present.  I am fully cognisant of the need to ensure the Commission for Energy Regulation is fully resourced to carry out its statutory functions.  This important issue was raised in the Green Paper on Energy Policy published in May 2014.  As a result of the Green Paper consultation process, the recent White Paper includes a Government commitment to review the legal and institutional framework for the electricity and natural gas markets.  The White Paper commitment specifically states that the review includes the Commission for Energy Regulation's mandate and resources.  The matter of how best to implement this commitment is a priority issue and part of my Department&rsquo;s immediate work programme.</p>  <p>  The European Union's 2009 third energy package obliges member states to ensure their energy regulators are fully independent and resourced.  In line with this obligation, the Commission for Energy Regulation is legally independent in the performance of its functions under legislation and is only accountable to the Oireachtas.  The CER must be sufficiently resourced to deliver on its existing and growing mandate and this matter will form part of the scope of the forthcoming review.</p>  <p>  During Committee Stage discussions, I pointed out that under the regulatory legislation, the Commission for Energy Regulation is accountable for the performance of its functions to the joint Oireachtas committee.  Furthermore, I stated that I would welcome the opportunity to discuss the forthcoming review of CER's mandate, including the resources, with the committee at an early date.  Any issues relating to resources in respect of new powers and functions will be addressed in parallel with the forthcoming review and the development of the new administrative sanctions regime itself.  The administrative sanctions regime will take time to implement.  For example, it requires preparatory work by CER to develop the performance standards.</p>  <p>  As I said on Committee Stage, it would not be appropriate or practical to consider the Commission for Energy Regulation's resources in respect of one particular statutory function and thereby exclude from examination the wide range of other regulatory functions the commission undertakes.  It is vital that a holistic approach is taken in respect of any review of CER's resources in light of all its energy regulation functions.  In line with the principles of independence, the allocation of staff within the Commission for Energy Regulation is a matter for the commission.  As the commission has assumed new functions in recent years, it has shown it can flexibly reallocate and adapt resources as its roles and objectives change.</p>  <p>  It is, therefore, proposed to accept the principle of what Deputy Brassil proposed in the amendment but to reject the amendment on the basis that the adequacy or otherwise of the Commission for Energy Regulation&rsquo;s resources will be reviewed holistically as part of the forthcoming review to which the Government committed in the energy White Paper.  Committee members will have a direct role in regard to that.</p></speech>

I hope the revised wording can be agreed.  Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith will address her amendment.  Two things emerged in the process of revising the amendments.  On the Order of Business the other day, I said we are legislating blind in not having a consolidated version of the Bill.  During the Committee Stage debate, I referred to a section which, in effect, did not exist anymore.  I said it to the Taoiseach and it applies in other areas but in this critical piece of legislation, we are going to have to find resources somewhere to consolidate Bills to make them intelligible.  It is just not right that we, as legislators, are dealing with legislation where we are legislating blind in some instances.  That is one lesson to emerge from the debate on the Bill to date.</p><p>I am pleased we were able to table the amendments but they are insufficient to position the State to become a leader in the area of matching efficiency and variable supply, promoting self generation and getting the benefit that should and could accrue to this country for being good at this energy transition.  We will need much more extensive legislation to take into account the various pieces of the jigsaw the Commission will put in place later this year.</p><p>From a green perspective, the news today was deeply disconcerting that the Commission has given us a free pass for the next ten years in terms of not having any effective increase in our climate targets after 2020.  That is all the more reason we must put energy and effort into this area because in the absence of any effective increase in our targets what I fear will happen is that we will fall behind the industrial revolution that is happening elsewhere.  The countries that have ambitious targets are the ones that will make all the changes and we will end up importing the technology in 20 years' time at huge cost to the State.  It will be far more expensive for us to do the transition then.</p><p>I hope the Minister will be able to accept the amendment I have tabled but also that he will dedicate the resources to preparing ambitious further legislation to take into account the market reforms and governance reforms that will be coming from the European Union as part of the 2030 package.  Even if in a sense we have opted out, which it seems to me we have, at least let us not opt out on the economic opportunity.  Let us not see the economy go backwards as an un-green or brown state that does not marry what we have, which is a huge variety of renewable supplies with tech industries.  Let us at least try to take that opportunity before it goes.</p></speech>

The reading of the Bill does not convince one that there is an enormous emphasis being put on that.  There has been a bit of tinkering here and there but the overriding concern is with working and regulating the principles of the market rather than seeing this as a vital and urgent challenge to us all.</p><p>Neither does the Bill address why we are already missing our targets set for shifts to non-fossil fuels and towards renewables.  In short, as I said on Committee Stage, the Bill seeks to rely on the market way too much rather than relying on necessary measures to set about trying to not just save the planet but to reach the targets we are expected to reach.</p><p>The first amendment relates to the board of the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI.</p><p>I know Deputy Eamon Ryan is not too fond of this, but I want to see it included.  I argued with the Minister at board level that we need a representative from the environmental pillar on the board of the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI.  It is not because we do not trust anybody else.  We probably do not trust anybody else but that is not the reason why.  It is to provide a balance that will correct the over-reliance on corporate interest that the board could have.  We need to see somebody from the not-for-profit environmental pillar sector on it.  I think it is fair enough that the Minister is willing to commit to his own amendment and individually and privately to have somebody involved from an environmental background.  However, I think that our revised amendment of having somebody from the environmental pillar is very important.</p> <p> On the access for community groups to the national grid, I consider amendment No. 3 very important, not just because I was asked by certain groups to pursue it, but also because the more I think about it and look at it, the more democratic I think it is.  It will unveil part of a solution to our problems of CO2 emissions.  If there are communities that are producing their own power and have excess power that they want to put on the national grid, it is absolutely ludicrous not to allow that to happen without forcing them to compete with the big players.  We need to encourage community groups to develop sustainable and renewable energy in this way.  Given that there is huge opposition at a local level to the big wind farms, this could be a really resourceful and imaginative alternative that works in favour of both the communities and the environment.  I would like to push for that amendment.  I repeat that the market is not helping the fight against climate change.  It is hindering it.  If communities are willing to do it in this way, we should definitely go down that road.</p> <p> On the question of the National Oil Reserves Agency, NORA, and seeking a report on the impact of biofuels on developing countries, the last amendment on-----</p></speech>

It is proposed to take amendments Nos. 2 and 3 together.</p><p>During Committee Stage, both Deputies Ryan and Smith expressed their views and their promotion of demand-side participation, flexibility and community participation in energy markets in order to provide mechanisms for consumers to participate actively in the market through production, sale and possible storage of electricity and to allow for aggregation services in the market.  I stated on Committee Stage that I believe the concerns of both Deputies are already substantially provided for in the existing legislation, specifically under section 9(4)(b) of the Electricity Regulation Act 1999.  Furthermore, the policies advocated by the Deputies were also supported in the energy White Paper published in 2015.  The White Paper acknowledges the crucial role of citizens in the transformation towards a decarbonised electricity sector.  It acknowledges that community-led energy efficiency and renewable energy projects will play an important and vital role in the energy transition.</p><p>In order to accommodate the Deputies, I propose to accept the text of the revised amendment proposed by Deputy Ryan, which amends section 9 of the Electricity Regulation Act 1999.  The amendment is consistent with the policy to increase electricity market flexibility, encourage demand response, facilitate renewables and foster the integration of the Irish electricity markets with other EU markets.  The majority of the issues raised by the Deputies are being considered and implemented as part of the wholesale electricity market redesign that will be delivered by the regulators next year.  We will also consider the issues of electricity market flexibility, active citizen participation in the markets, demand management and innovative services in the market in the context of the European Commission's legislative proposal due for discussion and negotiation by the member states later this year.</p><p>The issues of community engagement, electricity generation consumption and demand reduction are important policy matters and are highlighted in the programme for a partnership Government and in the energy White Paper.  The issue of grid access for communities is also a crucial matter for development of this sector and this is why it is prioritised in the White Paper.  I am happy to accommodate Deputy Ryan's amendment that highlights the importance of this policy consideration, noting the Commission for Energy Regulation's, CER, ongoing consultation on grid connection policy, which considers the issue of community grid access.  It also takes account of my Department's forthcoming consultation on the support of the renewable sector, including community-owned projects.</p><p>I commend Deputy Smith's efforts to develop an amendment on this issue but I ask the Deputy to withdraw it and to consider supporting the revised amendment put forward by Deputy Ryan, including the paragraph related to the policy <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>community projects and grid connection that we are accepting.  It is Government policy to support and facilitate community participation in the electricity market.  However, this must be done with due reflection and consideration of the implications for all electricity consumers, including those who do not have the means or the opportunity to benefit from participation in community undertakings.  Those with the means and the opportunity to benefit from involvement in community participation in the electricity market should not be allowed or be prioritised to do so at the expense of those who cannot so participate.  It is for this reason that I believe we should not accept Deputy Smith's amendment, well-intentioned as it is, without in-depth and detailed consultation and citizen engagement.  This is why the CER has carried out a considered and detailed public consultation involving citizen engagement, honest connection and grid access policy. </p><p>Just to explain what we are talking about here, there is the potential for an unintended consequence in relation to Deputy Smith's amendment No .3.  I agree with the principle of it.  I said that on Committee Stage.  We have tried to reflect those concerns in the amendment that has been tabled by Deputy Ryan.  However, we have seen in other EU countries that the people who have connected to the grids are the people who have the resources and the capacity to do so.  Yet, people in fuel poverty have actually ended up funding that connection to the grid in reality.  There are additional costs associated with connecting small renewable projects to the grid.  I agree that they should be connected but we should not be asking people who are in fuel poverty or those that do not have the resources to connect their own renewable projects to the grid to fund the total cost of this, or a substantial amount of it.  I know that would not be Deputy Smith's intention or objective, but it is a potential unintended consequence of the amendment as it is currently worded.</p><p>The consultation that CER is involved in takes account of the Government policy to facilitate community energy schemes as stated in A Programme for a Partnership Government and the White Paper for energy.  CER is looking at all of the complex issues around this at the moment with the objective of reflecting in the best possible way the issues that Deputy Smith has rightly been raising, that have been stated in A Programme for a Partnership Government and in the energy White Paper.  I also believe that it would be premature to legislate on this issue in advance of the forthcoming Government consultation on renewable energy schemes, which includes consideration of community schemes.  We will be putting forward detailed proposals for public consultation.  We believe that the public should have a direct input into the final structure of this before we legislate for it.  Only after such public consultation and citizen engagement would it be appropriate to develop primary legislation, if it is necessary at all, to promote community energy schemes.  Our energy White Paper commits us to undertake such consultation before we develop policy, including in areas of community ownership and renewable supports.</p><p>The issue of community ownership is not black and white.  Currently, we are very much engaged with this with the wind energy regulations.  I have received as many suggestions on what community ownership and participation should be as I have on the setback distances of wind turbines.  It is not as black and white as people might be lead to believe.  It is important that there is flexibility.  What is in the interest of one community and what that community wants to get involved in is not necessarily the formula that will work in another community.</p><p>As Deputy Eugene Murphy knows, I see that in our own county concerning different renewable projects with can have different impacts in communities.</p> <p> In addition, under our existing long-standing electricity regulation legislation, the Commission for Energy Regulation and the electricity system operators have strict legal obligations on non-discrimination between users seeking to connect to the electricity grid.  This amendment is in conflict with that obligation.</p> <p> It would not be appropriate to insert such an amendment, as drafted, adding to the service functions as a licence condition under section 14 of the Electricity Act.</p> <p> I further caution that Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith's amendment, as drafted, if accepted by the House would have to undergo suitable due diligence with regard to its alignment with and impact on the broader legal and regulatory framework as it currently exists before it could be considered whether it could be commenced.</p> <p> I hope Deputy Smith can consider what I have said.  We are both on the same page concerning this and we both want the one objective.  I ask Deputy Smith to work with me in the consultations that will take place.  If it requires primary legislation then we can progress that issue either from this side of the House or the other side, but it may not require such legislation.  Let us see what comes out of the public consultation first because, as I said, this is not as black and white as it might seem.</p> <p> Deputy Eamon Ryan raised the issue concerning the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 and the amendments thereto.  He is right in that it needs to be addressed.  It is impossible to read that legislation currently.  I have a formal response on it which should be in the Deputy's in-box at this stage.  We are quite willing to work with Members to see that consolidated legislation moved.  How we progress that is something I can talk about to the Deputy or other Members privately.  There is merit in what he is saying, however.</p> <p> Deputy Ryan has tempted me about this free pass we have got to 2030, but it is anything but a free pass.  Deputy Ryan knows probably better than anyone else in this House that the commitments we signed up to for 2020 could not be achieved.  They were set at a benchmark that we did not have.  We did not put forward the date that could substantiate having a proper and realistic target in place.  Sadly, because we signed up to a pig in a poke at the time, we are now potentially facing fines.  Missing our target by 1% will cost us &euro;150 million per annum.  That money would be far better spent in supporting Deputy Smith's initiatives to encourage community participation, as well as dealing with energy efficiency issues for communities across the country and particularly for older people.</p> <p> Earlier, Deputy Eugene Murphy and myself were talking about the quality of houses in many rural areas, which need significant investment to bring them up to today's required insulation standards.  That can provide benefits for people including comfort, as well as dramatically reducing energy bills.  Every barrel of oil that is not purchased has a direct impact on our environment.  I would rather see that money being spent on dealing with Deputy Murphy's constituents and the issues raised by Deputy Smith, than paying it in fines because of the way we signed up to this.</p> <p> Over the next 400 months, I am committed to bringing the Government, and future governments, along that road in order to have a decarbonised society by 2050.  I see the 2030 targets, which are only 160 months down the road, as a stepping stone along that route.  I have the same objective on this as Deputy Ryan.  It is important, however, to set achievable, realistic and affordable targets.  We should not set targets that have been unattainable and unachievable from the day we signed up to them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-07-20a.598" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1294" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="18:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016072000056#EEE00200"><p>I am glad the Minister raised those issues because we need to have that debate.  I fundamentally disagree that the 20% reduction target we set for 2020 was a pig in a poke or an impossible target.  It was absolutely achievable to my mind, but it depends on the extent of political ambition.  It also depends on whether one sees it as an imposition or an opportunity.  I see it as the latter.  I know the rest of the public administrative system does not see it that way because we fought with them tooth and nail on it.  The fact that we do not think it is achievable or that it is a huge imposition to try to achieve it, means we are not achieving it.  That is a fundamental problem.  We were heading in that direction back in 2011.  Our emission reduction targets were 14% over the previous five years.  Half of that was due to the recession, but the other half was due to the introduction of ambitious political measures to achieve energy efficiency, promote renewables and promote better transport efficiency.  I therefore disagree and think it was fundamentally achievable.</p>  <p>  We now have a big problem, however, because if one looks at the figures today the target we are setting for 2030 is our 2020 target.  We effectively got away with a 20% reduction, even though the headline is 30% if one takes out the pass.  It will be an expensive pass but we will get a pass on the ETS side and the agricultural side.  Effectively, therefore, we are 10% less and are back in 2030 to our 2020 targets.</p>  <p>  My fear is that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and every other Government Department, including Finance, which do not have the same ambition as the Minister to try to make this change will not give him the political space or capital to increase his budget three or five-fold, which is what I think we need to do.  My concern is that we will miss out on the economic opportunity from it.</p>  <p>  As regards Deputy Smith's amendment on community ownership, I have heard the argument expressed widely that there is a social justice issue involved.  If, for example, we allow people to create and generate their own power there may be knock-on consequences for others.  That fear should not hold the Minister back from freeing up Irish people's ability.  The scale it will take for that to become an issue is five, ten, 15 or 20 years away.  We have to win over that section of the public who want to do it.  The benefit of that, as the Minister said, will be the barrel of oil not used, which will far outweigh any other knock-on effect such as who is paying for the grid.  That can be managed.</p>  <p>  For too many years I have heard people use that as an argument to block the transition that is happening elsewhere and needs to happen here.  I support Deputy Smith's amendment in that regard.  I will leave the issue of board placements to a separate debate which is coming up later.  We have a consultation on community ownership but we have been waiting for and listening to consultations for God knows how long.  The White Paper should have made us come to a categoric view on it.  We should now be implementing it but we are not, so I support her amendment on promoting community ownership.  The wording we have agreed in my amendment provides a facility for that policy introduction and I hope the Minister will be able to use that very quickly.  However, let us not do it on the basis of fear that in some way by promoting self generation or community generation it will be a big cost on the rest.  That is not a big fundamental first issue: it can be managed.  I would not allow that to hold us back. </p></speech>

I do not see that as a block on it.  My point, however, is that we need to ensure that whatever we put down in primary legislation is carefully drafted.  There is this consultation and CER will come back to us shortly concerning its view.  It may very well propose that we need primary legislation in this area.  I am quite willing to work with all Members of the House to facilitate the passage of such legislation if that is required.  However, there are many ways we can deal with this.  It is not just the issue of grid access.  Even if we had primary access for community groups to the grid tomorrow morning, it would not change one iota of the practical aspect of this.</p><p>A combination or a suite of measures is needed to do that, and I am committed to doing it.  It is set out in the White Paper and the programme for Government.  I think there is unanimity in the House that it can and should be done.  I am slow to put in primary legislation a provision which I believe could have potentially unintended consequences.  That is the only reason I gave that example.  I do not see that as a blockage and I think it can be overcome.  As I said in this House on the day I was appointed, I do not see blockage as a reason not to do something.  It is just another issue to get around.  I want to work with all Members to ensure we can achieve that.</p></speech>

Following the discussion on Committee Stage, I asked my officials to consider the original amendment tabled by Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith and to discuss an appropriate alternative with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel that might address the Deputy's position.  I understand that my officials have also discussed this matter with representatives from the Deputy's office to clarify her requirements.  On foot of the discussions last week and in consultation with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, I am proposing an alternative amendment to that tabled by Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith, but to reflect the issues raised by her.  </p><p>I am conscious of the need for the appropriate representation from the environmental sector on the board of bodies such as the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI.  I do not believe that positions on State boards should be ringfenced for any specific sector.  Consequently, I do not propose to accept the amendment proposed by Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith.  As the Deputy will be aware, new arrangements for the appointments to State boards were introduced in 2014.  These will be put on a statutory footing later this year.  These arrangements strengthen the appointments process and ensure that individuals with necessary skills for the efficient and effective running of State boards are appointed following an open and transparent process.  The appointments process is run independently by the Public Appointments Service and it is open to any individual to register his or her interest on <i>www.stateboards.ie.  </i></p><p><i></i>A number of State boards come within the remit of the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  I actively encourage people to register their interest with <i>www.stateboards.ie</i>, particularly women.  The vast majority of the applications that have come across my desk so far have been from men.  I would encourage women to register their interest on <i>www.stateboards.ie</i>.  It would also be nice to see a few people from the countryside and not only from the city of Dublin on State boards.  If Deputies know of people who have expertise and want to get involved in State boards, please encourage them to register with <i>www.stateboards.ie</i>.  </p><p>Having reviewed the existing legislation in relation to the appointment of the board of SEAI, the provisions around the environmental competence can and should be strengthened.  Accordingly, I am proposing an amendment to section 10(3)(c) of the Sustainable Energy Act 2002 to include reference to climate change and environmental sustainability and to clearly state that appointees may represent non-for-profit or commercial interests.  I hope that this addresses Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith's concerns.  In addition, I advise the Deputy that arrangements are in hand for the filling of the existing vacancies on the board of SEAI.  An information booklet setting out the required skills and details pertaining to the appointments has been drafted.  I have instructed my officials to ensure that appropriate reference to the environmental competencies being discussed here today is included in that specification.  I also ask that the Deputy advise any individuals or organisations who may have an interest in participating in the board of SEAI or any State body to register their interest on <i>www.stateboards.ie.</i></p><p>I am accepting the principle of Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith's amendment, in respect of which I have brought forward the revised wording.  I am also committing to ensuring that the deficit as outlined by the Deputy will be incorporated into the new appointments, based on the applications that are submitted.  I can only make a decision based on the applications received.  I ask Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith to encourage as many people as possible in this sector to put their names forward.</p></speech>

I am concerned when places on boards are reserved for particular sectors or people.  I accept the principle of Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith's proposal but if we are not careful we could up with a board that is representative of people from the labour pillar or the business pillar and such people representing their pillars rather than being free-thinking.  Every person on the board of the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland should have an expertise on climate.  What we are talking about is the complete transformation of our energy system within three decades.  For this reason, we do not want accountants, lawyers or sociologists, etc., on the board of the SEAI.  We want all members of that board to have a profound understanding of and commitment to the issue of climate change because that is what shapes energy policy.  I am simply flagging that it is important that all those appointed to the SEAI board are completely focused if we are to make this transition because the scale of it is beyond compare in terms of what we have to do.</p></speech>

The difficulty I have with Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith's amendment is that I do not believe we should pigeonhole appointments to specific State boards.  We need flexibility.  As Deputy Ryan said, why should we be limited to one specific appointment?  In other words, should the Minister tick the box and appoint only one particular person even if there are three competent people he or she believes would add to the capacity of the board?  I do not think the Minister's hands should be tied.  We should not be pigeonholing people into various categories on boards.   I agree in principle with Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith's proposal and I am prepared to facilitate it.  I hope the Deputy will accept my amendment.</p></speech>

However, I do not agree with him or with Deputy Eamon Ryan.  Positive discrimination is where one checks the balance where it needs to be redressed.  I honestly believe that the bodies which advocate in respect of climate change issues are too weak on environmental issues.  This is why we need to reserve places or a place - I am not talking about the entire board - for somebody whose sole <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i>relates to environmental issues rather than whether they are making enough money or representing a section of industry.  It would be worth it.  I disagree with the Minister and Deputy Eamon Ryan.  However, given that they will win in any event, I will accept what the Minister says and I will encourage people to apply.</p></speech>

The impact of the scheme could be quite different from its intention when, as is the case here, it relies on the market and competitiveness to ensure results.  By imposing a levy that requires more biofuels to be used by road transport operators, we see an increase in such use.  It is true that we now use more biofuels but there are unintended consequences of market reliance that are having a negative impact on many indigenous small-scale producers of biofuels.  The market decided that importing the bulk of our requirements under the scheme was the most efficient way of doing it.  A multiplicity of countries can be involved in the production of imported biofuels.  For example, 94% of sugar cane used as a feedstock in the manufacture of bioethanol comes from Brazil while 100% of biodiesel produced from spent bleached earth comes from Malaysia.  Are we saying that it is sustainable or the best environmental policy to import biofuels from these countries or even to import biodiesel produced by using US corn or wheat?</p><p>While it seems this policy is successful in light of the increase in the amount of biofuels being used, we do not see an overall reduction in the use of petrol or diesel.  Our overall consumption increases in step with the increase in biofuels under this scheme.  We need to reduce our consumption of all forms of fossil fuels and look to a truly sustainable source of renewable energy.  Far from helping us achieve this goal, the market prevents us from achieving it.  An economic system based on competition, the drive for profits and accumulation for the sake of it will never be environmentally friendly or reduce the overall levels of raw materials and energy we use.</p><p>Our amendment is simple.  We understand the Minister's concern about the burden on NORA of compiling such reports.  However, regardless of whether it is done indirectly or directly by NORA, it is important that we see how this scheme impacts on the two areas to which I refer in order that we can gauge the effectiveness or otherwise of our policies and see their consequences and whether they are delivering the goal of sustainability and combating climate change.</p></speech>

I assume the Deputy is referring to the biofuels obligation scheme rather than the biofuel levy that is payable to obligated parties.  As indicated on Committee Stage, I appreciate the Deputy's concerns about the need to review the possible impacts of the biofuels obligation scheme on indigenous producers and also in respect of the growth in the use of biofuels and the food needs of developing countries.  However, it would not be appropriate to hardwire into primary legislation measures that can be catered for in a more flexible administrative manner and that would be more appropriate to other bodies.  Under the existing legislation, namely, section 31(2) of the National Oil Reserves Agency Act 2007, there is provision for the chief executive of NORA to account to the Oireachtas for the performance of the functions of the agency.  Therefore, as I said on Committee Stage, a more user-friendly and immediate approach to address the Deputy's concerns would be for the Oireachtas committee to request the agency to brief it on its functions and its administration of the biofuels obligation scheme, including the issues raised by the Deputy.</p>  <p>  On Committee Stage, I also referred to the report that NORA produces each year about how the biofuels obligation scheme is implemented.  The latest report for 2015 can be downloaded from NORA's website.  I also provided the Deputy with a copy of the report on Committee Stage.  It contains detailed information on how the scheme works and outlines in great detail how the sustainability of biofuel supported under the scheme is verified.  It also provides a detailed breakdown of the types of biofuels that have been placed on the market, the feedstocks from which these biofuels are produced and the origin of those biofuels.</p>  <p>  It should also be noted that the main function of NORA is to arrange the holding of national strategic oil stocks as determined annually by the Minister.  Its other function is to administer the biofuels obligation scheme on behalf of the Department.  NORA is a small, stand-alone agency that is involved in activities funded by levies imposed on the disposal of oil products and biofuels.  I am, therefore, not convinced that NORA would have the capacity or capability - or be the right body - to undertake or commission such a study.</p>  <p>  In 2013, the European Commission produced a 177-page report on the impact of biofuel production on developing countries that is in the public domain.  This EU report states that it took into account more than 150 previous studies from various sources, including those produced by international organisations, governmental organisations, academia, the private sector and NGOs.  The range of impacts that were investigated during the compilation of this report include those of an economic nature, including those on food prices, the land tenure system, investor strategies and business models.  The environmental impacts assessed include those relating to land degradation, de-afforestation, water resource management, biodiversity, greenhouse gas emissions and other land use changes.  The social impacts that were considered include land and food rights, gender and technology transfer.  This EU report goes a long way towards addressing the valid concerns raised by the Deputy.  Therefore, I ask her to withdraw this amendment.  I will furnish her with a copy of the report to which I refer.   If she feels this needs to be revised or updated or that it is missing something, I have no difficulty in taking it up with the European Commission on her behalf and on behalf of the committee and this House.</p></speech>

Can our officials, scientists or NORA extrapolate what will be the impact on Ireland from the evidence contained in the EU report or how it can influence or direct our policy decisions or changes we need to make?  Rather than just having the report, can we apply it to our specific targets and ambitions?</p></speech>

The appropriate way to do that is to bring representatives from NORA before the committee and ask whether it can extrapolate from the report's findings and whether it requires further information if that is available.  I agree with the Deputy and think there is huge merit in what she is saying.  I fully support the issues she has raised.  I have already raised this matter in the context of other importers of products from outside the EU.</p><p>We should explore it through NORA first and then we can see where we will go from there.</p></speech>

The area I would like to raise is affordable housing.  The sector is crucial because if we get that area correct we can move north and south of affordable housing.  North of affordable housing is private housing and south is social housing.  I am very passionate about trying to ensure we have that area correct.  The numbers I have been given very recently on the construction of a very standard three bed semi-detached house of less than 1,100 sq. ft., which used to be the old criteria attached to a first-time house purchase, is that it costs about &euro;180,000.  The difficulty with that is that the construction costs includes the site cost of about &euro;16,000, profit of about &euro;14,000 and VAT of over &euro;21,000.  Those figures are up to date as of last week.  The difficulty is that somebody on moderate pay of around &euro;30,000 will not meet the Central Bank criteria and will not get the loan unless they have a very large deposit.  It is practically impossible to gather up that deposit along with paying rent.  The even more difficult qualifying criteria from the Central Bank is the ratio of loan to earnings.  There is no way around that; there is a way around deposit if one is fortunate enough for somebody to be able to give them some funds.</p>  <p>  There are two options.  The first option, the important one, is to bring down the price of the property.  That can be done and I welcome the mixed tenure possibility involved in the housing plan.  The State has land but should the State charge people on low pay on a mortgage over 30 years to pay for that site price?  We want people to have the capacity to buy their own property, which is affordable, so that in future they have the capacity not to spend all their money on their house but to participate in society and community because they have some spending power.  That is the real nub of this.  If we get that right, we will have more people coming out of the rental sector and they will have purchased their own property.  The pressure then will be relieved on the rental sector.  The problem currently is that the rental sector is at an over-capacity stage.</p>  <p>  I welcome the student accommodation.  It is crucial that it happens in areas where the bulk of the students are - Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford.  There are other areas.</p>  <p>  I will conclude and let Deputy Bailey in.  It is really important that we move on the affordability of these housing units.  It is more than just Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway.  There are areas around the country such as Greystones, my town of Gorey, Wexford, Kilkenny and many others where analysis is required.</p></speech>

What this Department has achieved in 76 days is immense.  I compliment the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and the Minister of State, Deputy English, their Department and the many Ministers involved in putting this plan together and supporting it financially and through other strands.  I pay tribute to the numerous stakeholders for the immense consultation process that took place so that this plan will speak for a wide cohort of people, whether they are people who find themselves homeless, in mortgage distress or arrears, are looking to buy their first property and get on the property ladder, are seeking rent supplement or entering the HAP scheme, which is a very positive scheme that will be rolled out in totality shortly, or are trying to buy their first home but finding it immensely hard to put their deposit together.  This plan encompasses all of them.  While I accept we can go further in certain areas in future, this action plan gives a solid foundation to start to increase supply and plans to establish this and do far more.</p><p>Having come from local government, where I was a councillor for over 12 years, I have a great understanding of the barriers that are in place to develop housing, such as Part 8, and those infrastructural barriers in place for private developers pursuing their planning applications. <font color="#FF40A0"> </font>The elastic timescale is soul-destroying for many people who need a home.  I have great sympathy for them.  Procedure and process should not hinder the delivery of this plan and I welcome the actions to diminish the timeframes in both public and private delivery.  We have had approximately ten to 15 years of lack of financial investment in many Departments but mainly for direct build in local authority housing.  This Government is now in a financial position to invest in housing.  We need a strong economy to have a fair society and to invest in our housing supply.</p><p>To remind Deputies how far we have come in this process, it is not that long ago that the crash hit back in 2007.  We found many families in very serious situations.  What I bring to this debate is a personal experience of how the mismanagement of this country affected my family.  I was one of those families in massive negative equity.  Uncertainty hit my overpriced hall door with a very loud bang of unemployment.  I had a very young family, one being a newborn, and I experienced the fear of the future and the torpedo of an emotional rollercoaster of financial distress that an overburdened mortgage brings to any family.  Thankfully I have come out the other side of that through this Government's initiatives.  In order to build more homes, we need to invest in addressing our infrastructural barriers.  I am delighted with the &euro;200 million investment from the Minister, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, to secure that which confirms again a cross-departmental urgency and support for this housing plan.</p><p>I welcome the robust plan to tackle our housing situation.  I wish the Minister and his Department well on the implementation of this plan and do so knowing it is being tackled with a very genuine and sensitive regard to provide people with a place they can call home, not just a house.</p></speech>

I will start by wishing the Minister of State, Deputy English, and the Minister, Deputy Coveney, the best of luck with this plan.</p>  <p>  Every Member of this House, irrespective of what his or her politics or whoever he or she supports, has been concerned and hurt for many families which have, without question, suffered over recent years in homelessness.  It does not only apply to Dublin, Cork or Galway.  I can tell the Minister of State that I know of families in my constituency of Roscommon-Galway living in hotel rooms.  It is a very distressful time for them.  I am hopeful that the proposed strategy will generally work, that we will ensure that everybody will have a roof over their head and that their parent or parents will not have to be worrying about where they will sleep the next night.  We have all heard the stories about people having to put their children into a school in the daytime and walk the streets because they were living out of bed and breakfast accommodation.  It is a horrific situation and nobody in this House wants it to continue.  That is why I wish Ministers English and Coveney, and the strategy, the best of luck.  While we might come from different angles, all contributors to this debate are concerned about getting this right.</p>  <p>  I am a strong advocate of home ownership.  We should not be saying to people that they do not have a right to own their own home.  The Irish have a proud tradition of owning their own homes.  On many occasions when I would be talking to tenants in local authority housing they would tell me that they would like the opportunity to live in their own homes.  I welcome the fact that we have a new tenant purchase scheme.</p>  <p>  I do not approve of the situation where local authorities' properties under the Part V scheme cannot be included in any tenant purchase scheme for social housing.  It is unfair.  It is a nonsense and I would ask the Minister to take another look at it.  We are told the reason the Part V units are excluded from the incremental tenant purchase scheme is to ensure that all residential communities remain mixed-tenure developments.  This reason seems to be a perversion of the original intention of Part V, the previous scheme and the central idea of mixed-tenure communities.  I would say that the tenant purchase scheme discriminates against lower income households in these mixed communities by stating that it is only the right of a higher income household in mixed communities to have an opportunity to own their own houses.  I am very much in favour and a big supporter of Deputy Cowen's Bill.</p>  <p>  As I said, I wish the Minister and the Minister of State well.  I hope we can solve this problem.  I hope that we can all work together to relieve what is probably the biggest crisis facing us in the country at present.  Hopefully, that will happen very shortly.</p></speech>

While a strategic plan must be forward-looking and take a long-term view, we must realise that we are in the middle of a crisis and urgent action is needed for the thousands of homeless people around the country.</p>  <p>  What will this plan do for the person sleeping in a doorway on Grafton Street, for the woman and her children living in a hotel room, for the young couple who have separated and gone back to living with their parents because they cannot afford rent or for the young worker who is couch-surfing from Billy to Jack while trying, but failing, to find affordable accommodation, particularly here in our capital city?  While these are real people, all of them are in trouble.  They need some urgent action to resolve their immediate crisis situation.</p>  <p>  The capital spending on social housing for 2017 is set to increase by &euro;150 million and the Minister's plans will result in 6,000 social housing units per year for the next six years.  The Committee on Housing and Homelessness recommendation of 10,000 social housing units a year has been undercut to the tune of 40% in this new plan.  The whole point of the D&aacute;il committee being set up was to address the seriousness of the immediate crisis that we are now in.</p>  <p>  The reality is that housing lists are growing and the number of people in emergency accommodation is also growing, and therefore these plans are not sufficient to deal with the reality of these people's lives.  There has been universal agreement - universal among all except probably the landlords - for years that one of the major factors in the homeless crisis is high rents in the private rented sector.  One of the few areas where we have seen a recovery is in the sector but where is the reform of the sector?  Where is the protection for the responsible tenants, paying their rent and maintaining the property well?  What will prevent the landlord turning up and saying that his niece is coming to stay and the tenant must go?  For many tenants, there is nowhere to go or they are being told that the property has been confiscated by the bank, which must sell it while its empty.  They are put out and have nowhere to go.</p>  <p>  In a rural constituency such as mine, the stark homelessness of the cities is not so common, but the issue of mortgage arrears is damaging the mental health and well-being of so many.  The programme for Government promised many measures, such as a custom-designed mortgage court and a code of conduct on mortgage arrears, but there is no sign of them here.  Considering that there are over 85,000 households in mortgage arrears, this is a disappointing omission from the housing plan.</p>  <p>  It looks like there is a lot more to be done and what is lacking is the political will to do it.  It is time that the provision of housing for the people is regarded as a social responsibility and not just a source of profit for those in the business.  Housing is a human right and the social policy governing it must reflect that.  Unfortunately, this strategy does not reflect that social policy element.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-07-20a.648" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1303" speakername="Dessie Ellis" time="19:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016072000060#JJJ01000"><p>The launch yesterday of the Government's action plan falls well short of addressing the needs of families that are affected most by the housing crisis.  There will be no solution to the housing crisis without a social aspect and there will be no solution without State intervention.  The action plan for housing and homelessness launched yesterday is a case in point.  There are some good points, but the plan is conservative in its outlook and where time is taken to expand on plans, they do not add up or are vague or misleading.  For example, the action plan states that 1,500 rapid housing units will be finished by 2018.  We have seen some of this before, as there was a rapid-delivery housing programme for homeless families then residing in hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation rolled out in October 2015 by the Labour Party, which was part of the then Government, and which was to deliver 500 units by the end of this year.  However, in an answer to a parliamentary question, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, told me last month that out of the 500 promised units, 22 were actually built in Ballymun, with the possibility of 171 being finished by the end of the year, and even this target is in doubt.  Considering we are nowhere near completing the previous plan for rapid build housing, what are the chances of completing the 1,500 units before the end of 2018?</p>  <p>  There are a number of excellent initiatives in the action plan for supports for families with children in emergency accommodation.  These include dedicated child support workers, home-school community liaison, access to free public transport for school journeys and joined up supports between education, health and Tusla for homeless families, as well as important interventions to safeguard families in emergency accommodation.  However it is not clear how all of this will be funded.  Will the relevant Departments and bodies be expected to source the funding from their own budgets or will it be provided from somewhere else?  The Minister knows as well as I do that funding will be the difference here.</p><p>The plan also allows for streamlining of planning processes for larger private housing developments.  The proposal is for developments with over 100 houses to be referred straight to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, therefore bypassing the local council process, which was valuable for community input.  Given that big developments will have the biggest impact on a local community, removing the local consultation part of the planning process would be a retrograde step.  Part of the local accountability in planning comes after pre-planning consultations at local level and they often enhance or "community-proof" big developments.</p> <p> By increasing the percentage of Part V units to at least 30% in special development zones, one could also provide for a mixture of affordable and social housing and other services related to correct community living.  This will put mixed use estates, which are best practice across Europe, into our new developments and in turn re-energise these development zones.</p></speech>

It was echoed in the Minister's plan yesterday and it states:</p><blockquote>Off-balance mechanisms will be used to maximise financial opportunities and leverage other assets available to the State, including land.  Under the strategy's governance structure, a dedicated work stream will be established from within the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, the Department Public Expenditure and Reform, the Department of Finance and the Housing Finance Agency to progress specific off-balance sheet mechanisms: expansion of the NAMA special purpose vehicle, a large-scale public-private partnership and a new financial vehicle.</blockquote><p>If it sounds familiar, it should, as it was put before the D&aacute;il by the last Government by a former Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly.  It has just been copied and pasted into the current plan.</p><p>I am not as optimistic as many people.  I would love to be optimistic in this House but I am not.  I am certainly not optimistic when I look at the housing policy.  The main reason I am not optimistic is because the prevailing idea is that the only way we will get housing is by going through the private market, which seems to reign supreme as God almighty; therefore we must look to it.  I took some notes from a book today documenting the history of social housing.  In the years between 2000 and 2007, there were 46,000 or 47,000 units of social housing stock from the entire supply; private housing numbered nearly 500,000 units.  Probably a tenth of all houses are social houses.  This document is non-committal about the delivery of social houses, meaning the more than 130,000 families on the social housing list will have to do one of two things, and it looks like they will only have the first option.</p><p>That option is to get into a housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme.  Having been a councillor for the past seven years, I am familiar with the scheme.  It is very difficult to get a landlord interested in the scheme, as they have the pick of the crop now and they can go to students, information technology workers and other professionals around the city and take them.  That is instead of entering an arrangement with the local authority that would tie them in for a number of years.  There is a commitment to get something like 550 families into the HAP scheme by the end of the year but by the time we come back there will be four months until the end of the year and the Government would work magic to get 550 families housed under the scheme by then.  We will see and the proof will be in the pudding.  I will put a few bob on it and say it will not be done and cannot be done.</p><p>The reason is that this Government relies entirely on the private market, as social housing is absent from this document.  It is absent not by accident, but for a reason, which is ideological and political.  It is about feeding the developers, bankers and the same old crooks, gangsters and financiers who put us in this current position.  The Minister of State, and the former Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, are quite genuine about this to a degree but they will not achieve much.  This Government will build more houses than the former Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, not because of the plan, but because it would be impossible to build any fewer than he did.  We were promised 5,500 social houses under the former Minister by 2015 but we got approximately 400 by 2016, so we can work out the maths and see how much can be delivered.</p><p>The problem with the housing market is that it is a market and it gives us many problems.  It does little to deal with homelessness.  I will comment briefly on modular housing, as I have some in my back yard in Cherry Orchard.  There was a recent protest to stop the building going ahead but people did not object to the housing.  The people in Cherry Orchard have one shop and school, with no post office, dentist or doctor, and a lousy bus service.  They objected to the housing scheme going ahead because the builders did not know what they were doing.  They were cutting through an estate, taking away culs-de-sac, while they put main roads through another estate.  When the council was called to check what was going on, nobody had any maps or drawings.  Even at that most basic and fundamental level, we are making a hames of this.  We are paying somebody - I do not know who it is - &euro;250,000 for each of these modular houses.  I am not saying they will be nasty or horrible but we know from builders and people like Deputy Mick Wallace that one could build a decent home on public land for approximately &euro;150,000.  Why are we not doing that?  It is because the market reigns supreme and the Government cannot get that out of its head.  It should move away from the market and take responsibility for providing decent public housing.</p></speech>

As has been well documented in the House, this is not just a crisis for the Minister and his Department to deal with; it is a real-life emergency.  As a member of that committee, I was disappointed that more of our proposals were not taken on board.  However, I compliment the Minister and the Department on delivering the plan on time and giving us the opportunity in the House to debate it before the summer recess.  I welcome most of the housing action plan and it is extremely important that the plan is given a chance to work.  Every man, woman and child in emergency accommodation tonight deserves a chance for the plan to work.  The 23 children in emergency accommodation in my constituency of Waterford deserve for this plan to be given a chance to succeed.</p>  <p>  There are a few areas of concern.  We all remember last year the launch of the plan by the then Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, and I remember the phrase "shovel-ready sites".  Unfortunately, we have not seen too many shovels at work and local authorities only managed to deliver 28 houses in the past 12 months, with the rest delivered by approved housing bodies.  I keep repeating the role local authorities will need to play.  The local authorities delivered social housing in the past and did it well but the problem escalated when local authorities stopped building.  Their input must be reimplemented on a large scale and I look forward to seeing that happen.  This cannot just be another plan and we need to see the bricks and mortar.</p>  <p>  I welcome that the Government has promised to end the practice of homeless families staying in hotels by next year and to build 47,000 units of social housing.  The commitment to streamlined procurement and approval of new social houses is also very welcome.  The procurement and approval processes are out of date and they bear no relation to the emergency housing issue we are now experiencing.  They are in need of urgent reform and simplification.  There is always a risk in developing more procurement powers for local authorities and approved housing bodies.  Given the snail's pace at which the Department approves new social housing projects, the risk is worth it.  We dealt with this issue a lot in the committee and the frustration was great when dealing with procurement matters.  In my home town of Portlaw in Waterford, we saw plans last June and the local authority had already built 24 houses on a site.  There were no objections and the finances were in place, but not a sod has been turned 13 months later.</p>  <p>  With regard to improved social housing delivery, I welcome the proposals for a new financing model, including the commitment to request that financing of social housing by the State be considered off-balance sheet to improve approved housing bodies' ability to access finance and establish a new housing procurement agency with staff from the Housing Agency, National Treasury Management Agency and the Department dealing with housing, planning and local government, as well as the Department of Finance.  This is so local authorities and approved housing bodies can deliver their social housing programme.</p><p> I also urge the Minister to work with the credit unions.  This morning we all heard in a briefing that they are restricted by the Central Bank in how they can currently invest.  The credit unions have &euro;10 billion on deposit.  To use even a quarter of this to provide social and affordable housing would make sense.  They are really anxious to get involved and we should take them up on the offer.  They have much to offer if they were allowed into the market.</p> <p> I am concerned that a moratorium on repossessions was not addressed.  Unless we prevent people from being evicted, especially in cases of negative equity, it will be difficult to stop the ever-increasing waiting lists.</p> <p> I would have liked to have seen more detail on student accommodation.  Thousands of students are already facing difficulty in securing third level accommodation, especially in the larger cities, for the forthcoming academic year.  While the Higher Education Authority estimates an existing level of unmet demand of approximately 25,000 student bed spaces nationally, this strategy has proposed that 500 new student accommodation places would be built on DIT's Grangegorman campus.  I would like to see proposals on how universities and institutes of technology could gain better access to finance by borrowing independently from the State.</p> <p> Aspiring home buyers hoping to get a foot on the property ladder also felt let down.  There is not a lot in the report on first-time buyers and the difficulty of trying to get a 20% deposit together, especially in cities where it can amount to &euro;50,000, which is outside the reach of most people.</p> <p> There are gaps in the strategy that have to be filled but I sincerely wish the Minister well and look forward to seeing these houses, homes and apartments under construction as quickly as possible.  As stated in the overview of the action plan, good housing anchors strong communities.  I genuinely hope this plan is successful and look forward to seeing its implementation as soon as possible.</p></speech>

It has been long awaited and is long needed.  I thought for many years that we would never see the day we would get to the stage where a housing strategy became evident in the House of Parliament.  At last something is being done directly about the issues, which some of us saw and foretold many years ago while they were gradually and inexorably coming in our direction and creating what was initially a problem and then a crisis.</p>  <p>  We are great in this country for having problems for every solution.  That does not necessarily apply to this House but it certainly applies outside the House.  The first question is if it will work and the second where the money will come from.  We cannot afford the luxury of it not working.  That is the bottom line.  The Government has correctly put in the extra resources necessary because things do not happen unless provision is made.  The provision in this case comes down to the funding available.  There will be issues but the strategy can be tweaked satisfactorily to the benefit of the country, economy and the social life of the country.</p>  <p>  I so not understand why people object to other people's houses at the present time.  I know there have been situations where explanations have been given, but I just do not understand it.  I am one of those who feels that the most urgent issue for most families is a roof over their heads.  Many people in this country either do not have a roof over their heads or face the prospect in the not too distant future of not having a roof over their heads.  We have all dealt with cases where people have slept in cars, under bridges and in the open air over the past six to eight years.  This happened night after night and, in some cases, included small kids.  Whatever about adults in that situation, this has a most detrimental effect on children.  We hope that during the course of this plan we will see coming to fruition something that will address what we have all been talking about for a long time.</p>  <p>  There is another issue that I would like to see dealt with.  I have spoken to the Minister about it and I hope it will become a reality.  It concerns the old-fashioned local authority housing loan.  We all knew about them.  They were the first port of call for most young professionals.  For most people in working class areas, the very first thing they wanted was to own their house.  I think the Acting Chairman, Deputy Eugene Murphy, mentioned that Irish people do want to own.  They do want to own their house.  The reason they want to own it is it gives them security.  They have a stake in society and they are part and parcel of the economy.  They know that if they have a job they will be able to hold on to their house.  They have a vested interest in the economy of the country, which is a good thing because it involves everyone.</p>  <p>  Those who told us many years ago, when I objected to the housing plans that were followed, that we would change and become more reliant on private rental property were wrong.  It did not work, cannot work and will not work because it does not give the tenant the responsibility they want themselves, nor does it give them fixity of tenure.  They can never know when they will be asked to move on or for what purpose.  We all know about that issue.  Incidentally, there is a good cohort of landlords who are very decent.  They treat their tenants on the front line as if they were their own family.  Unfortunately, others are not so concerned and we have seen their activities over recent years.</p>  <p>  I am delighted we have reached the stage of having a tangible plan before us.  We hope it works.  We should all do everything possible to ensure it works.  We should add to it the bit about the housing loans, which can be provided for in the plan, to encourage those who are now asking where they will get a loan.  They want to buy and own their own house and are asking how they can do it.  There are two issues.  We need to make supply available to them and we need to ensure a loan system on which they can rely is also available to them.  I mentioned that at my parliamentary party meeting earlier this evening.</p>  <p>  I met a substantial business person in the recent weeks.  The first thing he said to me when he was talking about this housing situation was that the very first house he owned was purchased with the benefit of a local authority council loan.  Thousands of people throughout the country did the same.  The strategy will be hugely beneficial to everyone, the economy, the social life of the country, house owners and tenants.  Everything that has been added into the mix eases the current pressure.</p>  <p>  I am delighted to have had this opportunity to contribute and thank the Acting Chairman for facilitating me.</p></speech>

I hope, for the future of new politics, that this is the last of the spinning as we move towards a Government and a Parliament working together as the people rightly demanded.</p>  <p>  The very first line of the report states that housing is a basic human requirement.  I would like to see the State and the Government go further and state that housing is a basic human right with the obligations that go with it.  As a modern and ambitious nation, Ireland must work towards achieving that model, where housing is seen as a right and not simply as a vague requirement subject to the whims of changing agendas.</p>  <p>  I am concerned about the lack of detail with regard to those in mortgage difficulties.  The squeezed middle is often overlooked in major policy proposals and I fear that this may be the case again.  The past eight years have been enormously difficult for these people.  I would be stunned if any Deputy here did not during the recent election come across people who were visibly suffering from the strain of maintaining their mortgage repayments.  These citizens are also at risk of homelessness every month when the payment is due to be made.  I see no specific detail in the report which the Government has termed historic in its holistic capacity to embrace all housing issues.</p><p>In helping people in mortgage distress it is simply not good enough and I hope that in the autumn specific measures will be published for them.  </p> <p> I am also concerned about the number of approved housing bodies involved in the provision of social housing.  There are 542 with approved status.  To properly manage the provision of social housing in the long term that figure seems far too high.  My personal belief is the capacity of local authorities to deliver in this area should be increased.  A capacity building programme, with appropriate recruitment and training, should be undertaken to enable local authorities to gain the skills necessary to manage all aspects of social housing provision.  This would be an efficient and functional model of social housing management.  </p> <p> As I am not in a position to address all of my concerns, I will leave points about rent certainty, student accommodation, having one State agency and off-balance sheet items until the committee meeting tomorrow.</p> <p> This D&aacute;il has hit the ground running on the issue of housing provision.  An action plan has been launched.  The time for talking is over, while the time for delivery has begun.  I welcome the Minister's determination to track his actions in providing solutions to the housing crisis.  In this regard, I have one important and sincere piece of advice to give to him from my own experience, both as a businessperson and a public representative.  When a major project is undertaken in the business sector with many aspects to it and various timelines, it often happens that a particular proposal is simply not working.  In the business environment remedial action would be taken immediately, even if that meant scrapping certain proposals.  Throwing good money and resources at an idea that is not working cannot be tolerated today.  However, I have been frustrated during the years in seeing public policies that clearly are failing being continued simply because the public system does not have the courage to raise its hand and say, "We got this wrong, but we are changing it and will make it right."  The strength of the report will be the ability to change.  The public system's resistance to what is simply good management practice needs to change.  </p> <p> I wish the Minister and the Minister of State well, as I do the committee under the chairmanship of Deputy Maria Bailey.  I also believe the committee, with its oversight function, has a huge role to play in the delivery of the plan.  This D&aacute;il will be judged on its ability to deliver in dealing with the issue of housing and homelessness.</p></speech>

There is lot of good work going on in the housing sector and there had been a lot of discussion about homelessness, even before the general election.  It became a major issue which focused people's minds.  The quality of the debate is very clear and people genuinely wants to solve the problem.  There are various ideas about what we should do, but people want the crisis to be solved and those who are homeless to have a home.  They want to end homelessness and the provision of emergency accommodation in hotels and bed and breakfast establishments.</p>  <p>  The action plan is an attempt to bring forward a version of everybody's approach.  There is something in it for everybody to buy into and support.  The idea behind an action plan is that it is an evolving document.  If something is wrong, we will give up on it and take it out, but we will try it anyway and constantly add new ideas.  The document, Rebuilding Ireland, has been well received in the media and elsewhere.  People want to push it even harder and ask for more, which I understand.  We would like to do more if we had the money and resources.  People might say we only have &euro;100 million, but there was a fight to get that amount because every other Department wants resources too.  I was in two Departments previously and they both wanted some of the money that was available.  When there is some fiscal space, it is hard to compete for it.  It is an achievement that an extra &euro;2.2 billion has been allocated to housing.  Spending hundreds of millions of euro extra next year is not an option, but another &euro;100 million in capital has been allocated, a 40% increase.  We want to build on that figure and in the following year the increase will be over 100%.  If we had more money, we would spend it, but the plan is a fair attempt to start us in the right direction by building capacity with local authorities and other agencies, as well as in the private sector in order that it can build houses again.  It is an ambitious and comprehensive starting point in the Government's efforts and resolves to really deal with the issues of housing and homelessness.  </p>  <p>  The plan is ambitious, but it is also appropriate.  It has to be ambitious and hit targets.  The committee had further ambitions and that was its job.  I was a member of a committee a few years back and it was its job to push the Government and analyse policy.  Committee members have to scrutinise and put Ministers and Departments under pressure by asking questions and constantly coming up with new ideas.  I have seen this from both sides and it is an essential job.  We have got close to the target, but we are not there yet and everyone hopes the plan will go beyond what has been set out.  </p>  <p>  I generally enjoy listening to Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith, but I cannot let the claim that the belief in social housing provision is absent go unchecked.  A commitment to build 47,000 houses represents a major development, if we can make it happen, and a sum of nearly &euro;5.5 billion is not small change.  It is a lot of taxpayers' hard-earned money and shows there is a belief in social housing provision.  We can disagree about the percentages, but there is a commitment to deliver a lot of social houses and that should be recognised.  We can disagree, but we must fact facts.  </p>  <p>  The Oireachtas committee was very important and informed the debate in bringing forward its report.  Some suggestions made in it have not gone away, but they could not be factored in or achieved at this stage.  Proposals on rent certainty are an example.  We are developing a rental strategy, but we have to make it attractive to both investors and tenants.  I understand from where the committee was coming on this issue and we will spend a couple of months trying to tease it out further to come up with the best strategy we can to make the sector work.  Despite what people have said in this debate, there is a desire to provide rental properties.  Apart from social housing, the figure for rental properties is above 20%.  People are not only interested in buying houses; if one can rent at the right price, people are interested.  There is an onus on us all to give them that choice and develop a proper rental market with proper services, as well as proper communities.  We must work on that issue.</p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, and I, as well as departmental officials, have met a very broad group of stakeholders in all areas.  We have hosted two well attended stakeholder forums, both of which generated constructive debate and feedback.  The process has added greatly to our understanding of the housing system and its faults and failings and how its difficulties are leading to homelessness for many.  The housing system is a broad and interconnected set of markets and sectors.  Importantly, each sector of the market impacts on a different group in society.  In developing the action plan the Minister and I were acutely aware of the need to deal with each part of the housing system individually but also to address the interconnectivity and cross-dependencies in shaping an overall solution to build more homes.  It is a whole-of-government process, into which every Department and agency is feeding.  Everybody has been asked to buy into it and put his or her name to the actions to be taken.</p>  <p>  Am I allowed to give way?</p></speech>

The difference between this plan and other plans is that it involves a whole-of-Government approach involving many Departments.  It involves consultation with stakeholders, agencies and all the different players.  That is the same process we followed in the Action Plan for Jobs process.  Some Members will be familiar with that but others are not.  The Action Plan for Jobs process worked.  It set targets that nobody thought could be achieved, and it went way beyond those targets.  Why did that happen?  It was not because of magic by the Government but because there was buy-in by the private sector and all Departments.  It became priority No. 1.  Everybody's focus was on creating jobs and now, through this plan, everybody's focus is on building both social and private houses and finding solutions for people who are homeless and living in emergency accommodation.  There is a focus and a drive and that is backed up with actions, timelines, ownership and real cash.  That is why I have no doubt this plan can work.  In fact, I believe it will go beyond its targets.  We will monitor that and make an adjustment if needs be; it is an ongoing process.  There are more ideas out there that we have not captured in this plan.  We have to try to find them and include them also.</p><p>In taking this approach, we have the dual objective of repairing the broad housing system while at the same time providing real solutions for people.  For this reason, I was most pleased with the responses to the plan that referenced the fact that, for the first time, Government was looking at housing in its entirety.  That is really at the heart of this plan.  It is all the solutions in one document containing approximately 84 actions.  It is a focus that can make that happen.</p><p>To restore the housing system to a sustainable level we need to deal with all the component parts.  We looked under the bonnet of each sector and market of housing and came up with key actions to help repair what is broken or what can be done more effectively in each.  That is why we have the five pillars to set out the areas we will try to tackle in different ways.</p><p>On homelessness, we have set a clear target to have no families in hotels by mid-2017, except in very limited circumstances.  I hope we will get ahead of that target but that is a realistic timeframe in which to address that and we will do it.  We have to do it because it is not acceptable in this day and age to have families living in hotels and emergency bed and breakfast accommodation.  It is not appropriate either to have homeless people living on the streets but there is a combination of reasons for that and different solutions required.  Real involvement on the part of different Departments is required to address that, which we will do over time.  The challenge in terms of ending people living in emergency accommodation is to provide alternatives and trebling the rapid build programme to 1,500 homes is the key action to make that happen.  As I stated, it is an additional 200 this year, 800 next year and the rest the year after, so it will happen.  We have learned from the initial process and we can make this happen much quicker.</p><p>In the meantime, we will ensure that services for families, and particularly children, in hotels and other emergency accommodation is far better including enhanced liaison on family support, child welfare and child protection, including family resource centres; access to early-years services; school completion programmes; enhanced locally available practical supports for daily family life; access to free public transport for family travel and for school journeys, which is essential; and practical supports and advice for good nutrition for those without access to cooking facilities.  It is difficult to cover all the basics in one's own kitchen in terms of providing good food but we accept that it is even more difficult when one is living in a hotel.</p><p>The other side of this debate is people who are rough sleeping, which is often compounded and tied in with mental health and addiction issues.  This is a complex area that requires co-operation with the Department of Health, the Health Service Executive and others.  For that reason, we are trebling the funding for mental health and primary care services for homeless persons from &euro;2 million to &euro;6 million in budget 2017.  That is an appropriate response to try to determine how we can help these people get into a position where they can live in a home with support, with sheltered support or on their own and try to deal with the various issues that add to their problems.</p><p>In examining the social failing that is homelessness, one point was made again and again - prevention is far better than cure.  We are therefore targeting families and individuals worried about, or at risk of, being put out of their home or their rent agreement being finished - people who are worried that they will not have a roof over their heads.  We will do that through an awareness campaign and the T&aacute;naiste who is sitting beside me has brought forward a new facility, backed up with additional money and resources, to try to help people work through their arrears and mortgage difficulties, stay in their home and build more trust in that system.  We will try to get people to engage with the banks.  I am not saying the banks are saints but if someone will not engage it is difficult to help them.  It is difficult even to pinpoint their bank for a solution if the person will not engage.  We have to try to encourage that, and the efforts of the T&aacute;naiste, through the service, are to encourage that engagement and work through solutions.</p><p>Our Department is in charge of the mortgage to rent scheme, which I believe has failed.  I would have thought it was a solution for thousands of people.  It has been tweaked in recent months.  We will change it again.  We have looked at new ideas and will try to bring in more investors' money as it is well to put more money in the pot.  I believe that a new version of the scheme which we will roll out shortly containing new ideas can greatly impact on people and give them a choice, in terms of deal with their arrears and a mortgage they might never be able to afford in the future, to stay in their home.  In my view the scheme was not explained properly and if we believe in the scheme we should back it up.  That will help many people deal with their problem of debt while staying in their home.  I look forward to that working in a better way because I believe it is a solution that is appropriate and fair and protects the family home.  I hope we will be able to work on that through the committees also in the weeks and months ahead.</p><p>The link between a lack of sufficient social housing and homelessness is clear.  The lack of social housing options is also putting pressure on the rental sector, with one third of renters now supported by the State.  Again, the target is very clear &ndash; 47,000 new social housing homes by 2021 at a cost of &euro;5.35 billion.</p><p>I mentioned the figures earlier but it is worth clarifying them once and for all because there is confusion or doubt about them and I would hate for the wrong information to be given because it makes my life difficult when I am trying to get on a radio programme.  On the money side, the Social Housing Strategy 2020,<i></i>published in November 2014, committed to the delivery of some 35,600 social housing units in the period 2015 to 2020, supported by investment of some &euro;3.8 billion.</p><p>The social housing element of Rebuilding Ireland - an Action Plan launched yesterday proposes a significantly increased level of ambition, aiming for the delivery of 47,000 social housing units through build, refurbishment, acquisitions and leasing over the 2016 to 2021 period supported by an investment of &euro;5.35 billion.  A further &euro;200 million is being provided for the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund.<font color="#004080">  T</font>he &euro;5.35 billion investment proposed for the social housing area-----</p></speech>

I am confident of those figures and have no doubt about them.  I understand where there might be confusion, but the figure is right.  It is new money.  It is taxpayers' money.  It is not my money or the Government's money but taxpayers' money being invested in a key way.  The &euro;200 million for the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund is an important part of opening up sites for social housing but also for private housing.  It is about getting the market moving and achieving delivery.  This reflects a clear demonstration on the part of the Government of the high priority that it assigns on behalf of us all because the message is clear from everybody that we must spend money in regard to housing.  I have no problem going through the figures at a later stage in committee because I have no doubt about them.</p>  <p>  With regard to building more homes, when the housing market is working well, there is a good supply of a range of new and second-hand homes for purchase, which cater for the entire span of the market from starter homes upwards.  Currently, we are producing half the 25,000 houses a year we need.  Half of those are one-off rural houses so they are not where we need them in our main cities of Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway.  In fairness, having worked with the Members and Senators and having met councillors I am aware there is a housing problem in all our towns and villages.  It is prominent in our cities but it is evident now in all areas where people are waiting on homes.</p>  <p>  Similarly, due to this shortage of new homes, the second-hand market is half what would normally be seen.  The key graph on output is on page 30 of the plan if people want to analyse it.  It shows output predictions with the various elements of the plan implemented versus "business as usual" without these measures.  We believe that with the intervention in the plan we can double that figure up to 25,000 houses by 2019 and, I hope, increase it to 28,000 or 30,000 by 2021.  There is no reason it cannot go even further if everybody here works on that because when Government intervenes and commits to actions and backs that up with money and a delivery unit the markets will react because we cannot beat competition.  If we say we will build houses under a State plan-----</p></speech>

This is a technical amendment in the sense that where there is a robust <i>prima facie</i>case, the provision in the amendment would allow for an application to be made for an interim interlocutory order in respect of the property in advance of the 21 days elapsing.  If one is allowed to detain a person for questioning for seven days but if, after 24 hours, one has a robust case, one should proceed to charge that individual.  One would not need to wait seven days just because one is allowed to hold a person for that length of time before a charge is proffered.  Where there is a robust case, one should not be debarred from making an application to the court for an interim order in advance of the 21-day period that is provided for elapsing.</p><p>The reasoning the T&aacute;naiste is about to outline in respect of the amendment will be to the effect that this is probably one of the most litigated areas in criminal law.  As a result of the fact that each sentence in the original Criminal Assets Bureau, CAB, legislation has been parsed and analysed to such a degree and there is reluctance to dislodge any of the provisions contained in that legislation, I am not going to the wire in respect of the amendment.  I certainly do not want to do anything that would dislodge the legislation.  However, it would facilitate matters if we included a provision whereby if a robust and clear case exists, authorised CAB officers who feel confident of the bona fides of that case could go to court before the 21-day period has elapsed.  There was no legal bar to them doing that.</p></speech>

The Bill, as initiated, contains sufficient safeguards for affected persons against any potential abuse of the new seizure and detention powers.  In the context of justice being seen to be done quickly, I understand where Deputy is coming from but, as I said on Second Stage, persons can apply to the court to have an authorisation revoked and would only need to undermine any one of the four grounds on which the chief CAB officer must rely in order to do so.  It is also the case that failure by CAB to make an application order to the court for an interim or interlocutory order before the expiration of the 21-day period will open the door to a compensation action by the owners of the property.  I must also inform the Deputy that CAB can go before the court prior to the 21 days elapsing.</p></speech>

That is correct.  As the Deputy has acknowledged to the nth degree, criminals convicted of some of the most heinous crimes have used the Proceeds of Crime Act to litigate against the State, at considerable expense to the taxpayer.  The High Court and the Supreme Court have, quite correctly, been tied up for long periods in respect of that legislation.  That is as it should be because everyone, guilty or innocent, is entitled to access the courts to ensure that his or her rights are fully vindicated.</p><p>There are provisions elsewhere in law that require persons to be charged without delay.  When the Garda has sufficient evidence to do so, that is only correct.  The person is going to be prosecuted for a criminal offence and his or her liberty may be at stake so it is important that such matters are placed in the hands of the court without delay.  In that instance, however, the court hearing is not being made<i>ex parte.</i></p><p>The amendment raises a concern which I would ask the Deputy to consider.  It could open the doors to a great deal of litigation based on procedural arguments.  These could tie up CAB and the High Court in a potentially endless discussion as to when there is enough evidence for bureau to make the application to the court.  It must be borne in mind that, when conducting an investigation and especially when making an <i>ex parte</i>application to the court, investigators are bound to be fair and to make reasonable efforts to seek and consider exculpatory evidence.  This is a well understood concept in the courts and in law.  Forcing CAB to cut that process unduly short might render the overall process unfair.</p><p>We have, in light of the Deputy's amendment, consulted CAB on this.  The bureau has concerns that it might make the process unworkable.  Deputy Howlin indicated he will not press the amendment.  I ask that he takes what I have said as our best thinking on the amendment at this point and I ask him to reconsider the position.</p></speech>

The Bill provides for a firmly organised scheme.  First, a bureau officer -  if he or she is satisfied or believes that there is a reasonable suspicion that property may amount to the proceeds of crime - can detain the property for a period of 24 hours.  Second, if the chief bureau officer seeks an extension for that time and believes also that the property involves the proceeds of crime - or has a suspicion that it involves the proceeds of crime - the period can be extended to 21 days.  Obviously, once the 21 days have expired, the lawfulness of the detention also expires.  The property cannot be held for any period longer than 21 days.</p><p>The purpose of Deputy Howlin's amendment is to ensure that CAB brings applications before the courts promptly.  That is desirable.  However, I have a concern about the manner in which the amendment is being put forward because it could create a slight inconsistency.  People could argue that CAB could only go before the courts when it had enough evidence, as is provided for in the proposed amendment.  That may create inconsistency with what is already provided for in the statute.  The point which Deputy Howlin seeks to emphasise through the proposed amendment is that there may be times when property has been inappropriately seized by CAB by way of this administrative detention.  This must be prepared against with some form of legislative mechanism.  I believe a legislative mechanism to deal with that is provided in section 1(<i>c</i>) where there is provision for compensation.  That mechanism should deal with the concerns raised by the Deputy.</p></speech>

My genuine fear is that if it were accepted, the amendment would have an inadvertent and adverse impact on the effectiveness of what is extremely important anti-gang and anti-criminal legislation.  As others have pointed out, the new section 3 lies at the heart of the legislation and it introduces the notion of the bureau officer and reducing the value of the seized property to a threshold of not less than &euro;5,000.  These are measures I strongly support.  On balance, I am minded to err on the side of caution and not push the amendment for those reasons.</p></speech>

I had hoped that I would see a similar amendment in her name because it is not often in this House that one sees a consensus view, such as we saw even from the Deputies behind the Minister on this matter.</p>  <p>  I said that I come with a degree of experience in the notion of hypothecated taxes and the notion of anything ringfenced is anathema to the denizens of Merrion Street.  We understand that.  I thought, however, that the Minister in her new powerful role would be able to amble down Merrion Street and talk to the inhabitants therein and win a view that it would be a really social good that goods seized by criminals in the most deprived areas would be deployed to the benefit of those areas.  That is a reasonable proposition.  It is not a general proposition that would apply in terms of ringfenced taxes or ringfenced seizures to be used for particular purposes.  In this instance, many passionate arguments were made across all these benches that this is a good idea, that the proceeds of any moneys seized under these provisions would be used for the benefit of the social development of persons from communities suffering from economic and social disadvantage.  That would be a really good thing to do.  In the context of breaking out of the norms of other D&aacute;ileanna, it is something the Minister could have acceded to.  I was disappointed that I did not see an amendment in her name mirroring the sentiments at least of the one that had been argued for by Deputies.</p></speech>

I also put down a statutory scheme in a Bill I drafted and sent to the Minister, which provided for the establishment of a confiscated assets account.  I mentioned on the last occasion we debated this in the D&aacute;il that in Australia and other countries, there is a similar provision whereby assets confiscated, which are the proceeds of crime and are sold, are used for the benefit of the communities which have suffered the most from the use of drugs and from crime.  We should seek to replicate that.  It would be very beneficial to communities that have been particularly damaged by drugs.  I know it will not be considered here in the context of the amendments to this Bill.  There is, however, a review continuing in respect of the proceeds of crime legislation and it should be given active consideration.  Proposals should come forward since there is support around the House for it to ensure we can establish a new fund which uses the funds of criminal activities in communities.  It would be wonderful for communities to see benefits, advantages and developments in their areas as a result of the confiscation of criminal proceeds.</p></speech>

The point behind the amendment is to have a redistribution in certain communities but I hope to get this Bill through tonight and that is one reason not to accept amendments.  I would not rule out a medium-term review of this legislation to consider all of its implications.  I invite the Deputy to make a submission on that point because it is worth considering, although the Deputy knows the reaction of the Department of Finance.  On the international reach of the Criminal Assets Bureau, CAB, a real issue arises - for example, in a current case concerning funds which have been frozen in respect of criminal activity which has occurred outside the State where the victims of the crime are in another state.  If we are to abide by our international obligations and encourage greater international co-operation in the recovery of assets in cross-border cases, we need to be able in appropriate cases to transfer funds back to the country of origin where the crimes have occurred and the proposed amendment might tie the hands of the Minister and prevent this.  I am sure it could be dealt with appropriately if we were moving ahead in respect of this. </p>  <p>  There is another important issue, and I made this point in the Seanad, to do with the uncertain nature of the value of the assets seized by the bureau in any given year in addition to the potential delays through the possibility of legal challenge to court disposal orders.  The provision of continuing funding to community projects or organisations would have to be considered because the revenue source would be uncertain.  We would have to do work on the implementation of this amendment because it would not be a constant source of funding that a community might depend on.  The question would arise of what kind of projects it would fund.  I am sure that could be dealt with but depending on the revenue in a multi-annual way could be problematic and could make it difficult for organisations or communities involved in the delivery of such services to plan.  However, that is not insurmountable.  There is also the bigger point about ringfencing any funding and the administrative cost that arises in respect of that.</p>  <p>  The question of reinvesting the money in the work of CAB has arisen in some jurisdictions where money seized was, for example, reinvested in police services.  We do not want to create an incorrect perception of a link between the motivation behind the choice of CAB&rsquo;s targets and its funding stream or the funding stream of community initiatives.  If we are to legislate for a community redistribution fund it may be safer to do so in discrete legislation separate from the proceeds of crime legislation.  I appreciate that the amendment has been ruled out of order but I am certainly not against examining this issue and working through the various points that have arisen and then seeking Deputy Howlin&rsquo;s support to make sure he can convince those in the Departments of Finance and of Public Expenditure and Reform about it.</p></speech>

There are models such as the one in Australia where this is done.  It is a matter of having the will to do it.  We do it here with the funds of suitors and the dormant accounts fund.  Under the legislation, we take inactive accounts or funds of suitors, use them for a public good and if somebody subsequently says it is his or her money there is a provision for that.  It does not mean that people who benefit from the funds of suitors or the dormant accounts cannot plan - of course, they can.  It is a supplement for a defined and clear set of purposes.  One could make the same argument about the national lottery because if people do not buy the tickets how can the delivery of services be planned?  That line of argument does not hold water.</p>  <p>  I am obviously not going to win the argument tonight but in a way it is disappointing that the first argument used by the Minister is that she wanted to get the Bill through - in other words, if the amendment were accepted she would have to go back to the Seanad.  That is not a compelling reason to do something because I think there would be a consensus in the Seanad also to do this.  I do not have a legitimate amendment before the House.</p><p>I hope this argument will surface again in another context and that the T&aacute;naiste will be willing to take on people who feel that the way we have always done things in the past must be how we do things in the future on such issues.</p></speech>

It is an issue a lawyer raised with me and I thought it was worth teasing out.  I hope I signalled the issue in my contribution on Second Stage.  The new criminal provisions to deal with prostitution in this country would move criminal responsibility away from the sellers of sex to the buyers.  The proceeds of the transaction would accrue to the prostitute.  In a pithy statement I tried to encapsulate what would happen - we might not put the prostitute in jail but we would put them in the poorhouse because we are criminalising the proceeds of crime.</p><p>We have not debated the provisions of the sexual offences Bill in any great detail, which follow what, I understand, people describe as the Swedish model.  It criminalises the purchase of sex but decriminalises the sale of sex.  The victim is perceived to be the prostitute, that is, the person who is required by whatever economic circumstances to sell sex.</p><p>This provision would mean that, while a person would be decriminalised in terms of the act, the gains made would be criminal assets and she would be subject to having them seized.  I do not know whether the T&aacute;naiste has a view on this, but it is worth thinking it through if we are going to be consistent.  </p><p>In the previous Administration we had discussions on moving towards the Swedish model of recognising that women - almost exclusively women are the ones selling sex and in very vulnerable situations, often having been trafficked - should not be criminalised in this way either if we are decriminalising their action in the selling of sex.</p></speech>

It refers to a person who pays or gives another person money or other consideration for the purpose of engaging in sexual activity with a prostitute.  That could apply in circumstances where a man pays another man money in respect of sexual activity he has had with a prostitute.  It would not necessarily involve the payment of money, which is the intention, by the man to the prostitute.</p>  <p>  I am slightly concerned that the amendment would enable pimps and other individuals to receive money from other men who were availing of the use of prostitutes who are under the unfortunate control of these pimps, and that they would then be able to say that the money is excluded under the proceeds of crime legislation.</p></speech>

Under current law, neither payment for sexual services nor the receipt of payment for providing such services is a criminal offence.  I understand that the intention is to provide in the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill 2015 for an offence of payment for sexual activity with a prostitute.  That was the subject of considerable debate in the Seanad and a series of committee work that was done.</p>  <p>  While the Bill was passed by the Seanad earlier this year, it has not yet been enacted and we have not had a discussion on it here. I  hope we will move on to the Bill when the D&aacute;il resumes after the summer recess.  It is a matter for both Houses to pass the Bill. </p>  <p>  While the proposals in the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill are generally well supported and have cross-party support in the D&aacute;il, we have to conclude work on it.  I would have some difficulty in introducing provisions in this Bill relating to the proceeds of crime arising from conduct that is not currently criminalised.  It is not appropriate to introduce a provision that pre-empts the work of the House on the Bill.  I take the point the Deputy has raised.  When we are working on the other Bill in the House, we can be mindful of it.</p>  <p>  A number of other points are worthy of consideration.  The exemption for purchasing sexual services from criminal conduct for the purposes of the proceeds of crime could lead to sex workers being pressured into holding moneys as legitimate-seeming fronts for traffickers or other organised criminals.  It might also make it more difficult for CAB to pursue the proceeds of crime held by, for example, pimps or traffickers.  CAB would, for example, have to show a derivation from trafficking-related prostitution, as distinct from non-trafficking-related prostitution.  Those matters need to be considered.</p>  <p>  Another point relates to money-laundering legislation.  It is the case that while the amendment would disapply the proceeds of crime legislation to money obtained by a person who offers sexual services, that money would still be the proceeds of criminal conduct for the purposes of the Criminal Law (Money-laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010.  To attempt to exempt the purchasing of sexual services in that respect could have potential effects on international obligations or the regulatory system for money laundering prevention and detection.  There is also the potential for sex workers to be used as legitimate-seeming fronts for holding moneys for traffickers.  </p>  <p>  If the amendment was accepted and the offence of purchasing sexual services was introduced, money obtained from providing such services would be the proceeds of criminal conduct under money-laundering legislation, but not under the proceeds of crime legislation.  Given that we have not concluded work on the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill, it would be better to wait to introduce this amendment to this Bill.</p></speech>
