One such concern is the prevalence of online pornography, which is available to young people.  The purpose of this question is to elicit from the Minister whether the Government or he intend to seek to expand the role of the Irish Film Classification Office, IFCO, to assist it in monitoring the availability of online pornography to young people.</p></reply>
    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-06-26a.10.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019062600003#A00600"><p>I assure the Deputy that the accessing of online pornography by children is a matter for considerable concern, even where that content is not inherently illegal.  As stated by the Taoiseach in the D&aacute;il last week, it is a matter of concern to all of us that many young people learn about sex through pornography, particularly as such material is not an accurate representation of what is healthy or appropriate behaviour.  Exposure to such material at a young age is certainly inappropriate and may, at times, be harmful.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, the Irish Film Classification Office, IFCO, is responsible for examining and certifying all cinema films and videos-DVDs legally distributed in the State.  The legislation provides that no film shall be exhibited in public unless the Director of Film Classification has certified that it is suitable and a certificate is displayed to that effect.  The legislation gives the director power to prohibit a film or to impose conditions or restrictions upon its exhibition.  The Deputy will be aware that the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2008 clarified for the first time that a core function of IFCO was classification of content "likely to cause harm to children".  Where there is pornography contained within the material covered by the above legislation, IFCO takes a firm stand to prevent availability of such material to children by consistent application of its system of age-related classification of cinema films and videos-DVDs.  However, within this legislation, there is no statutory function for IFCO relating to broadcast online or mobile material. </p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-06-26a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1296" speakername="Jim O'Callaghan" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019062600003#A00700"><p>I thank the Minister.  The Government needs to give consideration to expanding the role of IFCO.  I have mentioned previously in this House that the current generation of young people are being exposed to pornography, the likes of which has not been seen previously.  Young men in particular are learning about sexuality from very violent pornography online, which presents women in a very malleable and submissive way.  As a State, we need to recognise that we have a responsibility to try to protect our children from the influence of online pornography.  We protect our children from the dangers of tobacco and alcohol and, similarly, we should do the same in respect of online pornography.  </p>  <p>  In 2017, the United Kingdom introduced the Digital Economy Act 2017, which includes the statutory rule that providers cannot provide pornography online to people without verifying that they are over 18 years of age.  In July this year, that role will be given to the British Board of Film Classification.  Does the Government intend to try to expand the role of IFCO in order that it would have a responsibility to ensure that young people, that is, those under 18 years of age, are not being exposed to online pornography?  </p></speech>

I do not currently envisage a role for IFCO outside its current statutory remit.  In particular, I do not envisage a role in regard to classification of online material, which I think Members will recognise as the dominant distribution model for material of a pornographic nature.  The issue of online material, as all Deputies will be aware, is complex.  It is an area that is constantly developing.  Access by children is not solely the responsibility of any individual Minister or Department.  Members will also recognise that content which is not illegal can nevertheless be harmful, especially to those people in society who may be vulnerable, and to children. </p>  <p>  My colleague, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton, is developing proposals for an online safety commission.  In this regard, he has recently held a public consultation to seek the views of citizens and stakeholders as to an achievable, proportionate and effective approach to regulating harmful content, particularly online. </p></speech>

The responsibility of the regulator is to ensure that children are not exposed to online pornography.  We need also to place more of a responsibility on the social media, large technology companies, that are making huge profits.  We need to try to set up a statutory office, expanding the role of IFCO, in order that there can be an obligation on the providers of pornography to be satisfied that the people to whom they are providing it are over the age of 18 years.  I am aware that when the UK was giving this responsibility to the British Board of Film Classification, there were some privacy concerns. </p><p>The issue in the UK is not about trying to identify who is watching pornography.  The objective of the legislation and the new statutory position is to ensure that the person providing the pornography has verification that the person watching it is aged over 18 years.  The Government is going to have to do something about this because the prevalence of violent pornography on the Internet is such that some steps be taken to ensure social media companies or the people providing it are responsible for it.  We have a responsibility as an Oireachtas.</p></speech>

The Deputy specifically raised the position in the UK.  Last Thursday, the UK Government announced that it was postponing the age verification scheme just weeks before its planned launch.  It announced a delay of six months due to an administrative oversight.  It has since been reported that the government failed to notify the European Commission when laying the regulator's guidance in Parliament in late 2018, undermining the legal basis of age verification.  Deputies may be aware that this is the third delay in respect of age verification in the UK.  Last week, in response to a parliamentary question, the Taoiseach indicated that we would examine the UK situation.  I would be most happy to do so.  While Ireland may envisage difficulties, this is also a situation of some complexity in other jurisdictions.  This is why I do not want to pre-empt the round of discussions and consultation currently under way, chaired by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  I look forward to hearing the outcome of that consultative process in due course.</p></speech>

A related matter is the whole area of child sexual abuse material, material posted without consent, violent sexual imagery and material of that nature.  The Budapest Convention on Cybercrime is broad and part of what it examines is the area of production orders and preservation orders.  That area gives additional resources and powers to domestic legislatures.  I believe this needs a statutory basis in this jurisdiction.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-06-26a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019062600004#B00600"><p>I thank the Deputy for this question.  Deputies will be aware that I outlined the position on ratification of the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime in January of this year.  I updated the House on the significant progress made in the ratification process within the term of this Administration, particularly through the introduction of legislation to give effect to the key criminal law provisions of the convention.</p>  <p>  The majority of the provisions of the convention are provided for under domestic law.  The convention is broad in scope and its measures are provided for in criminal justice, interception, sexual offences , extradition, mutual legal assistance and copyright legislation.</p>  <p>  The most significant step towards ratification of the convention was the enactment in 2017 of the first Bill in this jurisdiction specifically targeted at cybercrime.  The Criminal Justice (Offences Relating to Information Systems) Act 2017 gave effect to an EU directive on attacks against information systems, the main provisions of which reflect the key provisions of the Council of Europe convention.</p>  <p>  The recent legislation, therefore, also gives effect to provisions in the convention relating to offences against information systems and their data, and search and seizure powers in respect of such data.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the organisation with primary responsibility for dealing with cybercrime, has strongly welcomed this important legislation as a comprehensive weapon to tackle criminality involving computer systems and interference with such systems or their data.  Officials from my Department recently attended a meeting of the Cybercrime Convention Committee in Strasbourg and discussed with the Council of Europe Ireland's positive progress on ratification.</p>  <p>  The current Government legislation programme makes provision for the drafting of a new cybercrime Bill to give effect to those remaining elements of the convention not covered in national law.  This is to ensure that Ireland can ratify the convention and is evidence of the Government's clear commitment in this regard.  My intention is that this legislation will be in place to facilitate formal ratification of the convention as soon as it is possible.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-06-26a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1287" speakername="Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019062600004#B00700"><p>I was aware that the Minister would point to the Criminal Justice (Offences Relating to Information Systems) Act 2017.  That is related to what we more immediately think of as cybercrime.  As we have both outlined, however, the convention deals with issues such as online sexual exploitation.  The sexual abuse of children online is one of the most serious issues that any society can face.  The key elements of the Budapest convention that relate to this are production orders and preservation orders under Article 18.  It outlines that Article 18 is a domestic power relating to issues such as subscriber information which, as the Council of Europe has outlined, is often the most sought after data in criminal investigations due to the growth of cloud computing, remote data storage and so on.  This raises serious challenges for competent authorities seeking access to specified compute data.  It hinders criminal investigations and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is concerned by this.  We do not currently have powers in legislation with regard to Article 18.  This is one of the significant outstanding issues.  The Minister said that legislation will be brought forward soon.  When will it be brought forward?  Will it deal with the Article 18 transposition?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-06-26a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019062600004#B00800"><p>The legislation will enable us to ratify the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime.  It is important that any such ratification in legislative form will enable the Garda and other stakeholders to ensure the practical application.  I acknowledge, however, that there has been a delay in the ratification of the convention.  I am keen to focus on ensuring that the draft legislation is introduced at the earliest opportunity.  I refer, again, to the Criminal Justice (Offences Relating to Information Systems) Act 2017, which gives effect to key provisions of the convention.  This is now available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I also acknowledge other accompanying legislation such as the Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Bill 2017, which is a Private Members' Bill sponsored by Deputy Howlin.  All parties in the House are currently subscribing towards this Bill.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-06-26a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1287" speakername="Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019062600004#B00900"><p>That legislation is of value but it is related to specific criminal offences and new offences and it does not necessarily assist with the investigation of an offence.  Ratification of the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime is important to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, especially to the Garda national protective services bureau, the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, ISPCC and the State's special rapporteur on child protection.  Will the Minister engage with and meet An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na officers?  They will communicate to the Minister how urgently this is needed to ensure that criminal investigations can be carried out and be successful and that the people responsible for these heinous crimes can be fully investigated and brought before the law.</p>  <p>  Will the Minister commit to seeking a further information meeting with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on this specific issue?  He said: "...legislation will be in place to facilitate formal ratification of the convention as soon as it is possible".  What does "as soon as it is possible" mean?  Does it mean before the end of the year?  What timeline exactly is he talking about?  "As soon as it is possible" can mean any number of things.</p></speech>

Not only is it an area of some complexity, it is an area that is not specifically under the remit of one Department.</p><p>It also has an international dimension.  In that regard, Ireland is represented at the second protocol drafting plenary meetings, while we are in the process of implementing the legislation necessary to allow full ratification of the convention.  A further meeting will be held in the next few weeks and Ireland will be represented.  We are keen to ensure, when the second protocol to the Budapest Convention is finalised, that it will align as closely as possible with the issues raised by the Deputy such as protocols, notifications and production.  We want it to align with the EU e-evidence package.  The recent adoption of a mandate to allow the European Commission to participate in negotiations on behalf of the Union is welcome.  There is much work to be done.  It is a complex issue.  My priority is to see the publication and introduction of the legislation to allow for ratification as soon as possible.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, today I have to refer to what is happening in Longford where there has been serious criminal activity between two gangs in the past 12 months.  I ask the Minister for an update on what is being done to give confidence to people in Longford that the State is taking this criminal activity seriously.  It needs to be dealt with.  We need to ensure ordinary people in Longford are able to go about their lives without this threat hanging over them.</p></reply>

Criminal acts of this nature have no place in civilised society.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will not permit a small number of individuals to put local communities in fear for their safety.  I have been advised by the Garda Commissioner that a number of targeted operations have been put in place by local Garda management in Longford aimed at tackling and preventing the ongoing inter-family feuds in the Longford and Granard districts.  Under the current initiative, the feuds will be dealt with by district resources, with more serious incidents being addressed with support from the regional armed support unit.  I understand 15 arrests have taken place, with prosecutions having been initiated in a number of instances.  Investigation files on incidents in Longford will be submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions.</p>  <p>  The Deputy is aware that there has been substantial investment in the Garda budget by the Government which will allow the accelerated recruitment programme to continue in tandem with the deployment of new and leading edge technology to support front-line garda&iacute; in Longford in carrying out the work of delivering a visible, effective and responsive police service to communities in Longford and beyond.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is determined to bring the perpetrators of these acts to justice as soon as possible.  Both Garda management and my Department will continue to monitor the situation in Longford closely in the coming weeks.</p></speech>

It is, unfortunately, a product of the drugs industry and the fact that gangs that emanate from Dublin and that have spread into provincial Ireland are making substantial amounts of money from drugs.  That is an issue with which we have to deal.  Councillor Seamus Butler stated on a radio programme recently that we had to try to get their ill-gotten gains in order that people would realise there was no profit to be made or benefit to be gained from dealing in drugs.  It is welcome that the Criminal Assets Bureau is becoming more engaged in seizing assets worth smaller amounts in order that people will be aware that there is no profit to be made from engaging in drug-related activity.  I commend An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for its work and acknowledge that further resources have been put in place.  Unfortunately, it appears to be a trend that is moving from Drogheda to Longford.  We seem to be losing control of the dominance of the drugs industry.  What does the Government intend to do to ensure we will not be here in a month or six weeks' time discussing criminal activity in some other provincial town?</p></speech>

I have spoken directly to the cathaoirleach of Longford County Council, Mr Miche&aacute;l Carrigy, about the issue.  I condemn the disgraceful behaviour of a small number of thugs in the Longford area who have no regard for the rule of law.  The Garda Commissioner and his management team will continue to monitor the situation in Longford closely and allocate resources in the manner that best serves communities, including those in Longford.  I heard on the national airwaves a report that Longford town was within a ring of steel.  That does not make for pleasant listening.  The Garda management team in Longford will continue to tackle the issue to prevent ongoing inter-family feuds from taking hold in the community.  A number of arrests have been made.  I expect the rule of law to continue to take its course.</p></speech>

We need to put more resources into towns which are vulnerable such as Longford and Drogheda.  I note that that has now happened.  It is depressing that there is a ring of steel around Longford.  We should not let it get to that stage.  We need to intervene at an earlier stage.  I know that the Government and the Oireachtas cannot provide all of the solutions, but we need to face up to the fact that, unfortunately, the country is awash with drugs and that people are spending a lot of money which supports criminal activity.  The drugs industry is dealing in death.  We need a stronger education programme.  In a way, it is a little like online pornography.  We need to warn young people about the dangers of drugs.  We need to indicate to them the link between taking drugs and mental illness.  We spend much time warning people about tobacco and alcohol.  We need to warn them more about drugs.</p></speech>

I am advised by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that the National Family Support Network has concluded a number of evaluations of the drug related intimidation reporting programme and agreed to a number of actions.  The Government has made unprecedented resources available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to assist it to carry out its vital functions.  There is a specific operation in Longford and the surrounding region, Operation Stola, which has been put in place by local Garda management to address the ongoing inter-family feuds as a result of criminal behaviour being engaged in by a small number of people in the Longford and Granard districts.  I am keen to ensure the reputation of a fine provincial town, Longford, will not be damaged.  I am pleased to note that there have been a number of arrests and that files have been forwarded to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  I am confident that the small number of people who continue to break the law in Longford will be brought to justice.</p></speech>

Given the seriousness of the crime, there are significant sentences in place in the law for burglary offences.  I refer to the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001 which provides for sentences of up to 14 years' imprisonment.  Aggravated burglary - where a weapon may be used - is punishable by a sentence of up to life imprisonment.  Furthermore, the Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Act 2015 specifically addresses bail applications and targets repeat offenders by allowing for consecutive sentences where deemed to be appropriate.</p>  <p>  I know that the Deputy will be aware that, within parameters set by the Oireachtas, sentences imposed in any given case are a matter for the courts and that judges are at all times independent in their decisions, subject only to the Constitution and the law.  A matter that is fundamental in the law is that a court is required to impose a sentence which is proportionate, not only to the crime but also to the individual offender in identifying where in the sentencing range the particular case should lie and then applying any mitigating factor which may fall for consideration.  The vulnerability of a victim, including vulnerability by reason of age, may be regarded by the court as an aggravating circumstance.</p>  <p>  It is welcome that the Court of Appeal has set down sentencing guidelines for burglary and robbery.  In this jurisprudence the court has stated that if a considerable number of aggravating factors are present, it raises the offence to the highest category which merits a sentence of between nine and 14 years, before mitigating factors are taken into account.</p>  <p>  I advise the House that the Judicial Council Bill 2017 which has recently been passed by the Seanad and which I expect to bring into the House next week will address the matter of sentencing guidelines more generally.  I welcome the initiative of Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire in that regard.</p></speech>

Did he get mixed up or did he get the answer to another answer?  What has gone wrong?

Every town and village in County Kerry is rife with drugs.  How are they getting in?  No one is being intercepted.  There are many piers in the area, including Blackwater pier, Tahilla pier, the Oysterbed Pier, Gleesk Pier, the White Strand, Westcove Pier, Derrynane, Kilmakilloge, the Cloonee Lough, Bear head and Cahermore.

The question that was allowed is the one on the Order Paper, notice of which would have been given to the Deputy in recent days.  The Garda Commissioner and his team across An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to give priority to communities in County Kerry and other parts of the country.  From my perspective, I am keen to ensure the Garda Commissioner and his team are sufficiently resourced.  That is why a total budget of &euro;1.76 billion has been provided for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for this year, which represents an increase of 6% on the initial allocation for 2018.  Specifically, I refer the Deputy to Operation Thor which is providing a swift return for the Government on the investment made.  It includes an overtime budget of almost &euro;100 million, as announced in budget 2018.</p></speech>

The Minister will agree with me that in order to come forward with proper responses to criminal activity, we need to have accurate information and evidence.  To a large extent, we are dependent on the Central Statistics Office to provide crime statistics.  It recently produced details of criminal activity and crimes reported in the last quarter.  Do the Department and the Minister have proposals to improve the method by which information on crime statistics is accumulated?  What is the level of the Minister's engagement with the Central Statistics Office on that important feature?</p></reply>

There were some welcome decreases in a number of crime categories, including homicide, the level of which was down by 14% compared to the level in quarter one of 2018, and burglary, the level of which showed a 10% decrease.  There was also a significant increase in the reporting of fraud and related offences, with 1,500 additional incidents reported when compared to quarter one of 2018.  I welcome the increased reporting of crime and the fraud figures, in particular, which reflect the significant step-up in policing activity with respect to these offences.  While I also welcome the increase in the reporting of sexual offences, the continued upward trend of these offences is a concern.  As the Deputy will be aware, the Government has adopted a number of measures to combat sexual offences and support the victims of these crimes.  They include legislative steps, the roll-out of the Garda divisional protective services units and public information campaigns.  This is an area that is kept under review.</p><p>As outlined to the Deputy last week, the CSO's official crime figures remain &ldquo;under reservation&rdquo;.  This is by no means unique to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and similar issues have been reported in other jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom, Australia, the United State of America and Denmark.  However, it is clear that progress is being made through the joint efforts of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the CSO to improve the quality of the crime statistics.  In December last the CSO published a third review of the quality of recorded crime statistics based on data recorded on the PULSE database system for crimes reported to the Garda in 2017.  The review concluded, <i>inter alia</i>, that clear improvements had been made in the manner in which criminal incidents were being recorded on the PULSE system.  While this is encouraging, it is also clear that there is more work to be done in this area.  My Department, in conjunction with the Policing Authority, will continue to monitor the progress of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to ensure the national crime statistics are returned to the highest standard.</p></speech>

Without it, we cannot formulate proper policy responses.</p>  <p>  The Minister mentioned the crime statistics for the first quarter of 2019.  In many respects, they reveal the point I wish to make.  For example, the increase of 10% in sexual offences is a matter about which I am extremely concerned.  Each recent CSO quarterly crime statistics publication has shown an increase in sexual offences.  That is either due to the fact that people are becoming more confident about reporting sexual offences or, alternatively, it could be due to the fact that there has been an increase in sexual offences.  The latter would not surprise me because the prevalence of pornography on the Internet, which we discussed earlier, must be having some impact on young men.  We need to try to engage more with the CSO to ensure it can try to identify more accurately the cause of these trends in reported crime.  I do not know whether the Minister has any proposals in that regard on a higher level.</p></speech>

I share his concern regarding sexual offences.  He also referred to the steps being taken to improve the quality of crime data.  On the latter point, I wish to assure the Deputy that I and officials in my Department, in conjunction with the Policing Authority, will continue to monitor the progress of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in ensuring that the information published and our national statistics are returned to the highest standards.</p>  <p>  On sexual offences, I wish to advise the Deputy that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to improve its specialist services in this regard.  I acknowledge the importance of the roll-out of the divisional protective services units, nine of which have been established.  The plan and target is that there will be a divisional protective services unit in all divisions by the end of the year.</p></speech>

Many people who report them are very satisfied with the response they get from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  However, the point I was making was slightly different.  For instance, on knife crime, we know that some 2,000 knives were seized in 2018, compared with 1,600 in 2017, but we do not know the extent to which knives are used in crimes or criminal activity.  We need to try to identify how we want to expand the role of the CSO and formulate our statistical procurement process in order that we can get more useful information.  We will again find ourselves in a situation where there will be another increase, possibly in sexual offences.  At some stage, we will have to identify the reason for this.  Unfortunately, we are operating in a vacuum at present as we do not know whether more people are becoming confident about reporting or there is a serious rise in the number of incidents.</p></speech>

The Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland and the Garda Inspectorate identified that the Garda has not always been entirely up to the mark in terms of the quality of data.  Data are very important in ensuring a proper response to crime.</p>  <p>  There are two issues which I wish to specifically flag.  One of the main issues that led to the statistics being published under reservation was the review into homicides in the period from 2003 to 2016.  What is the status of that review?</p>  <p>  There is an issue that may have come to the attention of the Minister and which follows on from a previous question I asked.  The Minister stated that 10,024 arrests were made under Operation Thor between November 2015 and 7 May of this year.  That represents an average of eight arrests every day over the past three and a half years or one every three hours.  Operation Thor is important, but that figure seems a bit high.</p></speech>

I have no reason to question the accuracy of the figures from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at this time.  Neither I nor my Department have any role in the compilation of the figures, but I have no reason to question them.  If the Deputy has any further evidence in that regard, I would be happy to hear it.</p>  <p>  Deputy O'Callaghan made two points.  On knife crime, last November, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Analysis Service conducted analysis on PULSE data which disclosed no significant statistical increase in crimes involving the use of a knife.  However, I acknowledge this is a serious issue.  The working group will continue to monitor the prevalence and frequency of individuals carrying knives or knife-like instruments on their person, in addition to devising a strategy to tackle assaults involving the use of knives.</p>  <p>  On sexual offences, I broadly share the views of the Deputy.  He will be aware that I recently launched a major national awareness campaign on sexual harassment and sexual violence under the theme "No excuses".  I agree that there is a considerable amount of work to be done - and I acknowledge the work that is under way - to address what is a societal attitude towards sexual abuse.  We need to ensure that there also is a criminal justice response in terms of clamping down on offending and reoffending.</p></speech>

It is an ongoing trend which is having a big impact on people and their property and it requires an additional response.  Unfortunately, that is not what it is getting.  Rather, resources are being diverted away from it.</p></reply>

I am informed by the Commissioner that Togher and Anglesea Street districts are part of the Cork city division, with a Garda strength totalling 703 as of 31 May 2019.  In addition, there are 35 Garda Reserve members and 91 Garda staff attached to the division.</p>  <p>  Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, almost 2,800 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, of whom 69 were assigned to the Cork city division, with 26 and 15 assigned to Anglesea Street and Togher districts, respectively.</p>  <p>  The crime statistics for the first quarter of 2019 were published last Monday by the CSO.  To be of assistance to the Deputy, I will ask the CSO to make available up-to-date crime statistics for the Cork region.  However, I can inform the Deputy that the statistics on theft and burglary offences are more encouraging, with a welcome fall in rates of 2.6% and 10.3%, respectively.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, last year the number of garda&iacute; reached more than 14,000 for the first time since 2011.  The Government has further increased the budget for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to &euro;1.76 billion this year and the Commissioner plans to recruit a total of 600 trainee garda&iacute; and 600 Garda staff this year.  As we reach the end of the first half of 2019, I understand this is on target to be achieved.  This will facilitate the redeployment of a further 500 fully-trained garda&iacute; from administrative duties to front-line policing, which is the principal role and function of a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Ongoing recruitment is providing the resources needed to deliver a visible and effective policing service to communities in the Cork city region.</p></speech>

I have looked them up.  For the first 165 days of this year, there have been 210 burglaries, not to mind attempted burglaries or thefts from cars.  That amounts to one per day.  The Minister has instanced the number of garda&iacute; who have passed out.  Cork got 69 of these, which is 2.4%.  The population covered by the Cork city division must be approximately 8% to 12% of the national population but 2.4% is the figure Cork has got in recent years.  That clearly does not match up to what is going on.  This area has been neglected in recent years in terms of Garda resources.  This issue has been going on for a long time.  Places including Carrigaline, Ballincollig, Lehenaghmore, Glanmire and Carrigtwohill have been hit hard by this.  The livelihoods of people are being threatened and people are having valuable property stolen.  People are having their own sense of security in their homes undermined by this.  Yet, the response is only 2.4% of the garda&iacute; who have passed out in recent years.</p></speech>

The local Garda management in the Cork region keep all new and emerging crime trends under constant review.</p>  <p>  I refer the Deputy to the impact of Operation Thor.  Since November 2015 I am informed there have been in excess of 200,000 targeted checkpoints and over 350,000 crime prevention patrols throughout the country.  Theft offences are down, as are burglary offences, with almost 3,752 fewer incidents of theft and burglary offences for the year ending March 2019.  We should continue to assess the impact of Operation Thor, which is assisting communities throughout the country including those in the Cork area.</p></speech>

It is up 10% with one burglary every day and more besides.</p>  <p>  The Minister may or may not be aware of it, but the T&aacute;naiste came out with a statement some weeks ago and said that the southern divisions would get 50 extra garda&iacute;.  It turns out not only are we not getting the extra allocation but we are not getting the ten that were promised either.  They have now been diverted elsewhere.  We have got 2.4% of the garda&iacute; who have come out of Templemore in recent years.  Cork is being neglected.  There is no question about that.  Given the size and growth of the population it is simply not good enough.  The Garda locally does not have the resources to properly patrol its areas or tackle emerging crimes.  That is simply a fact.</p>  <p>  In Britain there are often issues following thefts and burglaries in cases where valuable property is stolen.  Most of the time the property cannot be returned.  Has the Minister examined the national mobile property register in Britain to see if a similar facility can be put in place here?  That would enable people to be reunited with their property.</p></speech>

I have data in respect of resources not only in terms of numbers but also in terms of vehicles and other equipment.  I wish to assure the Deputy that the Garda Commissioner keeps the situation under review on a constant basis in Cork.  Indeed, according to the Garda, Togher and Anglesea Street districts have benefitted from assignments since the Garda College reopened in September 2014.  The ongoing recruitment of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to provide additional policing hours in Cork city and throughout the country.</p></speech>

It is a fine town with a fine community, although lacking in industry since the Avon Arlington factory closed down.  The concern here relates to the East End Hotel.  It is the only hotel in Portarlington.  Recently, there have been rumours - nothing has been verified - that it has been turned into a direct provision centre.  The people from Portarlington are not against that but there are concerns that there has been no consultation and they need clarity on the situation.</p></reply>

As of 16 June 2019, a total of 817 applicants were staying in 25 emergency centres.</p>  <p>  The locations being used for the provision of emergency accommodation have been selected by means of a call for expressions of interest from hotels and guest houses advertised in the national press.</p>  <p>  I wish to confirm that the hotel in question is being used for emergency accommodation and is not a direct provision centre.  My Department is working to identify additional capacity within its accommodation portfolio in order that the use of emergency accommodation will be reduced and ended, if possible, by the end of this year.</p>  <p>  As part of the regional procurement process that RIA is rolling out in 2019, a competition for the mid-east region, which covers counties Kildare, Louth, Meath and Wicklow, will be advertised in the third quarter of this year seeking the provision of accommodation and ancillary services for persons seeking international protection.

That is appreciated.  The issue remains about the lack of consultation, including consultation with local general practitioners, GPs, and local schools on the extra supports and resources that may be needed.  I would appreciate if the Minister of State could give me the date from which the emergency accommodation started operating.  How long the contract is for?  How long does the Minister of State expect the hotel to be used by the Department?</p>  <p>  I accept what the Minister of State has said about a competition for plans for a new direct provision centre in the mid-east area.  However, the mid-east does not include County Laois.  It covers Kildare, Wicklow and Meath, as the Minister of State is aware.  Will there be another competition within the midlands region?

Emergency accommodation is sourced on an ongoing emergency basis, meaning it is not possible to offer prior engagement with communities, unfortunately.  Four regions are currently under assessment by the Department in conjunction with the Office of Government Procurement.  These regions include the south east, the midlands, the mid-west and the south west.  Once completed, four more competitions are due to be advertised this year in the west, mid-east, Dublin and Border regions.

I have not received that information from the Minister of State.  I would like to have that.  I would appreciate it.  I accept that it is emergency accommodation but obviously it does not simply happen overnight.  There is a period or a gap when consultation could be carried out with local GPs and schools to discuss supports that may be needed.  As I said, people from Portarlington are not against supporting people in their absolute hour of need but it is the apparent secrecy with which this was carried out that has been the greatest source of problems.  Certainly, I would appreciate if the Minister of State would contact me with information on those specific dates.</p></speech>

We are working hard to assist the more than 700 people who have status to move out of the accommodation centres, which will free up those beds.  I do not have the date on which this started but it is done on an emergency basis.  The RIA contracts beds as they become necessary and as the demand arises.  It is demand-led and, unfortunately, that is the position we are in.</p></speech>

It recorded that the use of cocaine and crack cocaine is increasing faster in Ireland than in most European countries, and that cocaine has become purer and more plentiful due to what is referred to as the "Uberisation" of the trade.  What is the Government's response to dealing with this increase in use of cocaine?  How does it intend to deal with the fact that social media and iPhones seem to be used for the purpose of advancing this trade?</p></reply>

The expansion of drug markets to the online environment, including via social media, is proving challenging for law enforcement worldwide, as the Internet and the darknet facilitate the movement of drugs, money and information across global borders.  I understand that international experience is that when a website selling illicit substances is taken down, it will almost immediately be replaced by another active site.</p>  <p>  I am sure the Deputy will agree that interagency and international collaboration are, therefore, critical in disrupting online markets.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na liaises with Revenue, the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, and its European and international counterparts to comprehensively disrupt trading activity and online markets at the earliest opportunity.  However, we have to accept that prosecutions for drug-related cybercrime are by their nature difficult.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has adopted a multidisciplinary approach to tackling drug-related cybercrime via improved control, risk management and profiling to detect, investigate and prosecute the persons involved.  The Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau leads in tackling all forms of drug trafficking and the supply of illicit drugs in Ireland, including monitoring and tackling the sale of drugs online.  Garda&iacute; from the bureau participate in various European projects such as the European multidisciplinary platform against criminal threats, which is co-ordinated through Europol and the Council of Europe's Pompidou working group on drugs online.  This working group seeks to harmonise the approach to the investigation of cyber-enabled drug trafficking and serves as a point of contact for all appropriate partners, including engagement with the private sector.</p></speech>

They examined 30 European countries and recorded that more people in Ireland had used cocaine in the past 12 months than in any other country apart from the United Kingdom and Spain.  That is a worrying development.  The report also indicates that the trade in cocaine has changed and has become, in a way, similar to trade in other products on the Internet.  It recorded that the use of social media and technology had assisted the sale of cocaine and advanced the cocaine trade.  Providers of the illegal drug - drug pushers - were able to provide added service, namely that they would deliver the cocaine to where the users are.  This needs to be approached this in two ways.  First, the Government needs to get our messaging right.  People need to be informed of the dangers of cocaine and associated with it.  They also need to be informed of the link between cocaine use and the murder of people in this country.</p></speech>

That is why I referred to the engagement on the part of the Garda with a range of other agencies on the international stage, seeking to ensure that we adopt international best practice here and that the Garda is engaged in a way that ensures a rapid exchange of information and best practice to combat the sale and trafficking of drugs online, including the use of postal express courier services, emerging techniques and dealing with the engagement on the darknet.</p>  <p>  As well as European engagement, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also liaises with the United States Drug Enforcement Administration.  Ireland is also represented at the international drug enforcement conference, which is attended by more than 100 countries annually.  It is important that we build these relationships from a criminal justice perspective and from a national point of view.  We will continue to advise on the dangers of engaging in the use of illegal drugs, in particular cocaine, and on the fact that those who are engaged in its consumption are responsible for many of the gangland, organised crime and drug-related deaths in our communities.</p></speech>

The Government and society needs to provide more information to the public about the link between cocaine use and criminal activity.  We see how people respond to information when it is given to them.  Many people now realise the risks associated with the use of plastic and, because of that, they are changing their practices.  They recognise that there is a threat to the planet because of the use of plastic.  If we can apprise people of the dangers associated with the use of cocaine and the fact that by using it, they are supporting and indirectly funding the killing of people in other parts of the city, they will respond.  The problem is that nobody is putting that message forward.  We do not read about campaigns on the Internet linking the usage of cocaine to criminal activity or the killing of other people.  The responsibility has to rest with Government.  An information campaign should be run.  Ministers spend their time in government giving information to people about matters that are dangerous to them.  The public should be better informed about the dangers associated with taking drugs and the link to criminal activity.</p></speech>

I refer, for example, to Ireland's national drugs strategy, Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery: A health-led response to drug and alcohol use.  This advises the public in respect of the dangers of cocaine use.  I refer also to the criminal justice response, which is to ensure those convicted of trafficking or promoting the sale of illicit drugs are brought to justice.  Last year, for example, the Criminal Assets Bureau successfully seized assets from an individual involved in drug trafficking in a number of jurisdictions.  Just yesterday, the annual report of the Criminal Assets Bureau was published and it highlighted ongoing activity to ensure the scourge of drugs within our society is stamped out.</p></speech>

Under the terms of the scheme, the tribunal is entirely independent in the matter of individual decisions on applications for compensation.  The Deputy will be aware that because of the manner in which cases have been recorded, in particular applications which are received but not actively pursued by the applicant, it has not been possible to date to provide the number of active cases that remain unsettled by the tribunal.  To address the issue, I have requested an assessment of the caseload of the tribunal, which I am informed will be submitted soon.  I will be happy to provide the Deputy with a further update at that point.  Nevertheless, my expectation is that the assessment will include short to medium-term recommendations designed to improve the processing time.</p>  <p>  I invite the Deputy to accept that many of these cases are complex and will take considerable time to conclude.  Notwithstanding that, I expect that steps can be taken to increase the processing time of more straightforward cases.  In addition to these short-to-medium-term measures, the Law Reform Commission, LRC, has included a review of the compensation scheme as one of the projects in its forthcoming work programme, which I welcome as an opportunity to examine in some detail the long established scheme for providing compensation to people who suffer injury as a result of criminal activity.</p></speech>

In 2015, for example, there were 217 applications, for which 159 payments were made.  On the other hand, last year, only three years later, there were 174 applications but only 18 of them were resolved, while in 2017, payments were made in only 31 cases.  All of a sudden a bottleneck has been hit, which is out of kilter with the previous years.  Over all the years of the tribunal, significantly more applications than payments have been made.  My understanding is there have been probably hundreds of cases in the system for years and years.  The review needs to determine what steps can be taken but some of the cases need to be dealt with quickly because the applicants have waited a long time.</p></speech>

The level of resources allocated to the tribunal, similar to any other line of the justice Vote, is determined having regard to the overall budgetary context, although I have been in a position to maintain the current funding of &euro;4 million for a number of years.  Moreover, an increased allocation of &euro;2.4 million was provided as part of a Supplementary Estimate in 2018.</p>  <p>  While I express concern about the delay, the tribunal is entirely independent in the making of individual decisions on applications for compensation.  It would be imprudent of me to comment on any individual case but, in general, the issue of a delay is of concern to me, which is why I indicated there will be an assessment.</p></speech>

He correctly indicated that for most of the recent years, the allocation was &euro;4 million, and that there was an addition of more than &euro;2 million last year, bringing the allocation to &euro;6.5 million.  That &euro;6.5 million, however, addressed payments to only 18 cases.  I am dealing with a victim, and I will not name her although she is not from my constituency.  The person who committed the crime against her has been through the courts but she must still go through the tribunal.  Her testimony to me is that the process equates to reliving constantly the vicious attack she suffered.  People such as her want closure.  She has been in the system for several years and is pleading that the matter be addressed more quickly than it has been.</p></speech>

In making decisions, tribunal members need to be satisfied in respect of a number of issues, such as ensuring that all supporting documentation has been provided, which will enable the tribunal to reach a decision on any application.  It may well be the case from time to time that further documentation is sought.  In addition, there may be circumstances where, owing to the nature of the serious injury involved, further ongoing medical issues have to be determined, reports may have to be provided, a medical condition may have to be addressed, or there may be issues the treating consultant is in a position to address with an updated medical report.</p>  <p>  Nevertheless, I accept the Deputy's overall point, namely, that the delays require analysis.

The Inspector of Prisons, Ms Patricia Gilheaney, was explicit in saying she believed that her office is severely under-resourced and went as far as to say it is not fit for purpose.  That is a serious statement and I look forward to the Minister's response.</p></reply>

I strongly support the office and recently met the inspector with my officials to discuss a range of issues relating to her office, including resources.  Following her appointment in May 2018, the inspector contracted consultants to carry out a review of the functions and arrangements of the office.  The report set out an optimal new enhanced structure for her office, its legal powers, the resources needed and other related and important issues.</p>  <p>  On additional resources this year, funding has been provided by my Department to contract external expertise to enable the office to review cases of deaths in prisons, and a process is under way to appoint a new office manager.  My Department also recently approved the awarding of a contract, following a tender competition, in respect of the development of an inspection framework and a strategic plan for the office.  The additional resource requirements set out in the consultants' report could not be considered in the context of spending this year as the Estimates process had been completed.  The inspector, however, recently submitted a request for resources, based on the report's recommendations.  The request is being analysed and considered in the context of the 2020 Estimates process. </p>  <p>  I assure the Deputy that my Department will continue to work constructively with the Inspector of Prisons to ensure the further development and enhancement of her resources and the capacity of the office. </p></speech>

I have looked them up.  I produced a policy paper on police in Cork and I would be happy to give the Minister a copy of it later.</p>  <p>  This is of huge concern.  The Minister is identifying that additional resources may be considered for the next budget and if that is the case it is welcome.  If there has only been one prison inspection report in the last five years and none in five jails over the last ten years there must surely be some element of concern that standards in these prisons might not be up to scratch, given the lack of inspections.</p>  <p>  I refer to the report carried out by the Inspector of Prisons on surveillance issues in prisons.  Where does that report stand and when will we heard more about it?</p></speech>

I represent the constituency of Laois-Offaly and I live in Portlaoise so I am very aware of the existence of two major prisons within that town.  I am keen to ensure the Office of the Inspector of Prisons is adequately resourced in order to allow her to perform her duties in respect of current inspections of prisons.  It must be borne in mind that the Office of the Inspector of Prisons is a statutory body, provided for under the Prisons Act 2007, which is independent of me both in the recommendations it makes and in the manner in which it organises its work within the allocated resources.  The Inspector of Prisons is charged with carrying out regular inspections of prisons.  In terms of resources, five staff members are currently assigned to that office and the current budget is just under &euro;500,000.  I assure the Deputy and the House that my Department continues to support the Inspector of Prisons in the performance of her functions.  I have met her recently and my officials meet her on an ongoing basis.  I acknowledge the receipt of a recent submission which will form the basis of my activities in the context of my relationship with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the forthcoming budget.</p></speech>

The resources are not adequate, inspections are not happening and that raises risks.</p>  <p>  I asked when we would hear more about a particular report into surveillance in the Prison Service.  I take this opportunity to emphasise the need for that report in the context of the broader issue of places of detention and failure to inspect them.  I again express the need for the Minister to ratify the UN's Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture.  It was signed in 2007 and has not been ratified in an acceptable timeframe either in relation to this or in a much broader sense of places of detention.</p></speech>

The embassies, which are under the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, process certain visa applications under delegated sanction from my Department.  The processing times for visa decisions are published on the visa pages of each visa office and embassy website.  As of last week, 18 June 2019, the average time taken to process an employment visa received in either the INIS visa offices in Dublin or overseas was three weeks.  The processing time in each location is determined by a number of factors, such as the volume and complexity of applications, individual circumstances, peak application periods, seasonal factors and the resources available.  While every effort is made to process applications as quickly as possible, processing times will inevitably vary as a result.  Notwithstanding that the visa service is currently experiencing an increase in the number of visa applications across most categories, processing times are on a par in many cases and there have been significant improvements compared to the corresponding time last year.  A number of measures have been put in place to deal with what is a significantly increased demand for visas on the part of people wishing to come to Ireland, including the assignment of additional staff to process applications and the streamlining of visa processes where possible.  I acknowledge that my colleague, the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, also has a role and function in respect of the processing of applications for work permits.</p></speech>

If it is not fully correct, it will be refused and he or she will have to start again.  When the visa waiting time is added in, we are talking about quite considerable lengths of time.  I cannot understand why the two processes cannot run in parallel so that when a person receives a work permit their visa application would be assessed and become available at the same time.  It is ridiculous that people who have gotten their work permits have to go back and get a visa.  The Minister indicated that in some cases it does run in parallel and the Minister has delegated sanction.  Can he explain what percentage of work permit cases are processed on that basis?</p></speech>

In the processing of visa applications through my Department, we must consider a broader range of issues dealing with immigration.  I invite the Deputy to agree with me that there are a number of concerns here, the central concern being, as with all visa services worldwide, the need to strike an appropriate balance between protecting the country's vital national interests by maintaining an effective immigration regime, while at the same time endeavouring to facilitate travel for those who meet the criteria.  Each visa application is therefore decided on its own merits, on a case-by-case basis, taking all factors into account.</p></speech>

Nobody is arguing with that.  What I am curious about is why everything has to work linearly rather than in parallel and why visa applications cannot be processed simultaneously to the applications being processed in the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation so that when one is available the other is too.  Visas might have to be issued subject to work permits, but so be it.  It seems to me that by doing everything sequentially rather than in parallel, we are adding to the length of time though not to the thoroughness of the investigation.  Would consideration be given to running the two processes as one parallel process between the two Departments, which is co-ordinated at the one time?</p></speech>

I assure him that greater consideration will be given to streamlining the process, procedures and practices.  For example, earlier this year, new arrangements were set in place to enable spouses of critical skills permit holders to gain immediate access to the workplace on arrival.

This is against the background of the documents released under a freedom of information request to <i>TheJournal.ie</i>, which reveal an almost cavalier approach to the ballooning costs of the project on a monthly basis.  The Eir submission points out that in April 2017, for example, &euro;787 million was the KPMG estimate of the subsidy that would be required, and that is after 300,000 customers had been taken out of the intervention area.</p><p>The Eir submission raises a number of important issues and deserves analysis.  Fundamentally, it is no secret that Eir says it could complete the national broadband plan project based on its approach, and with a roll-out to the extra 300,000 customers, for less than &euro;1 billion.  The Government is committed to &euro;3 billion.  This is in the context of documents that were revealed about a meeting held on 27 September last year.  The Taoiseach was too dismissive of Eir's submission yesterday and he made comments that Eir has rejected, in that Eir would not pass houses and would cover the maintenance use, which is the opposite of what the Taoiseach said yesterday.</p><p>On 27 September last year, it was revealed that the cost went up by &euro;300 million in one month.  The Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform said at that meeting that there was cause to pause and review the project.  That was dismissed by the Minister, Deputy Naughten.  We subsequently learned of the meetings between the Minister and David McCourt of Granahan McCourt, which led to Deputy Naughten's resignation.  The trajectory of the project did not change after the Minister's resignation, despite what we were told.  I think the Minister got too close to the Granahan McCourt consortium; the political and electoral imperative took over and the issue of cost in the Government's requirements went out the window.</p><p>Given that the costs have ballooned even from the estimates of 2017, never mind the original estimate of &euro;500-odd million, the Taoiseach has been too dismissive of those who have raised legitimate questions about this and of yesterday's Eir submission, which deserves further analysis.  Alternatives should be considered.</p><p>The Taoiseach might have felt the need to make a big political announcement before the local elections but I return to the words of the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, Mr. Robert Watt, who said there was cause to pause and review.  I ask the Government to do that now.</p></speech>

That is an objective that all of us in this House share.</p>  <p>  We should not forget that Eir took part in the process and made an initial bid for &euro;2.7 billion, which was higher than the initial bid from Granahan McCourt, and then pulled out of the process, citing the fact that the risks were too high and the level of oversight too onerous, and refusing to make any commitment around the equity investment it would make.  While the Deputy has been critical that the equity investment made by Granahan McCourt is too low, Eir was unwilling to commit to any equity investment whatsoever.  </p>  <p>  It is, therefore, a big turnaround that the company is now saying that it can do the project for &euro;1 billion.  If that is the case then I am all ears and we must listen to it.  This morning, the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment issued a letter to Eir, seeking further details and clarification about what it has said.  We need to know whether this offer is real and stacks up, and what kind of delay would be imposed on people in rural Ireland waiting for broadband if we went back to a new procurement process. Everyone understands that neither a private nor a State company can just be given a contract; there would have to be a new procurement process.  We also need to know that anything done would be within state aid rules and EU procurement law.  A letter was issued today by the Department to Eir seeking that information.</p>  <p>  Having listened to the contributions at yesterday's committee meeting, I think that as many questions were raised as answers were given.  One thing we want to find out is how there can be such a difference between the &euro;2.7 billion bid from Eir and this new offer of &euro;1 billion.  My concern, and that of the Department, is that rather than Eir making up the difference, a big part of it would be met by imposing higher connection charges and fees on those 500,000 homes, farms and businesses in rural areas than are imposed on those in urban Ireland.  That would be a serious problem for us and would go against the original objectives I mentioned at the start of my reply.</p></speech>

As the local elections are over, there might be a calmer climate in which to do that properly.  The health service is at a standstill and while I suggest that &euro;3 million or &euro;4 million could have prevented today's strike, &euro;3 billion was cavalierly announced for this project, which was much more than any of the estimates.</p>  <p>  I am struck by the minutes of those meetings.  It was casually reported at the meeting in September that the cost had gone up by &euro;300 million from the previous month.  No one batted an eyelid, including the Taoiseach, who was at the meeting.  The then Minister, Deputy Naughten, said that we should plough ahead.  He, of course, had had all sorts of dinners with Granahan McCourt, which I worry about.  I am not casting any aspersions, good, bad or indifferent; that might have been a political and electoral imperative.  However, the former Minister got too close to the remaining bidder.  That does not look good in respect of public procurement and so on, and the taxpayer is now caught for &euro;3 billion.  Minutes of a meeting on 2 May 2018 show that other alternatives were looked at and no definitive conclusion was reached.  That is also revealing and contrary to what we were originally told.</p>  <p>  If what the Taoiseach is saying is the case, I welcome the fact that the Government is prepared to look at this to try to deliver the same objective but in a much more cost-effective way for the taxpayer.</p></speech>

The truth and hurt this afternoon are that 10,000 support staff in the health service are on strike at 38 hospitals and facilities across the State.  They are engaged in industrial action because of the failures of the Government.  This is a mess entirely of its making and that truth, I hope, rings home at some level with the Taoiseach.</p>  <p>  I took the opportunity this morning to speak with workers at Beaumont, the Mater and the Rotunda hospitals.  I spoke with them to extend the solidarity of Sinn F&eacute;in and the considerable public support they enjoy for their just cause.  I hope this is the only morning I will have to do the rounds of hospitals, and that staff are forced onto the picket line.</p>  <p>  The strike has been a long time coming.  The Taoiseach has known since 2015, when the job evaluation scheme was resumed and agreed, that there was a need to pay workers fairly and that this liability was going to arise at some stage, yet he made precisely no effort and no plan was put in place to pay the staff involved what they are due.  The Taoiseach should know that none of the workers wants to be out on strike.  The people to whom I spoke are healthcare assistants, maternity care assistants, porters, catering staff and chefs.  They want to do what they do best; they want to be at work, caring for and supporting patients.  They are upset and offended because they believe their work is being disrespected and that somehow the Government regards them as menial staff, carrying out menial and unimportant roles.  It is important to say that the health service simply cannot function without these workers, and patients cannot be cared for in the way they must be.</p>  <p>  They feel they have been let down and believe that their work is undervalued.  They are correct in that analysis.  The job evaluation scheme also chimes with their analysis because it found that workers are being underpaid for the skills level they bring to their jobs and for the duties they carry out.  Dr. Paud O'Regan, a consultant at South Tipperary General Hospital, said this morning that the industrial action is having a major and almost catastrophic effect on services.  I can only imagine what the consequences will be for workers and patients if the Government drives this dispute to further industrial action next week.  Despite the Taoiseach's effort to portray workers and their union as unreasonable, that is not the case.  It should be borne in mind that the HSE accepted the finding of the job evaluation and requested the money necessary to pay these workers what they deserve but the Government has refused to live up to its side of the bargain.  The Taoiseach has broken his word and now we have a messy and unnecessary strike.  </p>  <p>  The workers trusted in the process but the Taoiseach has done nothing.  He made a derisory, non-offer to the workers last week which was, of course, rejected and here we are.  I ask the Taoiseach to act now, keep his word and end this messy and unnecessary industrial action by simply sticking to those things that he has agreed.</p></speech>

These are low-paid workers and caterers and porters can be contrasted with members of the Judiciary and the lot of judges in Irish society and the regard in which they are held.  These workers are wounded by this and believe the Taoiseach has let them down.</p>  <p>  They have made clear that patients are still being cared for in our hospitals, as I am sure the Taoiseach knows, and that catering workers, healthcare assistants and others are making sure that is the case.  Of course, this unnecessary dispute is having an effect on patients.  If he really cares about patients and values the workers, the Taoiseach will move to resolve the dispute.</p></speech>

He speaks about photo opportunities in order to divert attention from the real experiences of those who were on the picket line this morning.  I spoke to some of them and witnessed their righteous anger and frustration at the Government's approach to their dispute.  On the picket line in Tallaght this morning Michelle told me about the job she did as a healthcare assistant and how different it was from the job she had started in 18 years ago.  She said they now had so many responsibilities and that they did practically everything apart from giving medication.  Why is that?  It did not just happen by accident.  It is because they are the fillers for the cracks in a health service that has suffered from chronic under-investment for decades under Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il.  Ian is a porter at Tallaght hospital where he has been from the very day it opened.  He has been a porter since 1996.  He told me that his dad was a porter and able to afford to raise a family and buy a house on the wage a porter then earned.  In contrast, he is on the top tier of porter wages, gross pay of &euro;33,000.  He survives only by working 12-hour overtime shifts at the weekend.  He is facing eviction from his apartment in Exchange Hall.</p>  <p>  The story of being underpaid and overworked is very common across the health service.  These are the workers who many people do not think of first when they think of those on the front line in the health service, but clearly they are essential to anything that happens.  They include chefs, catering assistants, porters, healthcare assistants, technicians, laboratory assistants and so on.  They are being treated disgracefully by the Government because it refuses to pay them what they are owed.  The restarting of the job evaluation scheme was included in the Public Service Stability Agreement in order to get the agreement passed.  The fact that the Government is trying to shirk its responsibilities under the agreement underlines how partnership was and is a process designed to bind the hands of workers and keep improvements in wages and conditions to a minimum.</p>  <p>  All of the talk about going to the Labour Court is an absolute diversion, as the workers are well aware.  The Government accepts the finding of the 2017 evaluation and that the workers are not being paid what they deserve, yet it refuses to pay them.  The cost of paying them is approximately &euro;16 million and the workers are not slow in pointing out that the Government has overseen the cost of the national children's hospital more than double to &euro;1.7 billion and the national broadband plan treble from &euro;1 billion to &euro;3 billion.  As there is no problem in paying any of them, what is the difference?  Is it because the workers are seeking millions of euro rather than billions of euro?  Should they slap on an extra zero at the end in order that the Government could find the money?  Is it more likely that the reason is private companies will make a killing from those projects and that those who are on strike today are mere workers.  They are low paid workers, not like the high paid judges, to whom the Government can agree to pay an increase.  The workers in question get up very early in the morning and work to ensure the hospitals the Government has underfunded work as well as possible.  The Government must commit to paying them today and stop trying to delay and draw out matters.</p></speech>

Again, in the absence of a question, all I can do really is restate what I said, that the Government wants the strike to be resolved.  It was not necessary and the offer made was appropriate.  If it was considered that it was not appropriate and that the right place to resolve the dispute was the Labour Court.  We are willing to accept a binding determination from the Labour Court which is independent and the place where many other disputes have been resolved.  I suspect this dispute will be resolved there also.</p>  <p>  The dispute is about the timing and phasing in of a third pay increase for the support staff concerned.  Pay restoration is under way and complete for the vast majority of these staff.  Annual increments are being paid, after they had been stopped for a period.  There have also been special pay increases for recent entrants to allow them to catch up with the salary scales of persons recruited before the financial crisis.  As part of the public sector pay agreement, there is a 2.75% pay rise to be paid to all staff, the next part of which will be paid in September.  The Government has offered to begin implementing the further pay rise on top of the other pay rises from November.  That is an appropriate offer.  If it cannot be accepted, the matter could be resolved in the Labour Court where we are willing to accept a binding determination.</p></speech>

I will set out the logic of the workers, which is foolproof.  Does the Taoiseach accept the outcome of the job evaluation?  If he does, I presume he also accepts that the workers are being underpaid for the work they do.  If he accepts that the workers are being underpaid for the work they do, why does the Government not simply agree to pay them?  Why insist on delaying things by going to the Labour Court, or at least talking about going to the Labour Court?  Why not simply pay the workers?  How can the Government find the money to pay judges but not these low paid workers?  How can it find the money to pay for the national broadband plan but not these hard-working low paid workers?  How can it find the money to fund the national children's hospital hospital?</p>  <p>  I congratulate the workers on taking strike action because it is clear that without it, the Government would just continue to delay and drag its feet.  The strike action can force the Government to pay the workers what they are owed.  The nurses would have won more concessions if they had not cancelled their three-day strike action.  There is a lesson for the support workers looking to next week.  Unless there is a clear commitment from the Government to pay what is owed, they should go ahead with their action next week, demonstrate their power once more and force the Government to pay up.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-06-26a.157" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="12:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019062600014#M00600"><p>The answer to the Deputy's first question is "Yes".  The answer to the other questions is that the dispute is about timing and the implementation of the additional pay rises.  It must be done broadly within budget and we must bear in mind the consequent costs.  The Deputy has drawn equivalence with judges, for example, but that is a red herring.  I have already explained that public sector pay is being restored for the lowest paid first and that has been done.  The restoration will be extended to those on middle incomes earning up to &euro;70,000 by the end of next year.  For those who are high paid, like judges, the process is only starting and will not be completed until 2022 or 2023.</p>  <p>  The Deputy's attempt to create equivalence with the national children's hospital and the national broadband plan is also deeply misleading.  As the public sector pay bill is &euro;19 billion per year, we can think of how many children's hospitals or broadband plans could be paid for with that money.  We are spending multiples of the amounts set for the national broadband plan and the national children's hospital every year on public sector pay.  The increase in public sector pay this year alone amounts to &euro;400 million, which is multiples of the additional money we may need to find for the national children's hospital or the national broadband plan.  The creating of equivalence is bogus and misleading.</p></speech>

Most of Ireland's dark moments stemmed from 800 years of colonialism.  Nevertheless, there were some dark moments that we created and sustained after independence.  I specifically refer to the darkness of institutionalisation, mother and baby homes, the industrial schools and Magdalen laundries.  I will not get into the commission on mother and baby homes, except to say those who are formally recognised to have been in the homes were invited, with their representatives, to participate in a consultation process in 2017.  From that consultation process came the collaborative forum which was set up to support people in developing solutions to deal with issues of concern.  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, secured Government approval for a charter to mandate the work of the forum and review and bring forward recommendations in three areas.  One was information, identity and terminology, while another was health and well-being supports.  The third was memorialisation and personal narratives.</p><p>The language of the charter regarding how the forum would conduct its work was it would be "participant-centred", there would be "consensus" and "consistent communication and meaningful engagement", and it would "ensure the specific and separate needs of different groups are identified".  That was positive and promising language.  It was built around the premise of nothing about us without us and it seemed to indicate a new approach to looking at this area of institutionalisation.</p> <p> There was a selection process.  Nineteen members and a chairperson began meeting in July 2018.  There were five plenary meetings and 18 meetings of the sub-committees.  </p> <p> I know some of the members of the forum and, therefore, I know how difficult parts of the work was for them and how heartbreaking it was for them to relive that darkness in their lives but they gave 100% to the process.  One of them stated: "We worked our socks off and we delivered a thoughtful, high-quality and authentic report."</p> <p> The forum was also guided by a belief that its work, and the report, would be a significant contribution to the Government addressing all these issues.  They produced a 90-page report containing significant recommendations.  It was submitted to the Minister in mid-December 2018 but since then, it has sat on a shelf.  It has not been published, there has been no movement on it and no engagement with the forum.</p> <p> I have a number of questions.  First, is there a date for the next forum meeting?  Second, has the Minister decided on the new chair?  Third, what progress, if any, has been made on implementing the recommendations?  If those questions are not answered satisfactorily, the forum's work will have been in vain and it will have been only a talking shop with nothing meaningful coming from it.</p></speech>

Government also approved a series of measures and a comprehensive analysis of the recommendations by relevant Departments, with individuals Departments to revert by the end of June.  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs will co-ordinate responses and revert to Government.</p>  <p>  The Government agreed that a working group would be established by the Minister for Health to develop proposals for a package of practical help and well-being supports for former residents of these institutions.  That working group has been established and is due to report back to Government by September in advance of the Estimates process.</p>  <p>  Following the receipt of the collaborative forum's first report, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, signalled the opportunity to take some time to reflect upon the learning to date.  The forum also suggested revisiting these matters.  The Minister is currently examining how to best conduct a focused interim evaluation that involves the forum members.  Delivering its first report within six months was a significant achievement by the members and reflected a strong commitment and dedication to the task.  The Minister and Government very much values their contribution.</p>  <p>  The Minister is actively considering suitable appointments to the current vacancies of which there are many, including the chair.  She hopes to appoint a new chair very soon and to establish a board meeting shortly thereafter.</p></speech>

I cannot stress enough the extent of the engagement and how much the members of the forum brought to the entire process in a very able way.  One member described the feeling now that there was a deep sense of betrayal among the members because they were first told that the forum was independent of the mother and baby homes commission of investigation and that their report would be published regardless of the timing of the mother and baby homes final report.  When they asked for a legal adviser at the beginning of the process, they were told there was no need for one because they were the experts.  However, they are hearing now that the Attorney General has some problems with it but they are not being told in what areas.</p>  <p>  On another point, the Department of Education and Skills reacted by saying that the institutional history is too sensitive for primary schools but that was never recommended.  The members recommended it for second level schools.  </p>  <p>  There is something to be gained from what the Taoiseach's reply but we want the report published because that would be a tribute to the work the members have done.  These people have been hurt enough and the hurt continues when they are not listened to.</p></speech>

From my part and that of the Minister, Deputy Zappone, we feel that the establishment of the forum has added to this process.  The term the Deputy used is very apt - "nothing about us without us".  However, we need to bear in mind that Government committed to consider the recommendations but not to automatically implement all of them.  We are currently considering some and implementing others.</p>  <p>  On the publication of the report, much of that related to legal advice, which indicated that the report should not be published ahead of the commission's report, principally because there may be references in it that could cause the forum to be sued by other people.  We do not want to expose the members to that.  The legal advice in that space is that it has to be borne in mind that the report can prejudice the outcome of the commission's report.  We do not want to see people who joined a forum and wrote a report in good faith finding themselves being brought before the courts by people who believe they have been defamed or institutions saying that they were defamed by the report.  We would never ask somebody to be exposed to that again.</p></speech>

N&iacute; leor a r&aacute; gur pholaiteoir &eacute; Jackie Healy-Rae.  Bh&iacute; i bhfad n&iacute;os m&oacute; i gceist leis.  Ba cheann fhine polaiti&uacute;la &eacute;.  Rugadh agus tugadh &eacute; i dtimpeallacht na sl&eacute;ibhte agus labhair s&eacute; ar son mhuintir na sl&eacute;ibhte.  Sheas s&eacute; mar ionada&iacute; ar son an mhuintir sin go cumasach agus le misneach.  D&aacute; bharr, thug s&eacute; guth n&aacute;isi&uacute;nta di.

Bh&iacute; gr&aacute; m&oacute;r acu d&oacute; d&aacute; bharr.  Ba pholaiteoir cumasach thar na bearta &eacute; agus is cuimhin linn n&aacute;r chaill s&eacute; sna toghch&aacute;in riamh.  D'fh&aacute;g s&eacute; oidhreacht ollmh&oacute;r, a bheirt mhac ar lean siad &eacute; isteach sa D&aacute;il ina measc.  </p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il has made many mistakes over the years but they must be still kicking themselves for not nominating Jackie Healy-Rae to run for them in the 1997 general election.  Instead, he ran as an Independent and it marked the beginning of a remarkable political dynasty that continues today.</p>  <p>  I am grateful for this opportunity to pay tribute to our former Member, Jackie Healy-Rae.  Shortly after his election to the House in 1997 for Kerry South, he was interviewed by the distinguished RT&Eacute; broadcaster, Brian Farrell, who questioned him about who he represented.  Jackie's heartfelt and authentic response was, "I represent the plain people of Ireland".  When pressed about what that meant, Jackie responded with a line that has gone down in legend, "The people who eat their dinner in the middle of the day."</p><p>Some people were perhaps unable to see beyond the trademark tartan cap but that was their foolish mistake.  There was real political substance to Jackie Healy-Rae and he brought substantial benefits to the people of Kerry through his backing of the Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern's three-legged stool coalition between 1997 and 2002.  He secured similar terms during the Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party coalition between 2007 and 2011.  </p> <p> I hope his family will take it as a compliment from me when I say he had a real flair for publicity and for memorable expressions.  Coming from the beautiful surroundings of Kilgarvan and deriving the addendum to his name from his ancestral townland, Reacaisleach, Jackie Healy-Rae never lost an election, a winning trait that is clearly in the genes and has been passed down to his descendants.</p> <p> I will always fondly remember the few drinks I had with him after the Munster final in Kerry one year and his hospitality when I visited his pub in Kilgarvan as Minster for tourism.  It was a very late night and I am pleased he was able to get a late licence for the purpose so easily.</p> <p> He bore his final illness with great courage and fortitude and after his death in 2014, a poetic tribute was paid to him: he came from the mountains and he spoke for the people of the mountains.  Jackie Healy-Rae was not just a politician; he was a political chieftain.  He represented his people with courage and ability and gave them a national voice, for which they loved him.  </p> <p> In his later years, he was ably assisted by his sons, Michael and Danny, on Kerry County Council.  He loved to describe the relationship as three for the price of one.  Both Michael and Danny followed him into this House and continue to speak, and sometimes even shout, for the people of Kerry.  Today we also recognise their brothers, John and Denis, and sisters, Joan and Rosemary.  I also take the opportunity to pay tribute to their mother, Julie Healy-Rae, who passed away in 2015.</p> <p> I also offer our sympathies to Jackie's grandchildren, to Kathleen Cahill and her daughter and granddaughter, as well as Jackie's brothers and sisters and the wide circle of family, friends and supporters gathered here today.  Ar dheis l&aacute;mh D&eacute; go raibh a anam d&iacute;lis.</p></speech>

Ceolt&oacute;ir faoi leith ab ea &eacute; agus, gan amhras, bh&iacute; suim mh&oacute;r aige i gc&uacute;rsa&iacute; sp&oacute;irt.</p>  <p>It is my great privilege today to speak on behalf of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party in remembrance of a celebrated hard-working and most effective member of this House.  Jackie Healy-Rae was a politician, sportsman, musician, farmer, entrepreneur and much, much more.  He was an outstanding political organiser, manifested in his repeated successes as a director of elections for Fianna F&aacute;il in Kerry South for many years.  He was a by-election specialist and was instrumental, working with the late Neil Blaney in guiding the success of former Deputy, John O'Leary in a famous by-election in 1966.  Such was his success then, that he was invited to support and organise other by-elections across the country for the party, which, I understand, led to young Michael, our colleague, catching the electoral and political bug early in his life.</p>  <p>  That by-election lived long in political folklore, being responsible for the eventual construction of the bridge to Valentia Island and reflecting the great drive and organisational ability of Neil Blaney.  Jackie Healy-Rae in particular developed a real admiration for Neil Blaney and in the 1980s, would regularly call at Fianna F&aacute;il Ard-Fheiseanna for the return of "the best organiser in the western world".</p>  <p>  Jackie was a formidable election organiser himself.  He was successful in being elected to Kerry County Council in 1974 and in every subsequent election since until the end of the dual mandate.  During the 1970s and 1980s, Jackie served three times as Fianna F&aacute;il's director of elections in Kerry South and helped deliver two of the three seats for Fianna F&aacute;il.  When John O'Leary retired in 1997 an opportunity arose for Jackie to rise to the national stage.  Although he did not secure the Fianna F&aacute;il nomination at the convention, he went on to contest the election as an Independent, defy the odds and won in the subsequent election.  I chaired that convention.  A colourful occasion it was and is well documented in John O'Leary's memoir and is well worth a read for that and his description of the subsequent election.  Jackie's speech that night was masterful.  Even in defeat he was laying the groundwork for his subsequent campaign and hinting at his intentions.  I recall him telling the gathering "Do not be a bit surprised in the Black Valley in the depths of winter, as you open your half-door, that you won't see these beady little eyes looking it at you".  The die was cast as we left the convention on that occasion.</p>  <p>  As an Independent Deputy supporting that minority Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government of 1997, which was a highly effective and impactful Government on many fronts, Jackie's role was constructive and in the national interest.  That Government, under the leadership of Bertie Ahern, delivered the Good Friday Agreement and transformed the areas of education and research, to name but a few of its achievements.  He had the capacity to win projects for his constituency and to influence social policy, but astutely also knew his limitations and was particularly skilful in getting the balance right.  He mentored and led the other Independents supporting that Government, namely, Harry Blaney, Mildred Fox and Thomas Gildea.  He was intensely competitive in terms of the constituency and had to be watched at all times.  I recall how, as a youthful Minister for Education and Science at the time, we inadvertently let slip at a match at Croke Park that a highly sought-after special needs assistant, SNA, post for a school in Killarney was to be awarded.  The then Minister, John O'Donoghue, had a very able constituency officer who picked it up and arrived at the school principal's office at 8.30 a.m. the next morning to alert them that Deputy O'Donoghue had delivered the SNA.  I was at a factory in Cork that day, meeting with multinational companies, and received a phone call from S&eacute;amus Brennan who was keeping that Government together.  He said I had to phone Jackie Healy-Rae immediately as the Government was about to collapse over a SNA in Killarney.  I made that telephone call and got a real lesson in life because down that phone line, I got it both barrels.  I told him, "Look, Jackie, I owe you one," and he told me I owed him much more than one.  He was building up the credits for thereafter.</p>  <p>  He was also lyrical in his use of language and prose.  As a Cork man I have observed and consistently saluted the lyricism of Kerry people.  Jackie had it in abundance.  He wrote me a letter when I was Minister for Health on the development of South Doc, which originated in the town of Killarney because of the industry of GPs there.  I always regret that I did not keep the letter, because it is a masterpiece in itself.  Its first sentence grabbed my attention: "This is one of the most important letters you will ever read", and I was immediately captured.  He described this visionary project and concluded with a great line: "If this project does not come to pass I know that it won't be for the want of your trying".  No pressure.  It did come to pass and along with Caredoc in Carlow, it ushered in a new era of 24-7 GP care across the country.  </p>  <p>  Jackie loved his native county and particularly Kilgarvan, where he went to primary school and grew up on the family farm.  He was an active participant in GAA games and won two senior county hurling titles with Kilgarvan in 1956 and 1958.  He was an accomplished saxophone player with the Kilgarvan dance band.  He would have been particularly proud of his two sons, Danny and Michael, their success in general elections and their contribution to national politics, and, indeed, his grandchildren, Maura, Jackie Jnr., and Johnny who have made it at local elections.  It was indeed a costly convention on that occasion.  </p>  <p>  He was a legendary figure politically.  </p><p>He was also a gentleman and we got on very well at a personal level.  His courtesy was always there.  He was a gentleman to his fingertips.  Even though he was a legendary figure politically, his family will remember him differently as someone who guided and shaped their lives and, above all, their work ethic, which is a defining quality of the Healy-Rae family.  I express our sympathies to Danny, John, Denis, Michael, Rosemary and Joan.  We remember his late wife Julie, their mother.  We also express sympathy to his many grandchildren and his many friends and supporters across the kingdom and beyond.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam d&iacute;lis.</p></speech>

As the Ceann Comhairle has already said, Jackie Healy-Rae was and will forever be remembered as one of the great characters of the House and Irish political life generally.  His trademark wit, his plain speaking, his rich melodic Kerry accent and, of course, his flat cap, were all part of this character.  While he was sometimes teased or lampooned he was undoubtedly one of the most astute and determined political operators ever to grace the D&aacute;il.  I am sure we can all agree on this.  It is not only that he represented those who eat their dinner in the middle of the day, he had their backing as well.  There is no doubt the people of south Kerry always had Jackie's back and I imagine in the end for him that is all that really mattered.</p>  <p>  In a political career spanning 40 years he served three terms from 1997 to 2011.  He served 30 years as a member of Kerry County Council, including two stints as mayor of Kerry.  As has been said, he never lost an election.  That is some record and it is one of which very many of us gathered here are extremely envious.  His record of service to the people of Kerry has been continued with the election of not one but two of his sons, our colleagues Michael and Danny, who were elected in 2011 and 2016 respectively.  That his grandchildren Maura, Johnny and Jackie Junior now serve on Kerry County Council is further testament to Jackie's legacy and to the political achievements of this political family, the Healy-Raes.</p>  <p>  It may be five years on but I have no doubt that the sting of the loss of Jackie is still felt by his beloved family.  I extend our sympathies to that family, to his partner Kathleen, to our colleagues Michael and Danny, to his other sons John and Denis, to his daughters Joan and Rosemary, to all of his grandchildren and to all of his other friends and relatives throughout the kingdom and beyond.  He may be gone but he will never ever be forgotten.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam d&iacute;lis.</p></speech>

As other have averted to, and as everybody in the nation knows, Jackie was a unique member of the House whose presence here created an awareness in every corner of Ireland of the name Healy-Rae.  As others have said, he was a man of many parts.  He was born in Kilgarvan and nobody in the State does not know that fact.  He grew up on a family farm and with that level of understanding he became a lifelong champion of rural Ireland and of the maintenance of small farm holdings.  He was also a most successful businessman who, by the 1960s, had established a plant hire business in south Kerry.  His business grew and expanded and employed multiple people.  Of course, he also became a most successful publican.  He had many parts.  He was a successful GAA player and I understand he was a successful saxophonist and played with the Kilgarvan band.</p>  <p>  He first became involved in politics in the 1960s, heading several Fianna F&aacute;il election campaigns as we have heard from that party.  Most notable was the election of John O'Leary to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in 1966.  So impressive was Jackie Healy-Rae's acumen in organising campaigns that his skills were lent out by the party to several other Fianna F&aacute;il campaigns in other parts of the country including, I understand, in Limerick, Cork and Galway.  He was much in demand.</p>  <p>  He entered active representational politics himself in 1973 when he was co-opted to serve on Kerry County Council as a Fianna F&aacute;il member.  Elected in his own right the following year, he carved out an impressive representational reputation that ensured his re-election time and again to Kerry County Council for 30 years.</p>  <p>  I came across Jackie when he entered this House after the 1997 general election.  We had just left Government at that time and Jackie astutely negotiated with the changed political dynamic of the House and became one of the famous four wheels that supported the incoming Fianna F&aacute;il administration.  They were expensive wheels.</p></speech>

He ensured his support was rewarded with investments for the people he loved most, the people of Kerry.  To our colleagues Michael and Danny, to his grandchildren and to his extended family, to his myriad friends and supporters not only in the kingdom but throughout the country I extend the sympathy and regard of the Labour Party.  It is obviously a sad day to reflect on his passing but it is a day that will fill them in their remembrances with great pride for a great life well led.

As a number of people have mentioned, Jackie kept the very shaky Fianna F&aacute;il Government from 1997 in power.  The Ceann Comhairle might remember the consternation that was felt in the House when Jackie got ill once or twice on the train from Heuston and we thought we were into an imminent general election.  Fortunately, he recovered.  We were not ready at the time and the D&aacute;il went on.</p>  <p>  I served with Jackie in three D&aacute;ileanna and we often discussed south Kerry issues and the Beara Peninsula.  He knew of my Healy connections in the area.  In the 19th century, the Healy clan was based mostly in the hills and mountains around Lauragh.  I watched with admiration as he served in the D&aacute;il the way that a very dangerous road, which I use very regularly, from Kenmare through Kilgarvan and up to Glenflesk, Barraduff and Rathmore, was gradually widened and dramatically improved to become a very good regional road.  Of course, that was one of his achievements.</p>  <p>  Dr. Liam Weeks of University College Cork has done very interesting studies on the role of Independent Deputies in the Chamber.</p><p>We are a remarkable Parliament according to Dr. Weeks.  Compared with other European parliaments, Independent Members have played a strong role here.  That has been the case from the Government of the late 1940s, to the two Independent Members who supported the Lemass Government, to the great Tony Gregory who supported Governments in the 1980s and right down to today when Independent Members serve in both government and opposition.  Deputy Jackie Healy-Rae was a fundamental part of that great tradition.  He made a contribution which showed how an individual Deputy could exert great influence for his beloved kingdom.  </p> <p> He brought the spirit of Kerry to this House.  I refer to the county's tremendous culture, great expertise and excellence in tourism and enterprise, as well as its wonderful achievements in Gaelic football and other sports.  It is an honour to be able to say ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam.</p></speech>

He was from the turf smoke and sometimes gun smoke wing of Charlie Haughey's Fianna F&aacute;il Party.  An unwise political miscalculation set Jackie on the independent route in 1977.  That was the start of a journey which has culminated in the Healy-Rae family dominating Kerry politics.  The Governments of Bertie Ahern and Brian Cowen drew Jackie and me together in common purpose.  I cherish the years that I sat beside Jackie on the benches of this Chamber.  It was a wonderful experience.  We built a great trust and bond together.  At one stage, towards the latter end of his career, I was the runner for Jackie.  I made those runs because Jackie had his agreements and every Minister was expected to honour them.  When a Minister came into the Chamber here - Jackie had slowed down a good bit at that stage - he would ask me to go over to a certain man or woman and pin him or her down until he got there.</p>  <p>  I valued and enjoyed my relationship with Jackie.  Those times were instructive and educational as well as engaging and serious.  They were also very witty and at times even hilarious.  His mutterings and off-the-cuff commentary were a joy to hear.  Jackie had a uniquely distinctive and authentic character and personality.  He was a kind, thoughtful and considerate man.  Above all, he was a fountain of good old-fashioned wisdom.  Jackie loved Kerry and its people.  The people knew that and thanked him for it.  His friends and supporters in the Gallery and the people of Kerry watching at home returned that love in abundance, particularly at election time.  Jackie always recognised that he was only as good as the people around him.  We salute, therefore, our visitors on their achievements and success.  We welcome in particular Deputies Michael and Danny Healy-Rae, his two sons who are now representatives in this Chamber, as well as Maura, Jackie Jnr. and Johnny Healy-Rae. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that when it came to national issues Jackie acted responsibly and in the best interests of the country.  The Government of 2007, which was supposed to have been built like a battleship, with a huge inbuilt majority, gradually disintegrated.  For various reasons many Members on the Government side had gone to the hills.  This put Jackie and me under enormous pressure and those were dangerous and difficult times.  In the context of Brexit, it is opportune to remind this House that just a decade ago our Republic was defenceless, our sovereignty was gone and foreign powers were in Government Buildings.  The very structures of the State were at the edge of a cliff.  It seemed sometimes to Jackie and me, and others, that the late Brian Lenihan, a man who was then feeling the chill breath of death, was the only man left standing in the gap.  </p>  <p>  During that time of utter crisis, Brian Lenihan called Jackie and me into his office.  He took us into his confidence and outlined in the starkest terms the consequences for Ireland if that Government collapsed in a disorderly way.  The troika was insisting on corrective budgets and a finance Bill.  When Brian Lenihan was finished speaking, Jackie took my knee in a vice-like grip and said "Mother of Divine Jesus, Michael, we are going to have to go down with them".  We stood firm.  Many hard decisions had to be taken.  There was much drama and many cliffhanger votes.  Through it all, however, Jackie held the line.  </p>  <p>  Loyalty was Jackie's defining political principle.  He was loyal to his word, his people and his country.  In conclusion, it is said that one reaps as one sows.  In that regard, Jackie Healy-Rae has sown well.  He lived to see the reaping of his legacy.  A Healy-Rae dynasty rivals that of Daniel O'Connell in Kerry in its capacity to secure the support of the people.  We will not see his like again.  I will borrow a line from the famous Kerrygold butter advertisement and state that Jackie was pure gold.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-06-26a.179" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1317" speakername="Martin Ferris" time="13:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019062600018#Q00300"><p>The Healy-Rae family and the Sinn F&eacute;in Party have been very supportive of each other down through the years.  More importantly, the Healy-Rae family are my friends.  I first met Jackie Healy-Rae sometime in the late 1970s or early 1980s.  That was at a time when Robert Beasley, the Sinn F&eacute;in county councillor for Kerry, had to emigrate because of the circumstances.  We had to find a replacement on Kerry County Council.  We were seeking support for a co-option of Gerry Walsh to take that seat.  The only person we could trust in the political establishment in Kerry County Council was Jackie Healy-Rae.  He was the whip for the Fianna F&aacute;il party at the time.  I met him and asked him would he support Gerry Walsh taking his seat.  He told me "my boy, I guarantee that he is a county councillor now".  That was even before he went onto the county council.  I had tremendous respect for and trust in Jackie Healy-Rae from that day on.  That carries on to this day with Danny and Michael and Maura, Jackie junior and Johnny.</p>  <p>  The Healy-Rae family has a great legacy in many areas.  I had a great conversation with Johnny Healy-Rae after the local elections in Killarney.  We were talking about the next presidential election.  I suggested that he might be a candidate.  He stated that "if I am allowed to cut silage in the 300 acres around &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in, I certainly will go for it".  As the Kerry supporters and the Healy-Rae supporters and their extended family came in here today, my good friend, Deputy Gerry Adams, looked up and stated "thy Kingdom come".  He is a wise man.  </p>  <p>  Jackie had a tremendous career.  He played hurling for Kilgarvan and earned three county championship medals.  He won two of them on the field against Kilmoyley in 1956 and 1958.  He was a corner forward or a full forward.  In those days, those of us who watched, played or supported hurling witnessed an awful lot of ground hurling.  Jackie had a fantastic reputation as a corner forward for finding the back of the net with ground hurling while never damaging one daisy.  He pulled lovely and high.  He was able to take his man out of it and make sure the ball went to its destination as well.  </p>  <p>  I remember the first time Jackie was elected as a Deputy in 1997.  I missed out at that time.  Michael reminded me of this last night when we were talking about it.  We were in the count centre.</p><p>It was as though there was an ozone layer around Sinn F&eacute;in, particularly around me.  All the press was there but the other political parties were miles away.  They were very shy of the camera.  However, the first man up to shake my hand was Jackie Healy-Rae.  He had no problem with standing in front of the camera.  That is another great memory I have of him.  </p> <p> I remember when Peg the mare went missing.  It was international news, not national news.  Peg was Jackie's favourite mare and he was broken-hearted.  At the time, like today, there was a shortage of garda&iacute; in Kerry and they could not find the mare.  Jackie rang me and said "Martin boy, my poor mare has gone missing.  Is there any chance you would search up around north Kerry to see if you would be able to find my poor mare?"  Thankfully at the end of the day the mare turned up.  I do not know where it was or who had it, but it turned up.  </p> <p> Another great memory I have of Jackie is from my time on Kerry County Council.  Jackie was a Deputy.  The tuna fishermen off the coast of Ireland had been prohibited from drift-netting.  Kerry County Council decided to send a deputation to meet the then Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Frank Fahey, and officials from the Department.  We hoped to talk a bit of common sense into them and argue that the livelihood of Irish fishermen drift-netting for tuna should not be jeopardised by prohibition.  We arrived here and went into the office to meet the Minister and his officials.  We were all making the very strong case that it was an awful miscarriage of justice for fishermen to be prevented from fishing for tuna.  Jackie had a big ball in his pocket.  He put his hand in and pulled out a net.  I looked at the net and I looked at the officials.  They looked at it and were overwhelmed with examining the detail.  Anybody who knows anything about fishing would know that the mesh size for a tuna net is about nine inches.  The mesh size here was about four inches.  Furthermore, it was a monofilament salmon net and as such it was illegal.  Jackie brought that into that meeting.  It says a lot about the officials and the Minister that they did not have a clue what it was.  Jackie knew what it was. </p> <p> The legacy Jackie has left includes three county councillors, namely, young Jackie, Johnny and Maura.  They are fantastic people who got huge votes in the last election.  Deputies Michael and Danny Healy-Rae are my friends and fellow Deputies representing Kerry.  The one thing they all have is the common touch.  They represent the common ordinary people of the country.  They are not in a bubble.  Ireland is a lot more than what is inside the Red Cow roundabout.  Jackie Healy-Rae was a testament to their politics, the politics for the common man and woman.  They are fantastic people.</p> <p> As long as I live I will never forget a day when John O&rsquo;Donoghue was sitting where the Ceann Comhairle is sitting now.  It was a fairly eventful day.  There were three or four breaks because of the arguments that broke out.  Jackie stood up and said that while the Ceann Comhairle was up there, he would look after Bonane, Sneem, Caherdaniel and Reenard.  He assured the Ceann Comhairle that he would make sure the people of south Kerry were well looked after while he was in Dublin.  That says it all.  </p> <p> I wish Jackie's family the best and I thank them for coming here today.  They are continuing a fantastic legacy, which was started by Jackie Healy-Rae. </p></speech>

They were lifelong friends and had great respect for each other.  In their time on Kerry County Council, which was just shy of 30 years, Jackie made very telling contributions.  His first and real love was local politics.  He was an extremely effective local politician.  We talk about decision-making and responsibility.  In his time there Jackie never failed to pass a budget for Kerry Country Council; he never failed to pass a development plan or any important vote.  He was a man of great responsibility.  He represented people to the absolute utmost but he was always there to make the difficult decisions, and I have great respect for him in that regard.  </p><p>Following his election to the D&aacute;il in 1997 he was one of the four politicians who effectively had the balance of power, along with then Deputies Harry Blaney, Tom Gildea and Mildred Fox.  He delivered in spades for the people of Kerry.  As Deputy Lowry alluded to, from 2007 to 2011, when this country was in serious financial peril and some very difficult budgets had to be passed, Deputy Lowry and Jackie Healy-Rae stood up to the mark and took very difficult decisions.  They stayed in when others who were in the same position opted out.  For that political bravery I will always have the utmost respect for Jackie Healy-Rae. </p><p>His quotes were legendary.  Talking about the difficulties of people who came to him, he said they were &quot;so poor that they couldn&rsquo;t buy a jacket for a gooseberry&quot;.  On another occasion he was trying to draw attention to difficulties around a dump just outside Killarney.  At a council meeting he said to the country engineer that he passed the dump on his way to the meeting and had seen rats that were so big they had saluted him.  The manager, trying to lessen the effect of this contribution, said he had come in by the same road and had seen no rats.  That prompted a witty journalist from <i>The Kerryman </i>to write a headline in the newspaper the following week to the effect that &quot;Rats salute councillor but ignore county engineer&quot;.  </p><p>As Deputy Ferris alluded to, the speech that I will always remember Jackie Healy-Rae for was on the day John O&rsquo;Donoghue was made Ceann Comhairle.  It had everything; it was witty, respectful and politically effective.  It defined everything about Jackie Healy-Rae.  Others underestimated him at their peril.  A day that I know is difficult and reflective for all his family is also a day when we celebrate a great man.  His family holds him in great respect, particularly his grandchildren, who idolised him.  The legacy that he has left is for me and Deputies Martin Ferris and Brendan Griffin to deal with.  It is an unrivalled political machine.  While we differ on issues from time to time, I have nothing but the greatest of respect for Jackie and his family.  May he rest in peace. </p></speech>

Kilgarvan is on the green side of the mountain, whereas we are on the poorer red side.  The Healy-Raes, including Jackie, and my father and the other Moynihans knew each other well for many years.  Jackie bounced ideas off Dad for many years and they worked closely together in the health board, County Hall and, more recently, D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  Jackie Healy-Rae represented the plain people who, in his own words, had their dinner in the middle of the day.  He was well known for his hard work, whether in cutting turf, with diggers or for his constituents in County Hall, the health board or Dublin.  The people stood with him and saw things through with him because he put in the work in election after election from 1974 onwards and he never lost one.  He was a very sharp operator as one could see in the by-election campaigns about which we have heard so much.  He went on to put those skills to work locally in his own campaigns, as director of elections and a candidate.  He would be very proud of the fact that not one but two of his sons are Members of the D&aacute;il representing County Kerry.  Bh&iacute; aithne againn ar Jackie Healy-Rae mar fhear gr&aacute;mhar, greannmhar agus an-oilte i gcursa&iacute; polait&iacute;ochta i gcona&iacute;.  He will always be remembered with fondness for his hard work and great character.  N&iacute; bheidh a leith&eacute;id ann ar&iacute;s.</p></speech>

I thank my brother, Deputy Michael Healy-Rae, for assisting to arrange these tributes and Deputy Mattie McGrath, the leader of our group, who spoke at the Business Committee about the matter.  I thank all of the Members who spoke in such glowing terms for their praise for our father.  It was clear from their intimate knowledge of the things he had done and said that those who spoke knew him very well.  It is great to be here.  </p>  <p>  I express special thanks to everyone from County Kerry who travelled to be with us.  My father always had the best people around him.  It is quite something to think it is 22 years ago to the very day when he first took his seat in the D&aacute;il.  It is unbelievable to have these tributes being paid to him today.  A lot of those who are here were here on that day too and I must thank them also.  I refer to John Donoghue, Tim Coffey, Timmie O, Richie Mc, Tim Herlihy, John O'Connor, Seamus Doherty, Pat Moriarty, Noel Lucey, Brendan Hartnett, Derry Healy, Kevin Tarrant, Mike and Sean Dunne, Mike Galvin, Ruairi and James Doherty, James's partner Kathleen Cahill, Liam Fitzgerald and Noreen O'Sullivan who nursed my father when he was sick.  </p>  <p>  I must also mention the other great people who did so much for him, albeit it is dangerous to mention particular people, given the risk that I will leave someone out.  There are people who cannot be here, including Dan Dawn McCarthy, Connie Doherty and the O'Donoghue family of The Gleneagle and Scotts Hotel.  I am glad that we have Paudie O'Callaghan here of the F&aacute;ilte Hotel.  Some people have passed on, including Maurice Galvin who travelled every inch of the country, particularly County Kerry, with Jackie.  On the day my father was elected, Maurice said, "I can die a happy man now."  I also refer to Pats Guerin, the BB Dens from Rathmore and the Bravos, Ned Carey and Johnny Mahoney.</p>  <p>  I will cherish the years I had with my father, including when we lived in the pub in Kilgarvan.  He was very good to me and all of my family.  He was very good to Eileen and all of my lads.  He adored Johnny, Pat, Dan, Maura, Elaine and Theresa, for whom he did a great deal.  He has rubbed off on all of them.  He liked it when they called him "Jackson" which was their name for him.  </p>  <p>  My father was successful in everything he went at, whether it was tractors in the 1950s, hackney cars or heavy machinery.  He was a successful publican, auctioneer and farmer.  People may not be aware that he was able to weld, mow and plough better than anyone.  Work never bothered him.  He could milk the cows in the morning, travel to a meeting in Dungarvan, come home and milk the cows again in the evening, after which he would go to Rathmore or Gneeveguilla for political meetings.  Work was no bother to him and there was never any notion of surrender.  </p>  <p>  My father had many interests.  He was a magnificent hurler, something which has been well described in the House.  What I remember about him on the field is that he was faster than anyone else.  What he lacked in hurling ability, he made up for in speed.  </p>  <p>  My father loved all types of music.  As chairman of Comhaltas in County Kerry, he brought six county fleadh cheoil events and one Munster fleadh cheoil event to Kilgarvan.  He liked many singers and artists, including Charlie Pride, Johnny Carroll, Paddy Cole, Bing Crosby, Jim Reeves and, most especially, Dermot Flynn from Lisheenbawn and Killarney.  </p>  <p>  Jackie Healy-Rae never went on holidays, but on Saturday evenings he loved to go down the town in Killarney for an hour, as he would say, to meet as many people as he possibly could.  However, it was as a politician that he excelled, something about which many Deputies have spoken today, for which I thank them.</p>  <p>  My father made an enduring name for himself across Ireland, County Kerry and many parts of the world.  Imagine it is 22 years since he came here.  He was so proud on that day and we were all so proud of him.  He won two more elections in 2002 and 2007 and held his seat until 2011 when he was almost 80 years of age.  As a family and an organisation, he gave us many opportunities to celebrate and be proud of who we were.  He was co-opted onto Kerry County Council in December 1973 and headed the poll in 1974.  He lit a fire in County Kerry at that time which is still burning brightly, propelling my brother, Michael, and I to win two D&aacute;il seats in 2016 and Johnny, Maura and Jack to head the poll in three electoral areas in County Kerry on 24 May last.  My father won a seat on Kerry County Council in 1979, 1985, 1991 and 1999, topping the poll on most occasions.  He had massive political ability and a wonderful political brain.  He was a master strategist and a charmer who was able to convince people.  He had the power of persuasion.  He was approachable to everyone and people confided in him.  He was generous and wealth never concerned him beyond having enough to keep going.  He loved people and always wanted to listen, while, of course, everyone wanted to listen to him.  He has left a magnificent legacy of hard work for the people of County Kerry, for which each and every one of the people for whom he worked remembers him.  It involved many small, personal and private matters right up to larger community projects.  He was so proud of what he had achieved and deliverd in the D&aacute;il, including Kenmare Hospital, the Castleisland bypass, roundabouts, Barraduff Bridge, the Kenmare relief road, SouthDoc and Killarney House which he ensured was included in the capital investment programme in late 2010.  There are so many other things of which I cannot think or which I do not have the time to mention.</p><p>I am proud to have this chance to be in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  When my late father was first elected to this House 22 years ago, I never thought that it would happen.  I am honoured to have this chance to pay tribute to Jackie Healy-Rae.  We were side by side for all of his life.  We will continue his work while the people of County Kerry want us and God above allows us to do it.  I look forward to meeting him in another kingdom at a future time.  He rang me every night and every day when he was not at home.  I only wish when my phone rings now that it would show the number 087-2506633 because it often rang and meant so much to me.  He did so much for me.  I can honestly say he gave us the chance to start.  It could be the case that if it was not for him, we would never have been here and would never have got as far as we did.  It is up to us to work as hard as we can to continue his work because that is what he would want us to do.  His voice would be music to my ears if I could hear it again.</p></speech>

I thank Deputies most sincerely for their kind words.  The one thing we realise is they meant what they said.  Our late father, Jackie Healy-Rae, was indeed a very unique and special person.</p>  <p>  I must acknowledge the chairman of the Healy-Rae organisation, John O'Donoghue from Farranfore, who is in the Visitors Gallery.  He always chaired meetings of our organisation during the years.  I acknowledge my brothers, Denis and John, and my sisters, Rosemary and Joan, who is in America.  There are others in America who cannot be here.  I acknowledge my father's brothers, Denny and Mick, and his sisters, Hannie and Cathy.  My late uncle Dan would have loved to be here, but, unfortunately, that is not the case.  Others who would have liked to be here have sent very warm words.  My message to Dan McCarthy who is fighting his own battle in Milltown is that he will be here again.  I hope he will be here to see more of us in the future.  He will be there to fight other elections in the future.  There are people who recently departed.  On 4 April we lost Jimmy Breen from Sneem.  His wife, Mary, is here, about which I am very glad.  She is flying the flag for the Breen family.  They were with my father and us for many years.  Donie O'Sullivan is not here, but Noreen is, about which we are very glad.</p>  <p>  I mention a special young person, Katie, who is Kathleen Cahill's grandchild.  I would like to talk about a terribly nice and kind thing Katie did for my father.  When she came into the world as a lovely young girl, she made my father like a father again.  Everybody in Killarney knows this.  He used to go to Bird's Bazaar and make flower arrangements with Kathleen.  Neighbours would be drafted in.  They did all of these things in my father's later years.  He was there for Katie and enjoyed every day with her.  I will be eternally grateful to her because when more of us were small, he was so busy that he did not have the time to devote to us that he would have liked to have had.  He did it with Katie and  I acknowledge her especially.  She has come all the way from America to be here.  She is only a young girl.  I acknowledge the great joy and happiness she brought into our father's life.  Her mother, Antoinette, is in America today.</p>  <p>  Kathleen Cahill who was with my father for many years cannot be here.  We acknowledge all of the others who cannot be here but we know that they are watching from other places.  Each and every one of the people in the Visitors Gallery has something in common.  I acknowledge the presence in the Visitors Gallery of Senators Coghlan and Ned O'Sullivan and former Senator Dan Kiely who worked and soldiered with my father.  Senator Coghlan travelled many roads with our father.  They were very close companions.  Many of the canvassing team are here.  I remind Opposition Deputies who might think we are showing our artillery that the people in the Visitors Gallery are representatives of many others.  I want all of our colleagues in the different groupings to look up at the Visitors Gallery and realise that for every head and every pair of legs they see, there are 50 more at home.  They go from north Kerry to south Kerry, east Kerry, west Kerry and mid-Kerry.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge the new generation of Healy-Raes.  I am very proud that they are here.  Johnny Healy-Rae, Maura Healy-Rae and Jackie Healy-Rae were recently elected as councillors.  I congratulate all councillors in the country who were successful in last month's local elections.  It is a great source of enjoyment for Danny and me to see the young Healy-Raes here.  I am terribly conscious that we are all in a cycle or on a wheel.</p>  <p>  I remember fondly the nights I organised tours or clinics when the D&aacute;il was not sitting - perhaps at Christmas, in the summer or during some other break or recess - and my father used to ask what we had on for the week.  It is no exaggeration to say that an average night could have taken in 15 or 17 places.  Every place would have to be special.  In every place the local people would have had to be told that Jackie would be coming that night.  We met a lot of people and wrote down a lot of problems, but it is no good writing them down unless they are sorted out afterwards.  We used to love sorting out problems and trying to help people.  When I think back about those late nights, I remember falling asleep and trying to keep my eyes open as I travelled along in the car.  The funny stories used to keep us going.  When I think back about the funny things that used to happen, I also lament the tough problems we encountered.  The one thing nobody can take from us is the memories we have.  Jackie Healy-Rae gave us special memories from which we will never be pulled away.  I remember the funny and genuinely nice things that happened and the lovely people we met.</p>  <p>  I would like to say one thing to all of the people who are able to be here.  The one thing they all have in common is that my father had a very special place in their heart.  If they were asked to write a book about him, they could do so on the basis of their fond memories of things that happened.  He was an entertainer.  He was a politician.  Thankfully, the media are calming down a little about the Healy-Raes.  Perhaps they are getting to learn a little about us.  I remind them that a former Deputy in Dublin, the late Tony Gregory, was a nice, great and hard-working man.</p></speech>

That is why I always refer to the Red Cow as something it is not impossible for people to get across.  We are entitled to come here on behalf of the people of County Kerry.  Danny and I, like the lads on Kerry County Council, make no apology to anybody for beating a path to the doors of Ministers, the Taoiseach and Opposition leaders to state our case for and on behalf of the people of County Kerry.  That is our job and what we are here to do.</p><p>It is a very special honour.  </p> <p> Many have asked about the reason for the delay.  I will explain it.  In early 2015 I notified that we were going to do this but then something came up and there were delays.  Deputy Danny Healy-Rae and I said we would do it before the council elections and then that we would do after them.  Lately we said that if we did not do it soon, we would hardly be here ourselves.  We wanted to have it done to remember a person.  I think it is nice, even this length of time afterwards.  It is very special, something we will remember forever.  </p> <p> We will cherish the nice and genuine contributions made by people who stood with my father year in, year out; the people who visited him when he was ill; the neighbours who were always so kind and always there and true friends; and the nurses and doctors.  I saw a message from a doctor in County Kerry, of whom we are very fond and who helped to mind our father when he was ill.  He sent a message a minute ago that my father had been his favourite patient.  Things like that mean an awful lot to us, as does the fact that everyone is here and has shown patience because I know that there is a lot of very important business to be done today.  I appreciate the fact that they have given us this opportunity.  </p> <p> My father packed an awful lot into the years he had in this world.  He lived every day as if it was his last.  The one thing he always said to me was, "Keep going as hard as you can for as long as you can and never give up and never surrender."  If there is ever a little row inside this House and any Member thinks we will back down, I can say we will not.  We will tell Members now that we will not, but we will try to do it in the nicest possible way.  </p> <p> All I can say is there is the memory of Jackie Healy-Rae here today.  You can see it and feel it.  Again, we thank the people who are here from the bottom of our hearts.  We thank them, their families and relatives at home and the people around County Kerry, the rest of Ireland and the world who will hear this.  We thank them for being so respectful to the memory of Jackie Healy-Rae because he was loyal, as Deputy Lowry stated.  It was all about loyalty.  To this day, if someone meets me, Deputy Danny Healy-Rae or anyone in what I call the new generation of Healy-Raes, it is like paying a deposit.  We need not sign anything.  If we shake hands with a person and say, "That's it, you have my word;" that is it.  The only thing we will ever have when we have nothing else, just like our father, is our word.  If we give our word to somebody and shake hands on it, we will have to die before we break it and I mean that.  </p> <p> I thank everybody on behalf of all the Healy-Raes and the Healy-Rae organisation.  People can do the sums.  There is an awful lot of people at home.  I thank Members for giving us this opportunity.</p></speech>

Yesterday the Taoiseach said the Government had accepted the outcome of the job evaluation scheme and the recommendations made and was prepared to pay.  The only issues seemed to be implementation and the timelines.  When I said the strike would have been averted by the payment of a couple of million euro, it was in that context because the Government has stated it is willing to pay and accepts the outcome of the job evaluation, yet the Taoiseach said the issues were the timelines and implementation in the next few years.  He said payments would start in 2019.  I think Deputy Howlin suggested the offer was &euro;1 million.</p></speech>

I might be wrong, but my suggestion is that it would be in single digits.  In the context of the massive overruns on a range of other projects, it would not have taken a whole lot to avert the strike.  Three more days of strike action have been pencilled in for next week.  There are, obviously, significant issues for patients and those who attend hospitals as inpatients and outpatients.  In respect of the commitment in the programme for Government to better industrial relations within the health service, I put it to the Taoiseach that the strike could have been averted and that some creative work should be done to make sure we will not have strikes next week.</p></speech>

I commend Deputy Gino Kenny and many others who campaigned for this, as well as the Minister for Health who took the issue on board and progressed it.  Several weeks ago in the Chamber Deputy Gino Kenny raised the case of the Stephens family in Waterford who must import cannabis-based oil for their daughter Cassie.  They must travel to Holland to purchase the oil and pay for the costs of the flights.  They are one of 21 families who have a licence to do so.  They have been supported by Cassie&rsquo;s consultant in University Hospital Waterford and her GP.  She used to have many seizures, but they have reduced as a consequence of the cannabis-based oil treatment.  It is one of several treatments she receives, but it complements them.  However, the family have not been reimbursed one single cent.  Four of the 21 families in question have been reimbursed but not the Stephens family.  They have spent &euro;9,000 so far, but they cannot afford to spend any more.  They are now borrowing money.  Will the Taoiseach personally look into the issue to see what can be done to support the family?  I welcome the moves made by the Minister for Health today.  However, the Stephens family need support.  Will the Taoiseach personally intervene to ensure they will receive the reimbursements they are due?</p></speech>

I imagine the Deputy is aware that it would be illegal for the Minister for Health to give a direction to the HSE in a particular individual case.  There is a reimbursement system in place.  I have been advised that the following steps have to be completed when it comes to reimbursement.  The patient&rsquo;s consultant must be satisfied that all therapeutic options have been exhausted and prepared to accept responsibility for the monitoring of the patient&rsquo;s response, side effects, etc.  A prescriber applies to the Minister for a ministerial licence.  If it is granted, the consultant completes an individual reimbursement form, setting out the therapeutic benefit for the patient.  It must be completed in sufficient detail for the therapeutic benefit to be demonstrated.  Thereafter, an individual reimbursement form is considered by the Medicines Management Programme, MMP.  Following a review of the documentation, the MMP makes a recommendation to the HSE in favour of or against reimbursement support for the patient and of the patient's eligibility and informs the Primary Care Reimbursement Service, PCRS, of that recommendation.  That is the process by which somebody can apply for reimbursement.  I cannot say why reimbursement may be refused in an individual case.  I hope this information is of some help to the Deputy.</p></speech>

As we approach Dublin Pride this weekend and Trans Pride the following week - pride festivals will be held across Ireland - we need to recognise crimes motivated by homophobia and transphobia continue to happen here.  In Northern Ireland 281 homophobic incidents were recorded last year, of which 201 were classified as crimes.  Some 33 transphobic incidents were recorded, of which 12 were classified as crimes.  The population is nearly three times that of Northern Ireland and we can anticipate that we are not immune from that crime.  Will the Taoiseach consider instituting the same level of monitoring?  Will he require the Garda to record hate crimes and provide regular statistics to ensure we will understand the extent of the problem and that we will root it out in the State?</p></speech>

Hate crime was one of the issues they raised with me.  I am not sure what the situation is when it comes to Garda monitoring of statistics, but I will have it checked and reply to the Deputy by way of correspondence.  The issue of hate crime is being examined by the Department of Justice and Equality.  It is difficult to get it right because, while hate, anger and many other things may be sins, they are not crimes <i>per se</i>.  Perhaps a way by which we might deal with it is that rather than trying to make it a crime, we do something as part of sentencing.  For example, if somebody was to commit an assault or carry out a murder and was motivated by hatred on particular grounds, it would result in a stiffer sentence, rather than making the emotion or feeling of hate a crime which I think would be hard to do.</p></speech>

Obviously, it has been a protracted process, but it is welcome.  It is significant for the health system as doctors can now prescribe cannabis-based products.  I commend the families who have been campaigning for this in the past three years, in particular, Vera Twomey and Paul Barry.  The country owes that family a debt of gratitude for the sacrifices they have made.  While the programme is welcome, it does not go far enough, in particular with reference to the stipulation surrounding the omission of chronic pain.  Many will ask why a reference to chronic pain has been omitted from the programme.  Will it be included in the access programme in the future?</p></speech>

It is a pilot programme that will run for five years.  I recognise the Deputy&rsquo;s work in helping to bring us to this point, as well as the families mentioned by him.  The medical cannabis access programme provides for medical cannabis to be prescribed in three circumstances where a patient has failed to respond to standard treatments.  They include spasticity associated with MS, intractable nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy and severe refractory treatment resistant epilepsy.  Any decision to extend its use to other illnesses or symptoms would have to be made on clinical grounds, rather than it being a political decision.</p></speech>

Will he let us know what is happening?  Is funding in place and will the works be carried out?  Tipperary town needs, deserves and is entitled to this.

There was a debate on this issue last week during which it was confirmed that the funding was available and that it was only a matter of organising the details.  As the Taoiseach announced it a couple of months ago, we want to put the task force together.  The names of several people have been suggested and the money is available.  We will work with the different local groups, as has happened, but we will formalise the arrangements in the next couple of weeks.  I will be in touch with the Deputy later today to fill him in.</p></speech>

They indicated that the experience Eir had of rolling out broadband to 340,000 rural houses gave it a certain credibility.  It believes it could achieve roll-out to the remaining rural houses for less than &euro;1 billion, which is one third of the price projected under the proposed national broadband plan.</p><p>This is, however, the same charge that applies in the rest of the country.  It would require slightly different service level arrangements but, again, these would be the same that apply in the rest of the country.  Eir is adamant that it can do it.  Contrary to what the Taoiseach said yesterday in response to questions on this matter in the D&aacute;il, the company said the provision would include connection right to the house.  It includes the last-mile connection - the overhead wire to the home.  The committee is due to finish its work shortly.  We are due to have a final meeting with the Department.  Will the Government respond to the request Eir sent a year and a half ago to meet and to examine that cheaper option?  Will the Department inform itself of the advantages, disadvantages, and possibilities in order that we can have an informed discussion as to whether this is a practical alternative at our latest meeting with the Department?</p></speech>

Perhaps I can summarise my response.  The Department of Communications, Climate Action and the Environment wrote to Eir this morning to seek clarity on a number of aspects of what its representatives told the committee yesterday.  There is a big gap between the bid they made only a year ago and what they told the committee.  Eir made a bid of &euro;2.7 billion, which was slightly higher than the bid made by Granahan McCourt.  When it pulled out, the company had complaints about the high risks and the level of Government oversight requested, and it refused to give any guarantee in respect of the amount of equity it would put into the project.  The Deputy will recall that there was a lot of criticism of the fact that Granahan McCourt is not putting in enough equity.  Eir would not commit to putting in any equity at all.  We have to take what was said yesterday seriously.  The Department has written to Eir looking for clarity on a number of different issues.  I hope it will respond quickly enough for the Deputy to get its replies before the committee finishes its deliberations.  One key concern of ours is the difference between the &euro;1 billion Eir talked about yesterday and its &euro;2.7 billion bid.  We want to understand how that can be explained.  We would have concerns if that would involve higher user charges and higher connection costs for people in rural Ireland because one of the key objectives of the national broadband plan is to provide the 500,000 homes, farms and businesses in rural Ireland with broadband without connection charges or fees higher than those paid in urban Ireland.  If the difference is being borne by people in rural Ireland, we need to know that and we need to know how much they will be expected to pay under the Eir plan.</p></speech>

There was another shooting in a densely populated area in broad daylight.  Children who were out playing were forced to run for cover.  Two homes were petrol-bombed in retaliation within hours.  Another home was attacked last night.  I acknowledge that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has made some arrests in recent weeks but the situation is so serious that the response needs to be stepped up immediately.  We need 24-hour surveillance of the key culprits in the feud to curtail their movements.  There is every chance that, had that 24-hour surveillance been in place last Thursday, residents of the area would have been spared the horror and the fear caused by criminals attempting to assassinate one another on their doorsteps.  Will the Government provide additional resources to enable such 24-hour surveillance to take place and to monitor those involved in the feud to bring this nightmare to an end?</p></speech>

Does the Government intend to extend the July provision scheme to all children with Down's syndrome in light of a recent High Court settlement?  The children at the centre of the recent action, who have various educational and special needs, will now receive additional schooling under the July provision scheme as a result of that judgment.  Surely this area merits immediate review in light of that judgment.  This issue has been raised with me on numerous occasions by quite a number of parents of children with Down's syndrome.  I do not expect it today, but will the Taoiseach provide an update on the work of the implementation group convened to consider the recommendations of the National Council for Special Education's review of the July provision grant scheme, particularly the recommendation that the Government consider how an equitable national day activity scheme could be developed for all students with complex special educational needs, including children with Down's syndrome?</p></speech>

The report makes a number of recommendations, one of which relates to a serious threat to the beef industry in Ireland - the Mercosur trade deal.  This deal will have damaging implications for the beef sector if it goes through.  I ask the Taoiseach for a clear commitment that he and his Government will oppose that trade deal if it includes the importing of any beef from Latin America into Europe, because such imports would have a detrimental effect on the beef sector.  Coupled with that, while we are discussing the major issues of climate change, we are talking about bringing beef to Europe from the other side of the world.  It makes no sense whatsoever.  It flies in the face of everything we are supposed to stand for in respect of climate change and other such issues.  Will the Taoiseach confirm that the Government will oppose any trade deal that includes importing beef from Latin America into Europe?</p></speech>

As Deputy Martin Kenny has said, climate change will pose its own challenges but producers in Europe are able to provide food sustainably.  Farmers cannot understand how the Commission can allow a Mercosur deal that will allow 80,000 to 90,000 tonnes of beef into Europe to go through, displacing food sustainably produced in Europe.  We hear reports of rainforests being cut down continuously in South America to produce this beef.  European producers cannot understand how the Commission can have one policy to deal with climate change while another allows these imports from South America.</p></speech>

Would such a deal have to come before the D&aacute;il?  Will the Taoiseach clarify the position in respect of trade deals, particularly those that contain an offering of beef?</p>  <p>  Previous speakers have made a point that is more urgent and more pertinent.  The EU's own cumulative assessment of the impact of trade deals indicated that a deal with Mercosur could lead to a &euro;5 billion hit to the beef trade in Europe, which could mean a hit of up to &euro;500 million to the domestic beef industry and a 16% cut in the prices received by farmers whose income from production already leaves them on the bread line.  Will the Taoiseach ensure that this deal is stopped in its tracks and that this message is conveyed clearly to the European Commission?  The agriculture sector and beef farmers simply cannot take this mooted deal.</p></speech>

At the same time, the industry is heavily protected through trade restrictions and tariffs.  It is one of the most subsidised industries in the country.</p><p>When it came to the trade deals with Japan and Canada, we had to consider what is best for the country in the round, not just economically, but also in terms of social policy, because other sectors may benefit considerably from such a deal.  We have particular concerns over a very sensitive sector, which is the beef sector.  As a consequence of that I wrote a letter to President Juncker, the President of France and leaders in a number of other countries, expressing our strong objections to aspects of the deal, particularly as it affects the beef industry.  That is on the public record, having been published last week.</p> <p> On the particular issue of trade deals being ratified, my understanding is that any trade agreement is an exclusive EU competence and therefore would not require ratification of the D&aacute;il unless it is a mixed deal.  However, I will get clarity on that and reply to the Deputy later.</p></speech>

Secondary schools have closed and primary schools are finishing for the summer this week.  Obviously, plans are already being made for returning to school in August and September.  There are many challenges for schools, one of them being policies on the use of smartphones and iPads.  Proper consultation and collaboration needs to take place between parents, students and the schools because schools are complex environments to work within.</p>  <p>  Considerable work has been done on the parent and student charter, and much engagement has taken place at the Joint Committee on Education and Skills.  What is the status of the legislation for that?  That Bill will help schools work more effectively in consultation with their communities, parents and students.</p></speech>

The decision to license a medicine is for the Health Products Regulatory Authority or the European Medicines Agency.  The Oireachtas passed legislation to ensure that decisions on which medicines are reimbursed are not political decisions and should be made objectively by the HSE on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics.  About 30 new medicines this year have been approved for reimbursement.  I am sure more will be approved, but they must meet the criteria and done within the law passed by this House.</p></speech>

Many young adults are now being taken from institutionalised settings such as St. Patrick's in Kilkenny and placed in community homes throughout the city.  I believe the policy is successful but it lacks funding.  The consequences for staff members are that they still remain within the setting but they are not being paid properly and are not being given redundancy.  Their pensions are at issue and the HSE is not in a position to respond to them.</p>  <p>  The other consequence is that the clients of the service who are waiting to be put in homes, where a home is available, are waiting for &euro;600,000 to fund it.</p>  <p>  As a further consequence, a young man has been left in St. Luke's Hospital since November of last year.  The bed is costing &euro;1,000 a day and everyone agrees it is an inappropriate setting, but the senior officials in the HSE will not give sanction for the funding necessary to take that young man, whose health is deteriorating, out of the hospital and put him into the appropriate setting he deserves.</p></speech>

In the past few days, particularly in respect of the summer economic statement, we have heard across the Houses about broadening the approach to the need for increased labour due to a lack of workers for the jobs being created in the economy.  Approximately two years ago, I mentioned in the House the covert discrimination that older people looking for work and in the workforce face.  The Government has gone some way to address this with the &euro;10,000 incentive given to those who employ someone aged 50-plus who was long-term unemployed.  However, those in the 55-plus age group who have done manual labour come to my office to say that they find work difficult because their bodies cannot stand up to it after having worked for 30 or 35 years.  There could be another ten or 15 years' work in these people.  We must drill down into that and look to these people to fulfil that need in our economy, which will aid our competitiveness.</p></speech>

The wording put forward in the Bill reads: &quot;The State recognises the common good as including the right to adequate and appropriate housing and shall guarantee that right through its laws, policies and the prioritisation of resources, with particular regard to children.&quot;  Article 45 of Bunreacht Na h&Eacute;ireann sets out the directive principles of social policy and states:</p><blockquote>The principles of social policy set forth in this Article are intended for the general guidance of the Oireachtas. The application of those principles in the making of laws shall be the care of the Oireachtas exclusively, and shall not be cognisable by any Court under any of the provisions of this Constitution.</blockquote><p>The genesis of this Bill comes from a long-standing, deep concern over the housing crisis and, in particular, the increasing numbers of children experiencing homelessness, especially from 2014-15.  In 2011, the Central Statistics Office stated that there were 641 children experiencing homelessness.  This figure had increased by approximately 500% to almost 4,000 in April 2019.  Without excluding other cohorts of people experiencing homelessness, the Bill explicitly states that there must be particular regard to children, given the longer-term impacts of homelessness on them.</p><p>In summer 2015, I met the Ombudsman for Children, Dr. Niall Muldoon, and representatives of the Children's Rights Alliance, having contacted them that April to voice my grave concerns about the impact of the housing crisis, particularly on children.  I met these children at constituency information meetings, week in and week out, and at that time, 911 children were being held in emergency accommodation.  Four years later, in the week of 22 April 2019, that figure had increasing to an appalling 3,794.  </p><p>In the intervening years and months,  I have tabled countless questions to the relevant Ministers, including Deputies Coveney, Murphy and Zappone.  I have also raised the matter many times with the Taoiseach and I raised many Topical Issue matters.  Last February, a motion I tabled along with other independent colleagues was passed by the House by 71 votes to 43.</p><p>Some may question why we should seek to amend Article 45, which is not cognisant in a court of law.  However, when we started this process of placing a right to housing in the Constitution, we originally looked at amending the children's amendment, Article 42A, and having a referendum on the right to housing just for children.  However, when we met representatives of advocacy groups, they felt that while our idea was well-intentioned, it could overshadow other forms of homelessness.  We then examined the possibility of amending Article 41, regarding the family, but that also might have excluded people without children who are experiencing homelessness.  We believe that an amendment to Article 45 fits because it deals with the directive principles of social policy.  </p><p>Fine Gael and the Taoiseach have said repeatedly that no constitutional change is needed and that the Government is doing everything within its legislative power to provide funding and increase supply.  However, everybody will agree that we still have a dysfunctional housing market that is very far from equilibrium.  Putting the responsibility on the Oireachtas, by amending the directive principles of social policy to give particular regard to children, would be valuable. </p><p>In mid-May, we debated a constitutional amendment Private Member's Bill from colleagues in Sinn F&eacute;in, which I strongly supported.  The Bill sought to amend Article 43, on private property, and insert a new section 43A, stating that: &quot;The State recognises the right of all citizens to adequate, appropriate, secure, safe and affordable housing.&quot;  Despite Fianna F&aacute;il saying it now believes that a right to housing is a necessity, it refused to support the Sinn F&eacute;in Bill along with the Taoiseach and Fine Gael.  Other previous attempts at bringing forward a right to housing have also failed.</p><p>During debates on the Sinn F&eacute;in Bill, the Taoiseach's colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality, Deputy Stanton, said that Fine Gael was open to bringing forward the consideration of a right to housing.  I am now giving its members the opportunity to consider doing that under the social principles.</p><p>Earlier this month, we received the results of a study by Royal Holloway, University of London, headed by Dr. Mel Nowicki and commissioned by Dublin City Council.  The study was of 16 formerly homeless families and the impact of the experience of homelessness on the children of those families.  The findings, although not unexpected, are shameful for every Member of this House, and in particular for the Taoiseach and Government Deputies.  The findings included halted development of speech, children unable to crawl, problems with nutrition and so on; these are all problems that come from living in a crowded hotel room or a so-called family hub. </p><p>We all attended the recent INTO lobby day.  I met teachers from areas where there is a significant number of homeless children in their classes, but little or no extra support is offered to the families, teachers or children.  Based on the experience of my office, the lives of my constituents, particularly those who are suffering from homelessness, and the well-being of the almost 4,000 children experiencing homelessness, the time is here to put a right to housing into the Constitution.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-06-26a.279" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1215" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019062600027#Z00800"><p>I move:</p><blockquote>That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to amend the Housing Acts 1966 to 2009 by providing a definition of social housing and social housing support.  The Act makes a distinction between the provision of real social housing, a dwelling owned by the local authority or an approved housing body, and social housing support which can include Housing Assistance Payment, long term leases and Rental Accommodation Scheme tenancies.</blockquote><p>Traditionally, social housing was understood as houses, apartments or land provided to meet people's long-term housing needs but two significant legislative changes altered that substantially.  The Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 introduced the idea of social housing support &mdash; the idea that short-term, four-year rental accommodation scheme tenancies would somehow equate to long-term social housing as traditionally understood.  The Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014 further shortened that so that two-year housing assistance payment, HAP, tenancies are treated, both legally and from a policy point of view, as the same as long-term housing and while for some people this might seem like a technical point of difference, it has profound consequences.</p><p>There are four problems with conflating meeting people's short-term needs through HAP and the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, with meeting people's long-term housing needs through traditional social housing.  The first is it represents the casualisation of social housing.  We now have 70,000 households in HAP and RAS, two and four-year tenancies, and that creates real difficulties for those families in putting down roots, becoming parts of communities, choosing schools and sports teams for their children etc.  Given the volatility in the private rental sector, one can see the real insecurity, particularly at the moment, for RAS tenants of having that as their long-term social housing support.</p><p>It is also bad for all those people who are seeking to rent and buy and are not eligible for social housing support because it crowds out private housing with social housing tenants.  In fact, including rent supplement claimants, there are 100,000 households living in the private rental sector and that number is increasing because of the Rebuilding Ireland HAP targets.  That is one reason we have increasing demand for private housing and is driving up prices to rent and buy.</p><p>It is also incredibly expensive to the taxpayer and that is not only the view of the Opposition.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform report of 2017 definitively demonstrated that subsidising social housing tenants in the private rental sector is much more expensive than providing traditional social housing.</p><p>Another problem is that is underestimates the real level of long-term social housing need.  The Government will tell us that there are approximately 70,000 households on local authority lists today.  That is true but if one looks at real social housing need, the 50,000 households in HAP and 19,000 or 20,000 households in RAS would have to be added to that, which gives a much bigger figure.  One of the anomalies of the current system is that if I am in rent supplement and receiving State aid in the private rental sector, I am still seen as having a long-term social housing need and am counted in the housing list figures.  However, if I am living next door on a two-year HAP tenancy, I am not included in those figures and that makes no sense.</p><p>The purpose of this Bill is not to argue against short-term housing supports.  They are essential and any sensible housing system will have some form of housing benefit.  The purpose of this Bill is to introduce in law a clear distinction between social housing, houses, apartments, land or accommodation for Travellers that meets the long-term social housing needs of households.  On the other hand, there are social housing supports, which are temporary in nature, while people are waiting to secure long-term and real social housing.  It is a straightforward legislation but it profoundly changes and improves how we think about our social housing system and the supports, albeit temporary, that are provided for people who are waiting for real social housing.  It would give policy clarity to the Government, remove the anomalies and produce a much better and more stable housing system and, on that basis, I am seeking leave to introduce.</p></speech>

Since its formation in 2016, the Government has been working in a unique political environment in the spirit of partnership to deliver our ambition for a better Ireland.  We are now three years into our five-year programme.  In that time, we have made significant strides forward.  There are more people working in Ireland now than ever before.  Incomes and living standards are growing.  There have been consistent reductions in poverty and deprivation, including a 30% reduction in child poverty.  The benefits of our economic recovery are increasingly being spread throughout the country.  </p>  <p>  This third annual report highlights progress on the specific plans put in place in areas including housing, homelessness, education, rural and regional development, job creation, supports to families, agriculture and climate action.  It also underlines the emphasis the Government has placed on ensuring that everyone benefits from our continued economic recovery.  Budget 2019 reduced the level of personal taxation, especially for low and middle-income earners, and the maximum rate of weekly social welfare benefits and State pensions were increased by &euro;5 for the third year in a row.  </p>  <p>  Funding has been prioritised to provide more teachers for schools, more nurses for hospitals and more garda&iacute;.  These are actions that benefit everyone equally in our society.  </p>  <p>  The Irish economy performed strongly in 2018 and job creation was spread across the country with 132,900 jobs created outside Dublin.  The Government has a set of priorities and actions, including the Future Jobs Ireland strategy, that aim to protect our economy and jobs from the implications of Brexit.  Nine regional enterprise plans have been developed to reflect the new challenges, strengths and opportunities that each of the regions currently face.</p>  <p>  Despite this, things are far from perfect.  Much more progress is needed in many areas and often the pace of reform is too slow.  When it comes to homelessness, we are determined to reduce the numbers of people, particularly families, in emergency accommodation.  The solution is increased supply of housing, both homes for people to buy and social housing.  The fact that in 2018 more houses were built than any other year in this decade, and that almost one in four of them was a newly-constructed council house, is a major step forward.  We will maintain this momentum in the years ahead.  </p>  <p>  The annual report acknowledges that, despite many actions implemented, there is still much to be done to improve the area of health and the Government is resolute in its determination to deliver results for citizens in this area.  This is why budget 2019 delivered the highest ever health budget of &euro;17 billion, a &euro;1 billion increase on 2018.  This unprecedented level of investment will make a real difference to the service we can deliver and will allow the health service to deliver better access.  Three years on, the country is very much on the right track and the Government will continue with its ambitious programme over the next two years to invest in, and care for, the country and its people and to lay the foundations for Ireland&rsquo;s future progress.</p></reply>

One was for a fair and inclusive prosperity and the other was a commitment to honour agreements with public sector workers.  On both of those counts, when one looks at those auxiliary health workers, who were forced out on strike, the Government has failed to meet those commitments.  It was apparent and telling that these workers in the National Rehabilitation Hospital were very reluctant to be out on strike because, given the nature of the patients they have to deal with, they have quite a personal relationship with them and any suffering or hardship those patients go through is unpalatable to them.  They felt they had no choice because they had taken a hammering during the austerity period.</p>  <p>  The Government recommended setting up an independent body to evaluate their jobs.  It was that body, and not the health workers themselves, that recommended they should get these increases based on the fact that their jobs had been upskilled and the nature of them had changed.  They have been waiting for those increases, and accepted the waiting time, but they now feel they have waited long enough.  The Government has not honoured its commitments and these people are not getting a fair crack of the whip.  What does the Taoiseach say to them?</p><p>They did not want to be on the picket line but they were determined that the Government had reneged on its promises to them and they were not being treated fairly for the vital work they do in our hospitals.</p></speech>

The programme for Government committed to the implementation of the 2012 national carers' strategy in full and the most recent progress report on the strategy was published in 2017.  However, the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities was ratified by these Houses last year, and it raises the need to significantly revise the national carers' strategy.  The convention places a duty on Ireland to ensure assistance to the parents and caregivers of children and adults with disabilities.  Specifically, the provisions include assistance with disability-related expenses, as well as adequate training, counselling, financial assistance and respite care.</p>  <p>  In advance of the Labour Party's motion on carers tonight, which will deal with a number of related matters, will the Government commit to developing a new or updated national carers' strategy to take account of commitments in the programme for Government and the ratification by this House of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities?</p></speech>

One of those promises is to reduce waiting times for a range of healthcare treatments in specialties right across the board and across regions.  The Taoiseach stated earlier that everybody is benefitting from the recovery, or at least that everybody should benefit from the recovery, but there are certain cohorts who depend on public health services who are not benefitting from any recovery.  One of these consists of people waiting for orthodontic treatment.</p>  <p>  I will give the Taoiseach the breakdown of public waiting times for orthodontic treatment in the south east as of today.  It is 59 months in Carlow-Kilkenny and Wexford and 60 months in south Tipperary and Waterford, meaning the average waiting time is five years to have orthodontic treatment carried out.  Within those classifications of waiting times, the Health Service Executive has had to prioritise crisis cases.  The waiting times in that respect are 20 months in Carlow-Kilkenny and south Tipperary, 18 months in Waterford and 16 months in Wexford.  How can that be the case?  The capacity is not there and we do not have enough orthodontists.</p>  <p>  This is a programme for Government commitment that has not been met as waiting times have increased.  They have doubled in the past five years rather than going down.  Will the Taoiseach outline to the House the extra capacity and resources that will be provided for orthodontic care and treatment to ensure people do not have to wait five years in some parts of this country for orthodontic treatment?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-06-26a.296" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1224" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="14:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019062600028#AA00400"><p>It is striking that as we reach the second anniversary of the Taoiseach taking office, the principal message from Fine Gael is relentless negativity.  With yesterday's economic statements, most people would have expected a message about Government proposals but instead Fine Gael's initiative was to publish yet another attack video on Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party.</p>  <p>  The programme for Government states clearly that the Government will tackle homelessness and bring the crisis to an end.  I heard what the Taoiseach had to say in an earlier reply.  On the day that promise was made, there were 1,881 homeless children but today the figure is over double that, at 3,794.  It is a damning indictment of the Government's inability to deal with the issue of homeless children.  We have seen recent reports detailing the psychological impact on children, the consequences of an absence of security and the effects on their education development etc.  Does the Taoiseach consider that this promise is being delivered?  He has much economic and policy advice available to him.  Has he asked his advisers when the number of homeless children will return to the level existing when the Government took office?  At that stage the Government argued the level was unacceptable and would be reduced.</p>  <p>  We keep coming back to people just asking very basic questions.  The Government has accepted the outcome of the job evaluation scheme and the Taoiseach and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform have said they agree with the recommendations and are willing to pay.  The issue seems to be about implementation.  There is a an absence of transparency and a breakdown of trust between the Government and those representing workers, who are on the low pay spectrum of health service workers.  The broader issue is very poor morale across the board within the health service, which the Taoiseach must acknowledge.  He has not come to grips with it.</p>  <p>  There has been a terrible failure by the Government in providing access to therapies.  Deputy John Curran yesterday got a letter from the HSE about a young child who needs continuing access to occupational therapy and physiotherapy when the child moves to another school.  Deputy Curran was told the child would have to wait for two years for access to essential therapies.  The one defining quality in the area is inertia from the Government when it comes to access to therapies for children with special needs.</p></speech>

When the programme for Government mentions building fair and inclusive prosperity, there are a number of things which the authors, including me, had in mind.  The first was that we would get to a point where there would be employment for anybody who wants it, and we are quite close to that point now, with unemployment down to 4.4%.  We are approaching full employment, which is a massive turnaround from eight or nine years ago and a significant improvement from three years ago.  It was also very much about regional development.  Three years ago one of the major criticisms of the recovery was that it was not reaching all parts of the country.  While we can never have economic growth absolutely even in every part of the country, it is fair to say that in the past three years we have seen economic growth and increased prosperity spread throughout the country in a more balanced way than it was in the past.  We can see that with unemployment going down and employment rising in each county, car sales and many other indicators.  It was also about reducing poverty and deprivation.  According to the Central Statistics Office, the independent body which examines these things, we have now had four years of the rate of poverty and deprivation falling, with child poverty down by about 30%.  These were the kinds of things envisaged when we used the term of "fair and inclusive prosperity".  There is of course more to be done and a journey yet to be travelled, which I acknowledge.</p>  <p>  With regard to today's dispute in the health sector, I refer Deputies to what I said earlier but add that talks will now resume at the Workplace Relations Commission.  I hope those talks will be conclusive in the coming days but if they are not, I still believe the Labour Court is the last port of call and should have been used before this strike happened in the first place.</p>  <p>  It would be timely to update the carers' strategy now, given the passage of time and the fact that the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities has finally been ratified.  I point to some of the significant progress that has been made to support carers better in recent years, including additional respite hours and houses; the full restoration of the carer support grant, which is not means-tested; the &euro;15 per week increase in carer's benefit and carer's allowance; and the new 12 week rule that means somebody who has been a carer but is not a carer any more because the person being cared for passes on or moves into an institution, can continue to receive carer's allowance for three months to allow them the opportunity to get back to work or organise life.  Free GP care has also been extended to all recipients of carer's allowance and carer's benefit, which is significant because carers have their own healthcare needs.  That should not be forgotten.</p><p>It is not possible to do everything we would like to do in any one year but I believe those past three years have seen some real progress.</p> <p> On orthodontics, it is fair to say that we all agree that the current system is not satisfactory.  The new oral health policy points out a pathway by which we can adopt a different approach to oral health.  That is entitled Smile Agus Sl&aacute;inte, and I would encourage Deputies to familiarise themselves with that.</p> <p> I note that Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin accuses me of being relentlessly negative.  He does not usually accuse me of that.  He usually accuses me of being too positive and not willing to accept that there are issues about which to be negative but perhaps I am getting a better balance than I had in the past.</p> <p> In regard to housing and homelessness, as I mentioned earlier, there were just over 5,000 sustainable exits from homelessness into independent tenancies.  That was a significant increase on 2017.  Many more people are being lifted out of homelessness but, unfortunately, a roughly similar number are still becoming homeless every year.  It is not possible to project when the numbers of people in emergency accommodation will fall because we cannot project accurately the number of different reasons people become homeless, and we know from research that they are manifold.  It involves family breakdown-----</p></speech>

There is no Government that can predict the number of people who will enter into homelessness, any more than we can predict how many families will break down.  What we can predict is the number of houses that will be built, particularly the number of houses that will be built by Government.  We added 9,000 units to the social housing stock last year and would anticipate 10,000, or more than 10,000, being added to the social housing stock this year.  That is the biggest programme of investment in social housing in a very long time and I believe it will make a difference in due course.</p>  <p>  So far in the past 12 months alone, there are 22,000 new homes in Ireland, both houses and apartments.  People can see that that increase in housing supply is now having an impact on house prices moderating, and falling in some parts of the country, and not increasing as fast as they were in many other parts also.</p></speech>

The commission is entirely independent in its work and Mr. Justice Brian Cregan is its sole member.</p>  <p>  The commission was originally due to issue its final report by the end of December 2015, at an estimated cost of &euro;4 million, excluding any third party costs.</p>  <p>  The commission is required to investigate certain transactions, activities and management decisions at the IBRC and in its first module it is investigating the Siteserv transaction, which has been identified as a matter of significant public concern in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.</p>  <p>  In the commission&rsquo;s sixth interim report, Mr. Justice Cregan requested an extension of the deadline for reporting until the end of March 2020.  He also responded to several issues that I had raised with him in December last year regarding the estimated final cost of the investigation, the timescale for completion of the commission&rsquo;s work and whether it would be possible for the commission to reach interim findings.</p>  <p>  On 31 May 2019, following completion of consultations with the Opposition party representatives, I agreed to extend the commission&rsquo;s timeframe for reporting until 31 March 2020.  I also arranged for the commission&rsquo;s sixth interim report to be published on my Department&rsquo;s website and laid before the Houses.</p>  <p>  Other than what has been published in the commission&rsquo;s interim reports, I have no information on the status of its investigation as the commission is completely independent in its work.</p>  <p>  Regarding costs, the commission&rsquo;s sixth interim report provides an estimated final cost of the completion of the first module of its investigation, regarding the Siteserv transaction, of &euro;11 million to &euro;14 million.  However, this estimate assumes the investigation is completed in accordance with the timetable set out in the interim report and excludes costs or delays associated with judicial review hearings.</p>  <p>  The commission also acknowledges that it also involves a substantial degree of uncertainty regarding the amount of costs actually recoverable by parties before the commission and it assumes that the commission&rsquo;s legal costs guidelines are not successfully challenged.</p>  <p>  As I have informed Opposition party representatives, my Department continues to be of the view that the final cost is likely to significantly exceed Mr. Justice Cregan's estimate and could be of the order of &euro;30 million.</p></reply>

The Taoiseach is suggesting that the report indicates something of the order of &euro;11 million to &euro;14 million.  Nor can we be in any way confident that the report will be concluded by 31 March next year.  I appreciate that judicial review proceedings are under way that almost certainly will impact on the timeframe the Taoiseach has set out.  We are in the fifth year of this commission of investigation relating to the controversial Siteserv transaction, which is the first module of many.  It might be worth the Taoiseach's time to remind the House the number of modules that are expected.  This is the first one and we do not have a timeline or an end cost on it.</p>  <p>  We have had six interim reports to date.  The commission has not revealed any substantial details surrounding the controversy in the six interim reports over five years.  As the Taoiseach has indicated to the House again, the latest deadline for completion is set for the end of March next year and the cost may be &euro;30 million, but we do not know.  However, it seems that even this extended deadline is in jeopardy.  Mr. Justice Cregan stated in his most recent report that a legal action taken "could pose a significant obstacle to the commission's ability to complete its work by its proposed end date".  </p>  <p>  We need to have an open and clear conversation about where this commission of investigation is going.  How long does the Taoiseach perceive it will be before we finish the first module?  What is his best estimate of that?  Is it intended then to continue on to the many more modules, and at what ultimate cost?  That will enable us to understand when the issues of concern will be addressed and we can have answers to the questions that were posed in this House.  What cost will the full investigation of these matters reach?</p></speech>

That is an extraordinary fact.  It is quite shocking on any reasonable level that it would take so long to investigate a transaction with the objective of ascertaining whether value was achieved for the taxpayer.</p>  <p>  When commissions of investigation were established originally they were meant to be an alternative to tribunals.  They were meant to be a far more cost-effective way of getting the facts of any basic issue identified.  In this context, we amended the legislation to create a particular model to facilitate this investigation and the Oireachtas agreed to that.  To call a spade a spade, whatever one says and whatever one's views are, this has not worked in terms of the objective of investigating one transaction.</p>  <p>  From a democratic and a financial perspective, something needs to be done because the public deserves answers.  The D&aacute;il and the Oireachtas deserve answers in terms of these issues.  I do not know whether it is open to the D&aacute;il to undertake an independent evaluation into the procedures being used and the extent of the areas being covered and whether the Oireachtas can then satisfy itself that it should continue to proceed or look at another way of getting answers to the basic questions that were put in regard to that transaction.  After all, this is about the public having access to all of the information through the Oireachtas.</p>  <p>  I appreciate the fact that the Taoiseach is not in a position to have access to what the inquiry is doing but it would be interesting to know whether core accounting and economic work has been undertaken in regard to the issue.  I was not able to attend that last meeting but I am not clear about the Taoiseach's own views on how it should proceed from here onwards.  I would be interested in his perspective on that.</p></speech>

A balance must be struck between establishing the facts, which is why the commission was established in the first place, and the commission doing its work in a timely and cost effective fashion.  The Taoiseach has brought representatives of all parties and groupings together on several occasions to seek advice, which was the right thing to do.  Advice was given.  I deputised for Teachta McDonald at the last meeting.  I understand that she wrote to the Taoiseach asking that he seek a commitment from Mr. Justice Cregan that the costs be kept to an absolute minimum and that the one-year extension that is being examined be a one year extension and that then we would see a report.  There are risks attached to this, including court challenges and there might be issues outside the control of Mr. Justice Cregan, and ourselves.</p>  <p>  Has the Taoiseach written to Mr. Justice Cregan since that meeting with the representatives of different parties and groupings and, if so, what was the nature of the communication and what was his response?  As others said, there is a reasonable attempt to get information about something important and something which some people see as questionable in terms of process, and establishing the facts and the truth, but also making sure that is done in a timely and cost effective way.  We can all accept that it is not happening to the satisfaction of all parties and groupings in the House including, I imagine, the Government.</p></speech>

The commission was established by the Oireachtas, largely on foot of demands from members of the Opposition.  It is independent and is not being run or directed by the Government in any way.  The time it is taking and the rising cost of the investigation demonstrate the real difficulty in carrying out inquiries into what are ultimately commercial transactions, as well as the need for the need for us to be cautious when we set up commissions of investigation.  Between ten and 20 commissions are currently running and we must ensure that the threshold we set is appropriate.</p>  <p>  On costs and the commission's approach to its work, in its fourth interim report the commission stated that it is open to discussion with the Department of the Taoiseach on how to conduct its work in the most efficient manner possible, consistent with the applicable legislative and constitutional requirements of due process, as to how the duration of its investigation might be shortened.  On foot of this, my officials met the commission to discuss the matter.  As I said, the commission is independent in its work.  It must also be borne in mind that any changes to its terms of reference or the number of modules to be completed as part of its investigation would require both Government and Oireachtas approval.</p>  <p>  As required under the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004, the IBRC commission's legal cost guidelines were prepared at the commission's outset by the Taoiseach as the specified Minister with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and in consultation with the commission.  The fourth interim report said that in its view, the guidelines are inadequate and there needed to be proper consultation between the commission and the Departments of the Taoiseach and Public Expenditure and Reform in order to establish supplemental guidelines to meet the particular needs of persons involved in the commission.  The commission also stated that various witnesses have made submissions to it and are concerned that they will be out of pocket for legal expenses that they incurred in order to comply with the commission's directions and to protect their own good names and reputations.  My Department met with the commission to discuss this proposal for supplemental guidelines, however it is not intended to revise the commission's legal cost guidelines.  In this context, the potential cost implications for other existing or future commissions must also be considered.</p></speech>

To date 55 Opposition Bills are stuck awaiting a money message.  It is increasingly seen as a tool simply to prevent opposition Bills from advancing despite discussions we had at the outset of this D&aacute;il that we would try to equalise the capacity of every Member of this D&aacute;il to bring forward legislation.  Obviously, it would have to be up to a standard, be appropriate and so on.</p><p>Alongside the money message delaying tactic, the Government has adopted a new strategy of bringing in parallel Bills on matters of public interest where the Opposition has already tabled Bills.  Recent examples are Government Bills promised on tips, fur farming and on the gender pay-gap, on which the Labour Party has tabled legislation.  This is instead of working in the spirit of new politics with the Opposition on Bills on the Order Paper.</p><p>I am sure the Taoiseach has seen the opinion of law lecturers Dr. Eoin Daly and Dr. David Kenny in <i>The Irish Times </i>last week outlining how the abuse of the money message provision is constitutionally dubious and could precipitate a constitutional crisis.  They say:</p><blockquote>Article 17.2 exists for a specific and narrow purpose: to prevent the Oireachtas from pursuing a conflicting fiscal agenda and undermining the coherent management of State finances.<br /><br />The phraseology is also quite specific: it refers to laws &ldquo;for the appropriation of revenue&rdquo; which suggests it refers to laws whose purpose is to spend, and not laws which may have the effect of incurring some expenditure.</blockquote><p>Whether it is in the Oireachtas itself or in Departments, a much broader interpretation has been taken of the money message rule than is clearly intended in the Constitution.</p><p>Will the Taoiseach reflect again on this issue?  Is it his view that the money message issue should be resolved so that, even in terms of perception, it is not seen as a device to be used to stop the advance of Opposition legislation.</p></speech>

I am glad that generated quite a significant debate in the following week.  People Before Profit seems to be particularly hard hit by this and I do not believe it is a coincidence.  Our climate emergency measures Bill, medicinal cannabis Bill, Anti-Evictions Bill and objective sex education Bill were all money messaged.  Quite a way back, we introduced the first Bill to ban fracking in this country and, as Deputy Howlin indicated, lo and behold, shortly afterwards a Fine Gael Bill to ban fracking was published, although it permitted offshore fracking to continue.</p>  <p>  In response to this, the Taoiseach said the Ceann Comhairle made the decision and it had nothing to do with the Government.  That is not true when it comes to the climate emergency measures Bill and this needs to be said very publicly.  Last February, after it passed Second Stage, the Ceann Comhairle stated the Bill to keep fossil fuels in the ground did not need a money message.  Subsequently, on Second Stage and during pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill, the Government did not raise any suggestion there was a charge on the Exchequer, not even incidental costs, because it thought it could stop it another way, which it attempted to do by holding it hostage at the joint committee.  We voted to get it back to the committee and just a few days before it was due to go to the committee for scrutiny, the Minister contacted the Ceann Comhairle and said that by the way, 18 months later, there were a few costs through the return of licensing fees and potential legal action.  None of this is true.  We have a legal opinion from barristers to state they are made up costs.</p>  <p>  The Government has misinformed the Ceann Comhairle because there are no licence fees to be returned.  The terms and conditions for licences for gas, oil and exploration are explicit.  They explicitly state the Minister cannot have any actions taken against him or her.  He or she can vary the licences, withdraw, cancel or delay them and do what the hell he or she likes with them and this is set out clearly in the terms for issuing licences.  The Government has misled the Ceann Comhairle in a desperate last-minute effort to apply a money message to a Bill that even it did not suggest needed a money message before and where the Ceann Comhairle had previously concluded it did not need one.  There could not be a clearer example of the subversion and abuse of the democratic and legislative process than this.  This should stop.  The Government should withdraw the suggestion there are costs related to the Bill when they do not exist.</p></speech>

Last week, the Minister, Deputy Zappone, told Senators that she met advocacy groups, lawyers and social workers only the night before to listen to their views on controversial amendments to the Bill.  Adoptees and their advocates were not consulted in the drafting of any of the amendments or before they were circulated to Members.  It is not enough just to listen to and hear arguments against limiting adoptees' rights to their own information.  The Government must now reshape the legislation.  The Minister has committed to delivering a culture of transparency and openness for adoptees but that is not what the Bill provides.  The Adoption Rights Alliance warned that if the legislation proceeds as it is, the Minister will facilitate an egregious step backwards in the era of progressive social change.  Information and contact are two completely different matters and the balancing of rights arguments behind which the Government and Attorney General have hidden are ill-placed and ill-judged.  Why, in 2019, is the State's instinctive response to issues such as this still to be secretive and paternalistic?  How does the Government intend to proceed with the legislation, given that it has been deferred?  Will the provisions of the Bill dealing with access to information be revised and when will this be completed?</p></speech>

At the beginning of this D&aacute;il there was a general view it would be a new era in terms of utilisation of the money message and that it would not be abused.  In fact, the Standing Order subsequently adopted goes further than the Constitution and restricts legislation even more.  The Government has shamelessly abused the money message.  Deputy Boyd Barrett need not develop a victimhood because it has happened to all Bills.</p></speech>

Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Callaghan's judicial appointments Bill was money messaged because the Government had to look after Deputy Shane Ross and his persistence and vendetta against the Judiciary.  There are many more examples.  There is a need to amend the existing Standing Order and Deputy Jack Chambers has tabled a motion to do so to circumvent the abuse going on.</p>  <p>  The political liaison unit has come up at various times in the past and we are slowly getting a picture, which is a lot more complex than the Taoiseach originally informed us.  His opening position was that the unit was there to make sure the entire Oireachtas was consulted.  Eventually, he said the unit is there to liaise only with Deputies who support the Government and is not a general aid to all Deputies.  This raised questions because some Deputies who do not have public deals with the Government appeared to have some formative arrangement with this unit in the Taoiseach's office.  A number of Deputies raised this with the Taoiseach and demanded the full list of Deputies receiving preferential treatment be published, as it had been in every previous Government supported by Independent Deputies.  The Taoiseach said he had no problem telling us who is helped by the unit and on what basis they receive this help but we have still not received this information and there appears to be a refusal to provide it.  Will the Taoiseach explain why this information is being withheld?  It is fairly simple.  Which Deputies who do not have a published arrangement with the Government receive support from the Taoiseach's special unit for helping some Deputies?  We could take this down the route of a freedom of information request but it would look very suspicious if we were forced to go that far to drag this information from the Taoiseach.</p></speech>

I do not have any direct involvement contact with the parliamentary liaison unit but I understand its main involvement is with Ministers rather than Deputies.  It was established to perform a liaison function to help Ministers to be properly informed of the new responsibilities and procedures in the Thirty-second D&aacute;il.  In this regard, the main focus of the unit is to liaise with Departments and advisers on Oireachtas matters, with particular emphasis on assisting Departments with Private Members' business.  It is not the function of the unit to ensure the support of Deputies in the House; that is a political function.  The parliamentary liaison unit provides factual information on D&aacute;il and Seanad issues and on D&aacute;il reform.  Primarily, the unit assists Departments and advisers on Oireachtas matters.</p>  <p>  With regard to Private Members' Bills, as I said previously, perhaps yesterday, it is the Ceann Comhairle's function to decide whether a money message is required and it is entirely within the prerogative of the Ceann Comhairle to make that decision at whatever point he deems appropriate.  Whether they are issued is, of course, a matter for the Government.  In doing so, we always want to make sure the legislation is properly costed in terms of the direct effect on the Exchequer and an effect on the Exchequer that may occur down the line as a consequence of the legislation.  We also need to assess whether those costs are budgeted for and whether the Oireachtas has voted money to meet those costs.  A protocol on money messages has been in place for approximately six months.  It is working relatively well but we agreed to review it at the end of the parliamentary session and perhaps we should do so in the coming weeks or before the next session begins.</p>  <p>  As I mentioned earlier, 11 Private Members' Bills have been passed by the D&aacute;il in the past three years.  Only seven were passed in the entire 20 years before that.  We have seen a step change in the number of Private Members' Bills that have become law.</p></speech>

It is much higher if they are added.  Article 17.2 of the Constitution requires a money message for any vote, resolution or law to be passed by the D&aacute;il involving the appropriation of revenue or any other public moneys.</p><p>The memorandum of understanding, MOU, between the Government and the D&aacute;il on Private Members' Bills provides a framework for decisions to be made by Government on the issuing of money messages.  The MOU acknowledges the role, responsibilities and accountability of the Government under the Constitution regarding public expenditure.  The MOU between the D&aacute;il and the Government states:</p> <p>The Government has a constitutional role in managing the fiscal and executive affairs of the State and is accountable to the D&aacute;il  under Article 28.  The Government has absolute prerogative under Article 17.2 of the Constitution as to whether to grant a Money Message or not.</p> <p> The MOU puts in place a procedure where Private Members' Bills will undergo detailed scrutiny in exchange for a response from the Government on whether a money message will issue or not.  Scrutiny is undertaken by the relevant committee after the Bill has passed on Second Stage.  It constitutes a separate course in advance of Committee Stage.  The Order for Committee Stage cannot be moved until that is completed.  A scrutiny report will then have to be laid before the Houses and the money message is not requested until the Order for Committee Stage is moved.  </p> <p> The Government is committed to providing a response to the Oireachtas within six weeks of receiving the request for a money message.  Currently, 68 Private Members' Bills have been referred to committee.  Of those, 55 require a money message and the Government has provided a response to eight of those.  Money messages issued for the National Famine Commemoration Day Bill 2017, Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2014, Electoral (Amendment) (No. 3) Bill 2014 and Consumer Insurance Contracts Bill 2017, while reasoned responses issued for the Waste Reduction Bill 2017, Local Government (Establishment of Town Councils Commission) Bill 2017, Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2015, and Island Fisheries (Heritage Licence) Bill 2017. </p> <p> Some 15 Bills are still under consideration and a number of committees and sponsors have been contacted by Ministers requesting more time to consider the proposed legislation.  Another 32 Bills are either undergoing, awaiting or have completed scrutiny.  Two Private Members' Bills have received a money message and completed Committee Stage but are not yet enacted.</p></speech>

On Thursday, we met all 28 European Union, EU, Heads of State or Government, to discuss a wide range of issues.  We adopted the new EU strategic agenda for 2019 to 2024, and had a substantial exchange on climate action, as well as the multi-annual financial framework, MFF, the European Semester, and cybersecurity.  We also had a constructive exchange about the high-level appointments to the EU institutions, which are to be made in the coming months.</p>  <p>  Under external relations, we discussed developments in Russia and eastern Ukraine, and Turkish activities in Cyprus's exclusive economic zone.  We also discussed the downing of flight MH17, the eastern partnership, developments in Moldova and relations with Morocco and more generally with Africa.  We endorsed the conclusions on enlargement and the stabilisation and association process, which the General Affairs Council had adopted earlier in the week.  On Friday, we met in eurozone summit formation, to discuss economic developments across the eurozone and the strengthening of economic and monetary union, EMU.  We also had a brief discussion on Friday, in Article 50 format, about Brexit.  The Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, will focus on external relations and enlargement in her remarks.  I will outline our discussions on other issues. </p>  <p>  The European Council began on Thursday afternoon with the customary exchange of views with President Tajani of the European Parliament.  President Iohannis then reported on Romania&rsquo;s work as the holder of the EU Presidency since the beginning of the year.  This was the first time Romania has fulfilled the role of holding the EU Presidency since it joined the Union.  I offer my sincere congratulations to the President and the Romanian Government for their efforts and achievements over the past six months.</p>  <p>  As I have said previously, it is important for the EU to show leadership on climate action, so that we can credibly ask others to follow suit.  This is something that affects different member states in different ways.  We all face different challenges so our discussions on Thursday were long.  They were largely focused on preparations for the UN summit in September, which I look forward to attending.  We all agreed to continue to work towards achieving the objectives of the Paris Agreement and a carbon-neutral EU.  I believe we should not view climate action purely as meeting targets to avoid paying financial penalties.  Climate action is good environmental, social and economic policy as well.  Reducing greenhouse gas emissions will help to stabilise the climate and will give us cleaner air, warmer homes and a better quality of life.  We should, therefore, look to seize the opportunities and this is what our climate action plan, published on 17 June, does.  It sets out an ambitious vision for the country including carbon neutrality by 2050, and a road map as to how we can get there.</p>  <p>  I am happy to report that on Thursday most member states were able to commit to aiming for carbon neutrality by 2050.  However, we have more work to do at EU level over the coming months to prepare the ground for this transition.  We also invited the European Investment Bank, EIB, to invest more and lend more to projects that will help us to achieve these ambitions.  I had an opportunity to discuss this further with the President of the EIB, Werner Hoyer, during my visit to Luxembourg on Friday and Saturday, directly after the European Council.  We had a useful exchange on the MFF &ndash; the seven-year budget for the EU - and agreed to continue our discussions at the next scheduled meeting of the European Council in October with a view to reaching agreement by the end of the year. </p>  <p>  Under the important item of disinformation and hybrid threats following the European Parliament elections, we heard a report prepared by the Romanian Presidency, with contributions from the Commission and the High Representative.  This set out lessons learned from EU activities to counter disinformation campaigns targeting elections.  We agreed that sustained efforts are required to strengthen the resilience of our democracies when faced with disinformation.  We also agreed to continue working together to protect the EU and its member states from hybrid and cyberattacks.  We discussed our objectives and priorities for the next five years and reached a formal agreement on the EU strategic agenda for 2019 to 2024.  </p>  <p>  I am pleased that the paper reflects Ireland&rsquo;s priorities, as outlined in our national statement, discussed in this House on 18 April.  This in turn took into account the views expressed during our citizens&rsquo; dialogue led by the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee.  Our priorities are the completion of the Single Market in all its aspects, with a free trade policy that champions opportunity and a level playing field, developing economic and financial policies that are socially responsible, working to prepare for the social and economic challenges of the digital transformation, ensuring that the EU plays a lead role in climate action and sustainability and, finally, maintaining peace and security, including by developing stronger relationships with Africa and other partners.  The EU strategic agenda provides us with a strong framework to seize the opportunities and meet the challenges that face us and to deliver for our citizens in the years ahead.</p>  <p>  On Thursday evening, we had a long and constructive discussion on the high-level appointments to EU institutions to be made in the coming months.  The President of the European Commission, the President of the European Council, the President of the European Parliament, the President of the European Central Bank, ECB, and the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy must all be replaced, in accordance with the treaties.  Different rules apply to the appointments to the various roles.  The European Parliament will elect its own President, and we have agreed that, given its specific non-political mandate, the appointment of the President of the ECB should be handled separately and not be part of a package.  A candidate for President of the European Commission, however, must have a super majority in the European Council and then an absolute majority in the European Parliament.  No majority was apparent for any candidate on Thursday evening and we agreed to meet again next Sunday evening to resume our discussions.</p>  <p>  We agreed that compromises will be needed to achieve the necessary gender, political, geographic and demographic balance.  From Ireland's perspective, it is also important that suitable and qualified people fill these posts, who have an understanding of Ireland&rsquo;s particular issues and concerns, especially when it comes to Brexit.  It is essential that we come up with a compromise package that reflects the diversity of the EU and that can gain adequate support in the European Council and the European Parliament but also reflects the outcome of the European elections.  </p>  <p>  The current President of the ECB, Mario Draghi, attended his final meeting of the eurozone summit on Friday and I took the opportunity to thank him on behalf of Ireland for his excellent work over the past eight years.  We agreed that finance ministers should continue their work on strengthening EMU, including the budgetary instrument for convergence and competitiveness, BICC.  The new budgetary instrument is a step towards a eurozone budget and will be designed to promote convergence and competitiveness within the eurozone.  I would also like more progress towards a European deposit insurance scheme but I acknowledge that some countries have reservations about this. </p>  <p>  We are working to ensure that the European economy continues to bring increased employment and greater prosperity to our citizens.  Before the European Council ended on Friday, the EU 27 leaders had a brief discussion on Brexit.  We re-affirmed that, irrespective of who will be the next British Prime Minister, our position is unchanged. The withdrawal agreement, including the backstop, is not for renegotiation, and any unilateral commitments by the UK Government must be compatible with the letter and the spirit of the withdrawal agreement.  We are, of course, prepared to amend the political declaration on the future relationship, if the UK position evolves, and we will of course listen to any proposals or ideas the new Prime Minister has.</p>  <p>  The decision of the European Council in April to extend the Article 50 deadline until 31 October was taken to facilitate the cross-party talks in the UK and for a further round of binding indicative votes. </p><p>Regrettably these failed, so a no-deal Brexit cannot be ruled out.  We are, therefore, continuing our intensive preparations at domestic and EU level for the possibility of no-deal.<br/><br/>I had a good bilateral meeting with Mr. Michel Barnier before the European Council on Thursday morning at which we also discussed Brexit.  We noted the strong and consistent<br/><br/>EU position and agreed to stay in touch over the months ahead.  In addition to participating in the formal discussions over the two days, I also engaged informally with many of my EU counterparts in the margins of the meetings, using the opportunity, as I always do, to promote Irish interests.  I was pleased to welcome the new Finnish Prime Minister and the new acting Chancellor of Austria.<br/><br/>I look forward to hearing statements from Members.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-06-26a.333" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1224" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019062600033#FF00200"><p>This was a disappointing summit by any measure.  Its conclusions were largely written well in advance, it failed to agree anything on its major items and there was a setback on what had previously been a consensus on the critical challenge of climate change.  At a moment the EU is on the edge of an economic downturn, faces unprecedented political threats and needs to demonstrate unity and purpose, this was not a summit to encourage anyone.</p>  <p>  The failure to agree on any of the key institutional appointments for the next five years was not a surprise.  These always drag on.  What has been a surprise is the continued attachment</p>  <p>by some leaders to the discredited and undemocratic spitzenkandidat system.  Interviews published yesterday in which the Taoiseach's candidate, Manfred Weber MEP, said that he is the only legitimate choice for the Commission seem to suggest that he and his party put their own interests ahead of finding a widely accepted outcome.  Even if one accepts that the European parliamentary elections are fought on a cross-Europe basis with leaders known to the public - which of course they are not - parties with the support of a quarter of the electorate do not have the</p>  <p>automatic right to control key institutions.  Mr. Weber has not demonstrated that he has the skills needed to lead the Union and form a new bond with citizens.  He has never held any executive role outside of parliamentary management and has never held any role that requires active engagement with the public.  He should have the good grace to stand aside.</p>  <p>  We remind the Taoiseach that the presidency of the European Central Bank is critical for the future of this country and the entire eurozone.  It is inevitable that it will form part of a package with the jobs currently being filled.  Under no circumstance should any person be nominated for the job who has been an opponent of Dr. Mario Draghi's interventionist policies during his term.  We do not want last-minute converts seeking to grab the job with convenient changes of mind.  President Macron's position on this, while unusually strident, is absolutely right and we should support him on this.  Economic and monetary union is incomplete and the ECB needs a leader who understands this, not one wedded to the failed orthodoxies of ten years ago.</p>  <p>  The summit also agreed to return to the issue of the MFF in October, with the intention of reaching a conclusion by the end of the year.  It is not yet clear where these</p>  <p>discussions are going but we believe Ireland should join those countries that are being more explicit in supporting an increase in the Union's budget, particularly to support action on innovation, regional cohesion and climate change.  The budget should not be allowed to become another zero-sum game where the objectives set are ambitious but the financial means are yet again less than 1% of the size of Europe&rsquo;s economy.</p>  <p>  The decision of a small group of countries to block the adoption of ambitious climate change targets is a serious development.  The excuse they used was the need for extra funding for their energy and automotive industries.  If this type of approach is seen during the rest of this year, it will be almost impossible to reach a credible outcome or to move from words to action on key policies.  These countries need to understand that a 2050 climate goal is one every country can, and should, work towards.  The countries with the largest car industries and energy sectors are willing to sign up, so their excuses simply do not wash.  Applying short-term negotiating tactics to leverage a small amount of funding does not impress anyone.</p>  <p>  Of course, a major issue in discussions on the budget is the continued uncertainty about the relationship we will have with the UK.  It is often hard to know just how seriously we</p>  <p>should take comments from the Tory leadership candidates, because they are manifestly using arguments they must know have zero real-world credibility.  In a month there will most likely be a new Prime Minister and there will be no clarity as to what their Brexit policy is, unless Mr. Boris Johnson, MP, is committed to trying to inflict the vandalism of a no-deal outcome on everyone.  As we saw in yesterday&rsquo;s economic statement nothing has been put aside for a no-deal outcome.  No net stimulus is planned or available.  Money earmarked for items such as the health overrun, which is under way, is simply due to be transferred to help sectors that will quickly be caught in a crisis on 31 October.  </p>  <p>  A fortnight ago, the Taoiseach acknowledged, at least implicitly, that Ireland was not ready for a no-deal Brexit in March.  He claimed that the Government was ready, something which simply does not stand up to scrutiny, but admitted that the wider economy was not.  Part of this was his usual tactic of pushing the blame onto others but much of it was an admission that claims that everything that could be done had been done were not true.  As we focus now on the harsh deadline of 31 October, it is time to up the game and for the Government to accept its responsibility to make sure that the disruption to business is minimised.  We need to end reliance on useless metrics such as the numbers viewing websites and take a more active and interventionist approach.  At a minimum, every business that needs to register to continue trading needs to be contacted again and again until action is taken.  Equally, we need to know as soon as possible what is to be</p>  <p>done to help industries and communities experiencing disruption.</p>  <p>  During the recent election campaign, Commissioner Hogan, the Government and Fine Gael candidates issued co-ordinated statements about potential aid for the agrifood industry.  This appeared to break previous accepted limits for action during an election.  More important, however, we need this promised aid to be put in place immediately.  Let us not continue the policy of waiting until all the damage is done before trying to help.  Rather than having a third summer in a row in which the media is filled with the Taoiseach and others making self-congratulatory statements about Brexit, we need a detailed and credible update on Ireland's preparations for all scenarios that might emerge on 31 October or later.</p>  <p>  The summit briefly considered reports on hybrid threats and attempts to undermine free democracies in Europe.  Yet again there have been attempts by one country to promote division, undermine the European Union and support extremists, primarily on the right but also on the left in some countries.  On several recent occasions, Deputy Boyd Barrett has objected when I have pointed to the silence of many of our left wing parties on the issue of Russian aggression against European democracies, in Syria and in support of repressive regimes in many parts of the world.  Because of the structure of these debates, I do not have the opportunity to reply to him.  As such I would like to point out again that I fully appreciate the unique position of the Socialist Workers Party within the Solidarity-People Before Profit alliance as a party of the far left that takes an anti-Putin line.  This is emphatically not a position shared with some other parties and Deputies here.</p>  <p> Far too often we have had to listen to people lecture us about rights and then either fall silent about Russia's aggression or actively justify its behaviour.  Sinn F&eacute;in's pro-partition approach to</p>  <p>Ukraine is particularly striking.  Europe needs to protect its democracies and we need greater urgency in pushing the major social networking platforms to use more of their substantial income to track and take down misinformation and incitement to hatred and division.  This is a restatement of the need to take action to protect the viability of independent journalism as a profession and a viable industry.  Fianna F&aacute;il believes that it is past time for the Government to take up our proposals on this matter.</p>  <p>  We support the Government&rsquo;s strong position on not lifting Russian sanctions and the summit's commitment to standing by Ukraine.  Among other factors, the attempt to strangle Ukraine through closing the Kerch Strait, holding soldiers as hostages and giving Russian citizenship to Ukrainians in the occupied east as well as the refusal to hand over those accused of murdering hundreds on flight MH17 to the Netherlands for trial add up to a situation where nothing has improved and no sanctions should be lifted.</p>  <p>  Regarding Turkey, the Istanbul election result is encouraging but it is necessary to remain firm with the Turkish Government, particularly in light of its growing repression of the Kurdish minority.</p><p>When the Council reconvenes, it should take time to note the deteriorating situation in Israel and Palestine.  The latest so-called peace initiative from the White House is nothing of the sort.  As <i>The Washington Post</i>writes today, it is a policy which seeks the surrender and humiliation of millions of stateless people.  A policy of illegal annexation is under way and an attempt is being made to bury any possibility of a just solution.  It appears also that the more embroiled Prime Minister Netanyahu becomes in legal troubles, the more willing he is to radicalise Israeli politics.  As this happens, the Government cannot sit quietly on the sidelines.  We must reconsider our actions and speak out against what is a very dark turn of events.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-06-26a.335" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="15:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019062600034#GG00200"><p>In the absence of any real development on Brexit, the big news emanating from the European Council last week was the regrettable failure of Heads of Government to find unanimous support in working towards a target of net zero carbon emissions across the European Union by 2050.  That is very worrying.  While the House might disagree on how Ireland will achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050, the vast majority of Members at least agree that we have to get there, that climate change must be tackled and that we are way behind where we need to be in tackling the problem.  That is not just the position in this state, it is also the situation across the European Union.  Why is there such reluctance to tackle the issue at European level?  Why has the Taoiseach's party's own group in the European Parliament voted consistently against Europe-wide climate action measures, including binding renewable energy targets?  The failure to set direct, goal-based, binding targets for member states means that many countries, including Ireland, have simply not bothered to put in the effort required to meet targets.  They know that they can just buy credits to avoid non-compliance.  It is estimated that we will spend upwards of &euro;7 billion from 2020 to 2040 to buy our way out of missing our emissions targets.  That is bonkers.  It is bonkers money which equates to three times the cost of the national children's hospital.  It requires a serious rethink at European Council level and in the European Parliament.  It is incumbent on the Taoiseach as Head of Government to outline the Government's approach in that regard.</p>  <p>  The Mercosur trade deal has been raised with the Taoiseach a number of times today in the House.  It is important to raise it with him again in the context of the European summit.  I noted with interest the contents of the joint letter the Taoiseach sent to the European Commission last week with the President of France, the Polish Prime Minister and the Belgian Prime Minister to outline their concerns about the proposed Mercosur trade deal.  The time for writing letters on the issue has long passed.  My colleague Matt Carty, MEP, has called on the Taoiseach repeatedly to withdraw his support for the deal in recognition of the impact it would have on Irish agriculture.  We had a great deal of debate on the matter in the Oireachtas in the context of the report of the all-party committee on climate change which looked at how we could do more to reduce carbon emissions and transition from a high to a low carbon economy.  There is no doubt that there are challenges in every sector, inlcuding agriculture, in the transition to a low carbon economy, but farmers in Ireland are up for the challenge.  In many ways, they have led the way in transitioning to a more green economy.  One of the things of which we are all proud in this country is that we do farming very well.  If one takes beef production under the family farm model in Ireland as an example, cattle graze and are fed on grass and we do not have a proliferation of the factory farms one sees in many parts of the European Union.  It is the type of farming that is best and that we do well.  We produce some of the best beef in the world.  It is of high quality.  It is the type of farming that serves the country well.  I come from the south east and it certainly serves that region very well.  We are all very proud of the high levels of productivity but also the high standards of Irish farmers not just in the beef sector but also in the dairy sector, as well as others.</p>  <p>  The difficulty with the Mercosur trade deal is that we could end up signing up to a deal which would mean huge amounts of beef being imported into the European Union, even into Ireland if farmers here were forced to reduce their productivity.  In many cases in South America, rain forests are being cut down to facilitate the farming sector.  It would be ironic in the extreme if Irish farmers were told that they would have to do a great deal more, which they accept and for which they are up, in particular, where it would mean a reduction in beef production, while at the same time beef would be imported from other parts of the world which did not operate to the same standards, certainly environmental standards.  That would be self-defeating and would defeat the purpose of what we are doing.  It would be very bad for Ireland.  That is why we have concerns about the deal.  The European Commission is intent on offering a tariff-free EU quota of 99,000 tonnes of Brazilian beef a year.  How many trees will be cut down to facilitate its production?  What quantity of rain forests will have to go?  </p>  <p>  Other sectors are at risk too, including the poultry sector, from the deal, in which I do not see the positives for Ireland.  Certainly, the farmers I have met in County Waterford and the wider south east do not see the positives.  The deal is being pursued solely in the interests of German car manufacturers.  Why then is the Taoiseach playing with words, rather than putting his foot down to stop the deal?  Writing letters is not enough.  Expressing concern is not enough.  It is incumbent on the Government and the Opposition to take the same approach as we took to Brexit, namely, having a clear and unanimous Irish position on protecting the interests of the economy and Irish farmers and doing what is in the best interests of the people of this country.</p>  <p>  I refer to Brexit.  Since the Taoiseach last made a pre-Council statement, the field of Tory leadership contenders has been whittled down to two.  I do not have a particular gr&aacute; for either candidate or their politics, given the party from which they come.  Both have stated their intention to ditch the withdrawal agreement and that they are fine with the prospect of a no-deal scenario.  The real danger is that we will see a great deal more of what we have seen in the past two years with Mrs. Theresa May and I said as much in pre-Council statements.  We went through a tortuous two-year process during which all sorts of make-believe solution were put on the table by politicians in Britain, sometimes with the acquiescence of the Prime Minister because she was playing to different factions in her party.  As a result, we lost vital time in dealing with magic solutions.  It must be made very clear to both contenders and whoever wins that the withdrawal agreement and the Irish backstop are sacrosanct and that we cannot go through two more years of the nonsense we have seen.  Whoever wins the Tory leadership contest and becomes Prime Minister of the United Kingdom will have to deal with the fact that there is no majority in Parliament for a hard crash.  That is the simple arithmetic.  There is no appetite for and there are not the numbers in the British Parliament to support a hard crash.  That must inform the thinking of the new Prime Minister, as well as the thinking of the European Commission and the Government.</p>  <p>  I heard what the Taoiseach said recently about the backstop before and after the Council meeting.  It was very strong and forceful.  He reiterated what was necessary from an Irish perspective, namely, that while there may be scope to discuss the political declaration, the debate on the withdrawal agreement cannot be reopened.  That would be in no one's interests, including those of the British Government.  It is done.  It took two years of very painful negotiations and was a compromise.  We must be very clear in expressing our position to any incoming British Prime Minister that we can no longer indulge them with fantasies or what they call existing technologies which do not exist or solutions they say can be put in place but that do not exist.</p><p> That is the position on Brexit, but we have to wait and see what happens in the Tory leadership election which is not a matter for anybody in this House.  The Tory Party will decide in due course who its leader will be.  The new Prime Minister will have to deal with the Taoiseach, this state and party leaders in the North.  We will deal constructively with whoever that person is as we focus on the need to get the institutions in the North up and running again.  We want the ongoing talks to work and succeed in order that we can get to a place where people's rights can be vindicated and previous agreements made can be implemented.  We have to ensure the voice coming from the North - it is a majority voice coming from Sinn F&eacute;in, the SDLP, the Alliance Party, the Green Party and all those not in favour of Brexit or a hard border - is heard.  We have to ensure the false and fantasy solutions being regurgitated by the two contenders do not gain any traction whatsoever.  We have a great deal of work to do.  I ask the Taoiseach to continue to hold the line on the issue of the Irish backstop as forcefully as he has been doing.  I urge him to continue to protect the withdrawal agreement which people fought hard to negotiate.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-06-26a.337" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1353" speakername="Brendan Howlin" time="15:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019062600035#HH00200"><p>I want to focus in my remarks on the publication by the European Council of its new strategic agenda for the period from 2019 to 2024, inclusive, to which the Taoiseach referred in his remarks.  It is worth recalling the composition of the European Council.  Eight of the 28 Prime Ministers and other Heads of Government from around Europe come from the conservative European People's Party which is the Taoiseach's and Fine Gael's group.  Seven come from the economically liberal ALDE group, now known as Renew Europe, to which Fianna F&aacute;il belongs.  A further seven come from the Labour Party's group, the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats.  The others are Independents or from smaller groups.  Given that there is a clear majority of right-wing Heads of Government, it is not surprising that the Council's new strategic agenda reflects a conservative free market economic policy.  The first priority of the agenda is security and the rule of law, including control of Europe's borders and migration.  There is also a strong commitment to European foreign policy, defence co-operation and support for the rules based international order.  Economic policy is the second priority.  Social policy and environmental policy have been relegated to further down the list.</p><p>There is some hopeful language used in the European Council's document.  There is an important commitment that the European Pillar of Social Rights should be implemented at EU and member state level.  There is an important recognition in the document of the growth of inequality, especially among Europe's youth.  However, limp promises of ensuring &quot;opportunities for all&quot;, &quot;adequate social protection&quot; and &quot;inclusive labour markets&quot; show the lack of appetite among conservative European governments for taking more robust action on these issues.  On the call for &quot;good access to healthcare&quot;, it is easier said than done because there is no suggestion in the agenda of how it might be achieved in every member state.  This highlights the weakest part of the document, the section on implementation.  Essentially, the new strategic agenda commits to <i>laissez-faire</i>free market principles.  It calls for the non-regulation of social and economic actors by the European Union.  It states the Union &quot;must leave economic and social actors the space to breathe, to create and to innovate&quot;.  The implication of the new strategic agenda is that while European leaders recognise the problem of inequality, they cannot agree on measures to address it or they are content to rely on free market forces to resolve the fundamental challenge that has been posed in recent years.  It is a real political challenge to the very survival of the European ideal.  It is certainly not one about which we can be complacent.</p><p>The position adopted in the new strategic agenda is wholly contradictory.  Market forces are the reason there is growing inequality in Europe.  We cannot expect to have so-called &quot;opportunities&quot; and &quot;space to breathe&quot; to resolve the visible failures of free markets.  Recent examples of so-called &quot;innovation&quot; in the economy have included zero-hour contracts, the replacement of workers by automation and speculative investment in housing that is driving up the cost of housing across Europe without adding any value.  We have spent the last five years legislating to reduce the harm caused by these innovations in the economy and thereby protect citizens.  There is no reason to believe the market will produce better innovations in the next five years than it has in the last five.</p><p>European leaders should focus on agreed regulations to steer the economy in a new direction that will rebuild the momentum of and support for European ideals.  As others said, this is an even bigger concern when it comes to climate change.  The Labour Party welcomes the pledge to make sure no one will be left behind by the changes to the economy being made in response to the required transition to a low or zero carbon economy.  The European Union has the potential to be a world leader in environmental policy.  The big test of this approach will be when powerful economic interests have to be curtailed to protect biodiversity and the oceans.  There is almost nothing in the strategy that suggests the European Union will push forward with an ambitious agenda to regulate the economy in new ways or channel economic activity into sustainable action.  There is no reason to think it will make exceptional advances in the crucial period ahead.  This is extremely worrying, given that international experts have told us that we have just 12 years left in which to make substantial changes to economies to meet our climate change goals.  All of these matters are of fundamental importance.</p></speech>

Many of these violations have been led and organised by rapid support forces drawn from the old Janjaweed militia who have engaged in beatings, rape, torture and killings.  They have fired live ammunition in hospital wards.  They have been responsible for the widespread dumping in the River Nile of the corpses of murdered people.  They have been funded by the European Union to the tune of millions of euro to curb migration from Sudan to the European Union.  Was there any discussion at the European Council meeting on the ending of these payments to such a murderous force?  EU member states have supplied weaponry on a mass scale to the Saudi regime.  Some of these weapons have ended up in the hands of the Sudanese armed forces and been used to gun down Sudanese protestors.  Was there any discussion at the European Council meeting on the ending of arms sales by EU countries to the Saudi regime?  Were decisions made at the meeting in that respect?</p><p> I salute the masses of the Sudanese people whose uprising and revolution ended the regime of the hated dictator.  However, as is so often the case in the first phase of a revolution, the dictator fell but state power remained in the hands of his associates - in this case, the army officers of the so-called transitional military council.  When the transitional military council launched bloody attacks on the people at the start of June, the response was truly heroic.  The repression was met by a two-day general strike, which featured powerful strikes by port workers, oil field workers and pilots among others; the building of barricades in Khartoum made of bricks and burning tires; the blocking of bridges; and the spread of this type of neighbourhood resistance nationwide.  It has become increasingly clear that the real power in the land and the protector of democratic rights and freedoms is the masses of the Sudanese people, led by the urban working class.  The strike committees in workplaces and the neighbourhood committees that organise the resistance on the barricades have the potential to provide the foundation of a new genuinely democratic and socialist government in that country.  We support the organised self-defence of the Sudanese people, who can appeal to the ordinary rank-and-file soldiers to join the revolution, disarming the regime and brushing it aside.  There must be the release of all political prisoners; one person, one vote; the return of all troops from Yemen; the scrapping of military and security budgets with the money being put into health, education and jobs; nationalisation under workers' control of all the companies and assets of the old regime; a free, democratic and socialist Sudan that recognises the self-determination of all oppressed minorities and ethnic groups; and the spreading of such a change to all neighbouring countries.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-06-26a.340" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1291" speakername="Maureen O'Sullivan" time="16:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019062600036#JJ00200"><p>It was a sad reflection when we saw the EU's inability to sort out the top job as there was no majority for any one candidate.  However, there is an essential lack of democracy in that process.  The EU electorate does not have a direct role in who gets the top jobs in the EU.  I noted one positive, namely, President Tusk's remark that the European Council agrees that there needs to be a package reflecting the diversity of the EU.</p>  <p>  It was surprising in one way but not in another that unanimity was not reached on ensuring a climate-neutral EU in line with the Paris Agreement by 2050.  Again, listening to what President Tusk said, no country ruled out the possibility of achieving this so he is hopeful of a positive decision in the coming months.  When I read about taking account of member states' national circumstances and respecting their right to decide their own energy mix, it raised alarm bells that some countries might be able to slide further down the scale when it comes to climate change.  We also need more detail about how the EU will scale up the mobilisation of international climate finance from private and public sources because, again, we wonder what agenda private-public sources are working to.</p>  <p>  It is also a sad reflection that we are not seeing in a real way that the EU will be a driver on climate change.  It must get into the main driving seat on that.  This is the only planet we have.  I have recently become aware of Costa Rica due to a personal situation.  There is a significant example for us in that country.  We look at the militarisation of the EU.  Costa Rica actually forbids an army and has had no army since 1949.  It also has plans to be carbon-neutral by 2021.  It takes up 0.03% of the planet but hosts 5% of the world's biodiversity.  At one stage, it was third in the world and first in the Americas on the Environmental Performance Index, so there are good examples there at which we could look.  This is imperative, particularly when we consider the very ambitious agenda for the sustainable development goals by 2030.  I would hope that the EU would have that as a continuing item on its agenda.  </p>  <p>   I have a great problem with sanctions because at the end of the day, they hurt ordinary people the most.  The richest people are rarely affected by them.  Economic sanctions against Russia will continue for a further six months but it is ironic that the Council of Europe took a very different approach just recently.  We know the US sanctions against Iran are hitting ordinary people.  I have previously referred to how the long-standing US sanctions against Cuba are having a disastrous effect on the Cuban economy.  </p>  <p>  The strategic agenda sets out four priorities.  One is a strong and vibrant economic base while the other was promoting European interests on the global stage.  I want to look at those two in terms of trade agreements the EU has been and is negotiating.  There are concerns about the EU-Vietnam trade deal regarding serious consequences for workers, not to mention climate issues.  The investor-state dispute settlement, ISDS, mechanism is included.  This is a system that threatens public budgets and the environment.  It means that foreign investors can use the ISDS to sue governments.  Two oil firms have already used it to avoid paying taxes in the country.  One of the current ISDS cases against Vietnam involves two companies suing the Vietnamese Government over a takeover of one particular company.  One of the companies involved made a profit of &euro;787 million on the sale but is refusing to pay taxes.  We know that foreign investors can use the ISDS to sue a government, which has an effect on budgets.  There is a similar ISDS case in Croatia and another one in France where a company was able to weaken a climate change law by threatening to bring an ISDS case.  We have raised that in the Chamber quite a number of times over the past number of years.  There has been much criticism of the ISDS - mainly because it is biased in favour of the interests of the investors at the expense of the public interest.  The public can sue companies on human rights issues or labour rights.  The EU has not listened to the criticism and concerns.  With this EU-Vietnam trade deal, there is no obligation on EU companies and corporations to respect human rights, which is very serious.  </p>  <p>  A free trade agreement is being negotiated with the Mercosur bloc encompassing Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay.  I will refer to a letter from over 350 civil society organisations to the EU asking it to halt the negotiations because of the deteriorating human rights and environmental conditions in Brazil.  It follows a call in April from 600 scientists and representatives from 300 Brazilian indigenous groups asking the EU to support human rights and sustainable development in the face of increased human rights violations and threats to indigenous peoples and their lands in areas that are very valuable ecologically.  Civil society is under severe threat in Brazil.  The Brazilian President's campaign of ending any form of activism is being implemented, which means that the Brazilian Government has the power to supervise and monitor the activities and actions of international agencies and NGOs in the country.  The foreign affairs minister and the environmental minister are also global warming deniers.  The Brazilian department of climate change was abolished.  As the EU is Brazil's second largest trading partner, I feel the EU is not taking its responsibilities seriously when it comes to human rights.  It seems to be a case of negotiating the best deal for Europe regardless of what is happening.  Further deforestation must end.  Will it, labour and human rights and climate issues be discussed or does promoting European interests, which is on the strategic agenda, take precedence over European values?</p>  <p>  During pre-European Council statements last week, I referred to the protection of migrants.  I recently put a question to the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade on the Libyan detention centres.  The centre in question concerned the Qasr bin Ghashir detention centre.  Since then, there have been reports of two other centres south of Tripoli in the Nafusa Mountains - Zintan and Gharyan.  M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res, MSF, was recently granted access and found catastrophic medical situations that were confirmed by the UN agencies with 22 dead from suspected TB and other diseases since last September.  MSF visited Zintan detention centre where 900 people are detained in May.  Seven hundred people were housed in an overcrowded hangar while there were four barely functioning toilets and sporadic access to water that was not even drinkable.  </p><p>The Gharyan centre is on the front line of the conflict between the Libyan Government and the Libyan National Army.  These migrants fled harrowing situations in their own countries.  They have had harrowing situations with traffickers.  Now they are in further harrowing situations in the detention centres.  While it might be stated policy not to return migrants there, the EU is facilitating this illegal pushback to Libya.  The EU is not proactive enough in dealing with these issues and preventing such atrocities.  The strategic agenda referred to effective migration and asylum policy.  Surely, respect for the human dignity of migrants is central to that.</p> <p> The strategic agenda also reaffirmed the importance of the eastern partnership.  Our foreign affairs committee made an official visit to Georgia and we know the extent of the work it has done on this.</p> <p> Also noted in the strategic agenda was a reference to fostering entrepreneurship, innovation and increased research efforts.  Several weeks ago on Leaders&rsquo; Questions, I raised the issue of access to medicines.  The EU could take on a more progressive model in research and development.  Currently, it is not driven by affordability or accessibility.  There is a massive escalation and extortion with regard to prices of life-saving drugs.  For example, one company claimed it could produce a drug for &euro;150 million while another, big pharma, said it would cost &euro;2.5 billion for the exact same drug.  Reform is needed in this area because the universities and research institutes are publicly funded in the main.  However, when it goes to the pharmaceutical companies, more conditions need to be attached.  There are less expensive biosimilar alternatives.  At the 2016 European Council, under the Dutch EU Presidency, strong recommendations were passed for this kind of reform.  It would be a positive sign if a working group was established to drive these recommendations further.</p> <p> The strategic agenda stated, &ldquo;The EU also needs to take greater responsibility for its own security and defence, in particular by enhancing defence investment, capability development and operational readiness; it will co-operate closely with NATO&rdquo; and then later it stated, the EU &ldquo;will respect the principles of democracy, rule of law, transparency and equality between citizens&rdquo;.  I do not believe the two complement each other.  On one hand, we are looking at a military solution, while on the other we are looking at more of democracy with increasing militarisation.</p></speech>

The European Council agreed a strategic agenda for the EU for the next five years.  I wonder how the Council got around to agreeing this, especially with the backdrop of what is happening with our neighbours across the water and their ongoing deliberations regarding Brexit.  The strategic agenda sets out the priority areas which will steer the work of the European Council and provides guidance for the work programme of other EU institutions.  The strategic agenda focuses on four main pillars of priority.</p><p>Pillar 1 concerns protecting citizens and freedoms.  That is fine on paper but there are significant issues such as the persecution of Christians and some minority Muslim populations.  The EU, as well the Government and this Parliament, has not had any meaningful debate on this matter.  We seem to ignore it.  It is remiss of us that we have not had any practical debate on this matter.  The only debate was several years ago on a Holy Thursday - an appropriate date &ndash; when the Ceann Comhairle allowed it raised as a triple Topical Issue matter.</p><p>The second priority is to develop a strong and vibrant economic base.  Again, with the onset of Brexit and the challenges it poses, this goal looks wonderful and admirable on paper.  How is it going to be achieved, however, in the choppy waters when Britain leaves the EU in Hallowe&rsquo;en?  There are significant challenges ahead, particularly for the agricultural economy.  To add to that we have the whole green dream.  There has been a knee-jerk reaction to climate change all of a sudden.  Who is blamed?  The Irish farmers and rural dwellers.  We are the vagabonds, the polluters.  Nothing can be further from the case when many aspects of government are responsible.  The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, for example, refuses to allow bus lanes to be created on the way into Dublin.  The Minister, Deputy Ross, will not countenance such obvious solutions which are as plain as the nose on one&rsquo;s face.</p><p>Pillar 3 addresses creating a neutral, green, fair and social Europe.  We are not neutral any more.  Who are we codding?  It is a case of rose-tinted glasses.  We are not fair.  The Government thinks we are greenhorns but we are not.  This green agenda has to be dealt with holistically and equitably.  Every sector should take its own responsibility.</p><p>Pillar 4 is about creating and promoting European interests and its values in the world.  One has to wonder what the interests are when one sees the Mercosur deal.  I met with beef and suckler farmers this morning, some from the Acting Chairman&rsquo;s constituency.  They are facing wipe-out.  There is a &euro;100 million package from the EU with &euro;50 million backed up by the Government.  However, no one knows what the guidelines are.  No one knows how to get a penny of it.  Are the dairy producers who are overstocked going to get part of this too?  What will be left for a sector vital to the rural economy and villages?  After much pressure, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, announced the programme but there is no sign of how it will be drawn down or will it be equitable.  When it reaches the farm gate, will it even provide the price to buy two new farm gates or will it just be a few hundred euro?  Again, it is lovely glossy PR document and spin.</p><p>Much of these pillar points are fine in principle.  As I said at the pre-Council statements, however, we will need to see a far greater amount of detail, specifically when it comes to the building of a climate-neutral Europe.  As the document states, the EU can and must lead the way in this by engaging in an in-depth transformation of its economy and society to achieve climate neutrality.  It must, however, be conducted in a way that takes account of national circumstances and is socially just.  That is the key requirement of the strategy which must not be lost sight of.  There is not much social justice coming from EU policies.  That is why we probably have Brexit.  We know that this will present us with significant challenges when it comes to the agrifood sector.</p><p>The new strategic agenda clearly stated:</p><blockquote>The EU also needs to take greater responsibility for its own security and defence, in particular by enhancing defence investment, capability development and operational readiness; it will co-operate closely with NATO, in full respect of the principles set out in the Treaties and by the European Council.</blockquote><p>This is the kind of alarming talk to which I referred earlier.  I am sure it will set off alarm bells for the Minister of State as well.   Such talk has caused controversy in this House with respect to our involvement with European militarisation and the threat to our neutrality to which I have referred.  This kind of speech is downright dangerous and very provocative.  It is as clear as night gets dark or daylight comes in the morning that our Government, our Taoiseach, and Deputy McEntee, as the Minister for State with responsibility for European affairs, should say that although we are part of the European movement and we are a neutral country.  We are being sucked into travelling down this road in our rush to be good Europeans and to curry favour with our European friends in advance of Brexit.</p> <p> I agree, however, with the strategic agenda's emphasis on jobs.  We need a strong economic base given that it is of key importance for Europe's competitiveness, prosperity and role on the global stage.  I also agree with the view that as technological, security and sustainability challenges reshape the global landscape, we need to renew the basis for long-term sustainable growth and strengthen cohesion in the EU.  The only part of the Council's statement that concerns me is its intention to ensure that we deepen EMU in all its dimensions, complete the banking and capital markets union, and strengthen the international role of the euro.  This is, again something on which we will need to see much more detail given the potential that economic union has to disrupt the entire economies of smaller nations like our own.</p> <p> The wording is quite bland, but also quite stark.  The strategic agenda refers to "deepening the Economic and Monetary Union in all its dimensions, completing the Banking and Capital Markets Union and strengthening the international role of the euro".  That should ring as hollow with the Minister of State and with her predecessors as it does with me.  It sticks in my craw.  When we needed a bailout, we got a total clean-out.  When the IMF would lend us money at 2.9%, our so-called friends and colleagues in Europe charged us 5.9% or 6%.  We are still paying that back while the bondholders were let off unscathed.  They are laughing all the way to the bank because not only did the bondholders receive their money but they had insurance policies that would have repaid them for the collapse.  The German and French banks shovelled money into Ireland when we knew that Rome was burning and that Ireland was facing economic meltdown.  Where were our friends then?  They told us to hump off.  They fleeced us and they are still fleecing us.  Where is the economic cohesion there?  Where was the fairness and equity?  Where was the support of our sister and brother countries in the European Union - n&iacute; neart go cur le ch&eacute;ile?  Where was the support for little Ireland then?</p> <p>It was nowhere to be seen.</p></speech>

Each group will have three minutes.  I call Deputy Haughey for Fianna F&aacute;il.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-06-26a.345" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1360" speakername="Se&aacute;n Haughey" time="16:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019062600038#LL00300"><p>The national statement on the future of Europe was discussed in the House on 18 April.  I appreciate that this followed consultation throughout the country initiated by the Minister of State and European Movement Ireland but that statement is very technical.  It is not very creative or imaginative.  Perhaps it is realistic.  In any event, this has fed into Ireland's position on the EU's strategic agenda for 2019 to 2024.  I will follow up on something Deputy Howlin said.  Does the Minister of State agree that the strategic agenda is a very conservative document in its outlook?  It involves a reassertion of free market principles.  Deputy Howlin was quite critical of it.  What is the Minister of State's response to that criticism?  I am certainly sympathetic to Deputy Howlin's point of view.</p>  <p>  My second question is on the filling of the European posts: the President of the Commission, the President of the European Council, the President of the European Parliament, the President of the European Central Bank, and the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy.  There is speculation that at the heart of this impasse is a dispute between Germany and France on the very future of Europe and the direction it is going to take.  Does the Minister of State accept that, having regard to the state of negotiations, the candidacy of Manfred Weber is over and that he is out of the running?  Frans Timmermans of the socialist grouping is a realistic possibility for President of the Commission, as is Margrethe Vestager of the liberal grouping.  Is there any possibility that Michel Barnier might come through this process?  What is the Government's view in that regard?  Basically I am asking what is Ireland's position on these negotiations.  I know we are only a small country, but I presume we have a view.  Perhaps the Minister of State will be prepared to disclose that to us.  </p>  <p>  My third and final question relates to the possibility of a no-deal Brexit and the avoidance of a hard border.  At the same time the European Council meeting was being held, the European Commission published a paper on the importance of the backstop for the future of North-South co-operation.  The Northern Ireland Department for the Economy has published a similar report with regard to threats to trade between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland and to the complex set of relationships between the two.  During the Conservative Party leadership contest we keep hearing talk of a technological solution, maximum facilitation, and so on, which is worrying.  With regard to the two reports to which I have just referred, there are 145 areas of North-South co-operation.  All of that is under threat in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  It is obvious that a backstop is necessary and that a no-deal Brexit would be devastating.  Will the Minister of State assure the House that the solidarity of our EU partners is fully secured in respect of the backstop and the avoidance of a no-deal Brexit?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-06-26a.346" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1291" speakername="Maureen O'Sullivan" time="16:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019062600038#LL00400"><p>I am just looking for a response to three of the issues I brought up earlier.  The first related to the detention centres in Libya.  How does what is being allowed to happen there tie into the EU having an effective migration and asylum policy?</p>  <p>  The second issue relates to free trade agreements and the lack of interest and commitment when it comes to human rights and workers' rights.  It took a long time for Ireland to get its business and human rights policy together and for the committee to be appointed.  I am not to sure if the committee has met yet or if it is planning to meet but at least the chair and, I believe, the members have been appointed.  Unless labour rights, human rights, and workers rights are built into free trade agreements, the State is only paying lipservice to the notion of rights.</p>  <p>  The third issue relates to the EU being the driver of action on climate change.  Is the Minister of State confident that will happen?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-06-26a.347" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1337" speakername="Helen McEntee" time="16:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019062600038#LL00500"><p>I will start with Deputy Haughey's questions.  On the question of Brexit and a no-deal scenario, as he said, this poses both great economic threats and great political threats to North-South relationships and our east-west relationships with the UK.  We have set a very clear benchmark as to why the backstop is necessary.  It is there to protect the Good Friday Agreement, the areas of co-operation which the Deputy rightly mentioned, and our all-island economy.  It also protects the Single Market and the customs union.  Alternative arrangements have been proposed by different groupings, some of which are independent of the UK Government.  The current Prime Minister and sitting government also put in place a group to consider alternative arrangements.  What we have seen so far focuses on technical solutions that do not address or reach the very clear benchmarks we and the UK have set, benchmarks to which the EU is very committed.</p>  <p>  As to whether we still have solidarity, we absolutely do.  Last week's meeting of the European Council is the first I have attended at which Brexit was not top of the agenda.  It did not take over much of the discussion.  The very clear and simple statement from Donald Tusk was that we will be willing to engage on the political declaration on our future relationship if there is movement from the UK, but that we will not move on the withdrawal agreement, which includes the backstop, the financial settlement, and citizens' rights.  Regardless of what is said in the midst of the current contest and irrespective of who becomes the next prime minister, it is clear that the facts will not change.  The past three years will not change.  The agreements reached in negotiations cannot be changed, with the exception of the political declaration on the future relationship.</p><p>On the EU posts and positions, I cannot tell the Deputy who might get what position.  EU leaders, meeting last week, spoke for a long time and no candidates were eliminated.  Nobody was voted on, but obviously no conclusions were reached.  There are a number of moving parts in this regard.  The Taoiseach earlier spoke about five positions.  The European Central Bank post will most likely be dealt with separately, but the positions in the European Parliament, the Council, the Commission and the High Representative will be presented, most likely as a package, at the same time.  The European Parliament has the ability to approve or reject the proposals for the European Commission as well.</p> <p> Going back to what Deputies Howlin and Maureen O'Sullivan said about people do not having a say in this, 751 MEPs have a very clear and direct say and the Heads of Government from all member states have a very clear say in this extremely important matter.  There will be considerable discussion this week with all the Heads of Government, including Ireland's.  We have a voice and we are very clear that there needs to be a geographical balance, a political balance and absolutely a gender balance.  In line with the treaties we need to ensure that smaller member states are represented and, of course, we need the best people for the jobs, irrespective of whether they come from the proposed Spitzenkandidaten, Ms Vestager, Mr. Timmermans and Mr. Weber.  The EPP has come out again today to express our support for Mr. Weber as our lead proposed candidate.  We need to see how the discussion goes next Monday.  The sooner we can put this in place the better, with the Finnish Presidency starting on 1 July.  The suite of Commissioners also must go through the committee stages and the questioning by the European Parliament to allow business to move on as quickly as possible.  It is extremely important given the context in which we find ourselves.</p> <p> Our national statement fed into the EU strategic agenda, in the same way as did the statements of the other 27 member states.  While it may not seem that everything is reflected, overall we are happy with the agenda that has been set, particularly the focus on progressing the economy and the Single Market, and ensuring that we continue to do what we are doing right.  We need to look at the new priorities and challenges we are facing, including climate and the changing world around us, our engagement and our relationships with our neighbours.  We also need to consider education for our young people.  I am pleased to see today's announcement that 114 universities throughout Europe will be working more collaboratively.  DCU and Trinity College have been selected as two of those universities and I wish them every success in that regard.</p> <p> Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan asked three questions.  The EU - this includes an Irish voice - has clearly called for the detention centres in Libya to be shut down because as the Deputy rightly said they are not fit for purpose.  We would not want anybody to be detained in those conditions.  We are dealing with a very challenging issue in general in Libya.  While the EU policy is not to direct migrants back to Libya, the EU is working with the Libyan coastguard and is helping to train them with human rights a key focus in that training.  They are doing that inasmuch as they can, but also ensuring that where migrants are returned, where possible they are returned to the country from which they have come if it is not Libya.  Considerable work is ongoing in that regard at the moment.</p> <p> On the free trade agreement, we have only just established the new European Labour Authority for the European Union and Slovakia was selected as its base.  We take workers' rights very seriously.  At the moment there is no clear link to free trade agreements.  However, the closer we are and the more engagement we have with either groupings of countries or individual countries, be it on a bilateral basis or otherwise, the more engagement we can have not just on trade issues, but also on human rights issues.  We can use that as a forum and a platform to work through and provide support, financial or otherwise, where there are challenging situations to try to improve any member state where it seeks that and where we can help it.</p> <p> On climate, there is a priority from a European point of view that we are not just trying to catch up on targets, but we are actually setting the agenda and leading the agenda.  Last year the Commission published a document clearly setting out that we do not just want to reach our own targets, but that we want to be leaders on the global stage.  While there was some disagreement between member states at last week's Council meeting, we need to take into account that individual member states have challenges in reaching targets.  Ireland is very clear.  The document we launched last week, which has involved months of extensive consultation among political groupings and Independents here, as well as working with the Departments, sets out not just our targets to reduce our emissions by 2030, but also how we will reach climate neutrality by 2050.  The Commission's document does not set out the targets for reduction of emissions for 2040 and 2050, but we want to work towards that.  We have a number of opportunities, particularly at the UN climate meeting, which is taking place in September, to restate our position and our ambitions.  We need to be as ambitious as we possibly can be.  We acknowledge there are challenges and Ireland has its own challenges in reaching those targets just as other member states do.  We need to work together to help one another to try to reach those targets.</p> <p> The Taoiseach mentioned a number of issues which were addressed at the European Council.  In my wrap-up remarks, I wish to focus on enlargement and the external relations that were discussed last week.  On external relations we discussed a range of issues, including developments in Russia and Ukraine; Turkish activities in Cyprus&rsquo;s exclusive economic zone; the eastern partnership; recent developments in Moldova; the EU&rsquo;s relationship with Africa, including with Morocco and Libya; and the fifth anniversary of the downing of flight MH17.</p> <p> We agreed to roll over the sanctions against Russia in light of the ongoing situation in eastern Ukraine, and the fact that the Minsk Accords have not been fully implemented.  I know Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan also raised the issue of the Council of Europe.  She is right in saying that we need to ensure that we try to protect the individuals on the ground.  I believe that is why the decision was made in terms of the voting rights for the Council of Europe. </p> <p> We discussed Turkey&rsquo;s ongoing illegal drilling activities in the eastern Mediterranean.  We again called on Turkey to cease such activities and to respect the sovereign rights of Cyprus.  From Ireland&rsquo;s perspective, we stand in full solidarity with Cyprus.  Together with our EU partners, we will continue to monitor developments closely and to respond appropriately.  The Taoiseach made a very clear statement at the Council last week.</p> <p> In terms of the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of Ukraine, which Russia continues to breach through its illegal annexation of Crimea and Sebastopol, we fully support the decision to roll over the sanctions.  The European Council noted that 17 July will mark the fifth anniversary of the tragic downing of flight MH17, which claimed 298 lives, including an Irish citizen.  Leaders welcomed the announcement by the joint investigation team on 19 June that criminal charges will be brought in the Netherlands against four individuals.</p> <p> Leaders also took the opportunity to mark the tenth anniversary of the eastern partnership and agreed that work should proceed on a further set of long-term policy objectives in advance of the next eastern partnership summit.  Ireland supports this programme, which has matured in a challenging geopolitical environment, while helping to promote security and prosperity in the region.  In advance of the European Council, I hosted an event in Government Buildings to mark the anniversary.</p> <p> I am pleased that leaders also agreed on the importance of the EU's strategic partnership with Africa, and committed to further developing these ties.  Ireland has been active in calling for this and we highlighted it as a priority in discussions over the next EU strategic agenda.  It builds on the positive engagement at the first EU-African Union meetings that took place at ministerial level and the EU-African Union summit held in Abidjan in November 2017.</p> <p> Given the EU&rsquo;s focus on ensuring Libya&rsquo;s peace and long-term stability, I am pleased that leaders reiterated our support for the UN-led political process to bring about a peaceful resolution and a political transition there.</p> <p> The European Council also welcomed the renewed impetus in EU-Morocco relations.  Ireland's bilateral relations with Morocco are strong and we intend to open an embassy in Rabat in 2020.</p> <p> I attended the General Affairs Council on 18 June where we adopted conclusions on the enlargement and stabilisation and association process.  Leaders endorsed these conclusions at the European Council last week.</p> <p> From an Irish perspective, we welcome the findings of the Commission&rsquo;s annual enlargement package, including the recommendations to open accession negotiations with the Republic of North Macedonia and Albania.  North Macedonia has made significant progress on key reforms.  Due to its importance, leaders agreed to return to this issue in October.</p><p>The issue of Albania is obviously more complex, but progress has also been made in this area.  It is extremely important that we be able to give both countries a positive signal when we return to this issue in October.</p> <p> As the Taoiseach said, it was a lengthy series of meetings at the European Council at which a huge number of issues were discussed.  I thank all Deputies for their statements and assure them that the Taoiseach and I will continue to report to the House in advance of these meetings.</p></speech>

Many constituents in my area have rung me in disgust at the idea that rain could be the reason sewage is discharged into the sea.  It is not as if this is an isolated example.  It happened earlier this year and has happened repeatedly over many years.</p>  <p>  I took the time to look back at the Irish Water business plan from 2015, four years ago, in which Irish Water identified 44 wastewater agglomerations where discharges were taking place nationally, 43 of which did not comply with secondary treatment requirements.  Irish Water identified the critical problem relating to the discharge we are discussing, which was the lack of capacity at the Ringsend wastewater treatment plant.  It is massively over capacity.  That was identified four years ago and Irish Water stated it was going to do something about it.  It is still happening and, although there are plans in train for the upgrade and so on, it will still be another year, according to Irish Water, before anything happens to stop this.  It is not acceptable.</p></speech>

There have been discharges of sewage of various types into the bay 15 times in the past year.  The fact that it is only noticed several days after the fact means people are swimming in sewage.</p>  <p>  I am keen to hear the Minister of State's views on same day testing all year round.  People swim, surf and do everything in Dublin Bay all year round.  We should have same day testing all year round.  I want to know from the Department if that is being advanced and funded as needs be.</p>  <p>  We also need to know the exact technical reason this is happening.  Is there anything that can be done other than waiting for the new sewage plant in north Dublin or the expansion of the existing site?  We need to know if that will solve the immediate problem in Ringsend or whether the cause is that the other parts of the plant cannot cope with the volume, particularly when there are heavy rains causing sewage and rainfall water to mix together with the overflow tanks unable to cope.  We need details on this and on the timeline offered for solutions.  We also need details on the public information aspect so we are not getting notice several days after the fact and do not have to close all our beaches for several days after that until further updates come into place.</p>  <p>  This issue is enormously significant for the people of Dublin where access to our bay is one of the best things about the city.  We cannot tolerate the ongoing problem in Ringsend and the Government needs to take proactive measures to try and avert it.</p></speech>

The issue has been raised at Leaders' Questions this week so I am conscious there is information out there but I am happy to put more information on the record and tease out some of the issues around it.</p>  <p>  On Tuesday, 24 June, Dublin City Council and D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council both issued temporary bathing prohibition notices for local bathing waters.  Notices are in place on Dollymount Beach following a storm water overflow from Irish Water's Ringsend wastewater treatment plant and at Seapoint, Sandycove and the Forty Foot bathing areas following storm water overflows at a number of locations in the bay area of south Dublin.  These are specific and temporary bathing water notices and have been issued as a precautionary measure to protect people, pending water test results.  This form of notice is required by the bathing water quality regulations.</p>  <p>  Separately, the status of Sandymount and Merrion Strand is classified as poor and these bathing waters will have a bathing water restriction in place for the entire 2019 season due to more complex pollution issues.  This is unrelated to the recent overflow from the Ringsend plant.  </p>  <p>  Under the bathing water quality regulations, responsibility for water quality testing at bathing waters lies with the relevant local authorities.  The frequency and parameters of such sampling, as well as the appropriate laboratory procedures, are set out in the bathing water directive.  Due to the nature of the testing required, it may take between 48 and 72 hours before validated results are available.  That is to allow the bacteria time to grow.  Deputy Ryan raised the issue of same day testing.  There are certain procedures and science behind the testing that mean a certain period must be allocated.  The Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, has asked and stressed that we look into any ways we can improve those timelines.  There are clear directions set down regarding how those tests should be carried out.  I am not sure if we can beat that timeline but we are looking at that.  It is hoped that we will have results tomorrow.</p>  <p>  With regard to dealing with the regular storm water overflow issue, Irish Water is undertaking a major upgrade at the Ringsend wastewater treatment plant to deliver improved treatment and additional capacity, and to ensure a decrease in the number of overflows experienced each year.  This upgrade is due to be completed by the end of 2022.  It has been said that this has been going on for a long time.  Planning permission takes a little time.  It was secured in April this year so plans can now move on, this can go to tender and the works can start.  It was signalled a number of years ago but all the channels had to be followed to implement that and bring forward planning permission.  I am sure the Deputies want us to follow correct procedure in these cases because of the significance of the area we are putting the development and to make sure everything is done correctly from the planning point of view. </p>  <p>  The recent overflow occurred following heavy rainfall during a status yellow weather event in Dublin.  Our sewer network is designed to collect both rain water and sewage.  During the recent exceptionally heavy and sustained rainfall, the storm water holding tank reached capacity at the Ringsend wastewater treatment facility and the overflow from the tank entered the sea.  It is important to note that this form of release ensures that sewers do not back up and flood streets and homes, which would be a much more serious threat to public health.  That is the choice one is faced with and the procedures that are in place. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the planned investment at Ringsend, the Minister accepts the concerns of Deputies about the closure of beaches in Dublin.  He has asked his officials to meet officials of Irish Water, the EPA, HSE and the Dublin local authorities to ensure the response to incidents of this kind, any restrictions imposed and the associated communications are appropriate and consistent.  Many of the issues that have been raised this week, and by the Deputies here, have been about communication and ensuring we get the right, up-to-date and timely information out there and that people have confidence in that information.  That will be a part of what the Minister is asking, as well as exploring if there is a quicker way to do the testing and make other changes.</p>  <p>  The Minister has clearly asked for the issue of the testing regime to be examined as part of this consideration but there are issues in that regard, which might mean we cannot improve the timelines but we will do so if we can.  EPA reports show an overall improvement in the quality of our bathing waters with 94% of our bathing waters meeting the required standard and almost 86% classified as either good or excellent.</p><p>However, it is no secret that the wastewater networks require ongoing and sustained investment to bring them up to the required standards, deal with population growth and adapt to the impact of climate change.  Investment in wastewater infrastructure is prioritised in the Irish Water strategic funding plan, as it was in the business case made a number of years ago.  It is estimated that through the national development plan &euro;1.9 billion will be invested in wastewater projects from 2019 to 2024, inclusive.  Delivering on this investment will continue to be a key priority.  The Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, and his Department will remain closely engaged on this issue with Irish Water.  The solution to these problems is this planned expenditure.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-06-26a.371" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1238" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="16:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019062600042#UU00200"><p>We should have same-day testing, but even if we do not, there is surely a way, when discharges occur, that it can be announced immediately.  There is a problem if we do not know when there is a discharge and it cannot be announced publicly.  At the very least, the public can be made aware of the incident.</p>  <p>  Representatives of Irish Water gave testimony before the joint committee recently.  They indicated that it needed &euro;18 billion to rehabilitate water infrastructure.  It is clearly not getting that kind of money.  It stated large-scale service failures were unavoidable and that they were happening.  There is not enough money going into rehabilitating water infrastructure and it was exacerbated by misguided austerity cuts after 2008, when the already inadequate expenditure went from &euro;423 million per year to &euro;382 million under the Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party Government.  That pattern continued under the Fine Gael-Labour Party Government and spending has only begun to climb up again recently.  However, it is still inadequate.  We need more investment, as well as early warning systems.</p></speech>

I understand it is possible to have same-day testing services and that Dublin City University might have pioneered some of those systems.  It is important that we advance these processes as the current system is completely inappropriate because we only find out what is wrong days later.  Are we assured that the key problem of the overflow tanks, arising from the mixture of rainwater and sewage, will be solved with the addition of the new aeration and settlement tanks on the Ringsend site?  Will the Minister of State provide the details of the wider and more complex pollution issues on Merrion and Sandymount strands, given that they will be closed for the entire summer?  Is it safe for children to play on Sandymount beach and build sandcastles?  That is one practical question people are asking me.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-06-26a.373" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1264" speakername="Damien English" time="16:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019062600042#UU00400"><p>I will try to answer all of the questions asked, but I can send anything I miss to the Deputies in written correspondence.  The Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, has asked that we look at earlier communications and officials are investigating if that is possible.  There is also the question of giving more detailed information in our announcements.  We are happy to try to do that, too.</p>  <p>  The EU bathing water directive sets out the frequency and parameters of water sampling, as well as the appropriate laboratory procedures.  There is an issue in allowing bacteria to grow over 48 hours.  I do not know if that can be changed to allow results to be given within 24 hours.  The Minister has asked about this to see if there is any way we can improve the timelines for testing.  I am not saying there is, but we can follow up on what Deputy Eamon Ryan has mentioned.  If it is possible, it is something we will certainly strive to achieve.  I understand how significant this issue is for everybody and we should have test results by tomorrow.</p>  <p>  The Deputy asked if increased capacity at the Ringsend plant would solve the problem.  We are fairly confident that it will.  At the Ringsend wastewater treatment facility any flow from rain storms above maximum flow capacity is forced into a holding tank in order that it may be sent back to the plant after the storm flow has passed.  During especially heavy and sustained rainfall the storm water tank reached capacity and the overflow from the tank entered the sea.  This is not something that generally happens in the summer months; it has probably happened twice recently and is not very common.  It is a capacity issue which will be dealt with through planned expenditure.</p>  <p>  Separately, in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council's area, the heavy rain affected the pumping station on the west pier and had an impact on bathing waters around D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  This is not connected with the storm water overflow from the Ringsend wastewater treatment plant, but it has resulted in notices forbidding bathing at Seapoint, Sandycove and the Forty Foot.  Irish Water is liaising with the local authority on the matter.  It is not a capacity matter.</p>  <p>  The bottom line is that the Ringsend facility was built for a population of 1.64 million people and is over capacity.  That is why there is a planned upgrade.  As we all know, infrastructure such as this must go through a planning procedure involving much environmental law.  That is correct, but it takes a little time to spend the money.  The funding is secured for the project which will happen in the years ahead.</p></speech>

These things happen.  I appreciate his coming to listen to my comments and hope he can provide a positive reply.</p>  <p>  As the Minister of State knows, the July provision scheme provides funding for an extended school year that is not available to the vast majority of children with Down's syndrome, leaving them at a major educational disadvantage.  A recent High Court settlement involved children with various educational and social needs.  They will now receive additional schooling under the July provision scheme.  In the light of this recent ruling, I ask the Government to consider extending the July provision scheme to all children with Down's syndrome.</p>  <p>  The scheme allows an extra month of tuition during July for children with a specific diagnosis of an autism spectrum disorder or a severe or profound general learning disability.  The scheme is very beneficial as it ensures children do not regress over the long summer holidays.  I have been contacted by numerous parents associated with the Roscommon branch of Down Syndrome Ireland who believe the exclusion of their children from the July provision scheme is an injustice and a disgrace.  How can the education system and the Government leave children with Down's syndrome behind, as that is what is happening?  They are being denied the right to learn at their own pace.  In the light of the recent High Court ruling, it is imperative that the scheme be extended to all children with Down's syndrome.</p>  <p>  On a separate matter and wider note, parents of children with Down's syndrome in County Roscommon have also told me about the great difficulties they have in accessing occupational therapists, speech therapists and physiotherapists in the county.  Many parents of children with Down's syndrome must finance the cost of these services because of the serious lack of services provided by the HSE.  They are placed under serious financial pressure as a result.  Even where services are provided by the HSE, visits by therapists can be infrequent, piecemeal and insufficient to meet the needs of children.  I am informed by some therapists that too many children are assigned to them and that, as a result, they cannot provide a more regular service.  More therapists in these areas are required as therapists expect parents and teachers to carry out programmes.  I am sure the Minister of State is well aware of this issue.  A change must be made.  </p>  <p>  I hope the Minister of State recognises the message that we should rectify the July provision scheme and will bring it to the Government.  We can give the children a decent chance in life.</p></speech>

I recognise the matter raised by the Deputy and know that it is common in other constituencies also.  I thank him for raising it as it provides me with an opportunity to outline the current position on it.</p>  <p>  The July provision scheme provides funding for an extended school year for students with severe or profound intellectual disabilities and students with autism spectrum disorders.  The scheme was developed to reduce potential regression in learning associated with these specific categories of special educational needs over the summer holidays.  In July 2016 the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, which advises the Minister on these matters published its policy advice on educational provision for children with autism which included a review of the July provision scheme.  The review found that in general parents valued the July provision scheme because it provided day respite care for families and a structured day for students.  However, the NCSE's review found a number of problems with the scheme.  They include concerns that the scheme may be inequitable because it is not provided for all students with complex special educational needs.</p><p>The council recommended that the relevant Departments consider how an equitable national day activity scheme could be developed for all students with complex special educational needs.  The proposed scheme would provide a structured, safe, social environment for all students with complex special educational needs, which might include some children with Down's syndrome.</p> <p> The Department of Education and Skills has convened an implementation group to ensure the report's recommendations are fully and appropriately considered.</p> <p> There has been consultation with a number of other Departments and State agencies on the future direction of the July education programme.  It is expected that the group will make recommendations shortly concerning a revised scheme which would be implemented next year at the earliest.  Before any changes are made, there will be consultations with stakeholders.</p> <p> The D&aacute;il will be aware that the Department settled two High Court cases where children with Down's syndrome had sought access to the July provision scheme.  While the terms of the settlement are confidential, I want to clarify on behalf of the Minister for Education and Skills that the children concerned were not given access to the scheme.  Officials met with Down Syndrome Ireland yesterday to discuss the implications of the settlement and they will be in further contact with it this week.  I want to inform the Deputy that the Minister is scheduled to meet Down Syndrome Ireland next week.</p></speech>

Like many TDs, he will be aware of this situation from his own constituency.  I welcome the fact that discussions are taking place and that further meetings will take place next week.  My only regret is that we are entering into discussions again.  The National Council for Special Education, NCSE, is clearly saying we need to do something for those children with Down's syndrome.  All of us acknowledge and recognise that parents are under enormous stress.  If the July provision applied to children with Down's syndrome it would be a huge benefit.  It is very important that the educational needs of these children are met during the summer.  They are special cases.  They need that help.  We have to look after people like these children, and their parents, and give them every possible chance.</p>  <p>  While I welcome what the Minister of State has said, and I know he has knowledge of this issue from his constituency, I do not want discussions to go on and on without any changes taking place.  Last week's High Court decision regarding two children with Down's syndrome did not give them full access to the system, and I accept what the Minister of State has said, but it certainly has changed the goalposts.  All of us must recognise now that we must act in response to that High Court judgment because it means there is dissatisfaction, as far as the court is concerned, in the way those children are being discriminated against.  I will not labour the point.  The Minister of State knows where I am coming from.  He has an understanding of the situation.  I am sure all Deputies have such cases in their constituencies.  I hope we can move matters on and get a better system in place as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

I will reflect on them also.  I am not in the Department but I am a teacher and I understand the importance of the July provision and its delivery.  There are different methodologies in respect of it.  Some of it is school based and some is not school based.  The Minister will take his policy direction from the National Council for Special Education in terms of trying to formulate a decision.  When he reflects on it and has had the discussions with the Down Syndrome Ireland group, which are important, it will provide him with an opportunity, in conjunction with his dialogue with the NCSE, to be in a better position to make a decision on how to move forward.  The Deputy's points are well made.  They are not unique to any particular constituency.  We all deal with parents of children with special needs and intellectual disabilities.  I know that teachers are dealing with them also.  They are challenging.  These are special children for a special reason.  Until now, the July provision has been a very good scheme but the Deputy is asking that it be improved upon rather than changed.  I will reflect his views to the Minister for Education and Skills and ask him to respond directly to the Deputy.</p></speech>

This issue goes back to 14th of this month when it was announced that Kilcar post office was to close.  Seventeen post offices closed last year and it was our understanding that no more would close in our county until such time as An Post announced that.  Myself, Deputy Doherty and Doherty Pringle attended a meeting in Kilcar attended by approximately 300 people.  At the end of the meeting we were mandated to write to the public affairs manager of An Post.  We copied that to the Minister.  We met the Minister of State, Deputy Canney.  We also copied that communication to the chief executive.  The only acknowledgement we got was from the public affairs manager.  In fact, it was not an acknowledgement but rather a full reply by way of email.</p>  <p>  We were mandated to make the approach to request that a period of six months be given to allow for the locals, various organisations and the public representatives to make a case to the appeals panel.  Our only request was that Kilcar would be afforded the same opportunity as that given to the other 157 post offices.  A very cold reply came back stating, "Of course they can but we are closing and you can submit your appeal then".  That is not the way other post offices were dealt with.  We believe there must be consistency in that regard.  We are making the case to the Minister of State, who is here representing the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, that at the 11th hour this decision would be reversed, allowed to be extended to the end of the year to allow Kilcar make an appeal, which every one of the others was allowed to do.  They are prepared to make a comprehensive appeal but giving two weeks is tantamount to saying there will be no appeal.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-06-26a.383" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="17:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019062600043#VV00600"><p>This is a very serious issue that goes right to the heart of rural Ireland.  As Deputy Gallagher said, in the past year Donegal has seen the closure of 17 post offices.  That is the heart ripped out of 17 rural locations across our county.  We were told time and again by Government and by An Post that this was about securing the network, the other 950 post offices.  Lo and behold, right after the local elections - the timing was calculated by Government and An Post - they announced the further closure of a post office.  This is a post office that serves a vibrant rural community and a vibrant textile industry in Kilcar.  Many people will know of the brands that come out of that area and how the industry ships its products through the local post office.  A post office that has served that community for many decades is about to close within the next couple of days.  No opportunity has been given to the community to come together, to organise and to make a proper appeal to An Post.</p>  <p>  The reality is that this closure should not be forced upon the community.  It should not be left to the 300 people who turned up at the public meeting myself, Deputy Gallagher and Deputy Pringle attended.  This should be a decision by Government.  We, in Sinn F&eacute;in, tabled a motion before this D&aacute;il last year and got approval from the other political parties that no post office should be closed.  The Minister needs to listen to the will of the people and their representatives in this House.  It is scandalous that the people of Kilcar are being pushed into this situation.  Our ask today is twofold.  First, the Government must intervene.  Second, at the very least a six-month extension must be given to allow for the community to organise, to plan and to make the proper case to An Post if An Post at this point is not willing to reverse its decision.  I am asking for that commitment from the Minister of State.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-06-26a.384" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1225" speakername="Thomas Byrne" time="17:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019062600044#WW00100"><p>When I sought this Topical Issue debate today I did not name any particular localities, although I did ring the Minister's office to be helpful, to name the two localities I was to talk about. Interestingly, since then, my constituency colleague, the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, has issued a statement on one of them.  I am glad of her interest in this topic, but it was not evident until I raised this today on the floor of the D&aacute;il.</p>  <p>  I refer to two issues which are similar and different to those raised by my colleagues.  One relates to the village of Carlanstown, with a population of almost 700, where a postal agency has closed without any notice at all for the almost 100 people who deal with this post agency for their social welfare payments every week.  This is a devastating blow to this village and the people around it who use the postal agency.  At a time when we are supposed to protect rural Ireland, we are not succeeding.</p>  <p>  The other matter on the post office network is related to the announcement last year, which included the closure of seven other post offices in County Meath, was that some new post offices would open.  We were given a list of towns where there would be new post offices.  One was in my constituency in Kentstown, County Meath.  No post office has opened there.  An Post told me that nobody was interested in such a post office.  In fact, there is someone who is interested in having it in their premises but the terms and conditions which An Post proposes do not make it worthwhile for anyone to take it on.  This village, which is probably one of the largest settlements in the country, and certainly in the county of Meath, without a post office has been promised one by An Post and this Government but this has not been delivered.  It calls into question the reality of the announcements last year.  The post offices closing was a reality: all seven which were announced were closed and this has torn apart many communities, with their hope gone in Batterstown, Bellewstown, Clonalvy, Drumree, Dunsany, and Tara.  I pay tribute to all the postmasters who served in those post offices.  When An Post promised new post offices, it was good news but it is so cynical for them not to follow up on this and leave the people of Carlanstown bereft.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-06-26a.385" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1317" speakername="Martin Ferris" time="17:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019062600044#WW00200"><p>Yesterday, Deputy Michael Healy-Rae and I met representatives of the Irish Postmasters Union, IPU, on the crisis in the network of rural post offices.  The Government has been speaking on both sides of its mouth to the effect that there is no policy directive on social welfare payments being paid out in rural post offices.  Rural post offices tell us, however, that social welfare officers are asking recipients to open bank accounts in order that payments can be paid directly into them.  That removes a viable aspect of rural post offices.  When they lose a transaction, they do not lose that alone; they lose five or six transactions on the back of one.  The only thing that will keep rural post offices alive and continue to survive is if they have enough transactions.  Part of that is that the Government should make transactions available to post offices, whether online or otherwise, in order that they can remain viable and continue in our communities.</p>  <p>  Two motions were passed on this issue in the D&aacute;il, one on 16 November, in which Deputy Michael Healy-Rae was involved, and another in September 2018 tabled by Sinn F&eacute;in.  Those are sitting on the shelf and have progressed nowhere.  Why is that?  Why does the Government not respond and implement motions passed here?  A large part of those motions was to ensure that post offices would have encouragement and support for a community banking service.  A community banking service has helped the survival of post offices in New Zealand and other places where it has been allowed to develop, but it is necessary that the State support community banking services so that post offices can survive and be viable into the future.  </p></speech>

We listened to the IPU's urgent call on behalf of postmasters throughout the country.  I must declare an interest as I am a postmaster myself of a small post office in Kilgarvan, County Kerry.  I am proud to be the owner of a post office.  I want my post office and every other post office to be sustainable, keep the jobs it has in place for the future.  It will not happen without the Government's support.</p>  <p>  Deputy Ferris is correct about what is happening.  I do not want to wrong anyone.  When the Taoiseach was Minister for Social Protection, I showed him a document to show how unfair the situation was.  It was an application form for a new recipient of social welfare.  I told him it was being sent out in his name and was telling people to use the bank.  There and then he told me it was wrong and it should not be like that.  In fairness, he went away and had it changed.  He did not give us in the post office an unfair advantage; he gave us a fair playing field.  He had the form read that the recipient could go to their post office or bank, and it was good and sound of him to do that.  What is happening now in spite of everything is that people in Intreo offices are telling people to do things through the bank.  We are asking the Government to give us a fair chance.  This is a very important message and we need to get this straight.  Deputy Ferris and I had this yesterday from the president of the IPU.  We do not, as postmasters, want a handout.  We are not asking Government to give us a grant or anything, we are looking for nothing from the Government.  What we want is work.  We want to be given new business that we can administer through our post offices, whether it is motor tax, or that farmers would come to post offices to use e-assist to fill up an area aid form or other applications.  We just want work in our post offices and we are just asking the Government to help us in that.  It is a very ordinary and humble request.  Give us work to keep our post offices going.  </p></speech>

I apologise that I am not a Minister in the line Department.  The Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton, is at European Council meeting in Luxembourg.  As Deputies will know, Ministers of State routinely cover their colleagues.  I wish to cover as many of the points raised as possible.  I have a reply from the Department but I will ask the Minister&rsquo;s office to revert to the Deputies individually if there are any issues which they feel are not adequately addressed in the reply.</p>  <p>  It has been stated here previously that An Post is a commercial State company and as such, day-to-day operational matters, including decisions in relation to the company and its operations are matters for the board and the management of the company and not ones in which the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment has a statutory function.  An Post has an independent board and its mandate is clear in that regard.  That has been the case since An Post was created as a semi-State company. </p>  <p>  The environment in which the post office operates is changing and the network needs to change to thrive, particularly with the move to digital transactions.  These changes are impacting on the revenue being generated by the network as a whole.  In the face of serious declines in the volume of mail and post office business, An Post faced growing losses and has had to undertake a major restructuring of Its business to continue to be able to build, maintain and protect a service that meets the needs of communities across the country.</p>  <p>  The financial challenges facing An Post have been well documented, primarily due to the impact of e-substitution on mail volumes.  Mail volumes have decreased some 40% since 2007.  In 2018 alone mail volumes declined by 7.6%.  In response, the board of An Post oversaw the preparation of a strategic plan setting out a transformation of the company in both the mails and retail business.  An Post has advised that as part of this process, much detailed work has been done to ensure that the right infrastructure is in place to adapt to the rapidly-changing mails and parcels business. </p>  <p>  Two years later, critically important decisions have been made.  An Post has been stabilised because of the action that has been taken.  The implementation of the strategic plan is continuing to yield results.  An Post has gone from being in a very difficult financial position to making a profit.</p>  <p>  The post office in Kilcar is due to close at the end of this week as a result of the postmaster retiring.  The business, including Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection payments, will transfer to Carrick post office, which is 5 km away.  I understand that Carrick, like Kilcar, is situated within the Gaeltacht area.  Customers can also contact the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to arrange to collect their payments at any post office of their choice, including Killybegs and Glencolumbkille, in addition to Carrick.</p>  <p>  The transfer to Carrick will help to secure a sustainable future for that office and the other post offices in the area, as well as ensuring access to services to post office services.  An Post has confirmed that there will be no change to mail services to Kilcar and the surrounding area.</p>  <p>  Should the local community or local individuals wish to have An Post&rsquo;s decision on future post office services in Kilcar assessed in line with the established post office closure protocol, they can apply to the independent review process to have the case assessed and An Post will have regard to the assessors' recommendations. </p><p>That matter was referred to by Deputy Gallagher.  Any such appeal should be submitted as soon as possible.</p> <p> Of the post offices referred to in County Meath, I understand seven have been closed in the consolidation process that was announced last year.  I have also been told that An Post proposed to open a new post office, with Kentstown being chosen as the location, but having advertised twice for someone to take on the position, it has as yet received no applications.</p> <p> Key to the survival of the network is the willingness of the public to use the services the post office provides.  Investment of &euro;50 million in the network is under way.  It is based on getting communities to use the enhanced services provided.  There is no doubt that continued transformation of the postal business will be difficult and require tough decisions to make An Post fit for the future.</p> <p> To respond to the specific issues raised by Deputies Michael Healy-Rae and Ferris, I will ask the office of the Minister to reply directly to them specifically on the issues they raised following their meeting with representative of the Irish Postmasters Union.</p></speech>

The Government supported the motion, but then in a cynical exercise it went off and did the opposite.  When the Minister of State says it is not a matter for the Government and that An Post is a statutory body, it was the Government that gave it its imprimatur.  Ministers, including the Minister from County Donegal, gave An Post their imprimatur to do this.  Furthermore, there is the cynical exercise of using settlement patterns, rather than judging on the basis of a population of 1,740 in Kilcar.  The Minister of State has said they can go to Carrick or Glencolmcille, but there are no existing transport services that link them.  Closing the post office is a much bigger issue because other businesses will suffer as a result and jobs will be lost.  I appeal to the Minister of State to request the Minister, Deputy Bruton, to meet the Deputies for County Donegal at the earliest possible date in order that we can make the case directly to him.  We cannot hide behind statutory bodies when it is the Government that has taken this decision.</p></speech>

I invite the Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy Bruton, to come to Kilcar to see, listen and talk to the people and businesses that use the service all the time.  People are employed by businesses that are trying to build up what is a rural Gaeltacht area, but they see the State taking services away from them.  The suggestion made by Deputy Gallagher is one that needs to be actioned as soon as possible.  We need to talk face to face with the Minister and to do so quickly as the post office is to close in the next couple of days, although there is no reason whatsoever for it to close.  This falls outside the agreement between the Irish Postmasters Union and An Post.  The voluntary redundancies have happened.  We were told that they were to secure the network, but now another post office is to close.  How many other post offices will close if this is the carry-on by An Post while the Government sits on its hands?  The spin it puts on it, that any community with 500 or more people will have a postal service, is nonsense.  Kilcar has a population of more than 1,000.  The way in which the Government calculates the figure is completely disingenuous and amounts to nothing more than spin.  We need an extension of time, a meeting with the Minister and him to visit the area in order that the Government can get a feel of what it really means and what it is doing to the area in pulling out the heart of this rural community.</p></speech>

I informed the Minister's office about the position in Carlanstown where a postal agency has closed.  They do not cost An Post anything, but they provide an unbelievably valuable service in distributing social welfare payments.  Just like the village mentioned by my colleague, there is no public transport between Carlanstown and Kells post office, despite the fact that the NTA promised such a service approximately one year ago.  This is a very serious issue.  The heart is being pulled out of villages and people are being told to travel to the nearest town.  The nearest town - Kells - is very important, but it is also seriously important to protect villages.  I ask the Minister of State and the Minister to go back to An Post with what he has said in the House about Kentstown post office because it does not tally with what I am told on the ground by people who were interested in taking on the position.  They expressed interest to An Post, but the terms and conditions were simply too onerous for anybody to open a new post office.  The population of Kentstown is approximately 1,200 people and a post office was promised but not delivered, which was the most cynical exercise ever.  To sugarcoat the dreadful announcement made last year, we were told about all of the post offices being opened, but then we found that there was no sugarcoating.  That leave a bitter taste in the mouths of people.</p></speech>

That is the reality.  It will happen in the constituency of the Minister of State and the constituency of every Deputy in the House.  It would take very little to make them secure and viable such as delivering social welfare payments.  In my county T&uacute;s, a public body, has been instructing people that they must open a bank account in order that money can be paid into them.  That is wrong.  They were receiving their money in the post office.  Welfare payments, motor tax, driver licences, change of ownership of vehicles, driver and theory test payments, registration of electors, hospital charges, local authority parking fines and toll charges are just a few of the services that could be provided through post offices to make them viable.  When we bring people into the local post office, it contributes to the introduction of other transactions.  The Government needs to be active in promoting a policy to ensure the survival and viability of local rural post offices.</p></speech>

However, we lost other post offices.  When a post office is lost, it tears the heart out of a community.  It is something that does not need to happen.  We can hold on to more of them.  I ask this question, as I have consistently during the years.  We have great advocates such as Tom O'Callaghan of the Independent Postmasters Group, an independent union through which he represents many post offices.  There is also the Irish Postmasters Union.  They are all excellent in working together and asking the Government to do one thing - to assist us and not let us go down the road followed in England, Scotland and other places where thousands of post offices have been lost.  If they could reopen them, they would, but they are not able to do so.  It is like tearing up the rail network and then saying in 20 years' time it would be a good idea to put it back together.  We cannot do that because if we lose it, it will be gone.  When a post office, like a shop, pub or creamery in a rural community, is closed, there is no going back.  I, therefore, ask the Minister of State to help us.  That is all we are asking.  We are not fighting about it or being argumentative; we are just asking for help for small post offices and post offices in larger towns that are also struggling.  Will he, please, help them to survive?</p></speech>

I can only take the reply as it is.</p>  <p>  To answer Deputy Michael Healy Rae on the issue of engagement with the Irish Postmasters Union - other Deputies mentioned a meeting with the Minister - I will relay the request to the Minister.</p>  <p>  When I was listening to Deputy Gallagher, I thought of my own town of Newcastle West, where seven post offices were closed during the time another Government was in office and when the same issues arose.  The Minister is the shareholder, as we all know in this House because the party opposite was in government once upon a time when waves of post offices were closed.  The same issue was raised as to whether the Minister could intervene to keep open the post offices in Ballagh, Mountcollins, Tournafulla, Castlemahon and Feohanagh, as well as all of the other post offices in my part of the country that were closed.  Deputy Michael Healy Rae is right that we need greater dialogue on the network of post offices between An Post, the Irish Postmasters Union and all of the stakeholders.  We also all need to support post offices.  We all have an obligation as people who want to keep services alive in rural areas to support them.</p><p> Deputy Pearse Doherty asked about a meeting with the Minister.  I will relay that request for the Deputies from Donegal to meet the Minister, Deputy Bruton, on this issue.  I note, however, that when post offices in my own area, like Tournafulla and Knockaderry, were closed people also asked if the Minister could intervene.  They made representations to me at the time when I was councillor and Fine Gael was in opposition.  We all know the reality that An Post is a commercial company with serious financial problems.  It is on a path to trying to redress those problems.</p> <p> Deputy Michael Healy-Rae is right, however.  In support of the stakeholders, the Irish Postmasters Union, the service providers, the public, the Government and State agencies are working together.  We have had this discussion in this Chamber before.  One of An Post's greatest attributes is its ability to deliver parcels in future and to use the post office network to facilitate that.  I am not a Minister of State in the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment but I will relay the concerns raised to the Minister, Deputy Bruton.  </p></speech>

It is well known that I have had a long-term career, for some 25 years or more, in advocacy for and on behalf of carers.  My interest in this area is not new founded, it is something that long and well established.</p>  <p>  In 2015, the Central Statistics Office, CSO, found that one person in ten was providing care to someone with an illness or disability.  On that basis, about 355,000 people in the population are carers.  Roughly one in ten people in Ireland are carers today and this will increase to one in five by 2030 given the ageing demographic.  The 355,000 people could in fact be 375,000 based on the latest CSO population figures published some months ago.  Every one of those people has a different story.  The stories we heard at family carer events across Ireland were heart-rending and would move anybody.  They are familiar stories.  Any of us involved in the caring movement know exactly what is involved.  People are looking after their elderly parents, an elderly uncle or aunt or after a child with a disability.  I spoke to a woman from the D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown area this evening.  Her story would move anyone.  She is looking after a 28 year old child and is working extremely hard.  She went back to work and is now going back onto the carer's allowance.  She has a difficult job to get it.  </p>  <p>  There are also less well known stories.  People are working full-time and then acting as a carer around the clock for a spouse who is at home due to illness or disability.  Children under the age of 18 are taking on significant caring responsibilities for their parents.  We know that tens of thousands of children and teenagers, as young as ten years old, are providing care in this situation.  The Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, a colleague of the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, has been a great advocate in this area.  Many people estimate that some 25,000 children and young people are in that situation.  I believe that is a gross underestimate.  There is talk now of an estimate of 56,000 young people providing care across Ireland.  </p>  <p>  People affected by disability or illness want to stay in their own homes.  That is their most comfortable environment.  A carer's allowance of &euro;200 would assist in allowing that to happen, along with adequate respite care and home help.  There is strong evidence that quality of life is improved and people live longer in their home environment.  An immediate and achievable priority is to increase substantially the number of hours, homecare packages, and home help hours or alternatively, to establish the entitlement to secure the same outcome on a statutory framework.  I acknowledge the efforts of the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, in that regard.  They are positive.</p>  <p>  Carers do not want our sympathy or our pity.  They also do not want to be put on a pedestal or canonised.  They are just ordinary people struggling to care for their loved ones without the supports they so desperately need and deserve.  Carers are people who have chosen to look after their loved ones and they do need help.  They need practical help.  Most importantly, what they often need is an acknowledgement of their role, which is often disregarded.  That is what the State should be doing, that is how the State should intervene and that is what the State has to do better than it is doing.  Carers need respite and training.  Some need a downstairs bathroom at a critical time.  Others require home help hours when those hours are needed and not when the system decides to grant them - if those people ever get the hours.  That is, by hell, some system to try to navigate.  It is no wonder that these people are at breaking point.  Some carers just burn out and feel exhausted.</p>  <p>  First and foremost, therefore, carers need financial support.  Only one carer in five receives carer's allowance or carer's benefit.  Those are the only payments in the social welfare system that I know of where it is necessary for people to work full time and still only get &euro;16 more than if they sat at home resting on their hands.  It is an invidious situation.  Those payments are means-tested and the rules for the means test have not changed since 2008, despite the rising costs of living.  People are being unfairly left without income support.  </p>  <p>  A major and cherished goal of mine and of the Labour Party has been our policy to try to abolish the means test.  In 2003, I published a report entitled "Caring for The Carers".  Our goal should be to abolish the means test but in the interim, I know we must face and deal with reality, such the impact of Brexit.  In the interim, we should substantially increase the income disregard and the capital disregard.  We should do that because when disability allowance is awarded, there is a cap on disregard of &euro;50,000 but when carer's allowance is granted, the cap on disregard is &euro;20,000.  What is so different about carers?  That difference is invidious and discriminatory.  </p>  <p>  I know this is not the area of responsibility of the Minister of State but I ask him to relay this situation to the Government.  That is the simplest thing he could do today.  I heard about another change today that we could make quickly.  A special fund could be established tomorrow, in addition to homecare packages, for onset conditions.  For example, stroke victims initially require a huge number of hours of caring but it is for a finite time.  People get better.  Some people are of the view, however, that the provision of a large-scale input of hours would be robbing other people.  A special fund should be set up for that type of situation.  </p>  <p>  I ask the Minister of State to raise this issue at Cabinet.  I believe there is a commitment in A Programme for a Partnership Government to review the disregard level and the means test.  Nothing has been done, however.  Abolishing the means test, according to the Government's own figures, would cost &euro;1.2 billion.  I got those figures last week.  I know the money is not there now but in the long term, it would be money well spent.  The return on that money would be absolutely phenomenal.  The Minster for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, and the Secretary General of that the Department, Mr. Watt, would be delighted at the return on the investment.  They are the people who seem to count.  </p>  <p>  Carer's allowance is the only means-tested welfare payment that is taxed.  How is that fair?  This payment should be made exempt from income tax in line with other means-tested payments.  Making it subject to a tax is, in effect, adding insult to injury.  The Government is taking 40%, or more, off of the top.  That is madness.  There are other supports that the State provides.  People who are caring day in and day out need respite.  This is a big issue.  Those people are caring full time and only have a break when their siblings or children step in to take over for a few days.  That puts a strain on the wider family.  </p>  <p>  Let us look at this from another perspective.  There are plenty of people who work full time and who use up their holidays to provide relief care for their siblings or parents.  This is just one example of how care work affects the lives of so many people in families.  Some are struggling to earn a few bob to pay a mortgage and everything else.  It is a major demand.  The State can and should be doing much more to provide respite for the sake of the physical and mental health of the carers.  We need to address the issue of training in a holistic way.  Many carers are involved by themselves in manually lifting their loved ones in and out of beds on their own.  As a barrister, I know that if someone else was doing a similar type of work, he or she would be breaching the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (General Application) Regulations 2007.  Whoever was responsible could be sued.  These carers need help.  </p>  <p>  We need to revise and replace the old mobility allowance and motorised transport grant.  That has been going on since 2013.  As the saying goes down in Ballynacargy, a long churning makes bad butter.  This is taking so long the butter must be rancid at this stage.</p><p>We need to increase funding for the housing adaptation grant.  The Government has increased it but we need it more and more because our people need more appliances, mobility aids and equipment.  That is essential.  For every euro we spend on carers we get a huge return.  The carers' associations, Family Carers Ireland and Care Alliance Ireland, say they are saving the State &euro;10 billion.  The cost of all these income support schemes is much less than that.  I have said this so often; if carers were to down tools and require the State to step in with nursing homes and staff, the whole system would collapse overnight.  However, carers are not asking for the State to do everything.  They know that resources are limited.  I was speaking to a lady this evening who knew that.  They are doing most of the work without complaint.  However they need the rest of society to appreciate and acknowledge their work and its social value, and ensure adequate support for them to keep going.  The cost is minuscule when one carefully and objectively examines what we are getting in return.  </p> <p> That brings me to a crucial point.  Many carers are badly stretched.  Careers suffer from serious health issues themselves, including mental health issues like depression and anxiety.  That is the human cost of being constantly available and on call to support somebody who needs their care, which they give with unbridled love.  This is why the Labour Party believes that those in support of the carer's support grant should also receive a GP visit card.  The other day somebody asked me on the radio why that should be.  It is a question the Government itself will probably raise.  I would simply ask, why not?  Carers are not getting the card because of the means test.  Some carers get the carer's support grant but not the carer's allowance.  There are roughly 28,000 such people; that is what is left when roughly 80,000 are subtracted from an overall number of a little over 100,000.  Giving these carers the GP visit card would recognise the impact their work has on their health.  Those are small changes.  The disregard could be incorporated into the budget straight away, as could the policy of extending the GP visit card to carers who are not in receipt of carer's allowance.  As the motion notes, carers suffer from serious health issues including mental health issues like depression and anxiety.  We need to deal with that.  We need to encourage carers to look after their own health, and it makes sense to remove any cost barriers that might prevent people from going to a doctor to look after themselves.</p> <p> There is a big question over the future sustainability of the whole system as it is constructed.  People are working as hard as they can to look after their loved ones and in many cases, the stress and strain is intolerable.  At this point carers are genuinely in crisis.  We need much more detailed scrutiny and debate about the future of caring.  We need a new national carers strategy.  The Government is moving towards a social care model.  As long as it is adequately resourced that will be fine, but I do not believe in attaching one and a half legs to a strategy that should have four.  Without the other two and a half legs, the whole system will collapse.  That is what is going to happen. </p> <p> The strategy needs to take account of several home truths.  Our population is ageing, which means that more people than ever before will be involved in care.  One person in five will be involved by 2030.  Families have fewer children, which means that care duties will be shared between fewer people in the family circle.  The Minister of State knows this.  Conditions like dementia are on the rise, which means that more challenging care situations will be common in future years.  We have to take the issue of carers much more seriously than we have to date. </p> <p> The Government has to open its eyes to the reality of carers' lives and the pressure they are under.  I hope the Labour Party's motion tonight makes a contribution to that in a non-partisan and all-embracing way.  I see that Sinn F&eacute;in has tabled an amendment with some very positive points.  We have no issue with that.  We all have to get behind this.  It is not a partisan issue.  If we do so we will be certain of success.  I made this point before and the Minister of State is aware of it. </p> <p> I will give one example of the means test.  A woman in the audience stood up at a meeting in Mullingar, at which I spoke very passionately about the means test.  We waste a lot of money on administration.  Applicants must try to get through to administrators and are then put through a process.  Unless there are five "severe" marks on an application form it will be refused straight away.  I know that -  I have been dealing with this for 30 years.  I would say I have done more appeals on carer's allowance applications than anyone in this country.  The person who spoke out at this meeting was a married woman with a couple of adult children in England who had come home to look after her parents.  The Acting Chairman, Deputy Eugene Murphy, will vouch for this.  It is not a lie.  It is the blank truth.  She applied for carer's allowance to look after two elderly parents, including a mother with dementia and Alzheimer's.  They were in their 80s and 90s.  The first thing our beloved State bureaucrats did was ask the value of her house in England.  How dare they? </p> <p> This woman was looking after an elderly mother and father and that is the first thing they thought of.  That should be snapped out of the system.  That woman left her own family in England to look after her parents and that was the first thing we did.  We gave a lot of people a one-way ticket on the cattle boat from D&uacute;n Laoghaire in the 1950s, including six uncles of mine.  I know a bit about this.  Here was someone who had come back to look after their parents, the most precious thing she could do, and the first thing the Irish State did was poke its finger in her eye and ask how much her house was worth.  A house in England could be worth &pound;400,000.  It belonged to the family.  Without the disregards of &euro;20,000, the carer's allowance was disallowed.  The woman had to hire help and she went back to work to get carer's benefit.  By hell, that took a stretch.  It takes weeks and weeks to get something that should be received in ten days.  </p> <p> I am sick and tired of this.  I have been at this for 22 years, since 1997.  If there is one thing I would love to see, it is proper recognition of the work carers do.  The basic weekly carer's allowance payment is &euro;219.  The average contribution to the fair deal scheme is &euro;824.  A hospital bed for acute care costs &euro;6,000.  Do the maths.  A fool who got NG in the leaving certificate could prove that this is the most effective, cost-efficient and decent way of helping people.  Let us salute the carers of Ireland.  We got them on the cheap and we have exploited them.  This is naked exploitation.  We are an absolute disgrace as a country.  I do not mind paying extra tax to make sure they get their dues.  I come from a side of this House that believes that we need to levy taxes to provide services for people.  Some day I will probably be in that position myself, and I hope somebody will get the carer's allowance if they need it to look after me.  That is the way I think.  Not everyone might think that, but the Labour Party has always thought in that way.  We have sought to provide for the wider public, not for ourselves.  We left the "me" to Thatcher.  We always thought of the "we".  I commend this motion.  </p></speech>

We are also asking the Government to conduct a study of the income and living costs of carers to ensure that income supports are sufficient for all carers to attain a decent minimum standard of living.  With this motion Labour wants to give a voice to carers, as all too often people who care for a loved one do so in isolation while facing a daily struggle.  That is why we need a national carers strategy that recognises the value of carers.  It must recognise how much the State benefits from them and how much carers save the State.  It is difficult to quantify how many carers there are in Ireland at any one time.  We all know at least one person who is providing full-time care to a loved one.  It is very likely that we know more than one such person. </p>  <p>  As local representatives we meet dozens if not hundreds of carers during our time in office.  Indeed, many of us in this Chamber have been carers ourselves or have lived in a home in which full-time care is being provided.  As such, we know the commitment, the compassion and in the words of our motion the "inestimable value" that carers provide our society.  One person in ten is now involved in caring.  According to Family Carers Ireland, that figure is set to rise to one in five by 2030.  If every one of those carers stopped what they are doing in the morning. the impact it would have on our health system is incalculable.  Carers take the pressure off acute hospital beds and accident and emergency departments and give those they care for the comfort of staying in their own homes, which helps to bring about better medical outcomes.  Caring for a loved one has a knock-on effect, not only on the carers themselves but also on their families and loved ones.  A great many carers are under stress, with significant increases in the number reporting poor health, including depression and anxiety.</p><p>Care Alliance Ireland estimates that there are approximately 375,000 carers in Ireland, many of whom will face the additional issues I have mentioned, including the impact on their personal lives, stress and anxiety.  The alliance also estimates that the official number for younger carers grossly understates the reality.  According to the 2016 census, the figure for young carers is 13,000.  However, the Health Behaviours in School Children survey of 2014 reported that 56,118 children between the ages of ten and 17 were providing some form of care across Ireland.  Members should consider the impact on their lives, including their social lives, their ability to study, meet friends and relax from the pressures of school and exams.  If this progresses, it can limit the ability of young carers to transition to further education or employment due to financial cost and the preparation time required.</p> <p> Existing State supports do not go far enough and too many carers are suffering burn-out and serious ill health on foot of the stress and strain of their work.  Unfortunately, the role of carer falls disproportionately on women.  I hope the Government accepts that we need to do more.  There are too many rules and requirements around carer payments which restrict unnecessarily people's ability to balance care work with study or paid employment.  Deputy Penrose expanded on that issue very well.  Carer's allowance should not be taxed and the means test for the payment must be updated as a matter of urgency.  The Labour Party wants to see it being phased out completely over time.  Carers are always the unsung heroes.  They experience isolation, poor health and, in increasing numbers, stress.  This is not helped by the lack of provision of adequate home help hours and respite care as discussed by the House yesterday evening.  Most carers are on call 24/7, 365 days a year.  Carers require support in their caring journey in accordance with their individual needs.  The Labour Party motion recognises the contribution made by carers.  It is time the Government did the same.</p></speech>

and substitute the following:&quot;acknowledges that:<blockquote>&mdash; Ireland has a duty to protect persons with disabilities and their caregivers, in line with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD)and provide necessary support for the child and for those who care for the child, in line with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC);<br /><br />&mdash; the vision of the Carers&rsquo; Strategy is to recognise and respect carers as key care partners, who are supported to maintain their own health and wellbeing and to care with confidence and empowered to participate as fully as possible in economic and social life;<br /><br />&mdash; the Health Service Executive (HSE) Disability Services budget for 2019 is &euro;1.9 billion, providing 8,568 residential places, 22,272 day places, 182,506 respite overnights, 32,662 day respite sessions, 1.63 million personal assistant hours for 2,535 people, and 3.08 million home support hours for 8,094 people; and<br /><br />&mdash; an additional &euro;10 million was provided to the disability sector in 2018, to enhance respite care and alternative respite services including extended day services, summer camps and Saturday clubs;</blockquote>notes that there are a number of sources of data on family carers in Ireland, and that Census 2016 found that:<blockquote>&mdash; 195,263 or 4.1 per cent of respondents indicated that they provided regular unpaid personal help for a friend or family member with a long-term illness, health problem or disability, including problems due to old age;<br /><br />&mdash; the total number of family carers increased by 4.4 per cent between 2011 and 2016 and the total number of family carers aged 45 or older increased by 11.3 per cent; and<br /><br />&mdash; there were 13,000 family carers under the age of 25 in 2016, a decrease of over 1,000 compared to 2011;</blockquote>recognises that:<blockquote>&mdash; the health system relies heavily on family and other unpaid carers, who make a profound difference to the health, wellbeing and quality of life of those that they care for;<br /><br />&mdash; two in five family carers receive Carer&rsquo;s Allowance or Carer&rsquo;s Benefit;<br /><br />&mdash; the rate of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance has increased every year since 2017;<br /><br />&mdash; since 2016, Carer&rsquo;s Allowance continues to be paid for 12 weeks after the death of the person being cared for, an increase of six weeks, and since 2017, this extension was also granted in cases where the cared for person permanently moved into residential care or a nursing home;<br /><br />&mdash; the means test for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance is one of the most generous in the social protection system, in that &euro;332.50 of gross weekly income is disregarded in the calculation of means for a single person and the equivalent for someone who is married, in a civil partnership or cohabiting is &euro;665 of combined gross weekly income;<br /><br />&mdash; the work of family carers is indispensable in ensuring that people requiring care across the country can receive such care in their own homes and communities, while maintaining their independence and sense of self-worth;<br /><br />&mdash; providing care to loved ones can have a significant impact on the health, physical and mental wellbeing, finances and familial and societal relationships of family carers;<br /><br />&mdash; a range of social services and supports are necessary to enable family carers to provide care to the best of their ability;<br /><br />&mdash; the Government is committed to the full implementation of the National Carers&rsquo; Strategy, 2012, a whole-of-Government response to the challenges faced by family carers through the development of 42 actions under four national goals;<br /><br />&mdash; five progress reports published by the Department of Health, along with a series of independently conducted assessments of progress on the implementation of the strategy from the perspective of family carers, have found that a majority of actions have progressed in a way that has led to a positive impact on the lives of family carers although more work remains to be done;<br /><br />&mdash; the provision of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Carer&rsquo;s Benefit, Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant and Domiciliary Care Allowance, at a cost of almost &euro;1.2 billion in 2019, offers an important income support to family carers;<br /><br />&mdash; since 1st June, 2017, all children in receipt of a Domiciliary Care Allowance are eligible for a medical card without a means test;<br /><br />&mdash; increasing the income disregard for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance from &euro;332.50 to &euro;450 for a single person and &euro;665 to &euro;900 for a couple would cost the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection approximately &euro;73 million, with income tax and Working Family Payment offsets, the net expenditure would be &euro;55 million;<br /><br />and<br /><br />&mdash; it is a condition of receipt of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance and Carer&rsquo;s Benefit that the carer must be providing full-time care and attention, and the current limit of 15 hours of work or study per week is considered to represent a reasonable balance between meeting the care recipient&rsquo;s requirement for full-time care and the carer&rsquo;s need to maintain contact with the workforce;</blockquote>further recognises that:<blockquote>&mdash; over the past four years there has been a considerable increase of nearly &euro;140 million in the home supports budget which has grown from &euro;306 million in 2015 to almost &euro;446 million in 2019, with demand continuing to grow, and a combined 18.2 million hours of general and intensive home support for older people will be provided this year;<br /><br />&mdash; the HSE reviews people on the waiting list as funding becomes available to ensure that individual cases continue to be dealt with on a priority basis within the available resources and as determined by the local frontline staff who know and understand the clients&rsquo; needs, and who undertake regular reviews of those care needs to ensure that the services being provided remain appropriate;<br /><br />&mdash; the HSE provides over &euro;21.6 million in annual funding through service level arrangements with community and voluntary organisations who provide services to support family carers including in home respite services, peer-to-peer support and training courses;<br /><br />&mdash; the Minister for Health and the Minister of State for People with Disabilities intend to revert to Government in due course with revised proposals to reflect discussions at Cabinet and further discussions between the Ministers on the best way to progress the Transport Scheme, and it is notable that with regard to transport there are improvements in access to a range of transport support schemes available to persons with disabilities in the State and on-going work is being carried out by Government Departments, agencies and transport providers to further improve access to public transport services, and under the National Disability Inclusion Strategy, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has responsibility for the continued development of accessibility and availability of public transport for people with a disability;<br /><br />&mdash; in 2019, funding of &euro;71.25 million was allocated by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government to the Housing Adaptation Grant for People with a Disability, Housing Aid for Older People and Mobility Aids Grant, comprising &euro;57 million Exchequer funding, an increase of some 8 per cent on the 2018 figure, with the balance of &euro;14.25 million being contributed by the local authorities and the responsibility for the apportionment between the three grant schemes is a matter for each local authority; and<br /><br />&mdash; since September 2018, free GP visit cards have been extended to persons in receipt of the Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, and a key point in the decision to exclude Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant recipients from the GP visit card scheme is that the grant is not directly comparable to either the Carer&rsquo;s Allowance or Carer&rsquo;s Benefit, it is a once-off yearly payment of &euro;1,700 made by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and is not means tested; and</blockquote>further acknowledges that the Government commits to:<blockquote>&mdash; fully implementing the National Carers Strategy, and developing a new Social Care Strategy, in line with the vision of Sl&aacute;intecare to deliver a universal health service that offers the right care, in the right place at the right time;<br /><br />&mdash; establishing a new stand-alone statutory scheme and system of regulation for home care services;<br /><br />&mdash; including representatives of family carer advocacy organisations in the development of policy that has an impact on the ability of family carers to care for their loved one(s); and<br /><br />&mdash; continuing to grow supports for family carers to allow them to maintain their health and wellbeing and to continue caring with confidence.&quot;</blockquote></blockquote><p>I thank Deputies for their contributions.  In particular, I acknowledge the passion of Deputy Penrose in respect of the matter, which was evident when he spoke.  I have often said that one of the characteristics I most admire in a Deputy is consistency on an issue.  I acknowledge that the Deputy has been extraordinarily consistent on this issue over many debates.  He has raised the matter in debates when its relevance was not direct and never lost an opportunity to highlight the position of carers.  I acknowledge him and the wider Labour Party for their continued focus on the issue.</p><p>The State recognises the role that family carers play in society and is committed through a range of healthcare and income supports to support carers in their caring role and to alleviate the financial burden of caring.  Over the past 15 years, the number of recipients of carer's allowance has increased by 347% and the number of recipients of carer's benefit has quadrupled.  In addition, the carer's support grant increased by 23% in 2016.  Since 2011, total payments across carer's allowance, carer's benefit, carer's support grant and the domiciliary care allowance have increased by more than &euro;426 million, or 56%.  While there are many positive and rewarding aspects of caring, it is evident that caring is a significant challenge, affecting all aspects of a family carer's life.  The needs of the cared for person can place great demands on the energy and time of the family carer and, given that many provide full-time care, have a significant impact on their relationships with other people, their professional lives and their physical and mental health and well-being.  According to census 2016, there are more than 195,000 family carers in the State who provide regular unpaid personal help for a friend or family member with a long-term illness, health problem or disability, including problems due to old age.  Family carers are, therefore, an integral part of the provision of health and social care in Ireland.  Just as they offer unconditional care and support to their loved ones, they deserve our continued recognition, respect and support.</p><p>In light of the vital role played by family carers in Ireland, the first ever national carers' strategy was published in 2012.  The strategy represents a whole-of-Government response to the challenges faced by family carers and sets out the strategic direction for future policies, services and supports provided by Departments and agencies for carers.  The strategy is designed around a core vision that recognises and respects carers as key care partners who are supported to maintain their own health and well-being, care with confidence and empowered to participate as fully as possible in economic and social life.  Oversight of the strategy is led by my Department, while the HSE's multi-divisional carer strategy group continues to support the process across the service divisions to progress the actions in the strategy.  The strategy provides for the implementation of 42 actions under four national goals that aim to recognise the value and contribution of carers and promote their inclusion in decisions relating to the person they are caring for; support carers to manage their physical, mental and emotional health and well-being; support carers to care with confidence through the provision of adequate information, training, services and supports; and empower carers to participate as fully as possible in economic and social life.</p><p>Ireland has a duty to protect persons with disabilities and their caregivers under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD.  Reflecting the strength of the Government's commitment to the convention, the HSE's disability services budget for 2019 is &euro;1.9 billion, which is an increase of &euro;350 million since this Government entered office.  In addition, the provision of carer's allowance, carer's benefit, carer's support grant and domiciliary care allowance, at a cost of almost &euro;1.2 billion in 2019, offers an important source of income support for those caring for a family member due to old age or disability.  The HSE provides in excess of &euro;21.6 million in annual funding through service-level arrangements with community and voluntary organisations to provide services to support family carers, including in-home respite services, peer to peer support and training courses.  The significant contribution made by community and voluntary organisations is hugely valued in both social care and health service provision.  Organisations such as Family Carers Ireland play a crucial role in advocating on behalf of family carers, offering an excellent nationwide system of supports tailored to meet the needs of family carers in every area of the country.  I commend and thank them for their efforts in highlighting the issues faced by family carers and for representing them on the national stage.</p><p>Funding has been secured through the Dormant Accounts Fund for information and training supports for family carers.  This is assisting carers to provide the best care possible to the care recipient, reduce the risk of injury to the corer and care recipient and to help family carers cope with the emotional and psychological aspects of their role.  Funding is also being made available to provide for the dissemination of resource information for family carers, develop support networks and support groups to assist with the transition back into social and economic life at the end of the caring role and to implement measures that assist in promoting carer self-identification.  Identifying carers and their needs as early as possible is of critical importance if they are to be supported in their caring role.  The introduction of the carer's needs assessment tool will be a key step in helping to identify carers at all stages and will play a role in identifying the supports required.  My Department secured dormant accounts funding, which will enable the assessment tool to be piloted in a HSE community healthcare organisation this year.  The pilot study will greatly benefit the development of a comprehensive, standardised family carer needs assessment to identify needs.  It will do so by providing an opportunity to refine and improve needs assessment.</p><p>It is worth noting the five progress reports by my Department covering the period, 2012 to 2017, and a series of independently conducted assessments of progress on the implementation of the national carers' strategy from the perspective of family carers, which found that a majority of actions have progressed in a way that has led to a positive impact on the lives of family carers.  The goals of the strategy continue to apply and its guiding principles, namely recognition, support and empowerment of carers, remain as valid now as they were in 2012.  Rather than spending our time on the development of a new strategy, we should focus our efforts on ensuring the full implementation of the current strategy.  That is why the Government remains committed to delivering the existing strategy and my Department and the HSE, through its multi-divisional carer strategy group, are focused on meeting the health sector commitments in the strategy.  I encourage all Departments and agencies to continue to build on the progress achieved under the strategy to ensure a genuine whole-of-Government response to the wide range of needs of carers is maintained.</p><p>The Committee on the Future of Healthcare's Sl&aacute;intecare report supports a significant shift in our model of care to one that is focused on prevention and early intervention and which will provide the majority of care in the community.  The Government's Sl&aacute;intecare implementation strategy sets out an ambitious programme of reform to deliver this vision.  In line with the vision of Sl&aacute;intecare to deliver a universal health service that offers the right care in the right place at the right time, my Department has commenced preliminary consideration of the scope of a social care strategy.  The strategy, which is in the early stages of planning, will enhance support and focus for the key goals of current policies, including the national carers' strategy.  We cannot underestimate the devotion and dedication of family carers to their loved ones.  They are entitled to our respect, but also to our support.  The Government is committed to looking after people who spend their time looking after others, not because it saves the State money elsewhere, but because family carers ensure that cared for persons can continue to live in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.  Family carers work exceptionally hard.  As such, the Government records in the House its desire to recognise them, thank them for the work and reassure them that we will continue to offer a range of supports that will enable them to continue caring with confidence.</p></speech>

As we have heard, there are approximately 350,000 carers in the country, which equates to almost one in ten of the population.  By 2030 one in five people will be a carer.  Just over one fifth of carers receive carer's allowance.  As Deputy Penrose said, the carer's allowance payment received by someone caring on a 24/7 basis who may be working in this role for 80 or 90 hours a week is just &euro;16 a week more than the payment received by someone on jobseeker's allowance.  While I appreciate that carer's benefit and the carer's support grant must be counted also, nobody can argue that carers are well paid for the amount of effort they put in.  If we calculate it on the basis of the national minimum wage, we will find that approximately &euro;10 billion worth of voluntary work is being done in the State every year by carers, of whom some 80% are unpaid.  If the State had to come up with that money, the Minister for Finance's problems with a no-deal Brexit, or even a Brexit with a deal, would pale into insignificance.  We have to put measures in place to deal with this growing problem or phenomenon.  The ostrich approach is no longer sufficient.</p>  <p>  I have examined the proposals made in the Labour Party's motion.  In fairness, many of them would cost very little.  I myself have put some of them forward.  I would say that in all cases, we would be talking about a gross cost.  The net cost would be far lower.  In fact, the net cost would be a fantastic substantial benefit to the Exchequer, as I think the Minister of State realises.  Some of the things set out in the motion would be relatively cost-free and could be done immediately.  I refer, for example, to the restoration or replacement of the mobility allowance which was abolished as a result of a decision made by the Ombudsman in 2013.  Like other Deputies, I have asked on numerous occasions in this House when this allowance will be restored.  The answer we are continually given is that there are complications.  What is so complicated about it?  After six years, we still do not know when it will be restored.  Essentially, it means that the only transport assistance available to disabled or elderly people is the disabled driver's regulations grant which is drawn extremely narrowly.  As it applies to people with physical disabilities only, there is no assistance whatsoever for people with intellectual disabilities.</p>  <p>  The motion proposes that carers be allowed to work for more than 15 hours a week.  If they could work for 18.5 hours a week, they would avoid being caught in with the working family payment which kicks in at 19 hours a week.  That is a very reasonable request.  When I recently asked the Minister for Finance how much this measure would cost the State, I was given a conservative estimate of &euro;1 million from the Department of Finance.  I disagree with it because I think the State would actually gain from such a move.  Why not take this step?  I know plenty of carers who would be able to work over and above the 15 hours a week threhold and thereby enhance their incomes.  God knows, they badly need it.  I cannot see any great issue with it.</p>  <p>  There is certainly a cost involved in the means test.  The motion sets out responsibly that the ultimate objective must be to have no means test.  We all aspire to achieving that objective.  I would like to mention some figures in that context.  I have suggested that in the lifetime of the next Government the &euro;665 per week threshold be raised to the level of the average industrial wage.  Of course, there is no justification for keeping the capital disallowance of &euro;20,000.  It has been pointed out that the disallowance for people with disabilities is &euro;50,000.  There is no obvious reason one should be different from the other.  I know that the means test is relatively generous in social welfare terms, but it has not been altered since 2008.  It has been frozen for the past 11 years.</p>  <p>  I agree with the reference in the motion to the postcode lottery.  When we met carers across the road earlier today, the importance of the availability of respite care in many cases was forcefully brought home to us.  One's access to respite care and other services largely depends on where one happens to live in the country.  This can no longer be tolerated.  The Carers Association has made a magnificent and fantastically innovative proposal.  If it were to be supplemented to the tune of approximately &euro;3 million per annum, the postcode lottery would be virtually eliminated.  It should be given serious consideration in the context of the next budget.</p>  <p>  As the Minister of State will be aware, when one is looking after an elderly or sick person in the home, one often has to adapt the home accordingly.  Sometimes nothing other than a stairlift is needed.  On other occasions considerable adaptation works are required.  The problem is that the financial assistance for housing adaptations has moved backwards.  In real terms, when inflation is stripped out, we are spending less than we did ten years ago, even though the number of people over the age of 65 years or in receipt of disability payments has risen significantly in tandem with the increase in the population over that time.  I do not understand the logic of our approach in that regard, particularly when we are talking about very low figures in the overall context.</p>  <p>  To be frank, the position on local authority housing is a disgrace.  Funding for the repair and adaptation of local authority housing has decreased by approximately 25% in real terms in the past five or six years, even though the number of people living in local authority houses has increased in that time.  Deputy Jan O'Sullivan and I share the same constituency.  I am sure she can testify to the fact that corporation houses in every part of Limerick city are lying empty.  The council tells us that it has no money to do them up, even though approximately 4,000 people are on the housing list, which is getting worse.</p>  <p>  I think the Government should accept the motion which we will support.  Contrary to what some people have suggested, it is not a question of throwing money at problems, or of Fianna F&aacute;il and the Labour Party being spendthrift; rather, it is a question of saving the State a hell of a lot of money in the not too distant future.  We know what is going to happen down the line from a demographics perspective and what we are trying to do.  As Deputy Penrose pointed out, the net weekly cost to the State of home care is &euro;900, if it stops at that figure, whereas the weekly cost of a hospital bed is &euro;6,000.  We have to put something in place that will represent a substantial saving to the State and, much more importantly, prevent many people from suffering the distress, anxiety and anguish they will suffer if we do not make this change.  For demographic reasons, this is probably the only way we can do it down the line.  We will be happy to support the motion.</p></speech>

Once again, I pay tribute to the immense work done by them.  I support the motion proposed by Deputy Penrose and his Labour Party colleagues.  Those who work as carers have been completely undervalued by the Government, even though they provide essential support for their loved ones at a substantially reduced cost to the State.  Carers who do not have access to proper support services struggle to obtain appropriate training and advice on the challenges they face.  They cannot access emergency support and are unable to take regular breaks from their demanding roles.  They often feel alone, undervalued and ignored.</p>  <p>  As Deputy O'Dea said, there are 375,000 carers in Ireland.</p><p>We must remember that some of them are very young, some are very old and others are dual carers because they are caring for a child who might have an intellectual disability and elderly parents.  Fewer than one fifth of these people receive the carer's allowance so they are certainly doing the State some service.  </p> <p> I recently attended a Carers in Crisis public meeting organised by carers for carers for the south east.  I was struck by what I found at that meeting.  Carers feel neglected, isolated and depressed.  I listened to people who were in utter despair as they spoke openly about their daily lives, the challenges they face and how difficult it is trying to cope from day to day.  One issue that came up on more than one occasion was the need for emergency respite care in the event of a major family upset such as a death.  I listened intently to a young mother in her forties who had a ten-year-old child with intellectual disabilities.  Her own mother had passed away.  She said that she felt like a beggar trying to find emergency respite care for her child because there was no way she would have been able to mind her child during the upheaval of the funeral and burial.  I was struck by how difficult it is when something out of the ordinary happens and how important emergency respite care is.  I am sure every Member has similar stories but if there is one pointer we could take out of this debate, it is that emergency respite care is so important.  </p> <p> I also want to refer to another parent whose child had intellectual and physical disabilities.  The father had given up work because the child was as big as a young adult.  Carer's benefit is only paid for 104 weeks.  This man was coming to the end of the 104-week term and was under pressure trying to decide whether he would go back to work and wondering how the family was going to cope.  There is a big ask in this regard.  Carer's benefit needs to be extended to 156 weeks, which is three years.  That would make a significant difference.  If the child was cared for on a full-time basis by the State, it would cost far more and, therefore, it would be fiscally sensible to extend carer's benefit for a parent of a child who has to give up work to 156 weeks in order that the parent can stay at home and look after his or her own child.  </p></speech>

Approximately 350,000 people in this country are carers, with one in ten people looking after a loved one, and this number will increase substantially as our population ages.  Approximately one in five carers receive carer's supports.  Many of these carers are at breaking point.  They are very much isolated and suffer from anxiety and depression - very often because of the lack of support for them.  When carers get to a point where they end up breaking down because they do not have the supports they need, it becomes self-defeating because they are no longer in a position to look after the people who need to be cared for.  Those supports need to be put in place along with appropriate training and advice.  Many carers simply are not aware of what rights are out there and how to access them.</p>  <p>  Regarding respite care, I dealt with one woman today who told me that it has been more than six years since her family was provided with respite care, which makes it difficult for that family as its members become more and more tired looking after their loved ones.  I also want to talk about the time it takes to get approval for carer's benefit, particularly in cases where people have terminal cancer.  I know that, ultimately, there is back pay.  I was told about it previously by the Taoiseach but that is an irrelevance when somebody needs approval for the payment in order that he or she can get the care he or she needs.  I ask the Minister of State to pay heed to this motion and I am glad to support it.</p></speech>

The motion deals with carers this evening and it was home helps yesterday evening.  There seems to be an ongoing situation involving these improvements that should happen but are not happening.  As has been pointed out, carers save the State billions of euro.  Carers should not have to go down this road as they are saving the State money.  One in ten people provide care for a loved one.  Fianna F&aacute;il was involved in bringing in the carer's allowance, carer's benefit and respite care grant, which is now the carer's support grant.  Fianna F&aacute;il made changes to the social welfare system in order  half-rate carer's allowance could be paid.  All these measures were implemented probably when times were not as good.  While we acknowledge there are strains on finances and we do not know what will happen with Brexit, the Government must look after people in these circumstances.  They are saving the State a lot of money and doing a lot of work that would otherwise have to be done by the State.  We should realise one thing about carers today.  Many years ago, the local doctor called to houses to look after older people and advise families about them.  This practice has disappeared.  That is the way things go so this is all the more reason more supports, training and assistance should be introduced for carers and there should be further change to the social welfare system so that we make it easy for carers to take up this work and do it.  Like everybody else, we want these changes to happen.</p>  <p>  In respect of the case referred to by Deputy Penrose, those people are from my own parish.  He is correct.  They are from my parish and I know them very well.  The Deputy made his case here passionately.  I can tell him their daughter was stressed after being asked for a valuation of their house in England.  The same happened with another lady in my parish.  We have significant difficulty with that case.  She was asked questions about bringing her sister-in-law home from England when she realised she had Alzheimer's disease.  She was put through the mill trying to get home care assistance for her sister-in-law.</p></speech>

I would like all of that to be streamlined and greater understanding shown to those coming home to care for their individual family members.  Carers have saved the State significant money.  Every Member will make that statement.  It is time the Government began to count the cost in terms of how much money is saved because we are not talking about one individual carer.  We are talking about family members coming together to cover all the hours to look after the individual they love.  That needs to be recognised.</p>  <p>  I support what Deputy Butler said about the meeting held in Kilkenny.  The anger at that meeting stemmed from the fact that carers feel they are not appreciated and understood by Government, which does not understand the extent of the work they do, and they are under significant pressure.  Other speakers mentioned stress, depression, difficulties in families and the arguments that take place.  If we are going to give leadership in this area and prepare for a greater number of people to be cared for in the future, we must be proactively ahead of this and prepare for new ways of conducting this type of business.  We must listen to those on the front line such as the people providing care and the people at that meeting.  </p>  <p>  I would say the same with regard to home care.  The Government should listen to those employed by the HSE and how they believe the hours should be organised and recognised.  It will find that it will save money and give greater care where it is needed through working with them rather than against them.</p></speech>

It is a reflection of the importance of the extended family in society, which is part of our history and culture.  It is also a reflection of the strong sense of community that still exists, despite the pressures of modern living.  We are clear about our responsibilities to older people and those who, for whatever reason, are unable to care fully for themselves.  I am proud of the fact that Fianna F&aacute;il introduced the carer's allowance, carer's benefit and respite care grant.  It reflected our commitment to the role of the carer.</p>  <p>  However, there are many things we can do better.  Those working as carers have been undervalued by the Government, despite the fact that they provide essential supports to their loved ones at a substantially reduced cost to the State.  Carers who do not have access to proper support services struggle to obtain appropriate training and advice about the challenges they face.  Sometimes they cannot access emergency supports.  Many are unable to take regular breaks from their demanding role and can often feel ignored, undervalued and alone.  It is estimated that by 2030, one in five people will be a carer.</p><p>The outcome for a person being cared for at home is far better than for a person who is in permanent care away from home.  Accordingly, careful investment in carers is quality investment in the health service.  However, careful and quality investment in the health service have been in short supply in recent years.  In order to maintain a strong, vibrant and motivated caring culture, we must invest in training, supports and, most of all, carers.  Not to do so would be foolish in the extreme.</p></speech>

One of the challenges every week on this side of the House during Private Members&rsquo; time is to get across a coherent point because the time allocated is so short.</p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il supports the motion.  The income disregards for carers are the exact same as they were in 2010.  With incomes rising, the value of carers is going down dramatically.  We must have particular regard for those with young children who require high levels of care who gave up their employment to care full time in the home and are dependent on one salary.  That issue has to be examined, particularly in the case of those with high mortgage repayments.</p>  <p>  Will the Minister of State change the means test to bring it into line with the changes in the cost of living since 2010?  Will he take into account a reasonable amount for mortgage expenses as a deductible cost?  The group of young carers of working age are being penalised.</p></speech>

I welcome representatives from Family Carers Ireland to the Visitors Gallery.  Sinn F&eacute;in has brought forward an amendment which I believe strengthens the motion.  I hope all parties and none will read it and consider supporting it.</p><p>Carers are the backbone of our society and save the State &euro;10 billion a year.  Every day they look after and care for some of the most vulnerable citizens.  In doing so, they ensure the person being cared for can remain in his or her own home, the place where he or she wants to be.  The vision statement in the 2012 national carers strategy published by the Government stated:</p><blockquote>Carers will be recognised and respected as key care partners.  They will be supported to maintain their own health and well-being and to care with confidence.  They will be empowered to participate as fully as possible in economic and social life.</blockquote><p>They are nice words, but seven years on we must ask ourselves if carers feel recognised, respected, supported and empowered?  When it comes to the social protection system, the very obvious answer to that question is &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  Instead, they face many significant challenges in a system which should support and protect them.  Qualifying for a carer&rsquo;s payment is almost impossible.  That is why the majority of the 355,000 carers receive no carer&rsquo;s payment whatsoever.  Why?  The means test used to determine if a person will qualify for carer&rsquo;s allowance is extremely rigid.  It considers all household income of the carer based on gross income, essentially money a household never actually sees.  It should be calculated on net income.  The allowable deductions in the assessment of means also need to be extended to items such as mortgage repayments, rent payments, costs associated with dependent children and medical costs.  Those who take up a caring role will always be impacted on financially.  We can and should lessen the impact.  Those who receive a carer&rsquo;s payment are restricted in that they cannot qualify for secondary benefits such as the working family payment.  They cannot work or study outside the home for more than 15 hours a week.  That flies in the face of the vision statement.  We should not tell carers what hours they can work or study outside the home.  All caring roles are different and carers should be allowed to manage their own time.  We should trust them to do so.  Sinn F&eacute;in's amendment reflects this.</p><p>On returning to work or education after a caring role ceases, carers again face difficulties in that there is no intensive specific activation supports to assist them.  We need to see existing schemes such as the local employment service and the community employment scheme resourced sufficiently to ensure carers are assisted in returning to work.  They must have an opportunity to develop new skills, be assisted in updating their CVs and learn new interview techniques, with practical supports.</p><p>On retirement, when it comes to qualifying for the State pension, carers have been punished for having gaps in their PRSI records.  The system overlooks care as a contribution, while placing the emphasis solely on contributions in paid employment.  The motion makes no reference to carers and the State pension.  The new total contributions approach should cater for carers and ensure the time they have taken out of the workforce to care for someone will be recognised as a contribution.  We need to review the new approach to ensure it will benefit the very people it was introduced to help.  The amendment would ensure that would happen.</p><p>The publication of a new national carers&rsquo; strategy is essential.  The Minister of State has said he will not do this but will implement what has been proposed.  There is a need for specific and dedicated funding, with timeframes to ensure Departments will meet their set objectives within a specific timeframe.  Otherwise, the strategy is meaningless.  The amendment would ensure this would happen.</p><p>Family Carers Ireland has told us that by 2030 one in five people will be a carer.  A conversation is needed on what this will mean for employers and employees.  The amendment calls for engagement between trade unions and key stakeholders representing employers, employees and carers on ways by which employers could better support employees with caring responsibilities, given the inevitable increase in the number of carers in the next ten years.  We need to start this conversation now in order that we can plan for the increase.</p><p>While complimenting the work carers do and in recognising their valuable role in society, the challenges they face, as highlighted by them, are not being tackled.  Far too many of them cannot access basic social welfare supports.  They are limited in their caring role and punished financially, while, at the same time, saving the State billions of euro every year.  Every day the Government tells us about the improving and growing economy, yet we are continuing to fail 355,000 carers.  There is no longer a lack of funding available for the national carers strategy.  That excuse can no longer be peddled by the Government.  The strategy must be brought back to the table to be examined with carers and caring organisations.  A new strategy must be published, with dedicated funding this year.</p><p>Carers have weathered the difficult economic storm and welcomed the national carers strategy seven years ago.  They waited patiently for the Government to honour its commitment to review it in better economic times.  This is the time to end the exploitation of carers who save the State billions of euro every year.  I listened intently to the Minister of State&rsquo;s statement.</p><p>It is full of applause for the carers but it lacks substance and commitment.  It lacks a vision and a plan to help our carers.  We owe that to them and we owe it to them now.</p></speech>

That is enough to fill every seat in Croke Park.  A large proportion of those carers suffer depression as a result of never getting a break.  Every human being needs a break.  Even a short break allows us to recharge.  This is even more important if one is providing care seven days a week, 24 hours a day.  As we know, 6,000 older people nationwide are on a waiting list for home help.  Some 180 of those older people live in the constituency of Roscommon-Galway.  This problem is compounded by the fact that seven out of ten full-time carers have no access to respite care to give them a vital break.  They cannot get a break if they want to go to a family occasion.  They cannot even get a few hours off to attend a family funeral.  This leaves carers isolated and alone.  It leaves them far more prone to getting sick, leading them to be hospitalised themselves, forcing the older person or person with a disability for whom they care into long-term residential care, which has a knock-on impact on the health service and on society as a whole.  We need to ensure proper statutory provision for and access to respite care in this country to ensure carers get the opportunity to have that break.  Whether it is a break of a few hours every week from providing full-time care to an older person or a break for a family occasion, that access needs to be put in place immediately.</p></speech>

I was at its briefing today.  I fully support its pre-budget submission, &quot;A Decade Lost&quot;.  Its very reasonable demands are outlined in this motion and in the Sinn F&eacute;in amendment.  I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Private Member's motion but I also have to put on record my astonishment at the hypocrisy of the Labour Party on issues such as this.  Its motion refers to the period of adjustment, which is to say, when the Labour Party was in office from 2011 to 2016.  This is a very dishonest way to describe a period of brutal austerity deliberately aimed at the most vulnerable, the weakest, and those least able to resist.  Labour Ministers were at the front line of this brutal assault on the very people in support of whom the party has now tabled a Private Members' motion.</p><p>In the submission from Family Carers Ireland it states:</p><blockquote>Carer&rsquo;s health, both physical and mental, has deteriorated as has their access to vital supports and services, including respite.  Carer&rsquo;s repeatedly reported in 2009 and in 2019 that they need more respite and homecare hours to support them to be healthy.  Despite such calls for support, in the last decade there has been a 70% increase in the number of carers diagnosed with depression; a 24 percent increase in carers reporting poor health; a 30 percent increase in those experiencing anxiety and a 65 percent increase in the number of carers who have no access to respite.</blockquote><p>The hypocrisy of the Government is equally astonishing and equally dishonest.  Once again the Government's amendment includes weasel words about a commitment to Sl&aacute;intecare when in fact Sl&aacute;intecare, as a programme of serious reform to our healthcare system which is not fit for purpose, has effectively been shelved.  A key point made in the Sl&aacute;intecare report is that a piecemeal approach to implementation - a bit here and a bit there - would undermine the whole project.  Without Sl&aacute;intecare being implemented as intended, there will be no abatement of the health crisis.  </p><p>It is a crisis that is worsening daily.  For example, 6,300 families have been approved for home care assistance but are not going to get it.  Funding has been frozen.  An internal document from the HSE refers to the probability of a &euro;500 million cut to home help hours to try to keep within the budget for this year.  The HSE and the Minister of State say there will be no cuts but the reality is that-----</p></speech>

The following are words from Family Carers Ireland's submission, "These findings are a damning indictment of Government&rsquo;s attitude towards carers and are completely at odds with Sl&aacute;intecare&rsquo;s core objective - to shift the delivery of care from an acute setting towards care in the community and home."   Is the Minister of State saying those figures are wrong?</p>  <p>  The other point it made very clearly is that the hours a carer can work or study per week must be increased from 15 to 18.5.  It is very important to implement such an increase.  I would like to see a genuine approach from Government to deal with these issues.  We should be looking at putting money into issues such as these rather than at cutting taxes.</p></speech>

I thank the Labour Party for bringing it forward.  When I was spokesman for the party some years ago I published the party&rsquo;s carers&rsquo; strategy, which we called "Caring for our Carers".  It was an important initiative.  The motion before us today highlights Ireland's duty, under both the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, to ensure that parents and caregivers for children and adults with disabilities are given assistance &ldquo;including assistance with disability-related expenses&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  Earlier today, Family Carers Ireland launched its pre-budget submission for budget 2020.  As the Minister of State knows, the representatives spoke of the anger and disappointment many carers feel at the moment.  They said that morale is very low because of what they feel is a lack of support, especially with regard to home help and respite.  Family Carers Ireland is asking for the carer&rsquo;s allowance means test to be reformed and that the income disregard be increased to &euro;450 for a single person and &euro;900 for a couple.  It highlights that there has been no change to the disregard since 2008, that is, for a decade.  The group asks for allowable deductions to be extended and for income to be assessed on its net value.  Family Carers Ireland is also asking for the capital disregard to be increased to &euro;50,000, for carer&rsquo;s allowance to be exempt from income tax, and for carer payments to be excluded from the financial assessment of the working family payment.  It also believes the cap on work or study time for carers of 15 hours per week is too low and that it should be increased to at least 18.5 hours. </p>  <p>  Many of these requests or asks are included in the very comprehensive motion Deputy Penrose has tabled.  In addition to what I have outlined, the Labour Party motion also asks that a study be conducted on the cost of caring.  One of the things for which we have advocated over the years is a cost of caring allowance.  The other major reforms listed in the submission are also included in the motion before us.  Of particular importance is providing community and voluntary organisations with increased funding in order that people in every location have access to adequate services.  Other proposals include replacing the mobility allowance and motorised transport grant, increasing funding for the housing adaptation grant, and extending the GP visit card to carers in receipt of the carer&rsquo;s support grant.</p>  <p>  We all have been cared for and we all will be carers.  We all have had experience of caring at one time or another but there is something like 355,000 full-time carers in Ireland, more than 13,000 of whom are under 25 years of age.  This is a remarkable statistic.  The average number of hours per week that a carer spends caring is conservatively estimated at 45 hours.  Only approximately one fifth receive either carer&rsquo;s allowance or carer&rsquo;s benefit.  It is estimated that at least 35,000 more are not granted a payment due to being outside of the income limits.  </p>  <p>  There is clearly a great deal of work that Government needs to do to properly recognise the contribution of carers.  A study titled &ldquo;Valuing Informal Care in Ireland: Beyond the Traditional Production Boundary&rdquo; was carried out by Dr. Paul Hanly and Dr. Corina Sheerin.  This study estimated the value of informal care in Ireland at &euro;5.3 billion, which exceeds expenditure by the Government on home-based long-term care and long-term residential facilities.</p><p>It is a remarkable contribution by a cohort of fellow citizens.  Many of us have had experience of this or will have in the future.  In a very timely way the Labour Party motion brings the issue to our attention again, particularly in the run-up to making decisions on what may be a very difficult budget.</p></speech>

People cannot organise the timing of when they get sick.  It often happens that an elderly mother, father, brother or sister gets sick and has to go to hospital.  Eventually they cannot stay in the hospital any longer and are faced with the choice of going into a home or going home.  Many people from different walks of life do not like going into a home; it is a last resort.  They feel that if they go into a home they will never come out into the world again.  People want to go home and stay in their home for as long as possible.  It is then up to a family member, perhaps a single daughter or son, to look after that person.  They may be working and may have to give up their job and come home to mind their mother or father.  The carer may be a mother who is already very busy with a young family and is going out to work.  She is then asked to give up her job to mind her mum or dad.</p>  <p>  Those family members apply for carer's allowance.  That is the first time for them to be without their wages and they find that it takes up to 16 weeks to get the carer's allowance.  It is unbelievable that people have to wait that long.  Why does it take so long?  Why can we not have more people processing the claims?  After weeks it is pointed out that something is missing from the application and it takes more time.  That person is either trying to borrow money from the credit union or trying to live on something they can get from the elderly parent's pension.  It is not fair and it is not good enough.  Government Members continually talk up the economy, but I believe there is no copper at all because anytime we look for something, money seems to be the trouble.  People would appreciate it if the truth is that the Government does not have the money.</p>  <p>  There is a lovely new hospital in Kenmare with only half of it open and at present there is only one respite bed there.  If an elderly person gets two weeks' respite care in a year, for that entire area that hospital can cater for only 24 people.  For the entire area from Poulgorm Bridge where one turns off the Cork road back to the end of Lauragh, through Kenmare and likewise down into Sneem as far as Castlecove or Cahirdaniel and all the places in between it is not enough.  I am asking for that hospital to be fully utilised and brought into service.</p></speech>

This is an issue that should generate widespread cross-party support.</p>  <p>  The Central Statistics Office has found that 10% of the population are providing care to someone with a chronic condition or an infirmity due to old age for an average of nearly 45 hours per week.  An estimated 355,000 people in Ireland are carers, many of them caring for family members on an unpaid basis.  Disturbingly the study also found that more than 13,000 carers are under the age of 25, including children involved in care giving, which is shocking.  While this is commendable on one level it also speaks to the fact that so many young people are essentially providing the role of carer while also trying to balance other work-life opportunities including trying to rear young families.</p>  <p>  I have highlighted that the carers of Tipperary provide a staggering 256,120 hours of care per week.  This breaks down to an average of 42.1 hours per carer per week, which is an enormous sacrifice.  The findings also record that 7,041 people in Tipperary stated that they provided regular unpaid personal help for a friend or family member with a long-term illness, health problem or disability.  This comprises 4.4% of the county&rsquo;s population in April 2016.</p>  <p>  Going back to the young age of the carers, a response to a parliamentary question stated that there are at least 138 carers aged under 15 years, a shocking figure.  This is a situation that demands immediate examination.  These statistics demonstrate the clear need for Government to prioritise and fully resource carers' needs and to ensure they are provided with every level of assistance possible.</p>  <p>  With a sector of our society providing more than 250,000 hours of care every week, it is very clear the work they are doing is of fundamental importance.  That must be reflected in the Government's approach to carers and their families.  The carers had an event this morning in Buswells as they do every year.  We have plenty of patronising talk about how great they are.  As Deputy Danny Healy-Rae and others have said, it is ridiculous how long it takes for an application to be processed.  I salute Jim Molloy, the manager of carers in south Tipperary and his colleagues, along with all the care givers.  It is time for the Government to pony up and put its money where its mouth is.  Pious platitudes are no good.  The Government needs to give support and respect to the family carers.  It needs to shorten the waiting time for applications.</p></speech>

I want to focus on one aspect of the issue relating to the submission made by Family Carers Ireland, FCI, in respect of the transport and mobility scheme.  The mobility allowance and motorised transport grant was withdrawn in 2013.  I quote from a very sensible submission it made, which states:</p><blockquote>The failure to replace the Mobility Allowance and Motorised Transport Schemes, withdrawn in 2013 on the grounds of age discrimination, has led to the illogical situation whereby those who received a Mobility Allowance prior to 2013 have been allowed to keep it while others now equally in need are locked out.  It also means that the only transport support available is the Disabled Drivers and Passengers Scheme, which is targeted only at those with severe physical disabilities, with no support available to those with an intellectual disability.<br /><br />This prioritises the needs of people with physical disabilities over those with an intellectual disability and is subject to legal challenge. </blockquote><p>That sums up the issue.</p><p>I am Chairman of the Committee on Public Petitions.  The Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, who has responsibility for disabilities, appeared before the committee in October 2017.  At that stage he was promising a transport scheme.  Last year in May 2018, a memorandum was brought to the Government on the same issue with proposals for a transport-support payment scheme which did not seem to pass muster at the Cabinet and they were asked to go away and look at the issue again.  In January 2019 the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, stated:</p><blockquote>I intend to revert to Government in due course with revised proposals to reflect the discussions at that Cabinet meeting and further discussions between myself and Minister Harris on the best way to progress the Transport Scheme.</blockquote><p>I do not understand the role of the Minister of State in the Government.  I know what his title is but I feel strongly that he has delivered absolutely nothing for the people he is supposed to serve.  This is a typical example of a Government kicking to touch an issue it promised to legislate and provide for.  It is a very specific issue but it affects people in a complex way.  </p> <p> The spirit of this motion from our party reflects a sensible set of recommendations from Family Carers Ireland.  If the Minister of State gives the excuse that there are little or no resources, we will take that with a pinch of salt.  The rainy day fund is an example of that.  Money can be found for that particular scheme to ensure that those in need are provided for.  It would not take a pile of money to do this, given that on numerous occasions, including at Cabinet meetings, the Minister of State has said that he would provide for the replacement of the 2013 scheme.  In my short submission, I call on him to deliver on his promise.  When it comes to this agenda, the Minister of State has disappeared.  He is kicking everything to touch.</p> <p> I could go on and on about the families I deal with on a daily basis and their sons and daughters with intellectual disabilities who cannot access even a night of respite.  As Deputies, we have had conversations with the CEOs of the service providers and then have gone back to the HSE and the Government but we cannot get honest, decent answers to the questions we put forward.  All we want is to represent the people who elected us.  All they are asking for, on behalf of their families, is the dignity of being able to access respite care for their loved ones.</p> <p> The Minister of State has gone to ground and I fail to understand it.  The Labour Party made decisions in government and we paid a price for it but this is a time of relative plenty; the resources are there.  I understand the Government has to make provision for things such as Brexit but I do not understand why, in the times in which we live, we cannot provide for those who do not have a strong voice for themselves.</p></speech>

I thank Members of other parties who have expressed support for this motion, which I believe will be passed by the D&aacute;il tomorrow afternoon; I certainly hope so.  We tabled the motion to get action.  As did Deputy Penrose, who spoke so passionately about the cases he knows, I attended a regional meeting in Limerick on 29 April.  There were hundreds of family carers there in absolute desperation but who had managed to make arrangements and get away to attend the meeting in order that we would have an understanding of their plight.  They wrote down five priorities and one that struck me was that they want to move from understanding and sympathy to action.  That is what we want to achieve through this motion and, therefore, I welcome the support of others.</p>  <p>  I want to see Government action on this, because what it has committed to is minimal.  We are coming up to the budgetary cycle and we want to see real commitments in the budget to address these issues.  I reiterate what Deputy Joan Collins said: it is much more important to give carers a decent quality of life and income than to cut taxes.  Whatever priorities we have in this country, let us prioritise carers. </p>  <p>  In the short time available to me, I want to talk about two matters of justice, namely, the income disregard and the fact that it is taxable.  Many other social welfare payments are not taxable and there are many income disregards that do not apply to carer's allowance.  We want to see the income disregard increase and the introduction of other measures to allow the many carers who do not get carer's allowance to get into the net, which is important.</p>  <p>  In the long term, we want to see a plan to abolish the means test.  These people are workers and they work an awful lot more than 35 hours per week; in some cases, they are working round the clock.  We heard harrowing stories of the tough role for those caring for children who wake every half hour at night.  Another person who spoke at that meeting, who I know, has for years been caring for an adult son and gets absolutely no money because of the means test.  It is not enough to sympathise; we absolutely have to move to action.</p>  <p>  I will refer to a few things that have perhaps not got as much attention as others.  The first is the issue of increasing the hours that carers can work or study to 18.5 hours per week.  If a carer spends 35 hours per week caring, although most spend an awful lot more, there is no reason they should not be allowed to work during the hours that, for example, the child is at school or the adult is in day care.  That recommendation comes directly from the Family Carers Ireland pre-budget submission, which many of us attended this morning.  I thank that organisation for the detail it provided us with.</p>  <p>  Family Carers Ireland was very strong on the issue of the postcode lottery, whereby a carer in one area will get respite but a carer in another will not, or will get a housing adaptation grant in one area but have to wait two or three years in another.  That is wrong; people should have these things as a right.  We deliberately framed our motion in a rights-based context and referred to United Nations conventions and so on.  We need to start looking at this as issues of right, not things for which people must constantly fight, on top of all the other things in their lives they must do.</p>  <p>  I want to raise a specific issue from my constituency.  The St. Gabriel's Centre, which caters for people with disabilities, has through fundraising built a beautiful respite home at the edge of Limerick.  It serves a wide region of not just the mid-west but further.  While I acknowledge the HSE has given the centre some funding to manage, the St. Gabriel's Centre does not have the money to open the respite centre.  It would make such a difference to many families in my part of the country.  </p>  <p>  However, this motion is about carers in all parts of the country, who do so much in looking after their loved ones and in saving the State money, at great damage to their own health and well-being.  The do it because these people are their loved ones, but that is not enough any more.  We have to respond.  We are coming up to a budget and we need definite commitments to action.  That is why we have tabled this motion.</p>  <p>  I thank my constituency colleague, Deputy O'Dea, who said that Fianna F&aacute;il will support the motion, which I welcome.  That means that with the support of other Opposition parties, we will get this motion through tomorrow.  We want to see Government action quickly and in the longer term, we want to see the means test abolished.</p></speech>

Recently, I attended a Family Carers Ireland roadshow, which set out the incredible work of carers, day by day, week by week.  When one considers the changing demographics we face, ones sees that as a Government, we have to set out a roadmap of how we are going to respond to these challenges.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge the huge work done by Deputy Penrose throughout his career in advocating for carers.  As someone who shares a constituency with the Deputy, I have seen him push for carers and bring major policy decisions to the table during difficult times in this State.  He spelled out clearly the important correlation between taxation and improved services.  It is not often we hear such honesty in the Chamber from someone speaking to a motion.</p>  <p>  Small changes can make a huge difference, be it credit for the State contributory pension, which currently is not in place, or increasing the exemption to work to 18.5 hours.</p><p>These are not costly things but can make a significant difference to people, their lives and the care they deliver.</p> <p> On a broader point, the postcode lottery has been pointed to for a long time by the association.  As someone who is on the ground assisting potential applicants for a carer's allowance through oral appeals and a process that can be stressful when someone has a sick relative or friend to deal with, I believe we need to support them as best we can and set out that plan.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-06-26a.458" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1307" speakername="Catherine Byrne" time="19:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019062600055#HHH00200"><p>I would like to start by expressing the admiration that, l am sure, all Members of this House have for family carers.  Every day, tens of thousands of people provide care for parents, children, partners, family members and others.  They come from various different walks of life and began their caring responsibilities at different stages of their lives.  It is only right that we recognise the value and contribution made by family carers in the healthcare system.</p>  <p>  Supports for the carers of people are also vital as, in many ways, the needs of the carer are interlinked with the cared-for person.  Respite care is particularly important as it enables carers to take up or to maintain work, education, leisure and training opportunities or just time for themselves.  This year alone, the HSE&rsquo;s disability service budget of &euro;1.9 billion will provide 8,568 residential places, 22,272 day places, 182,506 respite overnight stays, 32,662 day respite sessions, 1.63 million personal assistant hours for 2,535 people, and 3.08 million home support hours for 8,094 people.</p>  <p>  In older persons&rsquo; services, &euro;446 million will be spent on the delivery of 18.2 million hours of care through home support and intensive home care packages.  The development of a new, stand-alone statutory scheme and system of regulation for home support services is a long-standing objective of the Government.  This is currently progressing in line with the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation strategy.  The new scheme will improve access to adult home support services that people need in an equitable, affordable and sustainable way.  It will be designed to support carers and will complement and integrate effectively with other health and social care services.</p>  <p>  Promoting a better awareness and understanding of the contribution of carers and their needs is also crucial to ensuring that we develop the right kinds of services to support carers within and outside of their caring role.  The annual carer&rsquo;s forum is a key success of the national carers' strategy, which enables policymakers to meet with family carers and to hear their concerns.  </p>  <p>  The HSE also provides funding to groups which offer support and information to carers and family members.  In addition, the HSE has provided support for the establishment of mental health engagement fora, which offer an opportunity for carers and family members to have a say.  </p>  <p>  There have been a range of improvements made to financial supports for carers in the past number of years.  When a carer&rsquo;s full-time role comes to an end, either as a result of bereavement or the permanent admission of the care recipient to a residential care setting, carer&rsquo;s allowance continues to be paid for a period of 12 weeks, doubling the previous length of continued payment.  This measure offers a period of financial certainty during a time of personal upheaval at the end of the caring role.</p>  <p>  Since June 2017, all children in receipt of a domiciliary care allowance are eligible for a medical card without a means test.  Since September 2018, free GP visit cards have been extended to persons in receipt of the carer&rsquo;s allowance or carer&rsquo;s benefit, at both full and half rates.  This will ensure that carers themselves are supported to protect their own physical, mental and emotional well-being.  </p>  <p>  The recent annual increases in carer&rsquo;s allowance and carer&rsquo;s benefit this year highlight the Government&rsquo;s commitment to maintain financial supports for carers.  </p>  <p>  The Government considers that while many parts of the motion are valid in principle, it is not possible to offer full support.  The motion would have a significant impact and the Government must manage its budget in a prudent manner.  Increasing the income disregard for carer&rsquo;s allowance from &euro;332.50 to &euro;450 for a single person and &euro;665 to &euro;900 for a couple would cost the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection approximately &euro;73 million.  </p>  <p>  The conditions attached to payment of carer&rsquo;s allowance are consistent with the overall conditions that apply to social assistance payments generally.  This system of social assistance support provides payments based on an income need with the means test playing the critical role in determining whether an income need arises as a consequence of a particular contingency - be it illness, disability, unemployment or caring.</p>  <p>  While the measures outlined illustrate the significant progress made to date in implementing the carers' strategy, I am aware that we can do more to meet the needs of carers and foster a climate in which they feel valued and supported to continue in their caring roles.  As mentioned, the 2012 national carers&rsquo; strategy remains relevant and the policy direction is still valid.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, does not believe that a new carers&rsquo; strategy is therefore the best way forward, rather we should intensify our efforts to realise the objectives of the strategy.  </p>  <p>  The Minister has asked officials in the Department of Health to continue to engage with all relevant Departments and Government agencies to build opportunities to strengthen the implementation of the strategy to ensure that we keep the needs of carers to the fore as we prepare for the 2020 Estimates process.</p></speech>

Care work is a vocation.  Carers put in hours and hours to help their loved ones and close relatives, be they young children, middle aged or elderly.  Sometimes, in desperate situations, carers are looking for respite help and it is not out there.  Take, for example, a child with autism whose parent is his or her carer.  That parent might be looking for some place for a weekend, to get a break, and the services are not available in some parts of the country.</p>  <p>  There is another part of this issue that needs addressing.  I have seen people working in Dublin whose mother or father may get sick down in the country.  Because of the respect and love such a person has for his or her mother or father, that person leaves Dublin to go home and look after his or her mother or father in his or her time of need.  Such people might have a house in Dublin or a spouse who was working, which will be included in a means test.  Such people will be told they cannot be in Dublin and in the west at the same time and will be refused carer's allowance.  The process that has to be gone through is long and laboured, especially if an application is refused and must be appealed.  It goes on and on.  Do we not realise that such people are saving the State money by going to look after their loved ones?  They may have given up a job and a life to do that in parts of the country but the State shows no respect for that.  I ask the Minister of State to ensure this is addressed.  I fully support the motion of the Labour Party.</p></speech>

He has a track record in this area.   Everyone in this House can see the passion he has shown about this issue.  I assure everyone in the House that Deputy Penrose has spoken up for carers for decades and, indeed, it is a topic to which he regularly returns in our party meetings.  The Labour Party is delighted to put forward this motion.</p>  <p>  The motion goes hand in glove with the motion that was before the House last night about home help hours and home care packages.  The motions are first cousins of each other in the way we need to re-look at both of them.</p><p>To be frank, carers and the provision of home care packages and assisted hours help to save the State hundreds of millions of euro.  We must re-evaluate these matters as we are getting things on the cheap with carers.  I am grateful to Family Carers Ireland and Care Alliance Ireland, members of which are here, for the information they continuously provide for us to update our knowledge of this very important area.<br/><br/>One of our aims in bringing forward this Labour Party motion was to give carers a voice.  All too often, people caring for a loved one do so in isolation.  Much of the time people around here exist in a bubble.  It is important, therefore, that we inform ourselves.  It is also important to give people a voice, as we are doing.  Given everything we have heard, we have been very successful in relating some stories of carers and getting into the nitty-gritty of the issues faced by them.  This is only one step on the road to providing carers with the recognition and assistance they need.  The collective actions we take from now on are most important.<br/><br/>Many people do not even consider themselves to be carers, as they see themselves as sons or daughters, siblings or parents who are looking after those whom they love.  Practically every one of us was raised in a context of everyday care for others.  Our parents or guardians looked after us as children and we reciprocate that action as we grow.  My nine year old daughter, Aoibhe, was here today and I always jokingly ask her if she will mind me when I am old.  Am I really joking when I ask this question?  There is intergenerational care; caring for others is at the heart of what it is to be a human being.<br/><br/>Sometimes a person's care needs move beyond the ordinary and become frequent and more fundamental.  When we speak about carers, we are referring to people who work daily to ensure someone else can meet his or her basic needs or function in daily life.  People become carers in different ways; sometimes it is because of an accident or the onset of a condition which requires care, while in other cases the process is gradual, perhaps because of a health issue as a result of a physical disability, dementia or something else.  That is why it is so important that as a society we and the State recognise the existence of carers as a distinct and unique group.<br/><br/>I will not reiterate all parts of the motion, but the bottom line is that carers need the State to support them, not replace them, and provide practical assistance to meet their own needs.  It is as simple as that, but sometimes it seems that we lose sight of this basic objective.  Too much emphasis is placed by the State on application forms, means testing and waiting lists, as we also heard last night.  We all know that the State must manage limited resources and distribute them as fairly as possible, but it has gone too far.  I submitted a parliamentary question that was answered yesterday.  I was contacted by a number of people who told me that the number of inspections related to carer's allowance had increased rapidly this year.  I asked the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection for the number, but, amazingly, the reply was that it could not provide the statistics.  That makes me nervous.  It is deeply worrying as the fact that a Department cannot provide statistics for its own reviews indicates that it is not functioning properly.<br/><br/>Why do we have a means test for full-time carers?  We know that regardless of their means, every full-time carer provides a valuable service that would cost the State several times more to provide than the carer's allowance of &euro;219.  With full-time carers providing care for an average of nearly 45 hours a week, someone on the national minimum wage would have to be paid &euro;441 for those 45 hours of work, even before taking account of employers' social insurance, materials, management and all other costs.  It could easily cost three or four times the level of carer's allowance to provide professional care workers.  Clearly, it would be more cost-effective to support family carers.  Why, therefore, do we still maintain a means test that throws up administrative and cost barriers that may make it impossible for some to take up the role, as mentioned <i>ad nauseam</i>here?<br/><br/>There is room for us to reconsider what we regard as appropriate in this state.  There is no need to be so strict about stopping people from accessing financial assistance.  We must ensure everything is done right, but we do not have to continue the manner in which we are doing this.  As the population ages and care work becomes even more commonplace, we must consider whether we are making the decision to engage in full-time care even more challenging.  That would be bad for the taxpayer, as it would cost the State more.  Outside the fact that it is wrong, it would be financially insane.  Let us change it.<br/><br/>The State should consider introducing a minimum income guarantee for everybody in the State in order that people would know that the decision to care for a loved one would not leave them without an income.  We have serious challenges in the country in how we treat carers and must change the way we think about the matter.  That is why we need a new national carer strategy with a long-term perspective.  As a society, we must make a strong and unambiguous statement on solidarity and appreciation of the work done by carers of all ages.  We need to say to carers loud and clear that they are not alone and that we really cherish them.  As a decent and democratic society, we should commit to working together to ensure the people who need care will receive all the support we can give and that people who provide care will be be valued and assisted.  We must also ensure carers receive paid leave; five days of paid leave would not be too much to ask.  By 2022 we will have to provide it under the European Union work-life balance directive; therefore, we may as well skip ahead and do it now.<br/><br/>I am grateful to all of the Deputies who have spoken in favour of the Labour Party's motion.  I acknowledge that the Government has recognised the valuable contribution of carers, although at times the response was a little defensive and we could argue the toss on many of the stated facts.  I also acknowledge the contribution made by the other Government representative who acknowledged that we had to look at the matter in a different way.  There are grounds for a renewed cross-party consensus on it.  There are some issues on which we must jump a little above politics, this Chamber and the bubble of Leinster House; this is one of them. Perhaps the motion will stimulate us into pushing forward with this agenda that we in the Labour Party want to pursue, with others, in supporting carers by practical means.  We can make changes not over one year but a number of years to make their lives better, support them, make them more financially stable and put them in a position where they would be able to look after loved ones in a fairer way.  The State supports do not go far enough and we have outlined our reasons.  The existing system of State supports is too rigid, with too many rules and requirements that unnecessarily restrict people's ability to balance care work with studies or paid work.  Too many carers are suffering burnout, as I have witnessed, and serious ill-health caused by the stress and strain of their care work.  We need to implement proposals.I hope the Government will accept the need to have a deeper national dialogue on the issue of carers and care work.  Regardless of its amendment which I know will be defeated because the motion has the support needed to be passed, I hope the Government will facilitate that national dialogue in the coming months.  If it does not, we, in the Labour Party, will ensure it will have no choice in the matter.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-06-26a.471" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1261" speakername="Jim Daly" time="19:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019062600057#KKK00800"><p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&quot;</p><p>I am pleased to introduce the CervicalCheck Tribunal Bill 2019 to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  On behalf of the Minister for Health, I thank Deputies for facilitating the taking of Second Stage at this early date.</p><p>The purpose of this important legislation is to establish an independent statutory tribunal to deal with claims arising from the CervicalCheck controversy.  The Bill is very much based on the recommendations set out by Mr. Justice Charles Meenan in his 2018 report on an alternative system for dealing with claims arising from CervicalCheck.  Following the issues that emerged last year, it is safe to say there is much greater awareness of the limitations of cervical screening and Members will be aware that false negatives do arise.  As Mr. Justice Meenan noted in his report, where a woman develops cervical cancer following a false negative, of itself, this is not sufficient to prove negligence.  To establish negligence, evidence would have to be given by a suitably qualified expert that the reading of the smear had fallen below the appropriate standard required.  Recognising that any alternative system to the court process would need to recognise the issue of liability, Mr. Justice Meenan proposed that a tribunal be established under statute for the purpose of hearing and determining claims arising from CervicalCheck.  The Bill does exactly that.  </p><p>The Bill also provides for restoration of trust meetings.  This takes account of what Mr. Justice Meenan said in his report and the view expressed by Dr. Gabriel Scally last year in the final report on the scoping inquiry into the CervicalCheck screening programme.  Restoration of trust meetings are not part of the courts process, but the Minister believes it is important to facilitate them through the Bill.  The CervicalCheck screening programme has played a vital part in saving lives.  It is essential, therefore, that women and their families have confidence in the programme and that women continue to use it.</p><p>Before going into the detail of the Bill, I would like to take time to briefly give further context and set out some of the important steps taken so far in dealing with the CervicalCheck issues.  They include the reports by Dr. Gabriel Scally, supports for women and their families and changes to the HSE&rsquo;s open disclosure policy and practice.  A further, very significant initiative is the <i>ex gratia</i>scheme for women affected by non-disclosure which just this week has begun to make payments to individuals impacted on by non-disclosure.</p><p>We are implementing in full the recommendations made in Dr. Scally&rsquo;s report and have accepted two further recommendations in his recent supplementary report.  They relate to procurement and quality assurance processes.  Actions to implement them are being identified and they will then be incorporated in the approved implementation plan for all of the recommendations made in the scoping inquiry and reported on quarterly as part of it.  The HSE continues to strengthen governance, quality assurance and management in the CervicalCheck programme and the wider national screening service in line with Dr. Scally&rsquo;s recommendations.</p><p>In terms of supports for women affected, funding has been given to the 221+ CervicalCheck support group to enable advocacy and supports to be made available to these patients.  Also, last year the Minister announced the establishment of a primary and social care support package for women and families affected by the CervicalCheck issues.  This comprehensive package of supports is for the cohort of 221 plus women for whom the audit carried out by CervicalCheck found discordance with the original reading of their slides.  The package will also be provided for any other woman for whom the independent clinical expert review being carried out by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists identifies discordance with her original smear test reading.  Deputies will know that the review is ongoing and that its purpose is to provide women with independent clinical assurance on both the quality of the screening programme and the timing of diagnosis and treatment.</p><p>The third point I mentioned was open disclosure.  This goes to the heart of the matter for many of the women concerned.  Deputies will be aware that the HSE recently published a revised interim open disclosure policy.  It is in line with recommendation No. 28 in Dr. Scally&rsquo;s final report on the scoping inquiry into the CervicalCheck screening programme.  It emphasised that the open disclosure policy should be revised to reflect the primacy of the right of patients to have full knowledge of their healthcare and, in particular, their right to be informed of failings in that care process however and whenever they arose.  The interim policy will be further reviewed when the patient safety Bill is published.  That Bill will provide for mandatory open disclosure of patient safety incidents and is at an advanced stage.</p><p>Regarding the <i>ex gratia</i>scheme, Deputies will know that earlier this year the Minister received Government approval for the CervicalCheck non-disclosure <i>ex gratia</i>scheme for women affected by the non-disclosure of the CervicalCheck audit.  It ensures the women affected can have the impact of non-disclosure addressed without recourse to court through the establishment of a non-statutory scheme to provide <i>ex gratia</i>payments.  The scheme is overseen by an independent assessment panel.  All of t he women, or their next of kin, in the 221+ group will receive a payment where the panel which is chaired by Mr. Justice Aindrias &Oacute; Caoimh determines that appropriate disclosure did not take place.  An initial tranche of payments will issue this week, with further payments to be made as individuals apply and have their applications assessed.</p><p>I am aware that there are other issues which are of great interest to Deputies.  Regarding the Ruth Morrissey case and the finding made in Mr. Justice Cross&rsquo;s High Court judgment that the screening programme must have &ldquo;absolute confidence&rdquo; before giving a test the all-clear, the State Claims Agency has lodged an appeal in order to obtain clarity on the legal position.  However, irrespective of the outcome of the appeal, the Government has given an assurance to Ms Morrissey that the full amount of her award of damages in the High Court will be protected.</p><p>In his second report Dr. Scally indicated that a form of no-fault scheme might be appropriate for those individuals impacted on by the CervicalCheck issues.  In 2018 the Government established an expert group, chaired by Mr. Justice Charles Meenan, to consider issues associated with medical indemnity claims, including the possible use of no-fault schemes.  The Minister looks forward to receiving the report of the group later this year.</p><p>Turning to the Bill, I propose to begin by giving a short overview.  The tribunal will hear and determine liability in claims in relation to CervicalCheck, subject to the consent of all the parties to the claim, recognising the issue of liability.  The Bill sets out who may make a claim and the period within which claims may be made.  The Bill enables the tribunal to determine and adopt pre-claim protocols and the chairperson to issue practice directions in relation to the conduct of claims in the interests of hearing and determining claims in a manner which is just and expeditious.  The tribunal&rsquo;s determination of a claim may be appealed to the High Court.  Where no appeal is made, the tribunal will apply to the High Court for confirmation of the determination.  The tribunal&rsquo;s hearings will be held otherwise than in public, except where the claimant requests otherwise and the tribunal agrees.  This respects the privacy of the women concerned.</p><p>As I said, the tribunal will also facilitate restoration of trust meetings.  The intention behind a restoration of trust meeting is to document experiences, facilitate discussion and provide information for the woman concerned or her family.  In addition to these functions, the tribunal may also provide advice or recommendations for the Minister related to its work.</p><p>Moving on to the detailed provisions, the Bill is divided into three Parts.  Part 1 is the preliminary and general Part; Part 2 provides for the CervicalCheck tribunal, while Part 3 includes miscellaneous provisions.</p><p>Section 1 is a standard section on the Short Title of the Bill and commencement provisions.</p><p>Section 2 is the definitions section.  A key definition is the definition of &ldquo;relevant woman&rdquo; which is central to the scope of the tribunal regarding who may make a claim.  They include a woman identified as part of the review of cervical screening as having CervicalCheck cytology review findings that were discordant with those of the original cytology examination, and a woman whose cytology slides were re-examined as part of the retrospective CervicalCheck audit and whose cytology review findings were discordant with those of the original cytology examination.</p><p>Section 3 is a standard provision for expenses incurred by the Minister in the administration of the legislation.</p><p>Part 2 contains sections 4 to 36, inclusive.  Sections 4 to 10, inclusive, deal with establishing the tribunal and its functions.  Section 4 provides for the establishment day of the tribunal.  The Minister expects to establish the tribunal once the necessary arrangements are in place for it to begin its work.</p><p>Section 5 provides for the establishment of the CervicalCheck tribunal.  The tribunal may sit in divisions.  It will be independent in the performance of its functions and will regulate its own procedures.</p><p>Section 6 is the membership section.  The tribunal will consist of a chairperson and not less than two ordinary members who will be appointed by the Minister.  As announced, the intention is that Ms Justice Mary Irvine will be the chairperson.  The Minister may appoint additional persons to the tribunal, if necessary.  The chairperson must hold or have held judicial office in the superior courts.  Ordinary members must hold or have held judicial office in the superior courts or be a practising barrister or solicitor of not less than ten years' practice.</p><p>The tribunal&rsquo;s functions are outlined in section 7.  As I said, the tribunal shall hear and determine claims made to it, facilitate restoration of trust meetings and report on and make recommendations, as it deems appropriate, on any other matter related to its work.</p><p>Section 8 deals with staff for the tribunal.</p><p>Section 9 enables the tribunal to appoint people with expertise to provide it with advice or assistance.  The section also enables the tribunal to conduct or commission research, again subject to the prior approval of the Minister, given with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p>Section 10 allows the tribunal to appoint its own counsel.</p><p>Sections 11 to 13, inclusive, are concerned with making claims to the tribunal.  They are important sections, on which I will go into some detail.  Section 11 provides for claims before the tribunal and who may make a claim.  Claims may be made by an appropriate person.  In the Bill an appropriate person is defined as a relevant woman, or where the woman is deceased, a dependant of the woman.  A claim for compensation may be made seeking damages for negligence, breach of duty, breach of statutory duty or breach of contract arising from any act or omission concerning CervicalCheck.  A claim may also be made seeking damages for alleged negligence or breach of duty arising from an alleged failure to inform the relevant woman or her dependant of the results of the retrospective CervicalCheck audit.  It is important to state, as a general point, that the legal principles of liability and quantum of damages as applied in the High Court to such cases will apply to claims before the tribunal.  A claim may not be made where a person has received an award from any court or settlement in respect of any action arising from any circumstance which could give rise to a claim before the tribunal.  The exception is an award under the <i>ex gratia</i>scheme.</p></speech>
