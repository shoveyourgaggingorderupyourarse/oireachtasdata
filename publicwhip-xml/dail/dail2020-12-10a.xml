Hopefully she will set a trend.</p>  <p>  I wish to discuss the number of vacant positions in the Judiciary, including on the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeal, the Circuit Courts and the District Courts.  I ask the Minister to make a statement on the matter.  This question has had great traction in recent weeks and has been the source of great tension.  It is clear that we need to do something to make our system better.</p></reply>

However, this arrangement is always kept under review, having regard to emerging pressures, planned retirements or any other issues.  When I met with the Chief Justice last week, he restated to me that there is no urgent need for this vacancy to be filled. </p>  <p>  The vacancies on the Circuit and District Courts will be filled as soon as possible.  The Government is committed to ensuring adequate resources for the courts to provide access to justice for all citizens and to filling judicial vacancies at the earliest opportunity generally.  Judicial appointments are made by the President acting on the advice of the Government, in accordance with Articles 13.9 and 35.1 of the Constitution.  As with all judicial vacancies, a request is made to the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, JAAB, for a list of suitable candidates for appointment and the names of all those who applied.  The JAAB recommendations are considered along with any expressions of interest from serving judges and all judges eligible for appointment.  As Minister for Justice, I then submit a memorandum for Government to the Cabinet agenda, at which point the Cabinet agrees on a nominee for appointment by the President. </p>  <p>  The programme for Government contains a commitment to reforming the judicial appointments process and I intend to bring forward new legislation to do this very quickly.  I will shortly seek the approval of the Government for the general scheme of a judicial appointments commission Bill providing for the establishment of a new commission to replace the JAAB.  </p>  <p>  The programme for Government commits to the establishment of a working group to consider the numbers and types of judges required to ensure the efficient administration of justice over the next five years.  Preparatory work is under way within my Department and I anticipate that this group will be established very soon.</p></reply>

One issue that has clearly come to the fore is the difficulty we have in ensuring a clear and transparent process.  I welcome the new commission and I hope it will bring clarity.  For any position in the private sector, the public sector or anywhere else, there is generally a clear process.  People can understand why a person gets the position he or she gets over the heads of others.  That is appropriate and proper.  It should be the case in the judicial system as well.  We know that a former member of the Government, Shane Ross, made a great effort to do something about all this and, unfortunately, did not get very far.  I hope we can do something that can actually deliver for people.  I am aware that High Court judges feel that they are under pressure and are continually seconded to do other work such as preparing reports or overseeing certain bodies or commissions.  They then find they do not have the time and energy to deliver the type of judicial system they want.</p></speech>

I have committed to doing this as quickly as possible.  It is important that we have a very clear process and that people understand it.  I have just outlined the current process.  I have adhered to that process at every stage of the six appointments that have been made since I became Minister, but it needs reform.  As the Deputy said, there has been a lengthy debate in recent years.  I hope the debate will not be of similar length when I introduce new legislation.  It is important that we pass it as quickly as possible, but people must have confidence in this process.  I assure the House that a process has been adhered to in appointments in recent years.  Everybody who has been appointed has done their job well.  That is reflected in the work of our courts.</p></speech>

It would be useful if she could give us a date by which she expects to introduce that legislation.  Will it be in the first quarter of the coming year?  When does she expect us to get it through the Oireachtas?  This has become an urgent issue of grave public interest and concern.  The sooner we can get down to brass tacks and deal with this issue, the better.</p></speech>

If that does not happen, I will introduce it very early in the new year.  I would like to see the legislation enacted in the first half of next year and avoid allowing the debate to go on throughout 2021.</p></speech>

The centenary of the foundation of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is coming up in 2022.  Can the Minister outline the State's plans to commemorate this historic occasion? </p></reply>

The foundation of the organisation is one of the key events recommended for appropriate commemoration by the expert advisory group on commemorations as part of phase 2 of the decade of centenaries programme.</p>  <p>  A centenary committee, chaired by a senior garda, has been established to co-ordinate the commemorations within the organisation.  To date, two significant events have been planned. </p>  <p>  The first, which will take place on 7 February 2022, will commemorate the meeting at the Gresham Hotel in Dublin of a committee which decided to form the Civic Guard, which would later be renamed An G&aacute;rda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under section 22 of the G&aacute;rda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Temporary Provisions) Act 1923.  The second event, which is due to take place on 21 August 2022, will commemorate the "storming of Dublin Castle" by the then Garda Commissioner on 17 August 1922, when the Civic Guard took control of Dublin Castle.</p>  <p>  I understand that further plans are currently under consideration.  These include digitisation of historic Garda materials to make them publically available online, including a photographic exhibition; localised exhibitions and events to commemorate the centenary of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na throughout 2022; the issuing of a commemorative ribbon and coin for personnel working during the centenary year; the extension of the Garda Museum for additional exhibitions; and the publication of a commemorative book.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-12-10a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1587" speakername="Cathal Berry" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020121000003#A01800"><p>I thank the Minister of State for that very detailed and comprehensive reply.  I have a few suggestions.  The Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors is of the view that a commemorative medal could be struck and presented to every serving member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I am of that view myself.  A very similar suggestion was made in 2016 for members of the Defence Forces.  Every serving member received a commemorative medal marking the Defence Forces' centenary.</p> <p>Is this something the Minister of State might wish to consider?  What are his thoughts on it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-12-10a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1618" speakername="James Browne" time="09:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020121000004#B00200"><p>I understand that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is considering the issuing of a commemorative ribbon and coin for personnel working during the centenary year but I will certainly bring the matter of a medal to the attention of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as well as something to take note of and take into account.  A lot of this is still open for review and consideration, and any ideas of merit would certainly be given consideration.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-12-10a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1587" speakername="Cathal Berry" time="09:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020121000004#B00300"><p>I have another suggestion.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Retired Members Association is of the view that an oral history project could be considered.  A very similar project for Defence Forces personnel is taking place in the Military Archives in Cathal Brugha Barracks.  There is a large volume of testimony and eyewitness accounts from Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na operations over past decades so, again, we should probably consider an oral history-type project.  I am not sure what the Minister of State's thoughts on this would be or where funding for it would come from.  Would the project come under the remit of the Department with responsibility for heritage or the Department of Justice?  I would be keen to hear the Minister of State's and the Minister's thoughts on this.  Would they be willing to consider it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-12-10a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1618" speakername="James Browne" time="09:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020121000004#B00400"><p>I know this is an area in which the Deputy has a real and genuine interest.  I will certainly bring his idea to the attention of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I think the Defence Forces oral history project was carried out in the late 1940s and early 1950s.  It is through those records that I know about the actions of my great-grandfather in 1916.  We know that oral histories can be extremely important, especially for generations to come, so I will certainly bring the Deputy's very worthy idea to the attention of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></speech>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-12-10a.27.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1607" speakername="Martin Kenny" time="09:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020121000004#B00700"><p>I wish to ask the Minister about the resources to deal with the backlogs of court cases.  As we know, the pandemic has created a situation where an awful lot of court summonses have been delayed and backlogged.  Up to 95,000 summonses are now in a backlog, with approximately 4,500 summonses being generated every week on top of that.  The Courts Service, naturally, is doing its best to deal with this but it really needs more resources.  It needs to be able to up its capacity considerably, and for it to do so, the Minister will need to put more resources in place to ensure adequate staff levels to deal with this.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-12-10a.28" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1502" speakername="Helen McEntee" time="09:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020121000004#B00800"><p>I am committed, as is the Government, to ensuring adequate resources for the courts to maintain access to justice for all citizens, not just throughout this pandemic but at all times.  This commitment was reinforced recently with the highest ever budgetary allocation for the justice sector, including &euro;158.8 million for the Courts Service.  This included &euro;8 million for the new courts modernisation programme along with an additional provision of &euro;5.7 million for Covid measures to enable court sittings to take place in a socially distanced and safe environment.  A significant priority for my Department and the Courts Service in the years ahead will be to invest significantly in digital technology in order to transform the experience of practitioners and court users.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the July stimulus package had previously assigned &euro;5 million to the Courts Service, with &euro;1.7 million of the funds to be invested before year end in ICT to install video technology systems to support the holding of remote court proceedings.  As of 27 November 2020, 1,941 hearings have been conducted remotely across all jurisdictions and, thankfully, this will continue to increase.</p>  <p>  The Government endeavours to ensure that courts continue to operate as effectively and as efficiently as possible.  My Department is in constant contact with the Courts Service.  We have maintained a schedule of regular interactions with the service throughout the pandemic to try to support it in addressing the issues the Deputy has outlined that have arisen during this crisis, including where backlogs have arisen.</p>  <p>  I am pleased that, even during the first period of the pandemic, the courts continued to sit on priority matters in the areas of family law and criminal matters, especially cases involving people in custody, bail, urgent injunctions and domestic violence.  In past weeks, even though the entire country was under level 5 lockdown restrictions, the courts remained open and dealt with a wider level of business.</p>  <p>  Meanwhile, the Courts Service continues to work with the Judiciary to prioritise business and the holding of court proceedings to address areas of concern.  The Courts Service has shown impressive innovation and adaptability during the Covid-19 pandemic and in maintaining vital front-line services for those who need them, including the most vulnerable victims of domestic abuse, as I mentioned.</p>  <p>  There are plans to install remote hearing equipment in 43 more courtrooms over the next few months and to bring even further venues on stream, which will enable more cases to be heard in a safe manner and further reduce backlogs.  The ultimate aim is to reduce the backlog levels to pre-Covid numbers.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-12-10a.29" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1607" speakername="Martin Kenny" time="09:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020121000004#B00900"><p>We understand and appreciate the work that has been done and that many of the courts are doing their best in difficult circumstances.  I agree with the Minister, however, that a greater level of new technology needs to be brought into play, particularly video links between the courts and the prisons and so on to try to resolve many of these issues whereby people are going for short sittings, which basically get the nod and go back again.  All this can be done remotely and using technology if possible, but an awful lot of our courts around the country do not have that technology in place, and that investment needs to be put in place as quickly as possible.  Apart from that, because of the large backlog that has built up, there will be a necessity to have more cases dealt with more quickly and the time allocated and the number of sittings per month may need to be expanded.  The Minister will have to see what resources will be needed to do that.  The argument has often been made that justice delayed is justice denied, and certainly some people would make that argument very strongly from an accused's perspective.  The level of attention that this needs has to be brought to bear on it, and the Minister needs to ensure there will be adequate resources to pay the additional staff because it will take many additional staff to do this.</p></speech>

We all heard this morning the figure of 122,000 as the initial backlog of summonses.  Significant work has been done to clear that.  There have been 97,000 cases heard since July alone in this particular area, but there was a backlog before Covid-19 started.  That is why we need to make sure we have additional resources.  It is why we need to look at the overall spaces we have, and that work has been happening through Covid-19, particularly for criminal trials.  It is why we need to look at the number of judges we have to see if it is enough.  It is why we need to continue to invest in digital technology, and I am very pleased about the 1,941 cases I have outlined.  It might seem like a small number but it is multiples of what was heard this time last year.  With 34 new venues getting digital technology, we hope those numbers will continue to increase.  Part of my overall plan within the Department is to digitalise the justice sector in general.  The courts are a huge part of that, and the more we can move into that space, as the Deputy says, the more quickly we can hear these cases and get through these kinds of backlogs.</p></speech>

I fully appreciate that the Courts Service has done a lot of work and done its best in the context of the pandemic.  However, there are people out there who find themselves before the courts, and I have spoken to a number of them.  For some it is a family issue and for others it is a small case, a criminal matter that normally would not be overbearing on anyone.  This has gone on for so long, and these people have these cases hanging over them that cannot be dealt with and continue to be deferred.  It is putting a lot of pressure on people.  In the context of a pandemic, when people already feel under pressure, it is important that the Courts Service is seen to be an area where we can deliver for people.  There is also pressure on solicitors and the entire legal profession as to how they find they are able to deal with this situation.  Sometimes they are very frustrated on behalf of their clients in trying to ensure they get access to the courts and get minor enough matters dealt with quickly and appropriately.</p>  <p>  We have an opportunity here.  As the Minister said, before there was a pandemic there was a backlog, which tells us there was a problem even pre pandemic, so we need to be able to deal with that as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

It is important to thank those who work in the Courts Service, our legal professions and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na because, while they have had to put a lot of cases on hold particularly since the summer, there have been meetings every week to try to come together to address these backlogs and move things along.  As I said, even as far as the summonses are concerned, 97,000 cases have been heard since July, which just shows the huge amount of work that has happened.  There are also conversations taking place on expanding the hours, which the Deputy mentioned in his initial comment on sittings of the District Court.  An effort is being made to make sure that as many cases are heard as is possible.  It is unfortunate that from the middle of March a lot of the non-serious cases, as they were deemed, although they were extremely important to those involved, had to be put on hold and the courts have only been listening to or hearing family law cases, domestic violence cases and other serious and criminal cases.  I am glad, however, that most of the hearings in the various courts have resumed and the numbers of cases heard have increased.  We will continue to work with the courts in order that they may continue to clear those backlogs as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-12-10a.36" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1618" speakername="James Browne" time="09:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020121000005#C00300"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising this important matter.  A key pillar of the Programme for Government - Our Shared Future is building stronger and safer communities.  I can assure the Deputy that the Government is committed to ensuring there is strong, visible community policing right across Ireland, both rural and urban.</p><p>To this end, the Department has secured an unprecedented budget of &euro;1.952 billion for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for 2021.  This level of funding is enabling sustained and ongoing recruitment of Garda members and staff.  There are now some 14,600 Garda members and more than 3,000 Garda staff nationwide.  Budget 2021 will allow for the recruitment of up to 620 new garda&iacute; and an extra 500 Garda staff.  There will be continued investment in the Garda fleet of &euro;8 million in addition to the highest ever investment, of approximately &euro;15 million, in the Garda transport fleet in 2020, a proportion of which relates to the Garda Covid response.</p><p>Although An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has provided very dedicated service by assisting in the national effort to combat the threat of Covid-19, ordinary policing has, of course, also continued throughout the period.  The Deputy will be aware of Operation Thor, which is designed specifically to tackle the increase in the number of burglaries and associated criminal activity that usually occurs in the winter months by undertaking targeted enforcement and preventative activity.  This year's winter phase of Operation Thor began on 1 October 2020 and will run until the end of March 2021.  This initiative, which also features the Lock Up and Light Up public awareness campaign encouraging homeowners to protect their homes through the winter months when burglaries tend to increase, has led to a very significant and sustained decline in burglaries and property-related crime since its introduction in 2015.  I am pleased to state that I have been informed by the Garda authorities that incidents of residential burglary have been reduced by 41%, to 52,816 incidents, while non-residential burglary is down 31%, to 19,672 incidents, in comparison with the equivalent period before the operation began.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>The Deputy may be interested in the work of the national rural safety forum, which brings together An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, my Department and the Department of Rural and Community Development, alongside national and local organisations including the Irish Farmers Association, Muintir na T&iacute;re and the GAA.  The purpose of the forum is to develop a nationwide network for the distribution of crime prevention advice, to increase engagement within communities and to prevent and reduce opportunities for crime.  This year, the Department has committed in the region of &euro;150,000 to local communities that wish to apply for a rebate towards the costs associated with running their local text alert scheme, which is administered by Muintir na T&iacute;re. This is a continuation of the annual funding made available by my Department for the text alert rebate scheme each year since 2016.  More generally, I can advise the Deputy that the Department has for many years provided funding for the employment and associated costs of the national community alert programme, including the employment of regional development officers.  These development officers provide support to community and text alert schemes and offer advice on how to establish new schemes.</p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, on 13 November the Minister, Deputy McEntee, announced that the Department will pilot three local community safety partnerships in Dublin&rsquo;s north inner city, Longford and Waterford.  These partnerships are the structures proposed under the new community safety policy of my Department to take a holistic approach to safety issues in partnership with the community.  The pilot schemes will operate at local authority administrative level and will be made up of local representatives, a range of local services, community representatives and residents.  Local community safety partnerships will take a strategic approach to their work in order that issues arising can be dealt with in a co-ordinated manner and addressed collectively by relevant service providers in partnership with the community.</p><p>It is welcome that the pandemic itself has had a notable impact on rates of burglary over the course of this year.  Residential burglary has fallen in 2020, with a sharp reduction observed in March and April in response to the public health restrictions on work, travel, school and business.  From March to August, inclusive, there were 43% fewer residential burglaries reported compared with the same period in 2019. </p></speech>

I accept that Operation Thor has certainly led to a decrease.  My question relates to other preventative aspects of the problem.  I and many others believe that one of the key deficits is the lack of community policing.  That has been raised in the Chamber on several occasions.  The Minister of State referred to extra recruits but is community policing in particular being considered?  Are there plans to increase the number of community garda&iacute;?  For example, community policing levels in Laois-Offaly have dropped dramatically in recent years.  Data that I obtained from the Department in response to a parliamentary question show that the number of such garda&iacute; in the Laois-Offaly division in 2009 was 44, whereas the current figure is just seven.  That represents a 500% drop in little more than a decade.  It is very concerning for communities that feel isolated, particularly rural communities.</p>  <p>  I have continually called on the Government to conduct an immediate review of the trespass laws, with the aim of strengthening the rights of farmers and landowners to protect their property and person.  That is another issue of concern.</p></speech>

This represents an increase of 38% since 2015, when there were 278 garda&iacute; assigned to the division.  On the same date, there were 38 Garda staff civilians assigned to the division, an increase of almost 73% since 2015, when 22 staff members were assigned to the division.  The increase in Garda staff is allowing members of the Garda to return to front-line duties.  The Deputy is correct that there were seven community garda&iacute; in the Laois-Offaly at the end of October when her parliamentary question was replied to, but I am pleased to inform her that, since then, the number has doubled to 14.  This represents a significant increase on the 2015 figure, which stood at four community garda&iacute;.  There has since been a significant increase, which I hope will alleviate the Deputy's concerns regarding community policing.</p></speech>

An increase is an increase but there were 44 community garda&iacute; in the division in 2009 and there are currently 14.  There is a need for more garda&iacute;.  There have been more instances of anti-social behaviour in estates.  The issue was discussed by Offaly county councillors during the week.  There is a desperate and urgent need for more community garda&iacute;.  I would like to see the number triple by next year because for the number to decrease from 44 in 2009 to seven currently is just not acceptable.  The figure needs to increase in order to help to prevent burglaries and to tackle the scourge of anti-social behaviour, which is affecting many communities, both urban and rural.  It seemed to escalate during the lockdown in particular.  The community policing models needs to be prioritised above all else.  I acknowledge there has been an increase from seven to 14.  An increase is an increase.  I hope that will continue and that there will be genuine efforts to get the figure back up to where it needs to be.  There needs to be more than 44 community garda&iacute; in the area.</p></speech>

I too wish to see a greater emphasis on community policing.  Community garda&iacute; play a very important role in communities.  I expect to publish the youth justice strategy in the next month or two.  It will provide a comprehensive approach to dealing with young people who are coming into the network of the Courts Service and the criminal justice system.  I have set up the anti-social behaviour forum, which met recently for the first time and will meet again at the end of January or in early February.  A number of rural groups are represented on it.  We are seeking to comprehensively tackle the whole issue of anti-social behaviour from both a Department of Justice perspective and that of an An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></speech>

As all present are aware, there have been appeals on these grounds in several cases before the courts.  It is a difficult situation that needs to be addressed as quickly as possible.  It is clear these issues could put some convictions in jeopardy.  Several conviction appeals currently before the courts and other cases to come are looking at the ruling of the ECJ as a possible get-out clause.  The matter needs to be dealt with urgently.</p></reply>

Since that time, the court has continued to deal with a range of cases referred to it in what is a complex and continually evolving area of law.</p>  <p>  The implication of the judgments of the court with regard to data retention regimes presents significant challenges not just for Ireland, but also for other EU member states that are grappling with the implications for law enforcement services in the investigation of crime.  Ireland is fully engaged in that work.  Conscious of the role played by telecommunications data in the investigation of serious crime and in safeguarding national security, a large number of member states, as well as the European Commission, have intervened in European court cases which were challenging national data retention regimes.</p>  <p>   Although criminal investigations are multifaceted and involve many avenues of inquiry and investigation, access to telecommunications data has become ever more important for all authorities responsible for the detection, investigation and prosecution of crime and for safeguarding the security of the State.  Ireland has intervened robustly before the European Court of Justice to highlight the potential implications of the court judgments and to defend the need for such information to be made available to law enforcement through appropriate national data retention regimes.  However, it is important to note that Garda authorities continue to investigate all forms of serious crime, utilising the available legislative powers.</p>  <p>  It is intended that a revised general scheme of the communications (data retention and disclosure) Bill, drafting of which is well advanced, will replace the Communications (Retention of Data) Act 2011, taking account of the 2014 ECJ ruling, as well as more recent rulings.  Our intention will be to provide the most effective crime prevention and investigative regime possible, having regard to the changing legal environment.  The judgment of the Supreme Court, following its referral to the ECJ, which is expected early in 2021 will be examined carefully by officials in my Department in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General.</p></speech>

It is a serious issue for many cases around the country and, indeed, for the Garda when it is trying to trace where people have been or what has happened in regard to serious crime.  We are all aware of some cases historically in which this was not, perhaps, the evidence that led to convictions but it certainly put people in the places where garda&iacute; were able to look at them in more detail and to prosecute the case in a way that secured a conviction.  Some of them were very serious cases.  The need to ensure that the Garda would have access to such records when appropriate, and that is the important point, is vital.  We all know people have a right to privacy and a right to go about their daily business without the fear that some type of big brother is watching them.  There is a balance to be struck here and the balance clearly has to take account of the rights of people to ensure they are safe in their communities.  Having adequate legislation on this would be vital to ensure that happens.</p></speech>

Obviously, we want to ensure we protect people's privacy, but also that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the powers to do its work.  It is important that we provide the Garda with the technical expertise, the financial support and the legislative underpinning it needs to do its work.  The Garda is continuing to do that work.  I have some of the figures relating to that Act.  The Garda made 13,545 data access requests to telecommunications companies in 2018 and 8,110 were made in 2019.  While the Garda might not be able to do this in as easy a manner as, perhaps, previously it is continuing to do its work.  The priority now is to ensure we have the best possible legislation to underpin the work of the Garda.</p>  <p>  The biggest challenge has been that since the ruling in 2014 there have been a number of clarification requests not just from this country but also from other member states and the responses to those requests have created more questions.  The initial ruling was quite wide-ranging so the requests and the responses have created more questions, which has made it difficult to draft this legislation.  However, it is at an advanced stage and the ruling early next year will be important.</p></speech>

It is vital that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has access, when appropriate, to carry out its work.  The other aspect of this that must be examined is social media and what happens there.  I know there is some preparation to examine the possibility of hate crime, hate speech and so forth.  Again, we have to be very careful about this because people have a right to freedom of speech.  We certainly must be very cautious about this and I understand that.</p>  <p>  To return to the issue of data retention and being able to access data, particularly in cases of serious crime, it is vital that we have the legislative underpinning to ensure it is there and that it can happen, when appropriate.  Equally, people must not feel that they are in some way under surveillance for no reason.  That is the balance that must be struck.  When the Supreme Court brings forward its judgment, it is important that we move into a position where we can strike that balance and come to a conclusion on this matter.</p></speech>

Other member states that have already introduced legislation in their jurisdictions based on the clarifications I just mentioned have had to change that legislation again.  It is important that when we introduce and pass our legislation, it is the best it can be and that it provides absolute clarity for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to allow it to do its work.  That is our intention.  The Bill is well advanced at this stage.  The ruling next year will be important and we will incorporate it in the legislation.  We have asked for this particular clarification so, hopefully, it will answer our questions to allow us to finalise this work.</p>  <p>  The Deputy mentioned social media and other areas.  One of the other parliamentary questions is about white-collar crime and other powers for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are bringing forward other legislative measures which allow for arrest warrants, especially for digital devices, and other supports to allow the Garda to do its job to the best of its ability.  It is important that we introduce and implement this legislation as quickly as possible and provide support to the Garda.  It already does wonderful work, but it would benefit from this additional support.</p></speech>

The Deputy will be aware that last week I announced my intention to lead a new cross-Government plan to tackle these issues, following publication of the Review of Structures and Strategies to Prevent, Investigate and Penalise Economic Crime and Corruption.  I intend to publish and start to implement an action plan to tackle economic crime and corruption early in the new year, which I have secured Government approval to do.  I thank the former Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, Mr. James Hamilton, and the members of his review group for their meticulous work in preparing this detailed report, on which I am determined to act.</p><p>Corruption and white-collar crime damage our economy, breed cynicism in our society and are a threat to our international reputation.  As noted in the detailed report recently published, Ireland is a relatively small country with a population approaching 5 million.  However, Ireland is listed as the fifth largest provider of wholesale financial services in the EU, with more than 400 international financial institutions located here and almost 100,000 people working in the sector.  The State and its agencies must have all the powers available to clamp down on and prevent this type of crime.  Ireland has a hard-won reputation as an attractive destination for foreign direct investment and as an international business hub and stepping up our efforts to tackle white-collar crime shows we are serious about maintaining and building that reputation.  Businesses large and small must be confident they can operate safely and securely, particularly as more economic activity goes online.  This trend has accelerated during the Covid-19 pandemic.  However, it is not just about businesses.  Consumers should know they can safely pay their bills and shop online and that they will not be subject to the threat of fraud.</p><p>The recommendations in the Hamilton review focus primarily on legislative and structural change and resourcing measures to enhance agency and multi-agency enforcement, as well as increasing capacity across the criminal justice system to prevent this crime.  Examples of the recommendations include greater powers for investigating agencies to tackle economic crime and corruption, the establishment of an advisory council against economic crime and corruption, reform of the Ethics Acts and additional resourcing for the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO, the DPP and the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau.</p><p><i><font color="#2F2F2F">Additional information not given on the floor of the House</font></i></p><p>The programme for Government recognises the reputational and economic damage that corruption and white-collar crime can cause to the State and commits the Government to introduce and implement new anti-fraud and anti-corruption structures.  The development of our new plan to tackle economic crime and corruption will be informed by the recommendations of the Hamilton review.  Work has already begun across Government to develop this action plan, which will set clear timelines for the introduction of a series of reforms to strengthen the State&rsquo;s capacity to prevent and prosecute white-collar crime.</p><p>I am committed to ensuring that the Garda has the resources, both in terms of people and technology, to combat all forms of crime.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been allocated an unprecedented budget of &euro;1.952 billion for 2021.  This level of funding is enabling sustained ongoing recruitment of Garda members and staff as well as driving significant developments in ICT.  The Garda National Economic Crime Bureau, GNECB, is the main bureau of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na tasked with tackling economic crime.  The bureau operates on a national basis and provides specialist support and guidance to regional investigators.  There are currently competitions under way to strengthen the staffing levels in the GNECB&rsquo;s financial intelligence unit and the GNECB itself as well as the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.  This includes 11 new permanent detective sergeants who are due to be allocated to the GNECB this month, with additional resources expected in 2021.</p><p>I can also advise the Deputy that there have been a number of significant steps taken in recent years to strengthen the State&rsquo;s ability to tackle corruption and related activities.  In particular, the Criminal Justice (Corruption Offences) Act 2018 is very important legislation in the fight against corruption, both in Ireland and abroad.  Further information relating to the Act and the Government&rsquo;s cross-departmental approach to tackling corruption and bribery can be found on .</p></speech>

That is what concerns people, that something has gone on for ten to 15 years with little or no action taken and a reluctance or inability to be able to bring a successful prosecution during that period.  One of the issues is whether we have a sufficient number of people with the expertise, especially in the area of forensic accounting.  Perhaps the Minister will outline if additional people will be recruited to deal with that area, so we can deal with white-collar crime in an efficient and timely manner.</p></speech>

It was to identify ways in which we can support the different agencies.  This report will be implemented not just by my Department but also the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Department of Finance and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, working with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Central Bank, SIPO and many other agencies.  This is about ensuring we have everybody working and talking together and putting it on a more permanent footing.  While there has been good engagement between the different agencies, to put it on a statutory footing and to have an annual report or plan which people have to stick to and which has a timeline will put more emphasis on this.</p>  <p>  One could split a significant part of the recommendation into three - structural change, resourcing measures and legislation.  The report found that most of the agencies were well resourced, but there was a lag when it came to the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau.  There are currently ongoing competitions to fill a number of new places and I hope this will ensure there are the relevant and exact competencies that are required in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to follow up on these cases.</p></speech>

I have read much of what was in the report.  What is important here from a justice point of view is that the Garda has the capabilities and, in the same way as was outlined in the previous question, that the legislation is in place to ensure that it can do its work, and that it has the numbers to make sure it can carry out the physical investigations and the right level of expertise.  We have a number of recommendations specifically relating to that.  There are two recommendations on new legislation that is required but, thankfully, drafting is under way in the Department.  The largest is a community policing Bill, which will underpin all of the new structures within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  There are also recommendations on being able to detain and question people for longer, as well as recommendations on resourcing.  While some of what is required is in train, more of it is new and we will get to work on that.  I hope to introduce an implementation plan early in the new year and we will act on that.  This is a very serious issue that impacts on many people's lives.  It is important that all of the relevant authorities have the capability to deal with this so that we do not hear of any more cases such as the one Deputy Burke outlined.</p></speech>

I assure the Deputy that I am working collectively with my colleagues and with our partners to address the immediate needs of victims of domestic abuse and, going forward, to put in place a system designed and built around their needs.</p><p>With regard to his specific question about measures to combat increased incidents of domestic abuse in Cork, as I have said, our collective approach is a national one, but this includes working to make sure appropriate supports are in place for victims wherever they live.  I will refer later in my response to Cork in more detail.</p><p>I am committed to supporting victims in the short term, including by addressing the challenges presented by the pandemic, and also to introducing an improved and comprehensive approach to providing the services that victims of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence need.  Together with the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, I will meet with Safe Ireland in the coming week and we will meet on a continuous basis to try to address many of the concerns it has raised.</p><p>I have published and started implementing Supporting A Victim's Journey, which includes the actions necessary for the full implementation of the 52 O'Malley recommendations.  This will introduce very real supports and protections for vulnerable victims and witnesses.<i></i>The update I received yesterday from the implementation oversight group, which I chair, is testament to the real determination of all those involved to meet the ambitious targets set out in the implementation plan.</p><p>I referred to the audit of services to be completed by the end of the March and to the review of the second national strategy for combatting domestic sexual and gender-based violence, which will inform the design of the third strategy.</p><p>I have also referred to the proactive approach taken by my Department since the start of the pandemic and to the Covid-specific funding provided.  I draw attention to the Still Here public awareness campaign run by my Department in partnership with public sector organisations and NGOs.  This campaign is about getting the message out that services continue to be available to victims of domestic abuse and that the travel restrictions do not apply to victims seeking help.  This is a message worth repeating at every opportunity.  I urge anyone who is a victim of domestic abuse to reach out for help when it is safe to do so, because the front-line services will support people and prioritise their case.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to attach the highest priority to domestic abuse through Operation Faoiseamh.  As part of their work to prioritise domestic abuse cases the Legal Aid Board established a helpline to ensure victims of domestic abuse get legal advice and representation where required and the Court Service is facilitating remote hearings for protective orders for those who cannot travel.</p><p>I understand that the Cork divisional protective services unit was launched on 4 August as part of the national roll-out and I am sure, like me, the Deputy welcomes this specialist approach to ensuring vulnerable victims are consistently met with the highest standard of specialist professional and sensitive expertise.</p></speech>

This year, from 12 March to 3 November 2020, there was a total of 22,540 reported incidents.  That is an increase of more than 3,000 cases.  There have been 217 prosecutions for domestic violence during the pandemic.  It is vital that the Government does everything in its power to address the matter.  It is welcome that a number of initiatives have been undertaken, both by the Government and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in recent weeks.  Operation Faoiseamh in particular ensures that garda&iacute; on the ground are working to address the issue.  The Garda has made more than 15,300 contacts or attempted contacts to victims of domestic abuse as part of this operation.  While much is being done to ensure that people are aware of the supports that are available, it is, unfortunately, the case that there are gaps, which need to be addressed.  One of those gaps is the access to refuge places.  I understand that the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth is also involved in this area.  The issue must be addressed.  Could the Minister provide an update on when we can expect to see action to improve the provision of places?</p></speech>

It is about much more than just bed spaces; it is about ensuring the appropriate services are there and that people in State agencies are working together with the community and voluntary sector.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately, the figures are not specific to Cork, as we have seen an increase everywhere.  The increase for 2020 compared to 2019 is 14%.  If we break down the figures for Cork north, there was a 15% increase in incidents, Cork city had the largest number of incidents and Cork west saw a 20% increase in incidents.  It is very clear that this has become even more of a problem than it already was.  As Deputy O'Sullivan outlined, significant work has been done by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Operation Faoiseamh.  There have been 217 prosecutions specifically in this area, 20,699 contacts or attempts to contact victims and 110 prosecutions have commenced, so a significant amount of work is under way by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in Cork to try to deal with this problem.</p></speech>

Could the Minister clarify when the review is expected to conclude?  Domestic violence is often discussed in the overall context of gender-based violence, but it is broader than that.  We know that men are also victims.  We also know that child-parent domestic abuse is an issue.  I am concerned about the lack of availability of refuge spaces for men within the system.  It appears that there is no current research on the need for such places.  It stands to reason that there may be an unmet demand that is not being addressed.  Is the Department willing to consider the development of male refuge places alongside addressing the need for additional spaces throughout the system?</p></speech>

I think the timeline that has been set is for it to be done by April.  A suite of different actions are being taken at the moment.  We have the audit to look at all of the different Departments and services and the support that they provide and how we can put in place a much better structure to make sure that we can drive the implementation of services and bring about much-needed change in this area.  We will have the implementation of the review of the second national strategy, which will then feed into the third strategy.  The implementation group is working on Supporting A Victim's Journey, which is very specific to people who have been victims of sexual violence and are going through the courts process.  As well as that, there is a significant amount of engagement happening.  I mentioned meeting with Safe Ireland.  I met with countless community and voluntary groups.  It is important that we can support them in the work that they are doing.  We are currently looking at how we can fund groups in a much better way, as part of the implementation of the O'Malley recommendations.  We are considering providing funding for perhaps two or three years so that they can plan ahead and put in place the supports and services.  That is something that has been missing.  Lots of different actions are taking place and we need all of it to come together because there is a significant amount of work still to do.  I am fully committed to that and I know the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, is also committed to that.</p></speech>

We are familiar with the problems in neighbouring jurisdictions in this regard and the Government is determined to ensure that similar problems do not develop in Ireland, particularly as any stabbing incident has the potential to cause irreparable physical harm or tragic consequences.  This is why a comprehensive and robust legal framework is in place for offences involving knives, including heavy maximum penalties.  Under the provisions of the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, the maximum penalty on conviction for possessing a knife in a public place without good reason or lawful authority was increased from one to five years.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also has an extended power of search without warrant relating to knives and offensive weapons.</p>  <p>  Proactive policing measures such as person searches have increased by 76% this year, leading to an increase in the number of seizures.  I am advised that the Garda has secured a substantial number of convictions in the courts in recent years for possession of knives or other weapons.  As one might expect, statistics on seizures of knives by garda&iacute; in the period from 2005 to 2019 indicate that 44% of seizures relate to individuals between the ages of 12 and 23 and 65% relate to individuals under the age of 30.  In addition, it would be expected that as Garda numbers increase, the enforcement numbers for crimes such as possession of weapons or possession of drugs would also increase.</p>  <p>  HSE data indicate that the number of people being admitted to health services overnight with knife injuries has dropped.  In 2019, there were 178 such incidents, a drop from the average of 236 between 2005 and 2011.  This means that although An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is seizing more knives, the number of people presenting to hospital with the more serious injuries that require an overnight stay in hospital is dropping.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is currently operating a reduction strategy for the period 2019 to 2021, which is targeted at tackling all types of assaults, including use of knives.</p></speech>

The figures I have received indicate a 10% increase in hospitalisation cases arising from knife crimes such as stabbings over the past two years.  It is also my understanding that in 2019 over 2,000 knives were seized by garda&iacute; but it is interesting that in the first six months of 2020, part of which involved the Covid-19 lockdown, there were 1,200 knives seized, an increase of 13%.  This is of concern to me and my colleagues.  My understanding is that in other jurisdictions, major programmes have been put in place to deal with this issue.  In Scotland, for example, a major programme was implemented to deal with knife crime that has contributed to a reduction of over 50% in homicides arising from people using knives.  Could we aim such a programme at young people and community groups in order to help get the message across on the use of knives?</p></speech>

As I stated, the number of people requiring an overnight stay in hospital because of knife injuries is down significantly, indicating that the number of serious incidents is reducing.  I will make inquiries on the Deputy's comment that the rate of hospitalisations has increased by 10%.</p>  <p>  Knife crime is largely youth-oriented and we have published a draft youth strategy.  We hope to refine it and have it published in final form in the next month or two.  That will help to target those vulnerable young people who are exposed to knife crime and perhaps getting involved in those kinds of incidents.  It is about redirecting them and education and awareness programmes will be very much part of that process.</p></speech>

This is a very complex area and, like her, I have met many people who have raised concerns about it.  This is something I want to consider as part of our wider programme of family law reform.  I intend to arrange for research to be carried out by my Department early next year on this.  Changing the legislation is not the only option and there may be other appropriate interventions that need to be done at an earlier stage to deal with different types of behaviours.  The best interests of the child will of course be paramount in any considerations, whether they relate to legislative change or other types of measures to try to work with and support families.</p><p>A family justice oversight group has recently been established in my Department.  In addition to officials, the membership of this group also includes representation from the Judiciary, the Courts Service, the Legal Aid Board and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  The group held its first meeting in September and has been tasked with driving progress on the development of a national family justice system.  This is a high-level group that will co-ordinate the delivery of the various elements of this project and I will meet the group again in the morning.</p><p>The Oireachtas joint committee recommended that consideration should be given as to whether laws should be amended to take into account cases where one parent is wrongly influencing a child or children against the other parent.  The family oversight group that has been established will consider this recommendation, as well as others, and it will also consider the research being commissioned by my Department in the new year.</p><p>A family court Bill is being drafted, following approval of the general scheme by the Government.  The family court Bill is a commitment in the programme for Government and when enacted it will be a key element in the development of a more efficient and family-friendly court system that puts families at the centre of its activities, providing access to specialist supports and encouraging, in a most important way, the use of alternative dispute resolution in family law proceedings.  The development of a comprehensive and sensible family law procedure, particularly for vulnerable families, will be central to this new system.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>In the preparation of the general scheme of the family court Bill, account has been taken of the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Equality, which published its report on reform of the family law system just a year ago.</p><p>There is no specific legislative provision regarding parental alienation in Irish family law but section 246 of the Children Act 2001 provides for an offence of frightening, bullying or threatening a child in a manner likely to cause unnecessary suffering or injury to the child's physical, mental or emotional health or well-being.  There are also legislative provisions in place to deal with child welfare, particularly regarding the relationship between a child and his or her parents or guardians, providing the framework for a legal response to a wide spectrum of child welfare issues.</p></speech>

Last May, the World Health Organization officially recognised parental alienation syndrome for the first time, deciding to include it in the 11th revision of the International Classification of Diseases, coming into effect in 2022.</p>  <p>  When a couple splits and the people go their separate ways, it is so important that children born into the relationship do not become the collateral damage of a very acrimonious break-up.  Our family court services must have in place resources and expertise to prevent the manipulation of one child or children to reject his or her father or mother, so will the Minister comment on that?  Our justice system must ensure that one parent cannot wrongfully influence a child or children against the other parent and cause untold and permanent damage to a relationship.  The parents who are at the receiving end of parental alienation may be deprived in many cases of seeing children for long periods so we must have supports to ensure that their mental health is catered for as well.</p></speech>

This is particularly the case with the involvement of young children.  We have all engaged and met with constituents and people who have gone through such difficult experiences.  It is really important that the right supports are given to those families by agencies at a very early stage.</p>  <p>  I have said that we must reform the family court structure and often when a case gets to court, the problem has gone too far and an adversarial scenario may have developed.</p> <p>What we need to do is try to provide support at a much earlier stage and that is why there will be a much greater focus on mediation.  </p> <p> On parental alienation, the WHO guidance clearly states that incorporation of the description does not indicate WHO endorsement or any sort of formal recognition but the very fact that the WHO has mentioned it is obviously a signal.  It is a very complex area, which is why more research is needed.  It is something that I want to act on because there are undoubted problems here.</p></speech>

I am delighted to hear that children will be first and centre in all of the mediations and discussions.  As the Minister has quite rightly said, early intervention is key in preventing children from being isolated in the context of the wrongful influence of one parent against the other.  I welcome the Minister's response and encourage her to move the process, engagement and round-table conversation with the stakeholders forward as quickly as possible.  We must ensure that our family court services have the expertise at the table to deal with these situations and that the right supports are in place.  Parents who are at the receiving end of parental alienation are undergoing untold mental health problems and supports must be put in place for them.</p></speech>

We must ensure that it is not just the physical environment that is conducive to helping families to get through very difficult situations but that all of the supports are around them as well.  As Deputy Smyth said, it is not just about going through the court system but also about making sure that support is provided during what can be a very traumatic time.</p>  <p>  In terms of parental alienation, we must look at all avenues.  Several countries have looked at the possibility of legislating in this area, including the UK.  Indeed, it looked at it twice but both times decided against legislation.  Brazil is one of the only countries in which parental alienation is a criminal offence.  We need to look at this carefully.  The upcoming research and review will look at what has been done in other jurisdictions, as well as the resources available to us now, the people we have in place, where they are working and how to make sure supports are provided to families, not just in terms of the physical built environment but also the structure of the court system itself.  </p></speech>

I ask the Minister to outline her plans to combat rising levels of domestic violence in Carlow.  Will she be increasing supports for those seeking help in domestic violence situations?  Specifically with regard to Christmas, what emergency plans are in place to keep services open?  It is so important that services remain open for people experiencing domestic violence.</p></reply>

Regarding her query about measures taken to combat increased domestic abuse in Carlow, I will respond in more detail later but would emphasise that our collective approach is an all-encompassing national one and will continue thus.</p>  <p>  There is no doubt that domestic abuse incidents have increased during the pandemic.  We also know that services are going to come under increased pressure in the period leading up to the winter weeks and afterwards.  In the first few months of the pandemic we had a full lockdown and it was only after society started to open up again that services started to see a massive increase in demand because people felt that they could actually seek help and that it would be available.  In that context, we know that pressure is going to increase, which is why we have tried to make sure that additional funding was provided this year and in the budget for next year.  This funding will support community and voluntary organisations, as well as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and various State agencies.  Additional resources, support, enforcement and services have been made available and domestic abuse cases are being prioritised by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Courts Service and the Legal Aid Board.  Covid-specific funding has been made available for this year and next.  </p>  <p>  I would like to assure the Deputy that we are not just looking at addressing immediate challenges but are also looking at how to improve services going forward.  The Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman and I are anxious to have the input of partners working in this area and have been talking to various community and voluntary organisations, as well as stakeholders in various Departments because this is not just an issue for our respective Departments but also for the Departments of Social Protection, Housing, Local Government and Heritage and Education.  We need to educate all of society about the issue of consent, what is acceptable and unacceptable, what to look out for and how to support people.  We will deliver on the programme for Government commitment to audit how responsibility for this area is segmented.  We will analyse the work done by various Departments and make sure that we have a functioning structure in place.  Obviously, when there is a national structure in place, that disseminates down into individual counties and the work being done there.  This provides better structures on a county by county basis.  I will revert to the Deputy on County Carlow in my follow-up response. </p></speech>

Evidence shows that women, children, migrants, refugees, people with disabilities and the elderly have been hit hardest by the pandemic and this has been compounded by a widespread increase in domestic violence.  A core issue of concern is unreported incidents of domestic violence.</p>  <p>  There has been a 25% increase in reports of domestic abuse in Carlow which is worrying and frightening.  While I welcome the introduction of a resource officer and outreach from Amber Kilkenny Womens Refuge Project, which does great work, I must ask again about a women's refuge for Carlow.  This is an enormous issue for me.  Carlow should have its own refuge and I have been fighting for this for a long time.  We also need to look at the issue of housing and how to provide emergency housing for women in domestic violence situations.  </p></speech>

It will be concluded by March of next year and will take into account the fact that there are also housing and social welfare support issues involved here.  Work is being done by Tusla at the moment to review the current bed capacity in order to ensure that we have enough places.  I am very conscious that a number of counties do not have their own refuge but Carlow and Kilkenny tend to work together in this space.</p>  <p>  The figures I mentioned earlier are quite significant, with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na contacting or attempting to contact 20,699 victims of domestic abuse, which highlights just how many people are in very difficult and challenging situations.  The number of cases has increased, as has the number of people coming forward for the first time.  The types of violence that we are seeing, particularly against women but also against men, have also increased.  This is a massive problem and is not just something that has arisen because of Covid-19.  It has always been there but Covid-19 has shone a light on it and I have prioritised this issue as Minister for Justice.</p>  <p>  It should be acknowledged that a huge amount of work was done in partnership with Beat 102-103 on awareness raising.  We know that when we raise awareness, people do come forward and report.  In particular, Ms Michelle Heffernan has been nominated for the Mary Raftery Prize for her work, for which I thank her.  </p></speech>

We must have an holistic approach to this.  Services must be more accessible and more information must be provided in order that people better understand the issue.  We know that people are doing their jobs to the best of their ability; that is not in question.  The issue is getting the audit right, which will have a massive impact on people's lives.</p>  <p>  I must also congratulate my own local radio station, KCLR, which has been focusing on domestic violence and abuse in recent weeks, in the run-up to Christmas.  Everyone is playing his or her part but it is important, in the context of the audit, that the Department considers a women's refuge for Carlow.  I know of people who were referred to refuges in Kilkenny and Waterford but they were full.  We are referring women to refuges that are full.</p></speech>

Their homes are not their sanctuaries.  They find sanctuary outside their homes when they discover a safe space somewhere else.  They were robbed of this chance for months during lockdown.  The Minister gave them assurances and clarity that travel restrictions did not and do not apply to them.  This was very welcome and an important move.  What other actions is the Minister taking to support victims of domestic and sexual abuse and to deliver long-term and lasting cultural change?</p></speech>

It is very important that victims of domestic abuse, violence and sexual abuse know what supports are available to them.  A key recommendation of the O'Malley report, which then fed into Supporting a Victim's Journey, was that there should be greater access to information in different forms and through different media.  At the implementation meeting yesterday, at which I met representatives from the Departments of Health and Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and my Department, it was clear that a great amount of work is under way to provide this information through an online platform and updated website but to also provide it where people are and in the places they go, including public spaces such as Garda stations and libraries.  People will then know where to get information and what services are available.  We need to ensure that those services are there for them.  That is why we are continuing to invest not only in the community and voluntary sector, but at a national level through Tusla with a view to ensuring people have the services they need when they take the very brave step of seeking this help in the first instance.</p></speech>

I compliment the staff of the Irish Prison Service, IPS, on the way in which Covid was kept out of the prisons.  I also recognise the co-operation of prisoners who have been deprived of visits, and many other things in the prisons, as a result.  What arrangements have been made to allow for prison visits over the Christmas period to happen in as generous and humane a way as possible, while remaining consonant with public health advice?</p></reply>

Feedback on the use of this system has been generally positive.  I understand that additional phone calls have been also been facilitated.</p>  <p>  The IPS has announced arrangements to allow all those in custody to book a physical family visit between 16 December and 6 January.  Each prisoner will be entitled to one physical visit, limited to two people, which will be limited to 15 minutes in duration.  I understand this time limit is necessary to ensure that the maximum number of visits can be facilitated, having regard to the need to reduce the number of booths in use for distancing purposes and the need to fully sanitise surfaces between visitors.  All visitors will be behind clear screens and visitors and prisoners will be required to wear face masks at all times.  No physical contact will be permitted.  All visitors will also be subject to the Covid-19 screening procedures which have been in place since March and visitors are requested not to attend if they have any symptoms, if they have been in contact with a person who has gone for testing, if they themselves have tested positive for Covid and have yet to be cleared by their doctor or if they have been abroad in the preceding fortnight.</p>  <p>  I understand that this is very difficult for the families concerned, particularly after such a difficult year.  However, the IPS has worked tirelessly to safeguard prisoners and staff and this continues to be the primary consideration.  We are all hoping next year will be a very different year but for now the IPS must continue to ensure that the prison population is protected from the virus and it is continuing to make use of alternative means of keeping prisoners and their families connected.  Prisoners will continue to be able to avail of 20-minute video visits and additional daily phone calls are also being facilitated during the Christmas period.</p></speech>

I realise the health challenges involved.  It is a question of balance.  I recognise that video visits have been made available, although there have been some gremlins with that system.  It is certainly a help but, all as all of us have discovered in our own lives, video visits, Skype and so on are no substitute for personal contact.  We are also aware that one of the big losses involved in being in prison is the loss of family contact.  This has been exacerbated this year.  We also know that good family contact can also have an effect on outcomes for prisoners after they leave prison.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State said that two people will be allowed per visit, one of whom will obviously be an adult.  If there are two or three children in a family, that family will be placed in an invidious situation.  I imagine that the number of prisoners with children is not equal to the total prison population.  Can anything be done to introduce some flexibility because it seems that this will be very difficult for people at this very special time of the year?</p></speech>

I absolutely understand that the loss of family contact has an impact on prisoners.  This is something which has affected people across society over the last year as a result of Covid.  I agree that prisoners having contact with family helps with stability and can result in better outcomes upon release.  I also agree that having to choose which two members will attend a visit will put some families in a very difficult situation but this has been necessary across all of our services.  We have seen it in nursing homes as well.  Very difficult choices have had to be made.  I will certainly encourage the IPS to introduce any flexibility it can while allowing for health considerations and concerns.</p></speech>

Not all situations are the same.  There is not the same pressure in all prisons regarding visits.  In the context of the health issue, I would make the case that the risk presented by two members of a family who live together is no different than the risk presented by three.  If they live together, one would imagine that whatever one catches, the others do.  The humane thing would be to make arrangements for children to be allowed visit over the Christmas period in both the male and female prisons.  If prisoners require multiple visits, which people who do not have children will not, that should be facilitated.  We are asking parents to make invidious choices between children.

As I have said, if any flexibility can be allowed, I will certainly encourage the IPS to allow it.  It will, of course, have to consider both the practical difficulties and the difficulties arising from Covid and the public health advice, which must be followed.  This will obviously result in a very difficult situation for the families concerned, especially where young children are involved.  It is difficult to be separated from one's family at any time but it will be even more difficult for those prisoners and their families at Christmas.  I understand that the IPS will be facilitating temporary release for a small cohort of prisoners, as is the normal practice.  Applications are currently being considered in that regard.  With regard to the mental health of prisoners, the Minister is working very hard to try to improve the supports available to prisoners not only in the short term but also in the long term.</p></speech>

They have met with officials in my Department and provided material in support of an application for a presidential pardon under Article 13.6 of Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann.  Following consideration by officials, I understand that an opinion was formed that the conviction might be considered unsafe.</p> <p>I am advised that the then Minister agreed that this case potentially demonstrated, in all the circumstances, a miscarriage of justice.  On foot of this, my Department engaged an expert on 19th century trial law in Ireland for their expert opinion on the safety, or otherwise, of the conviction.  I understand they have largely completed their work, save for some issues which will involve accessing the National Archives once they are open again.  When that is completed, the report will be submitted to me.  I can assure the Deputy I will consider it as soon as possible and make my recommendations.  If at that stage it is decided that a pardon should be recommended to the President, I will do so then.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the great work the Michael O'Donoghue Memorial Heritage Project has done on this case.  For the relatives of John Twiss, it is very emotive and important that they have justice done for their ancestor.  I acknowledge the Minister's enthusiasm from the start.  Within days of taking office she was on the case.  I also acknowledge the work of her predecessor, Deputy Flanagan, who took the case very seriously and moved it forward.  I hope that all of those working on the case can prioritise it and complete their work as soon as possible.  This has gone on for 125 years and it will be 126 years in February.  The passage of time does not diminish the hurt caused to the Twiss family and everybody in the district, particularly his descendants, who want to see justice finally for John Twiss.</p></speech>

Where a miscarriage of justice may have occurred, it is extremely important that we correct the record.  We need to provide clarity and assurance to the family.  I will give some more detail in the process.  Following the initial consideration of a case by departmental officials where they form a view that there was potentially a miscarriage of justice, we bring in the independent expert to examine all the information on the case.  I again thank those who have provided that information to the particular expert in this case.</p>  <p>  If it is advised that a presidential pardon should be awarded, I will bring that to Cabinet and then it goes on to the President to decide following advice of Government as to whether a pardon should be granted.  I reassure the Deputy that this case has not been forgotten.  It is being worked on and as soon as I get the report from the independent expert, I will act on it as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

They firmly believe in John Twiss's innocence.  Many experts over the years have examined the case in detail and have found there is no possible way this man could have committed the terrible crime that was committed.  Let us not forget that there was a victim in James Donovan, who was murdered callously in 1894.  However, John Twiss did not do it and that is why justice is really important here.  The BBC has featured this documentary on a number of occasions.  Based on the precedent set in the Maamtrasna case, I hope a pardon will ultimately be granted here.</p></speech>

My question might seem a bit redundant, but I ask her to reiterate the Department's intention regarding those who have received letters.  I put particular emphasis on the cases off the two care workers that I have raised with the Minister repeatedly.  What do they need to do next?  I acknowledge that Minister has given me written answers.  What are their next steps?  Should they make an appeal directly to the Minister?  What is the position of deportation?</p></reply>

The approach to deportation orders will continue for the duration of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>  <p>  A decision to suspend the issuing of negative international protection decisions during level 5 restrictions had already been taken and this remains in place.  Under the International Protection Act 2015, a person receives a letter informing him or her of his or her negative international protection decision and informing that person that he or she no longer has permission to remain in the State.  The person is required to confirm within five days whether he or she will accept the option of voluntary return.  It is important to note the person is not required to remove him or herself from the State within five days.</p>  <p>  For the duration of level 5 Covid-19 restrictions, I asked my officials to review the issuing of letters.  No refusal letters or letters enclosing a deportation order have issued to anyone who has been unsuccessful in seeking international protection since. </p>  <p>  Since the outbreak of Covid-19 in March 2020, there have only been four cases where individuals have been deported from the State.  Three of those cases arose from deportation orders issued prior to March 2020.  For the one case where the deportation order was issued since March 2020, that person was returned to their country and was not a failed international protection applicant.  </p>  <p>  For those found not to be in need of international protection, a detailed consideration is always given to all aspects of their case.  This must be carried out before a decision is made whether to grant permission to remain.  While I will not go into details of individual cases here, there is a very clear process.  I urge anybody applying through that process to provide as much detail as possible.  All considerations are taken into account - family situations, work situations, humanitarian situations and their country of origin.  All this detail is really important.  When making an appeal, including in the cases the Deputy has mentioned, such people should provide all that information along with any new information that may have come to light that might not have been taken into account in the initial response.</p></speech>

Just before I came in here, I spoke to two care workers who have received deportation orders.  Their concern now is that one of their work permits has expired and the other will expire in the next couple of weeks.  That does not help us because it means that two care workers who could be doing very useful and vital work during the pandemic are unable to because they do not have work permits.  They cannot apply to extend their work permits because of the refusal of leave to remain they have received.  It is complex and it is hard for me to know how to advise them.  Based on what the Minister has just said, I take it that they should make an appeal, reiterating and outlining all the circumstances they have faced and are facing, along with the details of the basis for appeal.  I take it that the Department will look favourably on that, particularly in the case of care workers, artists and other people who make a contribution to our community.</p></speech>

Taking one action can potentially have an impact in another space.  It is really important to have joined-up thinking and provide as much reassurance to everybody who is impacted by this.  I can speak to the Deputy separately about the individual cases.  We want to reassure people that they will not be deported throughout this pandemic.  The figures show that this is the approach we have taken from the outset.  Where there are complex and difficult cases, I encourage people to continue to engage with the relevant agencies and the Department.  As the Deputy noted, situations change and different scenarios arise.  Until we are made aware of them, it is hard to respond in great detail.  Where situations change or difficult scenarios arise, we will try to work with them to find the most appropriate response we can and to respond in the most compassionate way we can.</p></speech>

I will ensure that these issues are followed up.  Ultimately, the pandemic may spike and subside here and in other countries, but if these are the conditions under which people are allowed to remain, then the deportation orders are like a sword of Damocles hanging over them.  It is a tragedy and a pity.  These are human beings who have a huge contribution to make to our society.  In the end, this needs to be resolved outside the context of this Covid-19 crisis, because we do not want to lose valuable workers and people from our society and push them back to some place where they do not feel safe.  That is a wider philosophical and long-term question, but it is important that we take it into account.  If we are just relying on the conditions caused by the Covid-19 crisis for them to be allowed to remain, then this is still a very stressful factor in the lives of those concerned.  What the Minister said, and said emphatically, is welcome but there is still a problem for these people in the long term.</p></speech>

At the same time, it is a system and ,like any other, it can always be improved.  That is part of a wider discussion and engagement which may need to take place after this.  I reiterate my comments from yesterday to the effect that we will continue to take the same compassionate and pragmatic approach we have taken throughout this pandemic.  I give that reassurance.  I also stress something else I said yesterday.  We are rolling out a new vaccine programme and I wish to state, on the record, that no information provided by anyone who comes forward will be passed on to any type of immigration service or otherwise.  It is important that people come forward and get this vaccine, and that includes those going through the international protection system as well.</p></speech>

I have also heard the Minister say he is committed to a review.

I also recognise the potential hardship that might arise for students on placement due to Covid-19.  Student nurses and midwives are not paid salaries for clinical placements in years 1 to 3, when they are supernumerary or additional to the existing workforce.  This is the same across Europe in countries that have degree programmes for nursing and midwifery.</p>  <p>  Student nurses and midwives do receive allowances, including an accommodation allowance up to &euro;50.79 per week and a refund of travel expenses.  They are the only clinical students who receive the allowance.  Students are paid salaries of &euro;21,729 or &euro;22,229 in year 4 of their studies.  Last week I wrote to nursing unions and advised of the supports made available in 2020 for student nurses and student midwives.  These include access to the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, for those student nurses and midwives who may have lost part-time employment due to Covid-19.  This now includes nurses and students who had to give up their part-time jobs in nursing homes, for example, while on placement, in order to limit the potential for cross-contamination of Covid-19.  As the jobs still existed, they could not previously access the PUP, but they now can.  This is a specific exemption for nurses and midwives, for which I have secured Government approval and which is not available to anyone else.</p>  <p>  I have also asked for a short, independent examination of the current travel and accommodation allowance in the context of Covid-19.  I also believe a longer-term review of allowances and the fourth-year student salary is necessary and I have committed to that.  My Department is engaging with the representative organisations on this matter, and if they give their agreement for the review, my intention is that any recommended increase in allowances related to Covid-19 would be in place in January, as requested by the representative bodies.</p></speech>

It is very concerned that what the Minister is considering is a short-term response.  If something can be done in the context of Covid-19, that would be of some help.  The Minister, however, can also resolve the issue in the medium to long term immediately as well.  When the INMO hears about further reviews, it will hear the can being firmly kicked down the road.</p>  <p>  In a response last week, the Minister's party, after voting against a motion in the D&aacute;il, stated, "Student nurses in their final or pre-registration year are paid because they are different and do real work on wards that would not be done were it not for them".  It is not just fourth years who do real work, however, so too do first-, second- and third-year student nurses.  I received hundreds of emails from those people.  I cannot read out all of them out in the short time I have, but I hope to read one out in the next round.  The Minister must understand, however, that this is not just an emotive issue, this is an issue of justice and one which the Minister can resolve and which he should resolve.  Rather than just commit to reviews, I ask that he please deal with this issue for these workers, because they deserve it and I think the Minister knows that.</p></speech>

We are finalising that review now.  We are also looking at a longer-term review of student placements generally, but the representative bodies asked for very quick action.  They asked that any Covid-19-related allowances, if there is to be an increase, would be in place by January.  That is what they have asked for, and therefore that is what is being done.</p>  <p>  On the payment of a wage, I will refer to what some educators have said.  They are concerned about what looks like a push to turn a successful graduate degree profession into an apprenticeship model, which is the case in Germany and some other places around the world.  Some comments included references to the fact that if student nurses and midwives are paid and treated as workers, they will not be exposed to the learning they need.  It was also stated that they will be doing lower-skilled tasks and that this is not a degree education.  It was further stated that it is important that people understand that placement of student nurses is the same as placement for any other clinical student or healthcare student and that what is being suggested by calls to pay student nurses will set the profession back 50 years.  Very serious allegations regarding what is happening on the placements have been made.  I assure the Deputy and the House that I am taking these deadly seriously.  I have instigated a full review and I am meeting the directors of nursing this evening regarding this issue.</p></speech>

We got a similar response from the Taoiseach in recent days.  Let me be very clear that my party is certainly not looking for a return to the past or an apprenticeship programme.  We are supporting the call from the INMO for fourth-year students to be paid the equivalent rate of a healthcare assistant and that there be a fair allowance for first-, second- and third-year students.  One student who wrote to me commented that she was infuriated to read the statement from the Minister's party, which she referred to as an ignorant statement.  She told me that since her initial placement as a student nurse in first year, she has provided care to many patients and that she knows for a fact that the wards would not function without the help of student nurses, regardless of what year they are in.  There are hundreds of those student nurses, so I ask the Minister to not be disingenuous in responding to genuine concerns raised by my party and the INMO.  We are not calling for a return to the past and we are not looking to go backwards.  We are seeking fairness and a generous and fair allowance for those first-, second- and third-year student nurses.</p></speech>

The example of Australia has been raised in this House, which runs both an apprenticeship model and a degree programme.  I assure Deputy Cullinane, therefore, that we are taking this issue very seriously.  Two separate issues are being raised and we are addressing both.</p>  <p>  The first falls primarily within my remit, and relates to whether students are being asked to do inappropriate practices while on placement.  I take that deadly seriously.  Neither I nor anyone in the Department has had any contact from the colleges regarding this in the past.  I have checked.</p> <p>I have instigated a formal review.  If serious breaches are found, they will be dealt with because students are under the care of the HSE when on placement.  We are taking this matter deadly seriously.  </p> <p> With regard to the allowance, if I understood the Deputy correctly, Sinn F&eacute;in is not looking for a wage for first, second and third years but it is looking for an appropriate allowance.  I welcome and agree with that.  To that end, we are doing two things.  We are carrying out a short review at the request of the representative bodies to get the allowance in place in January at a time of Covid and we are considering a second review that would deal with the time after Covid.</p></speech>

A high-level task force was established to support and oversee the development and implementation of the programme.  The task force is working on a national Covid-19 vaccination strategy and implementation plan which I expect to be submitted tomorrow.</p>  <p>  Ireland is taking part in a procurement exercise being operated by the European Commission on behalf of member states to procure suitable, safe and effective vaccines in sufficient quantities.  Ireland has opted into five advance purchase agreements, APAs, with pharmaceutical companies and a process is in place to opt into a sixth APA.  When we start receiving vaccines, we will have to prioritise who will receive them first.  Earlier this week, I announced the vaccination allocation strategy for Covid-19 vaccines following sign-off by Cabinet on Tuesday.  The strategy prioritises those over the age of 65 living in long-term care facilities, front-line healthcare workers who are in direct patient contact and those aged 70 and over.</p>  <p>  The high-level task force is working intensively to ensure that all necessary elements are identified and addressed in the plans for implementation.  Its work includes how the vaccine will be administered, by whom and where.  Planning for an ICT system is in train to enable all necessary aspects of an individual&rsquo;s vaccination history to be recorded.  Further details will be included in the national vaccination strategy and implementation plan, once approved by Government.</p></speech>

A tracking system of vaccinations will be important given there will be two vaccines.  Solidarity-People Before Profit spoke to a public health doctor recently who told us that they will find this extremely challenging as they are operating at less than one-third of the resources and staff that will be required to roll-out the vaccine.  There are enormous challenges in regard to roll-out.  There is another challenge, which is the fears people may have about a vaccine.  There are people in society who will seek to stoke up that fear.  The Minister and the Government need to allay the fear around vaccine safety and roll-out.  This will be important because what we do not want is particular elements stoking up fear in regard to the vaccines.</p></speech>

A lot of work is ongoing in the Department and across government on a communications plan.  We have a very strong record of vaccinations in Ireland.  We will roll out a comprehensive plan.  It is about listening to people's concerns and taking them seriously.  It is also about providing the medical and scientific experts to engage with people and address their concerns.  </p>  <p>  Ireland has a very good track record.  I refer the Deputy to the roll-out of the HPV vaccine, which will save many lives.  Ireland had an uptake of 80% of that vaccine.  The  anti-vaccine movement then rolled into town across Europe and uptake of that vaccine, based largely on misinformation, fell from 80% to 50%.  I am delighted that thanks to an enormous effort across Ireland and some notable advocacy, uptake of the HPV vaccine has increased again from 50% to 80%.  This will save an awful lot of lives.</p></speech>

Various vehicles have been identified for roll-out of the vaccine, including GP surgeries, primary care centres and so on.  Britain is providing portable hubs to which people can go to get the vaccine.  Is consideration being given to putting in place out-of-hours services in order that GP services are not overrun because that would not be good for anybody?  Is consideration being given to portable roll-out of the vaccine over the next three to six months?  </p>  <p>  The Minister mentioned vulnerable people.

The prioritisation and implementation strategies announced this week are identified by the task force as living documents because how the vaccines are rolled out and which country gets them and when is dependent on three factors, namely, when the European Medicines Agency, EMA, authorises them, information that is still to come from the regulatory process in terms of which vaccines are most suitable for different people and, in part, the sequence of the vaccines.  For example, the first vaccine on which the EMA is likely to make a ruling, probably on 29 December, is the Pfizer vaccine.  It has to be stored at -70oC.  There are other vaccines, which we hope will be authorised, which are stored at a refrigerated temperature.  In the case of the Pfizer vaccine, GP surgeries and pharmacies do not have the necessary type of storage facilities and, therefore, a strategy is being developed to put in place the types of hubs mentioned by the Deputy.  There will be distribution from hubs where there is specialist storage.  The other vaccines that just need to be refrigerated can be distributed in a different way.</p>  <p>  As of now, we have no authorisation on any of the vaccines but the implementation plan being presented tomorrow is an adaptable plan according to the information we get and the sequencing and timing of when the various vaccines are authorised.</p></speech>

I have been observing the engagements of the Joint Committee on Children, Disability, Equality and Integration with the families, the Children's Ombudsman and other representatives.</p>  <p>  The length of time to complete an assessment of need under the Disability Act will vary depending on the child&rsquo;s complexity of need.  The average time from receipt of application to the completion of an assessment of need report in 2019 for a child is just under 20 months nationally but there is considerable variation between and within the different community healthcare organisations, CHOs. </p>  <p>  The Disability Act 2005 was commenced for children aged under five in 2007.  The intention at the time was that the HSE would provide assessments of need under the Act for this group only while the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs, EPSEN, Act 2004 would provide assessments for schoolgoing children.  However, it is important to note that the relevant sections of the EPSEN Act were never commenced.  As a result of a High Court ruling in December 2009, the effect of which was to open eligibility to all children born after 1 June 2002, the number of children aged five and over and, in addition, of schoolgoing age, has increased steadily as a percentage of applications received, increasing from 26% in 2011 to 55% in 2019.</p> <p>This reflects that the assessment of need process is an accumulative one in terms of the numbers seeking access.  The recent welcome allocation of &euro;7.8 million through Sl&aacute;intecare to address overdue assessments will further support the HSE and its funded service providers in ensuring children access the appropriate therapies as soon as possible.  Assessment of need is a nut we need to crack.  There is no denying that.  The lengths of time families are waiting to access assessments has turned this into an industry. </p></reply>

They are parents and children and this issue has a knock-on effect on the overall family structure, society in general and school.  It is crucially important that these children receive intervention and assessment in order that there are no lost opportunities.  That is what we are talking about here: lost opportunities for children.  Parents face a dilemma when their children do not reach their developmental milestones.  Some children are being left behind by their peers, are unable to perform tasks independently, or are totally reliant on the care of their parents or caregivers.  We need to start doing something now, today, as soon as possible, to ease the access for parents seeking an assessment of need for their children, when and where they need it.  What is being done to make this happen in a timely manner?</p></speech>

The funding I received through Sl&aacute;intecare is being adequately used to address that backlog at this moment in time.  Next week, at the Joint Committee on Children, Disability, Equality and Integration, I plan to have all the figures to show exactly how the funding has been spent and how we are achieving that.  I also plan to meet the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, next week to address the issue regarding the EPSEN Act.  When we originally brought in the assessment of need tools, they were intended to address early intervention.  The Deputy spoke about real families.  We should have all our assessments of needs done before a child enters the school setting, where appropriate and possible.  I want to move away from assessments and get to intervention.  That is the conversation I want to have.  I have a plan and we are working hard on it.</p></speech>

The committee heard from the Ombudsman for Children last week and he basically said it is an old fashioned three-card trick, that children are being moved from one list to another and their needs are not being met.  I am glad the Minster of State mentioned intervention because that is another problem.  When children get their assessment of need and what they need for their development going forward is outlined, the actual wrap-around services they need, such as speech and language therapy or occupational therapy, are not there.  Those services must be put in place, in conjunction with getting the assessments of need.</p>  <p>  I have an issue that was brought up by the Enough is Enough group at this week's committee meeting.  The standard operating procedure is a desktop examination wherein parents fill out forms and assess their children's needs.  Parents are not therapists and they have told me that they are terrified they will miss something that will delay their child's development.  Does the Minister of State think this is an appropriate mechanism for assessing children in order that their developmental needs can be met?</p></speech>

However, that only ever got off the ground for approximately six weeks because Covid landed.  Again, I am seeking funding from the Minister for Health and am using that funding appropriately to address the backlog.  As a new Minister of State in my portfolio, this has given me the opportunity to address whether the SOP is fit for purpose.  Will it address the needs of the families and get us the intervention we need in a timely fashion?  I hope the Joint Committee on Children, Disability, Equality and Integration will bring in the other lead clinician, Dr. McKenna, to give the balance of the conversation.  I am not a clinician and I want to hear from the experts.  I hope the committee will also invite the HSE lead to discuss this matter.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, the two in the group who do not use drugs are struggling with their mental health because they are being ostracised for not joining in.  His younger brother has the same problem.  When he tries to join his friends, they just turn their backs on him as if to say he is a spoilsport or self-righteous.

She was here again yesterday for the Private Members' business regarding mental health.  I thank her for keeping mental health front and centre.  It is hugely important.</p><p>We have never needed to put such a focus on mental health as we do at the moment.  The Covid pandemic has come down hard on people and I hear the Deputy's concerns about that group of young people and the challenges they are facing.  As we look forward to developing our roadmap to building a world-class healthcare system, including putting mental health front and centre, the Sl&aacute;intecare vision is to achieve a universal single-tier healthcare system.  We have a lot of work to do but much of it has started.</p><p>Our refreshed mental health policy, Sharing the Vision, is complemented by a national implementation and monitoring committee, NIMC, which will hold its inaugural meeting tomorrow at 11 a.m.  We had a fantastic document previously in A Vision for Change<i></i>but not all of it was implemented and this time will be different.  The NIMC will hold both me and the Minister for Health to account, as well as the HSE and the Department.  This is the first time we have had clear oversight.  To give the Deputy an overview of the independent make-up of the committee, it will be chaired by Mr. John Saunders, who is known from the Mental Health Commission.  Mental health reformers are included, as well as psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers, family representatives, minority groups, service users, representatives of Sl&aacute;intecare and NGOs across the board.

It was greatly appreciated.  This is a very serious matter and it can be difficult to leave a group of friends or to stand up to peer pressure.  It is a stressful situation for those directly involved, as well as their parents.  It is alarming that of one social group of 20 young people, 18 are regular drug users.  It is hard to imagine the scale of the mental health issues caused by drug use across the country.  We might be able to treat or deal with the physical health issues associated with neurological and substance use disorders but any strategies adopted must include mental health provisions as well.  This problem exists all over Ireland and we can be pretty sure that similar scenarios exist in every constituency on the island.  We need to update our schools drug policy.  Funding for mental health services is required in this regard but we need to make that provision as well.</p></speech>

Our schools policy needs to be updated across many sectors but especially in regard to drug abuse.  Sharing the Vision advocates for additional universal supports to provide care to individuals with complex mental health needs, including those presenting with co-existing mental health supports such as addiction or dual diagnosis.  This is where it gets very complicated.  As regards the dual diagnosis national clinical programme, a draft model of care is in place, which takes account of service users' views and ascribes the clinical pathway for patients with substance misuse issues and significant mental illness.</p>  <p>The draft model of care will not be published until it is finalised by the national clinical lead.  We are awaiting approval from the Office of the Chief Clinical Officer.  I take on board the Deputy's point.  Education is key.</p></speech>

There is also the issue with not having a partner there when receiving bad news.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />The evidence to date from the World Health Organisation states that birthing people need birthing partners as a part of their maternity care service ... It&rsquo;s not just about visiting rights, it's about  compromised care, its delivery of devastating information to birthing people without support, it's making important decisions without your support person, it's about navigating early labour and induction processes alone, it's the experience of post birth trauma and early postpartum struggles from behind a curtain. </blockquote>  <p>Is anything being done to minimise the damage?

I am very familiar with the situation, and I am a mother of three.  This week, there was a move to allow partners to attend the 20-week scan, which had not been allowed until now as a result of Covid.  It has been challenging.  We are talking about hospitals and maternity wards which are home to young babies, including the most vulnerable.  The most important thing we can do is keep Covid out of these facilities.  The Minister is constantly monitoring this and being updated.  He has spoken with maternity hospitals across the country.  It is very challenging and difficult for expectant mothers who might not be hearing positive news to have to sit by themselves.  I welcome the decision that from this week partners will be allowed to attend the 20-week scan, which is the anomaly scan.</p></speech>

At what stage is this project?  When will planning permission be submitted?  Prior to the 2016 general election, the former Taoiseach, Enda Kenny, stated that the exiting department was not fit for purpose.  Deputy Varadkar, who later became Taoiseach, stated that it was not fit for purpose.  The current Taoiseach said it was not fit for purpose.  Between feasibility problems and business case design, I have no idea what stage the plans have reached.</p></reply>

I had a very productive meeting with the Saolta group some days ago regarding ongoing projects at University Hospital Galway, including this one, and a discussion on elective facilities in the region.</p>  <p>  I am happy to say this project for a new emergency department at University Hospital Galway, which is part of a larger development incorporating maternity and paediatric services, will be included in the capital plan for 2021 along with funding to progress the business case for elective hospitals.  The design for the main block, incorporating a full fit out for the women and children's service, has been finalised and the cost-benefit analysis is to be updated for this development.  The design for a temporary emergency department, which is to be constructed, has been signed off in the past week.  This is an enabling work to clear the site for the main block development.  A procurement process is being progressed as part of this project.  It is expected that these works will commence in the first quarter of 2021.  Other site enabling works are ongoing in preparation for the main emergency department and women and children's block development, including road and services realignment.  Covid-related winter works for the emergency department are currently in progress and expected to be completed in this month or January.</p></reply>

Where is the planning permission at?  When will the planning application be submitted for the emergency department in Galway?  In 2017, then Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, told us that a new emergency department for University Hospital Galway was being designed with a view to planning for construction being provided as part of the 2017 capital plan review.  This hospital serves almost 1 million people from Donegal right down along the west coast.  That is six or seven counties.  The entire hospital is not fit for purpose.  I wish I had time to go into that matter.  There should be a brand new hospital at Merlin Park, not just the elective facility that is planned.  After talking to the HSE and after years of delay, when will planning permission for the emergency department be submitted to the city council for approval?</p></speech>

That specific query was not included in the question the Deputy submitted, which seeks an update on the totality of the works.  The latter is what I endeavoured to provide.  I will revert to the Deputy very quickly with the timeline relating to her additional specific question on planning permission.</p>  <p>  On the new hospital, I had a very constructive meeting with the Saolta group this week.  It has a plan that would incorporate a more ambitious project than simply the elective day case hospital which is under consideration.  It includes inpatient beds, additional operating theatres and so on.  It would be very favourably disposed to that being on the Merlin Park site. We are progressing that.  This week, the Department has received a report on all the potential sites for this really important development.</p>  <p>  The most important information regarding when construction on the emergency department will start is that it is being included in the capital plan for next year.  That has not happened before.  It is very important work.</p></speech>

Given the history of this matter, it is quite obvious that planning permission was the main thing.</p>  <p>  I have a slightly different opinion.  I believe that a brand new hospital should be built on the 150 to 180 acres of the Merlin Park Hospital site and that both facilities should be used as sister hospitals.  I am no expert, however.  The options appraisal did recommend a brand new hospital.  The decision was to take a small part of that and to build an elective hospital at Merlin Park.  I would welcome change on that.  If there is a move to having a brand new hospital at Merlin Park to serve a population of over 1 million and rising, I welcome that.  However, I am tired of the scripts about feasibility studies, business cases and examining things relating to a hospital that is not fit for purpose.  It seems to be driven by certain elements in the medical community rather than a proper appraisal of a need for a new hospital which the options appraisal has gone some way to do.  If we keep going like this, a new hospital will be built before there is a new emergency department.  It makes sense to build a new hospital, not to have parallel buildings and a waste of money.</p></speech>

The proposition of elective hospitals is one being deployed in Cork, Galway and Dublin.  It is international best practice and is going well where it is used.  Tallaght has secured an elective-only site in its area.  The idea is to separate scheduled and unscheduled care as that has good outcomes.</p>  <p>  I take the point about having a more ambitious plan than just building an elective hospital.  The Saolta group shares that view and we had a detailed discussion about the matter during the week.</p>  <p>  To finish on a positive note on emergency departments, when I was in opposition, last year and in previous year, the Deputy and I had pushed hard on the issue of trolley counts and people, particularly older individuals, waiting on trolleys, sometimes for days, including in Galway.  It is only the second week of December and still early days, but I am glad to report that so far this year while 90% of people are coming to emergency departments and 90% being admitted relative to last year because of the good work done on the &euro;600 million winter plan, including investment for Galway.  The trolley count is at less than 30% week for week compared with last year.  Many of those on trolleys are for shorter and shorter times and are in more appropriate conditions suitable to the Covid environment.</p></speech>

I want to ask specifically why they are being asked to pay for the flu jab.  It is perfectly understandable that they would receive the flu jab given that they are front-line workers and working very hard with patients in Covid wards etc.  Why, particularly when they are not being paid for the work they do, are they expected to pay for a simple thing like the flu jab?  A number of nurses have come to us about this issue.  I would like a comprehensive answer from the Minister.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-12-10a.176" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="11:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020121000016#O00300"><p>I thank Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith for her question.  When I received the question, it alarmed me because it suggested something that should not be happening.  As a result, I asked for it be looked into.</p>  <p>  The flu vaccine is free for all healthcare workers working in our public and voluntary hospitals and to all healthcare workers delivering front-line services.  It is also available free of charge to all students on clinical placement.  Students can access it in local occupational health clinics, vaccination clinics staffed by their peers or at their local GP or pharmacy.  My Department and the HSE are not aware of a situation where students on clinical placements have been charged to receive the vaccine.  If the Deputy is aware of individual cases where this has occurred, I want to tell her categorically that it should not have happened.  If she would like to revert to me with any individual cases, I guarantee her that they will be followed up.</p>  <p>  This year, given the potential for the winter flu season to coincide with a resurgence of Covid infections, and the importance of minimising hospital attendance, the Government expanded the provision of vaccination without charge to all of those in the HSE defined as being at-risk groups, including healthcare workers.  The amount of vaccine made available for this winter is almost double the amount of vaccine administered last winter.  Healthcare workers are at an increased risk of getting flu.  They also have the potential to spread the flu by virtue of their contact with patients.  Likewise, they can prevent the spread of flu by getting the vaccine.  It is recommended, therefore, that everyone working in a healthcare setting should get the flu vaccine.  This includes medical, nursing and allied health students, including those working in residential disability services.</p></speech>

I will provide him with the information I have.  Again, we are hearing, in regard to student nurses, that something should not be happening.  It should not be happening that they are not getting paid for work they are doing.  It should not be happening that they are working instead of studying.  It should not be happening that they are not supervised.  It should not be happening that they are working instead of learning.  However, all of those things are happening.  I totally get that workers who work on the front line need to be protected from the flu, but the problem is that they are being asked to pay for it.  I will send the Minister the information on that.</p>  <p>  Maybe the problem is that they are not defined as workers when they are working.  The Minister's reply referred, at the end, to all students, but it also referred to those working in the health sector.  At the very least, we need to recognise that student nurses are actually working and we need an assurance that this will not happen in the future.  I ask the Minister to clarify that it will not happen.  I will give him the information I have.</p></speech>

The two issues are separate.  There is the question of vaccinations and the question of students and the allowances they should be paid.  I know the Deputy and others are advocating that they become part of the paid workforce.  The colleges are strongly opposed to that and are very worried about it.  They believe the comparisons with the apprenticeship model could set the profession back decades.  Comparisons have been made in this House with Australia, where they run an apprenticeship model and a graduate degree model.  The opportunities available to the degree programme graduates are significantly better than those available to the apprenticeship graduates.  A lot of the really exciting and important developments in the nursing and midwifery professions happening right now are because they are degree graduate students, including enhanced nurse practitioner specialist roles and so forth.</p>  <p>  Specific to the issue at hand, it is clear policy of the HSE that all students get the vaccination for free.  I would be very happy to look into cases of individuals who are coming to the Deputy.  As Minister for Health, I very much want to know if any of our students, on their clinical placements, are being charged.  I will act on it if that is the case.</p></speech>

That is ignored and we are told that they should be students and they should be training.  In fact, they are students and they are working.  It is not that we are demanding that they become part of the workforce.  We recognise that they are students but we also recognise that they should be paid for every hour they work.  It is work that a normal care worker would do, including emptying bed pans, washing patients, taking their vitals and sometimes administering liquids and fluids to them.  It is not that they are not working.  When one is not being paid for one's work on the front line, being asked to pay for the flu jab is adding insult to injury and it really needs to stop.</p>  <p>  The Minister wants me to draw attention to specifics but a lot of things happen in the HSE that should not happen.  I know care workers in the HSE who have basically been witch-hunted for making any criticism of their employment or their employer.  It really is not acceptable that it is like the politburo for workers who work within it.  Some of these nurses are nervous about giving their names for that very reason.  There is a bad culture there and this is only another example of it.  The culture we have to stamp out is the exploitation of student nurses.</p></speech>

There are two separate issues.  One is whether students are being asked to do inappropriate activities while on their clinical placements.  Various testimonies have been read out in the D&aacute;il and various students have given testimony in the media and online.  As Minister for Health, I take those allegations deadly seriously.  I have initiated a full review of all of the allegations.  I am meeting with all of the directors of nursing on these allegations.  There cannot be a situation where these students are being treated as workers.  It is imperative, as part of their degree education, that they are full-time students.  In first, second and third year, they spend the majority of their time on campus.  The HSE provides clinical placements where they can link theory and practice.  I can tell the Deputy that their educators are strongly opposed to the idea that they would become part of the paid workforce in the HSE.  In essence, their argument is that they want to protect them as students and protect their learning, and if we start paying them as workers in a system, they could be treated as such.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, I am seeking a short review, to be finished by the end of this month, in co-operation with the representative bodies, to look at the allowances for student nurses.  We want to see if we can increase the allowances during the Covid period to reflect what is a very difficult time.  If such a recommendation is made, then I have committed to the students and I have committed to their representative organisations, in writing, that those increases in allowances would happen from January.</p></speech>

The Blackpool SouthDoc service, which had served residents on the north side, closed in March.  According to doctors practising locally, people have had to walk miles for the one operational service, which is situated in an industrial estate off the Kinsale Road roundabout in the south side of the city.  While it is accessible by car, many of the people I have spoken to do not drive.  The route is difficult for them to access on public transport and the cost of getting a taxi is becoming an issue for them.  As the second biggest city in the country, there is an absolute need for a second service.  Will the Minister outline whether the HSE has made plans to address this issue or reinstate the service in Blackpool?</p></reply>

GP out-of-hours services for Cork and Kerry are provided by SouthDoc.  The latter is a private organisation with more than 20 locations across the two counties, including a treatment centre in Blackpool that provides for patients on the north side of Cork city.  Further to public health guidance and the curtailment of in-person patient consultation, SouthDoc closed a number of treatment centres from 14 March last.  This was done in response to Covid-19 in order to protect both patients and staff and to limit the spread of the virus.  Other than the Blackpool centre, all centres in Cork city and county have since reopened.</p>  <p>  Cork Kerry Community Healthcare has written to, and met with, SouthDoc, requesting that the reopening of the Blackpool centre be prioritised.</p> <p>Cork Kerry Community Healthcare has also requested a plan for SouthDoc to reinstate services and a timeline for this.  While a timeline has not yet been received, the temporary nature of the closure has been confirmed.  SouthDoc has assured the HSE that every possible effort has been made and will continue to be made to avoid or minimise any impact of the temporary closures on patients.  The Government has supported the continuing provision of necessary out-of-hours GP services during the pandemic through a grant issued to service providers, including SouthDoc.</p></speech>

I appreciate the impact Covid-19 has had on all services throughout the health system.  It is my understanding that SouthDoc services throughout the city and county were closed at the onset of the pandemic to curtail the spread of the virus.  However, as the Minister has acknowledged, all centres in Cork city and county are open except for the one in Blackpool.</p>  <p>  I do not expect the Minister to be overly familiar with the north side of Cork city.  For his information I note that there is a purpose-built medical centre, St. Mary's Health Campus in Gurranebraher, which could house a new-out-of-hours clinic.  A service in this area could also provide for the people of Tower, Blarney, Grenagh and Whitechurch.  The demand for this service is greatest on the north side of Cork city.  One of the main issues here is the need for access to healthcare among people without transport.  I would welcome any further elaboration on the possibility of using St. Mary's Health Campus as a facility for SouthDoc in the event that the Blackpool centre cannot be opened. </p></speech>

Someone with a car might be able to deal with the situation.  Someone without a car who faces an emergency with a young child must spend &euro;40 on a taxi.  That is completely and totally unacceptable.</p>  <p>  I note that in reply to Cork Kerry Community Healthcare, SouthDoc has stated that this is temporary.  The question is how temporary it is.  Can we have a guarantee that if and when facilities are reinstated, this will not be a skeleton service with someone on the phone taking notes but no cars going out to visit people in the community?  The people of the north side of the city and beyond deserve a comprehensive and fully staffed out-of-hours GP service.  Can the Minister guarantee they will get that?</p></speech>

As Members will know, all of the relevant services were closed during the Covid-19 pandemic.  I have no doubt that the fact that the Blackpool centre remains closed is very frustrating for the people of the north of the city whom the Deputies represent.  Reopening it is a priority.  The HSE has engaged with SouthDoc to ask for the centre to be reopened and to request a timeline.  It is frustrating that a timeline has not been provided.  I undertake to follow up with the HSE to get one.</p>  <p>  In response to Deputy Barry's question around the nature of the services to be resumed, I can say that nothing has been brought to my attention to suggest that a smaller or more limited service will be opened.  I can revert to the Deputy with a statement to that effect from the HSE.</p></speech>

The service closed in March.  Other out-of-hours services reopened in June but the people of the north side of Cork city are still without a service in December.  I urge the Minister and the HSE to make this a priority.  Despite commitments to resolve the issue, months have passed and the situation is unchanged.  People are becoming increasingly frustrated with the fact that this is the only unit that has not reopened.  I stress the urgency of this matter and I hope the Minister can prioritise it as soon as possible.</p></speech>

If the House does not mind me going into a rabbit hole, I must ask what the timeline is for the Minister to tell us the timeline.  We do not want to know about this in January.  We want to hear about it in the D&aacute;il.  Can we hear it tomorrow?  If not tomorrow, can we have it early next week?  The idea that the timeline will be kept secret from the people of the north side of the city until the D&aacute;il reconvenes in January and the Minister has the chance to give us a timeline for a timeline is not acceptable.</p>  <p>  I heard the Minister say he has heard nothing about the centre eventually reopening with a skeleton workforce providing a skeleton service.  I advise him very strongly to put his ear very close to the ground on that.  It is a very real danger here.  That would be unacceptable to me and more importantly, to the people of the north side of the city and beyond. </p></speech>

An earlier question noted parents' frustration with long waiting lists for both assessments and therapeutic intervention.  They are waiting for admission to services like Beechpark Services.  Frustratingly, the transfer from infant services to school-going services creates another blockage.  These are sources of stress, uncertainty and fear of irretrievable loss of time.  Can a different model be considered to better deliver for parents?</p></reply>

As I said in my earlier contribution, one of my key priorities is finding a model that actually works.  Let us have one list so that when a child reaches early years education or school and needs an assessment, it is done in a timely way and an intervention can be accessed.  The intervention should follow all the way through.  Children should not age into and then age out of the catchment of early years intervention without ever accessing a service.  That is what I hope to achieve.  The &euro;7.8 million package was intended to form a basis for timely intervention. </p>  <p>  A pilot scheme was set up in community healthcare organisation, CHO, 7 as part of the school inclusion model, which envisages the provision of a certain number of therapists.  That proved very successful.  The pilot was not completed because of the Covid-19 pandemic but funding has been secured by the Department of Education to ensure that therapists are part of the education system.  When children are diagnosed and given therapy and a further follow-up is needed, services can continue until all therapy has been completed.  No child would end up on a list.  </p>  <p>  The network disability teams have been reconfigured under the HSE.  Some 91 of these teams will be geographically spread throughout the country.  They will be fully populated.  As of my most recent information, only seven team lead positions remained to be filled.  A lot of reconfiguration is going on to put speech and language therapy, occupational therapy and physiotherapy services in place.</p>  <p>  The model is coming together really well.  We now have the opportunity to work through the school inclusion model.  The network disability teams and the school and modular teams can work together so children can get the intervention they need in the appropriate setting and no appointments are missed.  This is all about intervention.  A new model is in place to allow for collaboration between education and disability services.</p></speech>

It is far less reliant on assessment.  The Minister of State mentioned the development of an assessment industry and the avoidance of the loss of a lot of very valuable time in those assessments.  Parents previously had to spend &euro;500 or &euro;600 on private assessments, which serve only as a gateway to further treatment.</p> <p>Perhaps there should be less reliance on assessment and more collective delivery of service, whereby both the resource teacher and the SNA within the school could supplement the professional therapies in order that, even between intermittent therapeutic interventions, there might be continuity for the child and less withdrawal of him or her from the group in the way these needs are handled.  I think there are in that model the seeds of a better approach than the one embedded in the HSE.  I worry that while huge money is being put into attempts to improve the HSE model, it might in its structure have elements that are not best practice and some of that money will not deliver the opportunities we hope it will.</p></speech>

The child should at all times get the necessary intervention.  We should also equip the people who spend eight hours per day in classrooms in developing the skill sets they need to support the child in his or her pathway through education.  We need to crack this nut - I used that phrase earlier - for the simple reason that there are too many lists and too many people responsible for them.  We need a clear pathway.  I see the value in the school inclusion model because we have the therapists who are dedicated to supporting the children all the way through their education as long as they need that support.  Nobody should need to time out after six weeks of speech and language therapy while waiting again and wondering whether he or she needs another assessment to continue when he or she is part of the education system.  I do not wish to speak on behalf of the education sector but I see completely the value in this.</p>  <p>  I also see the value in the 91 network disability teams, which are geographically spaced and which work in collaboration.  If children in schools need further intervention at a more complex level, the network disability teams will be able to support them.  It is all about using the resources collaboratively and together, cutting out the assessment and getting to the intervention at whatever level the child and the family need it.  The frustration of families at present is that they get letters back telling them it could be two years before their child will have his or her initial therapy.  Then the child has to get further therapy and is put on another waiting list for that.  These children are ageing out of their early years and going to secondary school without having got the other intervention they needed in the beginning.  That is where we need to get to.</p></speech>

One does not know who to ring.  I think parents have the same experience.  Who do they ring when they want to find out from one of these 91 teams where their child stands?  This is a very frustrating element and it needs to be sorted out.</p>  <p>  I welcome the Minister of State's commitment to meet the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, and her work with the Oireachtas committee.  For those of us Deputies who do not have the privilege of attending those meetings or being on the Oireachtas committee, could the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, perhaps include at least me in some of this work in order that I might get an insight into the way in which the Department sees this developing?  I would like to contribute in some way.</p></speech>

I would welcome more involvement of people with experience for the simple reason that I think we all want the one thing: we want the families to get their interventions.  We do not want lists upon lists.  I look forward to working with the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, on this.  I believe in the network disability teams, coupled with the school inclusion model so we can have just one list so that families know when their children have gone on a list.  The reason I need the school inclusion model, and I hope it will work, together with the network disability teams, is that schools operate for 38 weeks per year and that for the other weeks of the year children need to continue with their therapies in order that the network disability teams are able to support them through term time as well.</p></speech>

The National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics, NCPE, conducted a full health technology assessment of the application for the adult population and in December 2019 recommended that dupilumab be considered for reimbursement if cost-effectiveness could be improved relative to existing treatments.  The NCPE conducted a rapid review of the application for the adolescent group and in January of this year advised that a full health technology assessment was not proposed and that the drug should not be considered for reimbursement at the submitted price.</p>  <p>  Having reviewed the NCPE's recommendations, the patient group submission and the outputs of commercial negotiations, the HSE drugs group recommended that the HSE executive management team not support the reimbursement of the drug for either the adult population or the adolescent population.  On 21 August the applicant was notified of the proposed decision not to support reimbursement.  On 18 September the applicant submitted representations concerning this proposed decision.  Last month the HSE reviewed the applicant's representations and met with representatives from the company.</p>  <p>  The HSE has advised that the process is still ongoing and that the matter will be included on the agenda for the HSE drugs group's meeting in January 2021.  The HSE executive management team is the decision-making body for the reimbursement of medicines under the Health Act 2013 and will, on receipt of the outcome of the drugs group's deliberations, make the decision as to whether the drug will be reimbursed.</p></speech>

The drug is a treatment for severe eczema, which causes inflamed, dry and broken skin, which is exhausting to treat, painful and intensely itchy.  I have met many people who suffer from this unfortunate disease and many healthcare professionals who are campaigning on the issue.  While the issue is apolitical, we all get lobbied on these issues from time to time and I am very clear as to what our role is.  Equally, however, when I listen to healthcare professionals who say there is something profoundly wrong with the drug approval process in this State, and very often we find ourselves the last EU state to approve drugs, I believe it is an area we need to review on an ongoing basis.  I have asked the Oireachtas health committee to examine this and to work with Deputy Donnelly as Minister for Health.  If we can make improvements in this area while still keeping in place the apolitical process that is in place, we should consider doing so.</p></speech>

The health committee of the previous D&aacute;il spent a lot of time considering this.  The good news is that there are some amazing, life-changing and lifesaving new drugs out there.  A lot of them are so-called high-tech drugs, which are very expensive, and the HSE has been paying a lot more for such drugs.  In recent years, for example, the amount spent on the high-tech drugs alone has gone up from &euro;400 million to &euro;700 million per year, a very significant increase.  Part of the frustration for this calendar year is that there was no allocation in the service plan for new drugs.  That has been part of the reason that some of the drugs have been held up.  I say this without prejudice to this particular drug because, as the Deputy says, this is an independent assessment process.  What I can say is that I have allocated &euro;50 million for 2021 to new drugs.  I agree with the Deputy that Ireland in some cases is behind the curve and he and I have been given evidence that sometimes we are late to the party in allocating new drugs.  We are all the time trying to balance making as many of the new and exciting drugs available as possible for as many people in Ireland as possible with the very real cost constraints.  As the Deputy will be aware, negotiations take time and, in fairness to the HSE, at least in several examples I have seen, it does succeed in securing a lower unit price for the drugs which, given any budget, means we can make more and more drugs available.</p></speech>

I recently met with Professor John Crowne.  We had a good discussion on cancer care and one of the issues he raised with me was, again, these high-tech drugs to which the Minister referred in the field of cancer.  He was very supportive of and enthusiastic and excited about a lot of these new drugs.</p> <p>However, he pointed out that many of them are not available to patients in this State because, as he and many others who work in this area have observed, the unfortunate slowness of the drug approval process.  </p> <p> I wish to also raise the issue of the drug, Patisiran, which is a life-saving treatment for hereditary ATTR amyloidosis.  As the Minister will be aware, that is a disease that is peculiar to people on this island.  The drug is available in the North but it is not available to patients in the South, which is problematic.</p> <p> My point is that we can all celebrate these drugs when they come on stream.  Significant advances are being made all the time.  However, if patients cannot access the drugs in a timely manner, then we have a difficulty.  I genuinely believe it is an area in which we can make improvements.  I certainly wish to work constructively with the Minister, as does the Joint Committee on Health, to make advances in this area.</p></speech>

I had a conversation with medical oncologists just this week on access to new cancer drugs.  On the &euro;50 million that has been allocated for new drugs, although there is no set amount yet and the budget does not get sliced up per care pathway, it would be quite reasonable to think that &euro;15 million or up to one third of that &euro;50 million will end up being allocated towards some of the really exciting new drugs.  I asked the medical oncologists whether there is an opportunity for us to save money within the existing amount.  We should remember that we spend &euro;2 billion per year on drugs.  Their clear view was that there is an opportunity to make savings in biosimilars and prescribing practices.  What I would love to do is to protect the drugs budget, add the &euro;50 million to it, and find ways of reducing costs within that &euro;2 billion and reinvesting the saved money back into further drugs.  That certainly seemed to be something the medical oncologists wished to discuss further.  I will be delighted to continue the discussion with the Deputy and the joint committee on the issue.</p></speech>

The development of all aspects of mental health services nationally, including those for children and young people, remains a priority for me and the Government.  This is reflected in the current programme for Government and in the significant additional funding allocated to mental health in budget 2021.  As the Deputy will know, an additional &euro;50 million was secured, which will bring the overall budget to &euro;1.076 billion.  Of that &euro;50 million, &euro;23 million has been allocated to commence the implementation of many of the short-term recommendations of Sharing the Vision, including the expansion of CAMHS hubs.  It is expected that 148 additional staff will be recruited in 2021 by the HSE, of whom 29 will be in CAMHS.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, CAMHS admissions are prioritised by clinical need.  CHO 4 continues to take a proactive approach, with a focus on reducing CAMHS waiting times to improve access to a safe and effective service.  In the past eight months, even with Covid, much progress has been made.  The waiting list in the CHO 4 area, which covers counties Cork and Kerry, was 352 in October 2020, a reduction from 573 in October 2019.  Of those, 78 had been waiting to access CAMHS services for longer than 12 months, a reduction of 49% since January 2020.  In October 2020, 93% of all accepted referrals were offered a first appointment within 12 weeks and, of those referrals, 96% were seen within 12 weeks.  I will address the issue further in subsequent replies. </p></speech>

In terms of the figures being provided to the Department by the HSE, does the Minister of State see a significant challenge, particularly in respect of CAMHS in CHO 4 and the rest of the country?

There are currently more than 2,230 children waiting for such services.  However, in the past seven months or eight months, CHO 4 has taken a proactive approach.  Part of the waiting list, especially on the Kerry side, was associated with a key consultant vacancy.  The CHO put in place a Saturday clinic facilitated by local CAMHS consultant cover to target the waiting list.  Having spoken to the chief officer of CHO 4, which covers counties Cork and Kerry, in the past week, I can confirm it has secured a second consultant psychiatrist in CAMHS in Kerry on a temporary basis.  The CAMHS teams in Cork and Kerry are both now fully populated in terms of psychiatrists and they are working at full tilt.  We are working with them to reduce the waiting list as a matter of priority.  From what I can see, CHO 4 has always been problematic in terms of it always having quite a high number on the CAMHS waiting list.  I am adamant that I will have that waiting list reduced.</p></speech>

Is there a shortage of psychologists in CHO 4?  Is there a challenge in recruiting psychologists there?  On the issue of primary care, what is her view on how it is being rolled out to alleviate some of the stress within communities and address the enormous challenges coming down the line?</p></speech>

The waiting list is at all-time high of 10,500.  It is an issue I have inherited.  I met the Minister on this issue recently and I have met the HSE primary care team.  The team and the section of the Department that deals with mental health are aware that more than 5,000 under-18s are currently on that waiting list for more than 12 months and we are looking at a targeted intervention to reduce the waiting list next year.  A process is being put in place to see where we can get the capacity to so do.  The Deputy is correct that there are psychologist vacancies.  We are looking at a targeted approach.  I will visit Cork in January or February, Covid permitting, to meet the teams there.  Significant good work has been done, but we have to do more.</p></speech>

People who previously provided therapies and so on have been transferred to testing and tracing.  I ask the Minister to explain why it was not possible to leave those workers in their positions and hire other people to do this necessary testing and tracing work.</p></reply>

The HSE has worked intensively to put in place a comprehensive, reliable and responsive testing and tracing operation in a very short timeframe.  The redeployment of existing staff from other areas of the HSE, including front-line services as the Deputy pointed out, was an essential part of this response.</p> <p>Since the height of the pandemic there has been a significant return of staff to non-Covid front-line roles.  This has been facilitated by an ongoing recruitment process through which the HSE has recruited 675 new contact tracers and 565 swabbers to date.  Recruitment in these areas will continue until the targets of dedicated staff of 800 in contact tracing and 1,000 in swabbing are met.  This will allow the remaining redeployed staff to return to their original roles.</p> <p> I have been informed that there are 411 staff currently redeployed to swabbing operations, made up of both healthcare workers and non-patient-facing administrative and management staff.  Of the staff currently redeployed to contact tracing, none is from patient-focused roles.  Areas such as complex contact tracing will continue to require some level of redeployed community staff.  Where these staff remain in Covid-19 services, it is intended that their substantive posts will be back-filled.  While we remain cognisant of the potential for future demands associated with surges in Covid-19 transmission, the aim is to return redeployed staff to their substantive posts as soon as possible and to ensure that posts are back-filled when this is not possible.  I have asked the HSE to expedite this process.  At the end of September, I also announced plans to double the workforce in our public health departments by hiring more public health doctors, public health nurses, scientists and support staff.  That hiring process has commenced.</p></speech>

How many are involved in the routine tracing that was being done, for example, by Army personnel and so forth and, therefore, can be done by competent people who are not necessarily required to have a medical background?  I understand the people who carry out the test do not need that background either.  It appears the HSE has a total inability to recruit speedily.  It is difficult to understand how it took so long to replace necessary HSE staff with people recruited for this purpose.  Can the Minister explain how long it takes the HSE to make an appointment from the day it receives an application for a job?  What are the processes that take such a long time for such a clearly defined purpose?</p></speech>

They have all been redeployed.  There is a current workforce of 736 in swabbing.  Of those, 411 are redeployed staff.  That combines both the therapists we are discussing and those with non-patient-facing roles.  From memory, and I am open to correction, I received a report ten to 14 days ago that the number of therapy grades in swabbing was at 279, but I will revert to the Deputy with the most up-to-date figure on that.</p>  <p>  I have engaged repeatedly with the HSE.  We should remember that the HSE, to its credit, has created from a standing start one of the most comprehensive testing and tracing regimes anywhere in the western world.  That required pulling in therapists.  I agree with the Deputy, and the HSE is cognisant of getting the therapists back to their front-line roles as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

That means 500 of the staff are not therapists.  It also means that if there had been quicker recruitment, and there is a massive number of well-qualified and competent people who are unemployed because of Covid-19, the therapists could have been allowed back into their jobs.  Can the Minister give an estimate of the increase in the waiting lists for many types of therapy that has occurred due to the fact that there has been a long, non-crisis redeployment?  I can understand that during the first lockdown, the HSE had to do something fast.  However, I do not understand why, at the end of the year, we still have over 200 therapists involved in swabbing.  I would be interested to get some idea as to why it was not possible to employ non-therapy people.  Can the Minister give an indication of the effect this has had on various waiting lists in the community healthcare organisations, CHOs, around the country?</p></speech>

The HSE has pointed out repeatedly that while it is redeploying and is back-filling posts as fast as it can, it is a difficult recruiting environment generally.  It has also said that the swabbing centres and swabbing service are a serious clinical activity.  It has people there who are managing teams.  These are experienced clinicians and it is simply not possible to remove all that clinical and therapy experience and all the experience of people who have been involved from the start and have a stand-alone service.  There has to be continuity and senior clinical supervision, and the HSE is maintaining that.  However, it has committed to redeploying as fast as possible but also as fast as is appropriate to maintain the safety and quality standards in swabbing.</p>  <p>  I fully agree with the Deputy that there is a cost to these therapists not being in their front-line roles.  We have testimony from people across Ireland, particularly children, who have not been able to get the access they normally would get because of this.  Unfortunately, one of the things we must deal with in the HSE and the healthcare system during the Covid pandemic is the same system, essentially, having to fulfil both roles.  We must fight Covid-19, and Ireland is doing very well by international standards in that fight, and we must run the full healthcare system at the same time and try to alleviate issues such as the trolley crisis, which we experienced in previous years.</p></speech>

This was due to redeployment of staff, including senior nurses who would ordinarily be supervising the students.  There was a particularly high rate of absenteeism and the HSE&rsquo;s directors of nursing said they could not ensure clinical placements were protected.  There were fears hospitals could be overrun.  At the time, there were up to 900 Covid patients in hospitals.  Thankfully, the situation has improved.  As of Sunday, 6 December, there were 232 Covid patients in hospital.</p><p>In April, students were offered healthcare assistant, HCA, contracts to work and contribute to the national effort.  Approximately 1,350 of the 3,200 first to third year students took up HCA roles and contributed to the national effort.  All fourth year students were also paid at the HCA pay rate.  Given that working as a healthcare assistant does not provide student nurses and midwives with the structured educational outcomes that are part of a graduate programme, it was important to have the students revert to their educational placements as quickly as possible.  The HSE&rsquo;s directors of nursing have said that all student placements have now fully resumed.<b></b>It is imperative that educational placements are protected for education.  Payment at the HCA rate was made during the first Covid wave solely because the student nurses were working as HCAs.</p><p>We do not want the student nurses and midwives working as healthcare assistants, but to be full-time students on educational placements.  The colleges, which have primary responsibility for these students, have not contacted me or the Department of Education to seek payment for them as healthcare assistants.  In fact, I understand that the colleges, which are fully responsible for the students' education, are firmly of the view that these placements are clinical education placements and must be protected as such.</p></speech>

If anything can emerge from this situation, particularly in terms of the review, it is how student nurses and nurses are treated.  They are extremely dedicated to their vocation.  The last nine months have been unbelievably challenging, not only for the student nurses and their families but the people that they care for.  I hope the review will identify a number of issues.  I was a healthcare assistant for a long time prior to being elected so I understand about student nurses being on placement and that it is an educational environment, but it is also an environment where the healthcare assistants do a significant amount of work and they should be compensated and remunerated for that.  The retention of nurses is so important in this environment.  When nurses graduate, they want to stay in this country.  They are so proud of their job, but they will not stay here if they are constantly exploited and not respected.</p></speech>

That statement is simply not true.  The reality is that student nurses are plugging the gaps in a health system that is under severe pressure.  Student nurses do amazing work.  The T&aacute;naiste has worked in hospitals and I am sure he has seen that at first hand.</p><p>The Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, is crystal clear on the issue.  It notes that it is no use pitting nurses against nurses, whether they are in training or not.  Phil N&iacute; Sheaghdha, the INMO general secretary, recently stated:</p> <blockquote> 	Our students are being taken for granted. They are facing huge workloads and risking Covid infection. And while they are doing indispensable work, they are getting no financial recognition for their efforts. </blockquote>  <p>She went on to state:</p> <blockquote> 	Extra work, serious risk, and other sources of income being cut: student nurses and midwives are getting a raw deal. It is beyond time to respect their contribution and pay them. The message is simple: stop exploiting student nurses and midwives. </blockquote>  <p>The T&aacute;naiste can see that the INMO is very clear on this issue.  It is not nurses who are exploiting nurses, they are being exploited by the system.</p><p>The Taoiseach also said that he wanted examples of student nurses performing specific duties.  Let me recount one of the many examples that we in Sinn F&eacute;in have received from student nurses in recent days.  One nurse, Marie, contacted us to say:</p> <blockquote> 	As a first-year nurse, I would work all morning getting patients washed, showered and dressed alone, as there was often no healthcare assistants.  Then I had to record vital signs for a whole ward, which was usually up to 30 patients.<br /><br />In second year I remember one specific time, after a patient of ours sadly passed away, we had to get the patient ready for the family to see them.  I washed the patient with the nurse, cleaned his face, dressed him in a new gown and lay him out comfortably so he looked peaceful and ready for his family.  That was my first time of many doing that.  I carried on with the rest of my day, caring for other patients.  I drove home that night in silence.  </blockquote>  <p>Marie goes on to say:</p> <blockquote> 	I remember in third year dealing with a patient who had a major haemorrhage on the general medical ward, that was waiting for a bed to open in ICU.  The patient went into cardiac arrest.  I ran for the crash cart.  I alerted the nurse's station to call the cardiac team and I did chest compressions to try and keep the patient alive.  The patient, unfortunately, died.  I drove home in silence that night and couldn't talk to my mother. </blockquote>  <p>Is any of that not real work?  That is what student nurses are asking.  In particular, they are asking that of the Taoiseach following the comments he made.</p><p>The Taoiseach indicated that a review is under way.  I had a look back at the replies given by the Minister for Health to questions on this issue.  In October, he responded to a parliamentary question by stating that the review would be concluded in the coming days.  It is now the middle of December.  Why has it taken so long for this issue to be addressed?  It is one that must be addressed.</p><p>If any additional payments are to be made to student nurses and midwives, will they be backdated to the beginning of the new academic year?  Could the T&aacute;naiste respond to the student nurses who may be watching, to other nurses on the wards and to the people who genuinely believe that this exploitation of student nurses must come to an end?  Will the Government reverse its decision and ensure that they are properly remunerated?</p></speech>

From my time working in the public health service and as Minister for Health, I am very aware of the contribution student nurses and midwives make to the health service.  I am also aware of the limitations regarding what a student can do and provide in the health service, whether it is a therapy student, a nursing student, a medical student or any other student.</p>  <p>  There has been a lot of debate on this issue in the past week or so but there have not been as many facts as there ought to have been, so let me set out five facts of which we ought to be aware.  The motion in the D&aacute;il last week was party politics.  It was non-binding.  It was unfunded.  If it had passed, it would not have been worth a single euro to a single student nurse.  It was designed to make the Government look bad, the Opposition look good and do nothing at all for student nurses.  Public pay is not voted on in the D&aacute;il, ever.  Public pay is negotiated between the Government and trade unions and negotiations are now under way on the next pay deal.</p>  <p>  Student nurses are paid for their fourth year, for 32 weeks, and they are counted as part of the staff.  In the first wave of the pandemic, with the then Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, and I, as Taoiseach, took a decision to take on student nurses in the early years of their course as healthcare assistants.  We did so because we thought the hospitals might be overwhelmed on foot of the surge we were anticipating.  Thankfully, that surge never happened, but it was still the right decision to take them on as healthcare assistants.  That was only ever supposed to be on a temporary basis and we said so at the time.  We have provided the pandemic unemployment payment to student nurses who worked as healthcare assistants in nursing homes and who had to give up those jobs because we asked them not to be in two clinical settings.  The pandemic unemployment payment is being paid.</p>  <p>  Student nurses who are in years 1, 2 and 3, like all other students on degree courses, are not paid.  They spend a lot of time in lectures, laboratories and libraries and on supervised work experience or placements.  When one pursues a degree course, it is not the norm to be paid for that.  This is a degree course now; it is not an apprenticeship or a cadetship.  That is a very different and older model.  We decided we wanted to move away from that model 20 years ago after the Commission on Nursing reported.  However, I do think that student nurses should be paid where they are acting up, filling in for staff nurses or doing the work of staff nurses because wards or clinical areas are understaffed.  That does happen in education, for example, where students are doing the higher diploma in education, HDip.  Student teachers do not get paid for their work experience, but they are sometimes paid when they supervise or take over for a teacher who is absent.  In those circumstances, it is right that student nurses should be paid for the work they do.  That includes those in first, second and third year.</p>  <p>  This is an issue on which the Government is engaging and we want to continue to engage on it.  We will speak to the INMO and SIPTU's health division about this.  As Deputy Doherty stated, a review of allowances is under way.  As is always the case, matters of public pay will be negotiated between the Government, on the one hand, and the unions, on the other.  That is how it is done.  That is how we all want it to be done.  It is the best way to do it.  It is not based on a motion in the D&aacute;il.  That is just pure politics.</p></speech>

The T&aacute;naiste's coalition party in government put out a statement on its Facebook page suggesting that student nurses are not involved in real work.  It was very hurtful.  Many student nurses have contacted Deputies across the Chamber, particularly those in opposition, to outline the real work that they do in hospital wards.</p> <p>Other staff nurses have also contacted us, along with doctors and consultants, as I raised with the T&aacute;naiste last week, and they acknowledge that if it was not for the student nurses, the system would simply collapse because it is under severe pressure.</p> <p> Last week, a motion was brought forward by Teachta&iacute; D&aacute;la, messengers of the people, and they carried a clear message to this Parliament that the public wants to make sure that our student nurses, who have stepped into the breach in the middle of a pandemic and put themselves and their families at risk, should be rewarded, and should not be expected to staff our wards during this pandemic and be paid nothing for it.  That is what was contained in the motion put forward by Teachta&iacute; D&aacute;la.  The Government proposed an amendment that gave no commitment to paying student nurses for the work they have done.</p> <p> This is a political issue because the Government has decided to turn its face against it.  The Government is now coming under sustained pressure.  We will not give up until student nurses are properly remunerated for the work they have done.  The Government should hear the calls loud and clear from the public right across the State that they fully back the student nurses in this demand.</p></speech>

I set down five facts and the Deputy questioned none of them.  The way he spoke almost implied that he was talking about a Sinn F&eacute;in motion but it was not.  It came from People Before Profit and Sinn F&eacute;in had little or no role in it but it is trying to take over the issue for political gain.</p>  <p>  As I mentioned, the vote last week was on a non-binding and unfunded motion.  Had it passed, it would not have been worth a euro to a single student nurse.  Public pay is negotiated between the Government and unions.  That is the way it is done and that is the way it should be done.  Student nurses are paid for their fourth year.  We paid student nurses in their first, second and third years during the pandemic as healthcare assistants because we thought hospitals might be overwhelmed.  Thankfully, they were not and they are not now.  We pay the pandemic unemployment payment to student nurses who were asked to give up jobs in nursing homes.</p>  <p>  It is not the norm for people doing a degree course to be paid for their years as students.  It is the case for apprentices and cadets but not for people doing a degree course.</p></speech>

In this country, everybody is anxiously awaiting tomorrow's Government announcement on the proposed roll-out of the vaccine.  Last Tuesday, the Minister for Health released the first report on the proposed priority groupings for the vaccine.  I note the list is referred to as a provisional list so I hope it means there is potential to make changes to the list.  I want to make a case for that now.  This relates to people with underlying health conditions.  We know from analysis done on cases in terms of mortality, admission to hospital and admission to intensive care units that having one or more underlying health condition is a very significant factor.  For that reason, it was quite surprising and disappointing that on the list of 14 cohorts of people, people with underlying conditions in their late 60s are fifth and adults with health conditions under 65 are seventh.  It is very hard to understand why those cohorts are so far down the list.  The T&aacute;naiste should explain that to us and I hope the Government can revisit the list.</p>  <p>  I am particularly concerned about the final cohort, which is the 14th grouping, and these are due to get the vaccine last.  These are people under 18.  I want to make the case for the very many people under 18 in this country who have serious underlying health conditions.  I take the point that the vaccines have not been tested on children under 12 but I am talking about teenagers, or those aged between 12 and 18.  A significant number of teenagers in this country have serious underlying health conditions.  I spoke to the mother of one of them this morning, a 17-year-old girl who is a transplant recipient.  Her mother explained what an awful year she has had since last March, when she had to cocoon, and how her life has been so drastically affected.  Just yesterday the House discussed the mental health effects on young people in particular but this is especially pertinent in the case of young people with serious health conditions, as the impact is multiplied several times over.  In this girl's case, her 19-year-old sister had to move out of the home because of the high risk involved.  The girl is being homeschooled and this is having a major impact on her mental well-being.</p>  <p>  It was a terrible blow to people in such circumstances to hear that they are last on the list of people to get the vaccine.  I earnestly appeal to the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health to please consider those categories of people who have had such a difficult time and bring them up the list to ensure they are early recipients of the vaccine.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-12-10a.257" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="12:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020121000022#U01100"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising this important matter.  She made a valid case that must be listened to.  The task force report on the deployment and administration of the vaccine is expected to be completed tomorrow and it will go to the Cabinet on Tuesday.</p>  <p>  Last Tuesday, the Cabinet approved the prioritisation of the vaccine, including which groups will receive it first and last.  That was based on advice from the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, and the national immunisation advisory committee.  It is based on medical and scientific advice and we did not make any modifications to it.  We accepted it as it was presented to us, starting with the highest-risk group, which we all accept that comprises people aged over 65 in nursing homes, before moving to healthcare workers in direct contact with patients.  We all know the reasons for that.  It then moves to other groups.</p>  <p>  This is not set in stone and can evolve as new information emerges and we learn more about the virus and vaccines.  As more vaccines are approved, the list may need to be modified.  We expect one vaccine from Pfizer BioNTech to be approved within weeks but, within months, six could be approved and they will not be same.  They will have different characteristics and profiles, and we may need to modify the advice in respect of that.</p>  <p>  There are two reasons the last group comprises people under 18 and pregnant women.  The number of people under 18 or pregnant women who have become very sick or died as a result of this virus is very low and such people are in the safest group in that sense.  There is also the obvious reason that not many children or pregnant women have been involved in the clinical trials.  People engage in clinical trials voluntarily and not many people would offer a well child or themselves if they are pregnant unless there was a particular reason to participate.  It is not that we think it is unsafe at all for children or pregnant women; it is just that it is not often that children and pregnant women are involved in trials for a new vaccine or medicine.</p>  <p>  The Deputy's case that older teenagers with an underlying medical disease may be a high-risk group is valid and should be considered.  I will certainly take it up with the Chief Medical Officer, CMO, the next time I see him, which will probably be next week.</p></speech>

It was suggested there would be an announcement by the Cabinet tomorrow but I note the T&aacute;naiste's indication that it will be next Tuesday.  I hope this allows time for the Cabinet to reconsider the matter.</p>  <p>  I am not making the case for everybody under 18 to be brought up the priority list at all but I refer to a particular category of people under 18 - teenagers - in this very difficult position.  I very much appreciate that the T&aacute;naiste will discuss this with NPHET and reconsider the matter because it has been desperately hard.  It is hard for young people with an underlying health condition.  The past year has been appalling and it has had a major impact on them.  I ask that the Government also considers raising up the list the other group of people with underlying health conditions who are under 65.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach is in Brussels on other business and it is unlikely that we will be able to convene a Cabinet meeting.  We believe the report should be seen and approved by Cabinet so it may be Tuesday before it is published.  However, that has not been decided yet.  The report does not deal with prioritisation, which is a separate matter that has been decided based on the advice of scientists and doctors.  As I said earlier, it is not set in stone and it can evolve.  The case Deputy Shortall makes for people who have chronic diseases and who are at risk, even those in their teenage years, needs to be considered.  I will certainly raise that with the CMO next week.</p></speech>

On 27 April, I raised this with the T&aacute;naiste.  I raised it in the House again on 1 July, 11 August and in September, October and November.  At 7.20 p.m. on Sunday last, I got an email from Ms Barbara Murphy indicating that the HSE was considering reopening the hospital subject to the building being okay.  That was the first time there was any question mark about the building.  What kind of deceitful untruths - I would use a stronger term if I was allowed - were given to us?  Councillor Kieran Bourke, a hard-working councillor who has worked on behalf of the town for years, as well as members of his family before him, came to Dublin and met the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, who promised him that the hospital would be reopened.  I had commitments from the previous Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, and from the current Minister that it would be reopened.</p>  <p>  A hard-working local committee has been seeking to make sure that the hospital is reopened.  The local community in Carrick-on-Suir, as well as the people of south Kilkenny, east Waterford and south Tipperary have raised funds to provide three hospice beds in the hospital.  All of the staff in the hospital were exceptional, including the caterers, nurses and members of the palliative care team.  There are only two other hospice beds in south Tipperary.  These are located  at a wonderful facility in Clogheen, 30 miles from Carrick-on-Suir.  Where are people supposed to go?  Is it a case of to hell or to Connaught?</p>  <p>  It is outrageous that the HSE and the Department of Health could treat people like this.  They are having a meeting this evening with local Deputies to tell us about it.  We have replies in writing from them but we cannot believe a word they tell us.  What a shameful way to behave.  They closed the hospital under the auspices of Covid-19 initially, saying that they needed it and we accepted that.  I do not think any patient went there for Covid step-down care but a huge number of patients have been denied step-down and recovery time because the hospital is closed to them.  I know of patients who could not get access to the hospital and they died at home, supported by the hospice in Tipperary, which is excellent.  This is shocking.</p>  <p>  The hospital has been in Carrick-on-Suir since 1835 or 1840 and has served generations.  Many townspeople were born in the hospital.  The HSE and the Department should not treat people like this.  There is a new primary care centre in front of the hospital which cost &euro;10 million.  Less than 50% of that centre is occupied but the HSE is telling us that it wants St. Brigid's hospital for community care.  This is deceit and a blackguarding of the people of Carrick-on-Suir and surrounding districts.  It will not be accepted by me, by the people on the hard-working committee to which I refer, namely, Ms Catherine Foley and Mr. Eddie Reade, or by Councillor Kieran Bourke, who met the Minister.  What kind of politics or democratic system do we have when a Minister can tell a councillor, in writing and to his face, that a hospital will reopen and then he learns, summarily, that it is to close?  Who is in charge of the HSE?  It has too much power and has done so much damage.  It was not fit to handle the Covid crisis and is not fit to handle anything.  We lost Tipperary Community Hospital in 1987.  We lost St. Michael's mental health beds under the so-called A Vision for Change but got nothing in return.  We are lucky to have saved Clogheen and thanks are due to former councillor Mr. Con Donovan for that.</p>  <p>  When we had health boards, we had accountability.  Shockingly, there is no accountability in the HSE or the Department of Health regarding the money that has been spent on St. Brigid's.  There is a new lift in the hospital.  The Minister of State, Deputy Butler, told me yesterday that there are no showers upstairs. but there are.  The HSE and the Department are using HIQA now.  They wheel out the vehicle of HIQA, which is not fit for purpose either, when they want to do damage, destroy a community and destroy a wonderful facility that is badly needed and that was fought for by the people.  This will have far-reaching repercussions.  We want the hospital kept open.  This decision must be reversed immediately.</p></speech>

St. Brigid's hospital is a short-stay unit with 16 beds, including three palliative, two respite and 11 convalescent beds.  The HSE-operated activity at the hospital and the design and layout of the building are largely reflective of a small hospital from the time period in which it was built, namely, 1837.  In March, admissions were suspended and the hospital was designated as a Covid-19 step-down facility.  Arrangements were put in place for patients requiring convalescent, emergency respite and palliative care to be accommodated elsewhere in the HSE's services in south Tipperary.</p>  <p>  With regard to St. Brigid's hospital and its infrastructure, having considered the current infection control advice, it is with regret that the decision has been made to discontinue short-stay services at St. Brigid's in Carrick-on-Suir.  Unfortunately, I am advised by the HSE that it is no longer feasible nor sustainable to continue to operate St. Brigid's as a district hospital given the layout of the premises, the narrow hallways, inadequate space, the facilities available in the two five-bed wards and the risk of cross-infection.  It is now proposed to use the premises as a base for the newly-created community healthcare network, CHN, in south Tipperary, along with serving as a base for members of a chronic disease management team, with a particular focus on diabetes.  It is ideally located adjacent to the primary care centre and co-location of these buildings will enable integrated and multidisciplinary working.  The repurposing of St. Brigid's will provide the HSE with the opportunity to develop community healthcare services in south Tipperary for the better, with a particular focus on the management of chronic diseases like diabetes.</p></speech>

It is waffle from the HSE.  Why were we not told that in the email that I received last Sunday evening?  The wonderful staff that were there have been deployed elsewhere because of Covid.  They put their shoulders to the wheel in the belief that they would be sent back to St. Brigid's.  The building might be old but it is in pristine condition, with a new wing added for the hospice some years ago.  This building will still be standing when many of the prefabs and quick-build units the HSE is putting up are rotten and decaying.  We want the people of Carrick-on-Suir to be able to use it.  They are a proud people but they have gotten nothing but kicks from this Government.  There are no factories and no support but they are not accepting this.  I spoke to Ms Catherine Foley this morning who will be pushing a bed to Dublin next week, all the way from Carrick-on-Suir.  She is one of the activists in the town and is a non-political person.  Councillor Kieran Bourke will be fighting, might and main, as will I because this is wrong.  Why did the T&aacute;naiste stand up and read out balderdash from the HSE?  He is supposed to be in charge, along with the Taoiseach.  This is being hived off and HIQA is being blamed.  HIQA is not fit for purpose.  It gets wheeled out when the Government wants to do something disastrous.  The dishonesty and deceit that has been perpetrated on public representatives and the people is shameful and that is why politics is the way it is in this country.  All the Government wants is big jobs and powerful positions and to hell with the little people but the little people will rise up in the spirit of C.J. Kickham of Tipperary and will not accept this from the so-called coalition.</p></speech>

We all recognise his stature.</p>  <p>  On the questions raised, I am advised by the Minister and the Minister of State that there are currently no residents or patients in the hospital.  They are all being catered for elsewhere in higher-quality, more modern accommodation.  The staff have been redeployed and there have been no job losses.  Following some minor works, seven whole-time equivalent staff members will initially be based at St. Brigid's, including a CHN network manager, an assistant director of public health nursing, a clinical nurse specialist in diabetes, a senior dietician, a staff dietician and two administrative staff.  A podiatrist will also be providing in-reach services at St. Brigid's hospital.  While it is regrettable that it is no longer feasible or sustainable to continue to operate St. Brigid's as a district hospital in the way it operated in the past, as part of the modernisation of our healthcare service, this building will be repurposed to provide chronic disease management and better diabetes care for many more people than are currently receiving it in south Tipperary and the south east more generally.  Overall, this will represent an improvement in healthcare services in the area.</p></speech>

On Monday, the results of this survey were published.  They point to a truly awful situation, with 31% of Irish Traveller households and 28% of Traveller children living in acute poverty.  The rate of poverty here is the highest across the six nations surveyed.  One in ten Travellers are in households where at least one person went to bed hungry in the past year.  A full 65% experienced discrimination, again one of the highest levels in the six countries studied.  The survey found that 70% of Travellers aged between 18 and 24 were not in further education and just 17% of women and 13% of men were in employment, mainly in part-time or precarious jobs.</p> <p>This is an indictment of a society with what can only be called racist attitudes towards Travellers and Roma.  It is an indictment of a State that has failed 7% of its population and of the political parties that have dominated government and local authorities since the foundation of the State.  The treatment of Irish Travellers can be compared to the scandalous and inhumane treatment of women and children incarcerated in mother and baby homes and industrial schools.  At the very least, they are entitled to an apology from Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael and a clear and precise condemnation of those politicians who, if not fostering it, are accommodating anti-Traveller bias.</p> <p> This is particularly the case in the appalling record of local authorities in providing Traveller accommodation.  On Monday morning, in response to this survey, Mr. Michael Collins of Pavee Point said that &euro;69 million of funding for Traveller accommodation has not been drawn down since 2000.  At least 45% of the funding for this year has not been drawn down by local authorities.  While the Travelling community make up 7% of our population, some 15% of that community are homeless.  The facts speak for themselves.  Local authorities are not prepared to stand up to anti-Traveller sentiment.  The issue needs to be taken out of their hands.  We need a central government agency to take on this key question and to deliver.  I will support this issue in the Joint Committee on Key Issues affecting the Traveller Community.</p> <p> I repeat my call for the T&aacute;naiste to give an apology to the Travelling community for the fact that this is still happening three years after 1 March 2017, when Traveller ethnicity was recognised.  I also call for serious action to tackle the multitude of issues the survey has identified.</p></speech>

It certainly rings true for me, given my experience, and I am sure it rings true for many in this House.  There can be no doubt that Irish Travellers have, for generations, faced a huge degree of disadvantage and discrimination solely by reason and virtue of their birth.  They have suffered discrimination in employment and in housing.  This is reflected in higher levels of poverty and lower levels of educational attainment.</p>  <p>  I do not think it is fair, however, to say that no action has been taken or that Government has done nothing in recent years.  I am proud to have been a member of the Government that took the decision to recognise Traveller identity and ethnicity three years ago.  That was not done by a party of the left or a different government but the Government led by my party, Fine Gael, alongside the Labour Party.  We have also announced some changes in the way in which Traveller housing funds are to work.  These were announced by the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, only the other day in acknowledgement of the fact that local authorities perform very poorly indeed in providing Traveller accommodation.  The Minister has indicated that the system is going to change.  Instead of money not being drawn down every year, as it often is not, a new system is to be put in place which will make sure that more Traveller-specific accommodation is provided in the years ahead.</p>  <p>  A lot is also being done to ensure a greater focus on Traveller and Roma health and on providing educational opportunities for people from the Travelling community.  While the numbers may be small, it is good to see more and more Travellers finishing secondary school, making it to third level and availing of those educational opportunities.</p></speech>

Some 73% of Travellers surveyed said that they had experienced housing discrimination.  Professor O'Flaherty has said that "EU-wide Roma and Travellers are experiencing a perfect storm of fundamental rights deprivation and challenge" and that the findings of the survey pointed to a "profound underachievement of strategies".  In some ways, the T&aacute;naiste has made my case.  There have been reports, submissions and recommendations with regard to the Travelling community but very little has been implemented.  He is right that some areas, such as public health units for Travellers, have improved a bit, but not to the level they should have.  The fact that this report indicates that Ireland is probably the worst in all areas is a damning indictment of the State and its attitude towards the Travelling and Roma communities for decades.</p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste has not given an apology.  I expected one.  I will continue to pursue such an apology from both Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael now and in the Joint Committee on Key Issues affecting the Traveller Community.  The fish rots from the head.  Unless we get leadership from the top, we will not get change at the bottom.  That has to change.</p></speech>

I absolutely appreciate that much more needs to be done and that the progress made in recent years has been inadequate.  There are many different reasons for this.  It is a bit simplistic and populist to just blame it on the Government.  The discrimination Travellers face in our society is deeply ingrained and there are a lot of reasons for it.  It is wrong, however, and it is the duty of Government to respond to it.</p></speech>

The news with regard to the Irish protocol in the last 48 hours is very welcome.  We should not have been forced into that position but it is good that the issue has been resolved.  The outstanding issues with regard to the future trade arrangements are still to be resolved.  The T&aacute;naiste said yesterday that he believed Boris Johnson would make the necessary concessions.  Does he still hold that view?  Can he give us any more insight as to where he thinks things stand in advance of the Sunday deadline?</p></speech>

It is the coming to fruition and the outcome of the agreement we made with the then Prime Minister, Theresa May, three years ago.  I said at the time that it was bulletproof, and it turned out to be bullet proof.  Some people doubted that at the time but it has now proven to be so.  All that was promised, including that there would be no hard border between North and South and that the common travel area between Ireland and Britain would be maintained, has been done and is being honoured by the UK, the EU and Ireland.</p>  <p>  I do not have any read-out on the dinner last night.  I was not there and those who were have kept what transpired close to themselves.  It is impossible for me to comment on it but I can say that they did at least agree that it was worth continuing the talks.  The talks will continue at least until Sunday.  As is always the case in negotiations such as this, a bit of compromise from both sides is required.  Final decisions can only be made by the principals, in this case Prime Minister Johnson and President von der Leyen.  I hope we will see a positive outcome.</p></speech>

I take great interest in health issues but, in my time in politics, I have rarely seen an issue on which people have been misled so much.  The Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, gave a commitment to Deputy Cahill that it would reopen in July.  A number of commitments were given to all public representatives.  I also have correspondence from July.  Up until recently, we understood from our conversations with the HSE that it was to reopen.  This is a very sensitive matter in that county for palliative care and respite.  The idea that we will just purchase beds in other areas is not on.  It is also not on that the HSE, the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, and the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, would treat public representatives in a way whereby until literally hours or days ago we were being totally misled.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste to look into this.  How all of a sudden is this facility being closed despite assurances being given to members of the T&aacute;naiste's own party and Government that it would reopen?</p></speech>

I am advised that it cannot reopen as a district hospital because the infrastructure is too old and inadequate in the modern age, particularly now that the issue of infection control will be so important.  However, it will be reopened as a community healthcare facility, improving services in the area, particularly for those with chronic diseases like diabetes.</p></speech>

Despite it being a semi-State body, the State seems to abdicate all responsibility to Irish Water.  I recently asked Irish Water who is responsible and it informed me that at the end of the day, the State is.  Some urgent issues have gone unaddressed for years.  Shannonvale has a green space that used to be the heart of the village but now it is unsafe and unusable because of a treatment plant that floods the area consistently.  In Belgooly, malodours from the waste water treatment plant are so bad, people have to keep their windows closed.  Many people want to move from there, but the value of their homes has decreased as a result.</p>  <p>  The Glengarriff road in Bantry, the gateway to the Wild Atlantic Way and the main road into tourism town of the year, is so bad it is damaging cars but road works cannot go ahead until Irish Water completes its works first.  None of these projects are on its capital investment programme, meaning they simply will not be done.  At what point will the State intervene?</p></speech>

I will certainly inform the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, that the Deputy raised them in the Chamber today.  I will see if he can provide a written response as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  Next year Irish Water will get a significant increase in its capital budget, giving it more resources to invest.  That does not mean that every project that needs to be done can be done next year or the following year, but it means that more of them can be done.</p></speech>

The T&aacute;naiste should not try to obfuscate.  In doing that, the Government betrayed the programme for Government commitment, specifically to return the support of healthcare workers who protected us all.  The Government then made the decision to take away the healthcare assistant rate that it had been forced to give them in the early period of the pandemic.</p>  <p>  The Government persists in compounding this dishonesty with claims, such as the one today that most student nurses across Europe do not get paid.  I will give the example of Germany so that we can get some facts on the record.  In Germany for the degree course, first year students get paid &euro;750 to &euro;800 a month, second year students get &euro;800 to &euro;900 a month and third year students get &euro;930 to &euro;1,030 a month with no fees.  Why can we not do what they do in Germany for student nurses and midwives?  Why does the Government not stop the spin to deflect away from what it did last week?</p></speech>

Brexit. </blockquote>  <p>Our fishing industry in Killybegs, Howth, Castletownbere, Dunmore, Kilmore and Duncannon are all waiting with bated breath for news on a deal.

We will do all we can to protect our fishing industry and our fishing communities around the country.  As Deputies are aware, negotiations are still under way between the European Union and the United Kingdom.  Among the issues still being discussed is the issue of fishing rights from 1 January onwards.  We are in a difficult position.  The United Kingdom has left the European Union and in doing so it takes its waters with it.  Up to now, we have been catching about 35% of our fish in UK waters and that may not be open to us in future.  We are doing our best in the circumstances to retain access to as much of those waters as possible.</p></speech>

The Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science has given no instruction to the colleges to return.

They are now being asked to pay for the next semester from January onwards.  It is very unfair.  Mol an &oacute;ige agus tiocfaidh s&iacute;.  We need to look after our young people.  Other Deputies mentioned student nurses.  This is shocking.  They had a traumatic enough time in the past year and they face further uncertainty next year.  Their families need to get some come-back on this funding.  The private providers will not help out either.  They are just taking the money.  Students are at home, sometimes struggling to study from home, and not living in the rented accommodation.  It is certainly very unfair.</p></speech>

I have received several phone calls about the lack of guidance over stage schools in level 3.  Some gymnastics clubs and drama classes state that they can open, but it looks like they are using the previous level 3 guidelines.  The new guidelines state clearly that no organised indoor gathering should take place and that for outdoor sports, it is individual training only.  This means, for example, no dance classes, ballet, gymnastics, basketball, racquetball, squash, Zumba or drama.  Gyms, leisure centres and swimming pools can open for individual use only.  This does not include other leisure facilities.</p>  <p>  This is very frustrating for schools that have essentially remained closed since March.  It is frustrating when their teachers are being asked to go to school to teach dancing, which is absolutely wrong when the same children cannot attend their weekly dance and drama classes.  I ask for clear guidance on this because there has been considerable confusion about level 3.  Even though we are glad to have the shops open, it is important.</p></speech>

The Minister of State went on to say &quot;That work, which is detailed and complex&quot; was underway, and the Minister for Health sent me a letter to the same effect the other day.</p><p>In <i>The Southern Star</i>, my local newspaper, this morning the Fine Gael Senator Tim Lombard, stated my call for clarity on the scheme and its continuation was grossly irresponsible and that I was scaremongering, that Fine Gael had secured a deal last year and that he had no doubt that deal meant things would continue as before for everyone seeking surgery abroad.  The Taoiseach, the Minister for Health and the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, were unable to announce any new cross-Border deal in the last two weeks.  Can the T&aacute;naiste explain the new cross-Border scheme to which Senator Lombard has referred? </p></speech>

I can say that the cross-Border directive ceases to apply to Northern Ireland and Great Britain when those areas leave the European Union on 1 January.  It will continue to apply for people travelling to other parts of the European Union, but we are trying to put alternative arrangements in place to maintain the status quo when it comes to cross-border healthcare.  Existing arrangements which see people, for example, in Donegal using Altnagelvin Hospital for cancer or cardiology services and people from Northern Ireland using Dublin hospitals for cardiothoracic surgery, will all remain in place.</p>  <p>  We will provide a scheme for residents of Northern Ireland which will be the same as the European Health Insurance Card, EHIC, scheme.  People living in Britain will no longer be eligible for EHIC, which is the new version of the old E111 form, but residents of Northern Ireland will still have it and we will fund that from the Irish Exchequer.  It seems that under the common travel area, CTA, arrangements that Irish citizens in Northern Ireland and Britain, and vice versa, will continue to be able to avail of each other's health services, but that might not apply to people resident in one jurisdiction travelling to a private hospital in the other jurisdiction.  I think that is the question which the Deputy is asking and that has not been worked out yet I am afraid.</p></speech>

This seemed to be working well initially.  However, there has been a recent significant deterioration in air quality, as evidenced by the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, monitoring stations.  Those stations confirmed that there was widespread pollution between 16 and 30 November from the burning of non-smokeless fuels or smoky coal.  One coal merchant told me that he is doing everything right.  He is paying his taxes, including his carbon taxes and VAT, he is only selling the correct fuel in the right area, certified by the EPA, and he is employing several people.  He is in danger of losing everything, however, because people are selling coal, which is not certified by the EPA, cheaper than he can buy it.  That coal is being sold door-to-door at night from vans.  I asked the local authority about enforcement, but I have been told it has not been given any additional resources to deal with this issue, and it is not able to do so.  More needs to be done, therefore, if we are serious about climate change and climate action and about protecting businesses which are struggling to survive.</p></speech>

Some of that is down to meteorological conditions, but obviously the backdrop is pollution from cars, which has probably gone down because fewer people are travelling in their cars, and the increased burning of smoky solid fuels now that more people are at home.  The difficulty is that this is not just because of smoky coal.  A large and growing part of it is down to people burning other solid fuels, such as wood, turf and peat briquettes.  In respect of their impact on air quality, those fuels are just as bad and arguably worse, but we have decided not to ban the sale or burning of wood, turf or peat briquettes for reasons which the Deputy will understand.  It would be dishonest to claim to people that a nationwide ban on smoky coal, or enforcement of that, would solve the problem of people burning the other solid fuels which are just as bad.</p></speech>

I welcome the statement from the Minister for Health, when answering a question from Deputy Cullinane, that the review of student nurse allowances will finish this month.  I asked the Taoiseach this question, but whether he misunderstood me or I was unclear, I will try to be more straightforward now.  The review is welcome and needs to happen.  Could we also look at whether it might be possible for this allowance money to be paid up front?  Many nursing and midwifery students in third year in the Dundalk Institute of Technology, DKiT, have raised this issue with me and asked if this might be possible.</p></speech>

Significant decisions are being made today concerning rural, one-off planning.  Our colleagues on the county council have concerns regarding the nature of the deliberations during Covid-19.  The national development plan is also being reviewed and in terms of the hierarchy of documents, significant decisions are being made on rural, one-off planning which will devastate rural communities.  The T&aacute;naiste and his Government should seek to suspend the ongoing review of the County Meath development plan until the national development plan has been reviewed because the implications of the current proposals for rural communities would simply be devastating.</p></speech>

Both of those are in the process of getting new school buildings, but are worried about delays, those which have already happened and any that might happen in the future.  The impact of these delays on the numbers of pupils these schools can accept for 2021 will be significant.  I spoke to the vice principal of Pelletstown Educate Together National School recently and one concern is that the school will not be able to accept junior infants because there is no space for the two Portakabins required.  We know a builder will be approved soon, but meanwhile there needs to be a guarantee for both those schools that there will be new buildings on site for 2021.</p></speech>

Once again, they are having difficulties accessing their basic social welfare entitlements.  This time, the UP38 forms are being filled in incorrectly.  An email I received from one of the workers states:</p> <blockquote> 	If these forms were filled out right by Aer Lingus staff could have money owed to them in their bank accounts within 24 hours.  Staff are desperate as they were counting on this money for Christmas. </blockquote>  <p>I ask the T&aacute;naiste to engage with the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, to issue an instruction that these forms be processed even if Aer Lingus refuses to fill them out correctly.  Failing that, I ask that he engage with the Minister for Transport, Deputy Ryan, who can instruct Aer Lingus to fill out these forms correctly.  It is unfair.  These people are not looking for anything they are not entitled to.  They have been on lay-off for a long time.  Christmas is coming and they desperately need this money.</p></speech>

It needs to be sorted out before Christmas.  I agree with the Deputy in that regard.  I do not understand why this is still a problem.

I am sure the T&aacute;naiste has heard of My Lovely Horse Rescue, which does great work in the area of animal welfare.  It has noted an increase in recent times in the number of animals and horses being left in parks and public spaces and on State land.  Last weekend, it filmed a video throughout the South Dublin County Council, Fingal County Council and Dublin City Council areas.  There were 100 horses loose in Dunsink and others were tethered with no access to water.  There is legislation in place but it is not being implemented as it should be.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste to raise at Cabinet the need for the establishment of a multi-agency to enforce that legislation.  Many animals are not microchipped or licenced.  I propose that the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Senator Hackett, who has responsibility for public land, would take up this matter.</p></speech>

I was struck by the remark that it is possible to buy a horse in Ireland for as little as &euro;10, which is extraordinary.  I know some horses are well looked after but a lot are not and that is not right.  In this country we have a particular attachment to horses and we hate to see them maltreated.  The law is in place but, as the Deputy stated, it is not adequately being enforced.  I will raise the issue with my colleagues, the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, and the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, to see what we can do better.</p></speech>

We are on the verge of rolling out a vaccine.  Hopefully, in the not too distant future we can get back to some semblance of normality.  That is to be celebrated, but one group remains very concerned, namely, those who suffer from cystic fibrosis, CF, which is a chronic lung condition.  As we know, Covid-19 attacks the lungs in particular.  My question relates to the priority list and groups.  It must have been an incredibly tough task to prioritise particular groups above others.  I would like the Minister for Health and the T&aacute;naiste to examine the priority groups to see if those suffering from cystic fibrosis can be bumped up the list.  Currently, persons aged between 18 and 64 suffering from CF are seventh on the list.  How fast can we expect the vaccine to be rolled out to those seventh on the list?  If there is any delay, can those suffering from cystic fibrosis, of whom there are not a huge number across the country, be prioritised?</p></speech>

The schedule is based entirely on medical and scientific advice and Government did not alter it in any way.  We are very much guided by the doctors and scientists regarding vaccination, starting with those at most risk, which is those aged over 65 in nursing homes, moving on to healthcare workers and then others based on age, disease status and risk profile.  As we said at the time, nothing is set in stone.  I hear the case that the Deputy makes in regard to people under 65 with respiratory illnesses such as CF, who are definitely high risk.  When I speak to the CMO next week it is one of the issues I will raise with him.  We need to be flexible and to potentially change the schedule as science and knowledge develops.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-12-10a.320" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1590" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="13:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020121000028#BB00500"><p>I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>  <p>  The Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2020 has three core objectives.  First, it amends the Credit Union Act to allow for general meetings, which are prohibited under current health regulations, to proceed; second, it amends the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2012 to increase the number of consecutive terms of office members of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council may serve from two to three; and third, it amends the Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Act 2010 to include the European Union as a facility lender, which will allow the State to comply with certain provisions contained in the SURE loan agreement at EU level.</p>  <p>  The Credit Union Act 1997 currently requires credit unions to have their annual general meetings, AGMs, for the financial year to 30 September 2020 completed by the end of January 2021.  Under current health guidelines, general meetings, including AGMs, would not be able proceed in practice.  The changes proposed in the Bill will allow for greater flexibility to manage general meetings on a permanent basis.  These changes, importantly, will allow credit unions to make changes to their rules if they so wish.</p>  <p>  Some of these amendments will be temporary and relate directly to changes required to enable general meetings to proceed during the Covid-19 pandemic.  In particular, the board of a credit union can decide on the form of a general meeting, similar to the provisions in the Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Covid-19) Act 2020, notwithstanding the rules of the credit union.  Should these legislative changes not be made and the public health measures continue to restrict large physical gatherings, the Central Bank has the power, in limited circumstances, to direct credit unions to postpone the holding of their AGMs for a period not exceeding nine months, where it is necessary to do so.  The Central Bank has an identical power to defer special general meetings of credit unions.  Boards could also issue information in written form to members or publish financial updates on their websites or both.  However, these outcomes would be suboptimal as members would not be able to express their right to vote or call the board of directors to account or both.</p>  <p>  The main amendments proposed in the legislation are: to allow the option of virtual general meetings, which provide access for remote attendance and the option of electronic voting; to provide credit unions with the option of availing of proxy voting for a temporary interim period to allow for the directors to determine the form of the general meeting, notwithstanding the credit union rules; to allow for AGMs for the year ending 30 September 2020 to be delayed until April 2021; to allow for the interim period to be extended by order of the Minister for Finance; to allow the Minister to make further regulations relating to general meetings to be held by the use of electronic communications technology; and to allow the directors of a credit union, in exceptional circumstances, to cancel the holding of a general meeting at any time prior to the holding of the meeting.</p> <p>While the Bill is similar in some respects to the Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Covid-19) Act 2020, it takes into account the different nature of credit unions and makes some permanent changes to encourage greater member engagement at general meetings in the future.  For example, the Bill provides for credit unions to hold partly or fully virtual meetings on a permanent basis and provides greater flexibility for credit unions to determine how they manage voting. <br/><br/>The Bill will amend the Schedule to the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2012 to increase the maximum number of consecutive terms which a member of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, may serve from two to three terms, before becoming ineligible for reappointment.  This amendment is proposed to address exceptional continuity challenges the council is currently facing and to provide for greater flexibility for future appointments.  Members of the council are required to possess a certain skill set and a highly technical level of expertise.  With members currently restricted to serving just two consecutive terms of office, the pool of candidates available for every new open competitive process is a particularly narrow one and an ongoing challenge.<br/><br/>The five-member council is likely to have three vacancies by the end of the year.  In addition, the two members who will remain <i>in situ</i>are relatively new appointees.  The continuity challenges which face the council constitute exceptional circumstances and require the proposed change to the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2012.  Once passed, the change will help to address this considerable continuity challenge and allow for existing members to serve a third consecutive term.<br/><br/>The Bill will amend section 67 of the Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Act 2010 to include the European Union as a facility lender, which will allow the State to comply with certain provisions contained in the EU support to mitigate unemployment risks in an emergency, SURE, loan agreement.  Section 67(7) of the Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Act sets out those institutions which are facility lenders to the State.  While the definition of &quot;facility lender&quot; currently includes the European Financial Stability Facility and European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism, which are part of the EU, these references would not cover the E as lender under the SURE regulation and loan agreement.  The technical amendment to section 67(7) extends the definition of &quot;facility lender&quot; to include the EU as lender to the Irish State.<br/><br/>The Government has applied for a loan of &euro;2.474 billion under the EU's SURE instrument.  This loan will cover eligible expenditure on short-term work schemes, that is, the majority of the expenditure on the temporary wage subsidy scheme.<br/><br/>I look forward to hearing Deputies' views during the debate, which will allow credit unions to hold virtual AGMs associated with the financial year ending September 2020, will allow each credit union to decide on the appropriate mechanism for voting at general meetings, and will extend the time in which AGMs can be held from January 2021 to the end of April 2021.  <br/><br/>Over the past week, we received a great deal of interest from Oireachtas Members on all sides, supporting the passage of the Bill to allow the AGMs to be convened as soon as possible.  The Bill will also amend the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2012 to allow for an increase in the number of terms that can be served by a member of the lFAC.  It will also amend the Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Act 2010 to include the EU as a facility lender, which will allow the State to comply with certain provisions contained in the SURE loan agreement.<br/><br/>I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>

B&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir gur sin pl&eacute; do l&aacute; eile.  Inniu t&aacute;imid ag d&eacute;ile&aacute;il leis an mBille at&aacute; os &aacute;r gcomhair.  T&aacute; tr&iacute; phr&iacute;omh chatag&oacute;ir sa Bhille seo agus beidh Sinn F&eacute;in ag tabhairt taca&iacute;ochta d&oacute;.  S&eacute; sin r&aacute;ite, t&aacute; leasuithe curtha chun tosaigh againn chun an Bille seo a neart&uacute; agus a l&aacute;idri&uacute; agus le pl&eacute; a bheith againn faoi chuid de na h&aacute;bhair imn&iacute; at&aacute; ag comhair chreidmheasa difri&uacute;la ar fud an St&aacute;it, chomh maith le leas&uacute; &oacute; thaobh an IFSC de.</p>  <p>  The legislation has three core objectives: first, to amend the Credit Union Act to allow credit union general meetings to proceed virtually, as they are currently prohibited under Covid-19 health regulations; second, to amend the Fiscal Responsibility Act to increase the maximum number of consecutive terms an IFAC member can serve from two to three; and third, to amend the Credit Institution (Stabilisation) Act 2010 to include the EU as a facility lender.  </p>  <p>  I will focus on the first two objects.  I commend the credit union movement and the services it provides to communities right across the island. It is an all-Ireland movement that is embedded in our communities.  There are 317 credit unions across the island with 3.6 million members.  It has a track record of delivery.  For more than 60 years, our credit unions have been an underutilised asset on the island.  Although not relating to this legislation in particular, as we emerge from the pandemic, and while there is uncertainty around the future of Ulster Bank, we need to enhance the role played by credit unions in the financial market.  There is a total asset book of &euro;20 billion, and with that comes great potential for the credit union movement to support our communities and economy through SME and mortgage lending and involvement in the delivery of social housing.  For that to happen, a change in mindset is required in both the Department of Finance and the Central Bank.  During my time as an Oireachtas Member, and particularly as spokesperson on finance for Sinn F&eacute;in for more than a decade, I have witnessed the support across the political divide for the credit union movement.  Collectively, we can ensure the necessary supports are put in place so that they can provide a stronger role in society and the financial market.  </p>  <p>  I also wish to refer to legislation I introduced some years ago on moneylenders.  Money lenders are a scourge on society, particularly in their charging of an annual percentage rate, APR, of up to 187%.  Particularly at times of hardship, something that the pandemic has unfortunately brought to many households, moneylenders are advertising their wares, selling high-interest loans with immoral rates of interest.  A Bill was before the House and is now before the finance committee for pre-legislative scrutiny.  The committee has heard from stakeholders.  As sponsor of the Bill, I am delighted to have read the submissions that have been received in support of the need to place a cap on the interest rate that can be charged by money lenders.  I believe it is a role that the credit union has filled and can continue to fill.  Initiatives were introduced in previous years, some by local credit unions, to ensure that short-term small lending is available to families and households who need it at times of pressure.  </p>  <p>  The financial year for credit unions falls at the end of September.</p> <p>The AGMs subsequently occur between October and January, as required by the Credit Union Act 1997.  As a result of the current public health measures, it is impossible to proceed in practice with physical AGMs or special general meetings.  In addition, the uncertain direction of the public health measures into the future makes planning for a general meeting difficult due to the time lag between the notice of a meeting being sent to members and the holding of the meeting.</p> <p> The purpose of this legislation is to allow for credit unions to hold meetings remotely that are required under the Credit Union Act.  Our support for the legislation is wholly contingent on our support for the credit union movement itself.  The Credit Union Development Association, CUDA, and the Irish League of Credit Unions, ILCU, have engaged with the Department of Finance and the Oireachtas finance committee on the general scheme of the Bill.  Both organisations welcomed the provisions set out in the general scheme.  However, concerns have been raised regarding specific provisions in the Bill.  I want to focus on two of those concerns.  The first regards the role of the nomination committees and how they are affected by this legislation.  The second relates to the issue of proxy votes.</p> <p> The Bill provides for the introduction of pre-meeting voting.  The nomination committee is one of the key committees established under the Credit Union Act.  Its purpose is to ensure that nominees to credit union directorships meet the highest standards.  This is an essential part of what could be described as the fitness and probity regime for credit unions  As part of the process, the nomination committee shares a report with members who, in turn, elect directors.  Under the credit union rules, this report is shared in advance of any voting.  The new subsection 78A(4)(a) of the 1997 Act, as inserted by section 6 of the Bill, suggests that voting will be allowed to take place before a nomination committee sends its report to members.  This issue has been raised with the Department by the credit unions.  I would appreciate clarity in this regard and for their concerns to be addressed.</p> <p> The second concern is in regard to the proposed introduction of proxy votes.  In 2016, the Department's credit union advisory committee published its review of the implementation of the recommendations in the report of the Commission on Credit Unions.  The committee noted proxy voting as a specific concern for stakeholders.  Serious issues have been raised with the Department regarding these proposals.  Among the issues is that the introduction of proxies could lead to conflicts of interest or situations where undue influence could be exercised on voters.  Concerns have also been raised about the possibility of one individual acting as a proxy for several members, which could lead to undue influence being exercised by a single individual.  One of the fundamental tenets of the credit union movement is that there is one vote for each member.  These concerns have been raised with the Department.  I have tabled amendments dealing with both these issues and I would appreciate if the Minister could address the concerns raised.</p> <p> Section 14 relates to IFAC.  This provision has been brought forward to avoid an awkward situation for the Minister.  IFAC was set up as part of a wider agenda of budgetary reform after the Fianna F&aacute;il Government destroyed our economy.  It was set up to scrutinise Government budgetary policy.  Under the 2012 legislation, the council has five members, with no member allowed to serve more than two four-year terms in a row.  Since the beginning of this year, the council has been reduced to four members, after the former chairman, Seamus Coffey, finished his term.  This is despite the fact that the legislation passed by this House requires a vacancy on the council to be filled within six months.  Another two members are due to finish at the end of the year, reducing the number of council members by two and leaving three vacancies.  One of the members, the current chairman, Sebastian Barnes, has been on the council since 2012 and is coming to the end of his second four-year term.</p> <p> This section seeks to extend Mr. Barnes's membership of the council by a third term, or another four years.  To be clear, Mr. Barnes has served the council with distinction.  However, it is not appropriate to extend his term of service and the provision to that effect has been introduced simply to avoid embarrassment for the Minister.  It is important that fresh voices and new perspectives are brought to the council.  That was the whole point of the two-term limit.  Such limits exist in other jurisdictions to safeguard the credibility of budget watchdogs.  The limit should not be undone and the credibility of the council should not be undermined simply because the Government has neglected the council.</p> <p> I want to conclude by again commending the credit union movement on the continuous service it provides to members.  I hope we can allow the movement to continue to play an enhanced role in the economy.</p></speech>

Is rud f&iacute;orth&aacute;bhachtach &eacute; ionas gur f&eacute;idir leis na AGMs tarl&uacute; agus t&aacute; s&eacute; sin f&iacute;orth&aacute;bhachtach do na daoine at&aacute; ag brath orthu.</p>  <p>  I welcome this Bill, which makes provision for the holding of certain meetings by credit unions via remote access.  We have discussed in this Chamber the importance of credit unions being able to hold their AGMs.  It is something that has been raised with me by a number of constituents and several credit unions.  It makes absolute sense that this is being dealt with now, in light of the very real risk to human life posed by Covid-19.  It will allow, by way of amendment to the Credit Union Act 1997, for attendance and voting by proxy at certain meetings.</p>  <p>  We know the key role that credit unions play in communities.  There is a credit union beside the estate I live on and I have been a member of it since I was a very small child.  The credit union is a financial centre for many communities.  That is especially the case at this time, when we are looking at the possibility of Ulster Bank leaving the market and the closure of many bank branches.  When branches close, there is a loss of local knowledge relevant to funding for loans and so on.  Local knowledge is key when making decisions on the granting of loans.  I have spoken to the manager of a credit union who raised the concern that its AGM, which would usually cost approximately &euro;30,000, with the production of booklets and all that kind of thing, may now carry an additional cost of &euro;5,000 to &euro;8,000 under the provisions in the Bill.  It is necessary and important that the AGMs go ahead but it is also important to be aware of such concerns.</p>  <p>  There is a need to look at the credit union sector in a broader sense.  We need to look at what credit unions can do, what activity they might be able to branch into and the very real crisis they are facing.  From speaking to staff in several credit unions in recent months, they have made it clear that we can no longer ignore the scale of the crisis facing credit unions.  Nor can we ignore the opportunity for the sector to step into the breach if the likes of Ulster Bank were to leave the market and there are ongoing closures of other bank branches.  Those closures can have a significant impact on communities.  Regulations have been placed on the sector that have put credit unions at a competitive disadvantage relative to the banks.  That has stymied their ability to lend and is strangling their ability to give customers the facility to borrow.  Lending regulations introduced just a few months ago allow credit unions to lend only 7.5% of their assets for secured loans such as houses, with larger credit unions being possibly allowed to lend up to 15%.  This was brought in by the Central Bank as an advancement of regulation.  According to the credit union staff to whom I have been speaking, it is far from it.</p>  <p>  We need to consider whether it might be better for the credit unions to set their own lending limits.  That may not be the way to go but we certainly need to look at what they can lend.  Obviously there must be limits, but the situation must be looked at because the credit unions feel they are stymied.  More than 50% of the consumer credit market is for mortgages.</p> <p>How can credit unions ever offer a real alternative when this restriction is in place?  The Central Bank is increasing the risk for credit unions by not allowing them to have more balanced loan books.  We hear that credit unions do not have the nature, scale or complexity to offer mortgages.  We need to ask whether they could broaden their activities.  We know the great impact they have on communities and their local knowledge, which is very important.  Draft figures show that credit unions collectively made a surplus of approximately &euro;65 million in the year prior to 30 September.  On the other hand, Permanent TSB reported a pre-tax loss of &euro;57 million in the first six months of the year.  Ulster Bank is reported to have plunged into loss and may be preparing to exit the market.  In a very unfortunate development, Ulster Bank refused to appear before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach to explain its actions and what it intends to do.  Credit unions clearly have the capability and capacity to step into the breach.  It is great to see community-led organisations that can help their local communities.  </p> <p> Credit unions are also at a competitive disadvantage with regard to the regulations governing their investments.  The foreword of the Central Bank's feedback statement to its consultation paper on potential changes to the investment framework for credit unions stated: "We are strongly of the view that lending and the provision of services to members should be the key drivers of sector viability".  It notes that revised investment regulations would necessarily impact on the level of return.  The Central Bank thus acknowledges that investments by credit unions are safe, but they are still unable to hold the same reserves for investments as for loans.  That has a real impact on ordinary people.</p> <p> Furthermore, I refer to the share caps credit unions are obliged to implement.  A credit union in the south of Dublin has restricted members' holdings to &euro;20,000.  Another one in north Dublin has restricted its members' holdings to &euro;15,000.  Members are unable to access a mortgage through their credit unions, while a young person cannot save for a deposit on a house with their local credit union.  That is quite concerning, because credit unions can have a great relationship with their customers. </p> <p> My colleague, Deputy Pearse Doherty, mentioned IFAC and the proposed third term for members.  That is a concern.  IFAC has served us well, and this is not a reflection on any of its members.  However, a limit of two terms was set for a reason.  We should stay within those limits.  </p> <p> This Bill is welcome.  We need to examine the credit union sector and its potential.  The Minister of State has previously spoken of the importance of the sector, but we have not seen bang for our buck in that regard.  We need to look at what credit unions can do, especially in light of the large number of bank branch closures.  The credit union sector has always been very good to its members and has always exemplified that favourite word, "prudence".  Credit unions have always been very careful.  We need to support them however we can and they are currently telling us that they are facing a huge crisis.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-12-10a.326" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1599" speakername="Gerald Nash" time="13:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020121000031#EE00200"><p>This Bill is generally welcome but some elements require improvement to meet the needs of members, boards of management, managers and staff of credit unions.  Efforts to facilitate the safe holding of AGMs in the context of Covid-19 are welcome.  Credit unions are democratic.  Their workings are based on the one member, one vote principle that is fundamental to co-operative community-based organisations.  As such, it is important to look in greater detail at some of the changes proposed in this Bill.</p>  <p>  Section 11 deals with the introduction of proxies.  This is a very radical departure from the current situation in credit unions throughout the country.  It is concerning that this proposal, which is frankly poorly thought out, is being shoved in on a permanent basis in an emergency Bill designed to meet the particular needs of this moment.  There are concerns that some of the provisions of the Bill would enable malign manipulation.  For example, I am a little surprised that it allows for the accumulation of many proxy votes under the control of one person, who may not even be a credit union member.  The absence of a measure to preclude vote clustering is cause for further concern.  For example, the Bill could enable voting blocs to be assembled and deployed for or against candidates for positions on credit union boards, dividend payments, mergers, etc.  Considerable discussions on the subject of mergers are currently ongoing between credit unions throughout the country.</p>  <p>  The introduction of bloc voting could make manipulation of outcomes easier for persons with criminal intent, including money laundering by outside organisations that might attempt to take over control of the credit union.  It could lead to a host of other manipulations and dodgy dealings.  This proxy voting proposal has not been drafted on the basis of what I would describe as reality.  For example, section 11 will introduce a new section 82A(6) to the Credit Union Act 1997.  This limits the time credit unions will have in advance of a meeting to verify proxies and set up systems for electronic voting to 48 hours.  If we are to proceed with proxies, which the Minister seems intent on doing, we need to revisit the idea that only 48 hours will be required.  The section also inserts a new section 82A(7), which allows for the electronic delivery of proxies.  This will oblige election officials to authenticate documentation that may not be original.  It will thus be even more difficult to detect fraudulent documentation and nefarious actions in the context of credit union AGMs. </p>  <p>  The new section 82A(4) effectively precludes the board from putting measures in place to exclude voter fraud.  Such precautions have been omitted from this Bill.  The board is limited in the measures it can take to verify the identify of the voter and ensure the security of the system.  This area will require further focus. </p>  <p>  This is a hurried, ill-considered and potentially dangerous section and the Minister of State should consider withdrawing it.  I understand that a working group on credit union legislation is currently in place and is meeting with the Department.  It would be better if this measure was referred to that group for more consideration, given the fact that it consists mainly of credit union associations.  I accept the urgent need to allow credit unions to hold their AGMs for the reasons the Minister of State outlined. </p>  <p>  We have several other areas of concern.  The Bill proposes to introduce pre-meeting voting.  This is fundamentally undemocratic and arguably runs counter to the whole concept of fitness and probity.  As the sector regulator, we have seen how hard the Central Bank has worked to promote fitness and probity among directors and senior management in all banks and credit institutions.  The nomination committee is one of the key committees established under the Credit Union Act 1997, as amended.  Among other things, it is charged with ensuring that nominees to credit union directorships meet the highest of standards across a range of areas.</p> <p>The report of the nomination committee to the members, in other words the electors, is a key element of this process.  Under credit union rules, it must be delivered in advance of voting by secret ballot in the elections.  The Minister now seeks to change this by providing for voting in advance of the AGM, as covered in the proposed new section 78A(4)(a).  This raises yet another dilemma and conundrum.  The administration needed to prevent a member, or a proxy, afforded a pre-AGM vote from voting again at the AGM would be substantial.  This is a real issue.  Were the actual meeting to be held online, sophisticated communication and voting technology would have to be developed and deployed with much time spent in the interval, between the close of vote and the opening of the meeting, to avoid affording some members two votes.  That is a real and practical challenge.  Consideration should be given to withdrawing the concept of pre-AGM voting and that the whole issue be referred back to consultation over a limited period with the representative associations, notwithstanding our acceptance of the urgency of action in this area to allow AGMs to take place in the current health context.</p> <p> The proposed new section 78A(7)(a), to our amazement, fails to mention the requirement that any electronic system deployed should also provide for both show of hands ballots and secret ballots, as well as how the integrity of the ballot and the one-person, one-vote principle will be ultimately provided for.  This is a fundamental issue and it ought to be addressed.  It should be borne in mind that it is difficult to see how, on a technological basis, clustering of proxy votes could be accommodated in such situations.  There are a range of different technical, security and electronic challenges with which we would be faced if this legislation is passed as presented.</p> <p> I note the Bill has a technical amendment which enables Ireland to draw down SURE scheme funding of more than &euro;2 billion directly from the European Union.  The Bill also provides for the extension of term limits of members of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC.</p> <p> When the SURE scheme was announced last spring, I saw it very much as an affirmation that the idea of the social Europe was back in vogue.  It was an immediate response by the EU acknowledging that member states would need direct financial supports to help workers and businesses whose jobs were in jeopardy and who may need significant investment in terms of upskilling and retraining.  From the Minister of State's earlier remarks here and in the Seanad, this money will be used to pay some of the bill for the temporary wage subsidy scheme and not for training and upskilling purposes.  Insofar as I can establish, this is permissible under the scheme.  It would be helpful, however, if the Minister of State could confirm the current status of our application to draw down these funds and that the European Union has sanctioned the use of these funds for this purpose.</p> <p> The Bill started its journey in the Seanad several weeks ago.  The Minister of State and his officials will be aware of the real concerns expressed by my colleague, Senator Marie Sherlock, in a helpful and measured way in respect of the ambitions of this legislation to extend term limits of members of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council.  We are now learning of the exceptional continuity challenges facing the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, in that if its enabling legislation is not amended to allow term limits to be extended, it may soon in practice be the case that this statutory body may not be able to make a quorum at all.  That is a dangerous situation to be in.  If it cannot function at that level, then it cannot meet the statutory remit set for it by the Oireachtas in 2012.  I understand one vacancy has been open for the guts of a year.  From where I am standing, there does not seem to be a shortage of capable, independently minded macroeconomists in our country who could perform a valuable service on the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council.  Is it the case that of those applying, the criteria cannot be met by those candidates?  Is it the case that we do not have anybody applying for the positions at all?</p> <p> I would be interested to know when the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council started to raise these issues with the Department and how far back the ability of this body to function came into question.  When was the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council first in contact with the Department?  How concerned was the Department by this situation?  Members are being asked to amend legislation at the eleventh hour to allow term limits in the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council to be extended to allow the organisation to do its job.  I hope this issue has not arisen because of neglect from the Department or, at least, lack of interest in the council's workings and its functions.</p> <p> I hope and think the Minister of State will agree that the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council has served us well since 2012.  It has fulfilled an important role with its evidence-based function by independently assessing and critiquing Government policy and fiscal policy more generally.  It has also helped to lift the veil on fiscal policy and to make the process as to how fiscal policy is arrived at more accessible for members of the public and more widely understood.  Heaven knows that more than most, this country has suffered from what one might describe as groupthink.  Last week marked ten years since we were forced into the arms of the troika, lost our economic sovereignty and all that went with that.  Turnover in any body is important, as is its independence.  A 12-year term, which will be envisaged if this legislation is passed, is not advisable and could potentially lead to institutionalisation, herd mentality and groupthink.</p> <p> This is not a criticism of anybody.  All Members are huge admirers of the work that the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council has done, both corporately and the individuals who have served this country's policy development well.  Would the Minister of State not be better minded to extend the number of appointments that can be made to the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council and make changes as to how the board operates to ensure consistency and continuity of membership as some members come and go?  For example, the Minister of State might take a look at the Low Pay Commission, which has many more members than does the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council.  When I was establishing the Low Pay Commission, one matter foremost in my mind was to guarantee term limits were short enough to ensure a turnover with new and fresh thinking.  I also wanted sufficient numbers of people on the commission to ensure continuity and consistency and that it was representative.  That might be a more elegant solution to the problem than the one proposed in the Bill.  We might look at extending the number of members who can sit on the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council rather than taking the approach that we ought to extend term limits to deal with a problem we have now.  It might be better to take a more fundamental look at the legislation and broaden it out to allow more people to sit as members of this important organisation.</p> <p> It will become increasingly more important as we move forward.  The Minister of State will be aware of the criticisms from both the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council and the Parliamentary Budget Office in terms of the lack of budgetary scrutiny, the scrutiny of Estimates, Supplementary Estimates and so on introduced this year in the context of the vast amounts of money the State is providing to businesses to keep the doors open and people in work, as well as the vast resources we are pumping into State services in the context of the current emergency situation.  The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council is an important organisation.  It should not be neglected but should be looked after and prioritised.  I suggest the Minister of State does that, not by extending term limits but by ensuring the legislation enables more macroeconomists with expertise to sit on the board at any given moment in time.</p></speech>

While some people are wondering how they managed to survive the year of Covid-19, others are wondering how they survive every year within the confines of this Bill.  I am anxious that the lending capacity of our credit unions be extended in our communities.  They are bedrocks of opportunity and protection.  I am equally anxious about the effective politicisation of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council.</p> <p>I am not referring to its fine members but to the Minister's attempt to legislate for a third consecutive term for one of them.  Term limits are a key aspect of good governance.  I disapprove of what is happening.<br/><br/>The reduction of the council to a fig leaf for the Minister's embarrassment is indicative of the Government's attitude to the public overall.  This week, more-than-well-paid judges are getting an increase on the grounds that they are entitled to it, yet the Government is demanding that student nurses put their lives on the line for &euro;50 because, in its opinion, that is all they are entitled to.  The Government forgets that almost everything in people's lives is predicated on what we do in here.  Where they live, how long they live, their healthcare, whether they can keep a roof over their heads, whether they can keep their sight, whether their children can go to college, and life and death are all decided within the confines of this House at the pressing of a button &ndash; N&iacute;l or T&aacute;.<br/><br/>Homelessness is rising.  Outside this House, too many people are looking to the Muslim Sisters of Eire and other soup kitchens to be fed.  The term &quot;soup kitchen&quot; cuts deep for us in Ireland.  The soup kitchens, rack rents, evictions and bailiffs of a former generation feature again in this one.  This time, the tent cities in Cork and Dublin do not arise via Trevelyan or Peel but via Bilderberg and Davos.  Privilege meets power.  Under the Government, privilege is power.  It is also a question of access and influence - a text, a nod, a wink, conversations with friends, a confidential State document reordered and leaked, sneak peaks and Supreme Court seats.  Why?  It is because those concerned are entitled.  It is time to do better and to do things differently.  <br/><br/>Hundreds of thousands voted for Sinn F&eacute;in precisely to do things better and differently.  For their vote as democrats, some have treated them as lessers, lowers, political lepers, social pariahs, and literal and political illiterates, even while news was breaking of the leaking of documents by the former Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar.  All the Fianna F&aacute;il Members were queueing up here to declare confidence in him although most of them had none.  This morning, the<i>Irish Examiner </i>had another report on the T&aacute;naiste leaking information, this time in regard to protected disclosures.  We are aware that Fianna F&aacute;il does not have confidence in the T&aacute;naiste, because no confidence was deserved.  To keep change out, Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael buried the hatchet.  They buried it deep into those they believe to be unentitled, but change is coming.  Those same people will vote time and again until they see themselves and their interests represented in government and in finance Bills, as they should be.  That is their right and entitlement in a republic.</p></speech>

Conscious of the fact that she is a new Deputy, I have to point out that Second Stage speeches on legislation are meant to focus on the legislation.  However interesting her contribution might have been, it did not focus on credit unions, which are the subject matter of the Bill.  Anyway, that is for future reference.</p></speech>

Clearly, there are three main provisions: to facilitate credit unions to hold meetings virtually; to increase the number of consecutive terms of office of a member of the IFAC; and to include the EU as a facility lender.  Essentially, this is tidying-up legislation.  It addresses a number of administrative issues.  The Social Democrats do not have a difficulty with that.</p>  <p>  I want to make a few comments on the section regarding credit unions.  I note some of the amendments that have been tabled in this regard, particularly No. 4, which relates to the need to ensure secrecy in election votes, and amendment No. 8, whereby proxy votes need to be submitted up to seven days in advance of an AGM rather than 48 hours.  Both of those amendments have some merit.  I hope the Minister of State might consider them.  They would improve the legislation.</p>  <p>  The legislation has been welcomed by credit unions.  They would certainly favour both amendments but the bottom line is that the legislation is enabling legislation.  It does not bind credit unions to operate the proxy system in the way that is set down.  Overall, the legislation is very much welcome.  I will not delay the House any longer.  I am happy to support the Bill.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-12-10a.332" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1588" speakername="Patricia Ryan" time="13:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020121000033#GG00400"><p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  The credit union movement has been a huge force for good across the Thirty-two Counties, in almost every small town in addition to the bigger cities.  I commend the staff and volunteers of credit unions, who have been instrumental in helping individuals and small business owners to keep the show on the road throughout the pandemic.  I commend the leadership on its constant development of new ways to help its members.  The credit unions are rivalling the big banks with their innovation.  They are offering online access to accounts.  In recent weeks, they have made Google Pay and Fitbit Pay available to their customers.</p>  <p>  We need to give the credit unions a greater role in our banking system.  They are embedded in our communities and are best placed to help the local areas, of which they are an integral part.</p>  <p>  Some small changes can be made to make this happen.  Credit unions should be given greater capacity to provide mortgages.  We need to legislate for a more ambitious future-proofed vision of mortgage lending.  This should include a change to the current regulatory position to allow credit unions to operate a more centralised investment model that would allow them to pool their resources to develop community bank mortgages open to all members who meet the lending criteria.  This would allow home loans to comprise 20% of the total credit union loan book, thereby offering a more member-friendly solution for credit unions that wish to expand their mortgage lending.  This would contrast with the commercial banks, where between 55% and 75% of the loan books comprise mortgage loans.</p>  <p>  We should utilise credit union funds to support the building of social housing.  We should create a mechanism by which credit unions could invest in social housing.  This would allow the credit union sector to invest up to &euro;900 million in the provision of social housing and fund close to 6,500 badly needed new homes.</p>  <p>  Credit unions could play a very important role in helping the country to meet its climate change targets if it were possible to provide funding for a national retrofitting programme.  The Government has committed to retrofitting 500,000 homes by 2030 at an estimated cost of &euro;5 billion.  Credit unions are well-positioned to support this programme by leveraging their assets to provide funding.  </p>  <p>   We need to empower our credit unions to participate more fully in SME lending.  Legislative changes will be required to ensure such sectoral lending is feasible.  This would allow all credit unions that wish to participate in such lending to do so.  The proposal to pool resources among credit unions also fits with the concept of a credit union-led community banking model.   </p>  <p>  This legislation is about allowing credit unions to adapt to the current pandemic.  We need to ensure that our credit unions are to the forefront of this economy, rather than an afterthought. </p></speech>

There are questions over proxy votes and such.</p> <p>Deputies Doherty and Mair&eacute;ad Farrell and others spoke about the fact that the Minister probably needs to look at a number of these matters and, possibly, some of the legislation and ensure that we have everything right and that we have the correct levels of accountability and probity.</p> <p> Credit unions have been spectacular in the work they have done in many communities.  In many places, they are the stopgaps that have facilitated people who did not necessarily have the ability to go to retail banks and get loans that were absolutely necessary, from the point of view of getting through periods of difficulty during normal times never mind this particular pandemic.  What we have seen with regard to credit unions in recent years is a huge amount of rules and regulations that are absolutely necessary as regards accountability and financial probity.</p> <p> As I have stated, this was obviously necessary.  There was a certain element of professionalisation, and smaller community-based credit unions were subsumed into larger operations.  This has happened in Dundalk.  The capacity at the larger level is necessary to ensure that all due diligence is done.  It also gives the ability of better bang for buck.  We need to make sure that we do not lose the community connection.  A number of local people were able to make a decision which, to be fair, was not always necessary on absolutely financial or fiscal reasoning but on the basis of somebody needing those funds to get through a particular gap, such as facing into Christmas.  If we completely remove this facility will we leave the space open for money lenders?  A number of speakers have mentioned the legislation coming through and the absolute necessity for it.  We need caps on the annual percentage rates charged by a huge number of these outfits.  We are all aware of them in every town and village throughout Ireland and they are advertising.  This is a busy time for them to catch people.</p> <p> We support the legislation but we need to have a mindset jump on the whole idea of credit unions and the way we deal with housing.  People are speaking about the fact credit unions are not being facilitated to deal with mortgages.  We need to look at how we deal with affordable and social housing to ensure we also have the clawbacks that are necessary.  We need to facilitate all of these things.  We have made a number of jumps in this pandemic and we need to do it in the context of credit unions and a number of other issues.</p></speech>

I raised this issue on Questions on Promised Legislation, and so have other colleagues throughout the House, to try to deal with credit unions.  While this is a miscellaneous provisions Bill, it is important that we deal with the credit union aspect of it.  Ar an gc&eacute;ad dul s&iacute;os, ba mhaith liom comhghairdeas a dh&eacute;anamh le gach credit union fud na t&iacute;re.  Every credit union in my county, from Nenagh to Carrick-on-Suir and in all the towns and various villages, must be saluted.  It is in the real spirit of the late Canon Hayes that we support our communities.  They are of the community, for the community and with the community.  We all know the bad experience we had with the banking crash.  Now we see the bad experiences continue with the banks and what they are doing.  The Bill is an effort to deal with it.</p>  <p>  I salute the board members, volunteers, management and staff of all credit unions in Tipperary and throughout the country for the work they do.  In Clonmel recently, and, in fairness, I have not seen it anywhere else, the credit union erected a lovely shelter along the footpath to allow people who are standing outside because of Covid to shelter from the rain, wind and hail.  I salute them because I see people standing out banks and they do not even want them inside any more.  I salute the board and John Courtney and John Walsh and various people who are involved, and were involved, and thank them for caring for the people in the community.  It is a lovely initiative.  Our pillar banks do not mind whether people perish from the rain or wind or from vulture funds.  They have lost the spirit and their reason to be.</p>  <p>  The amendment to the Credit Union Act 1997 to make provision for the holding of certain meetings of credit unions virtually is very important.  We have all had to change massively with working from home and using virtual meetings.  They are difficult and challenging.  I support some of the amendments that are being suggested because it will be very difficult to allow proxy votes in advance of AGMs.  There are technical issues to be worked out.  When I raised this two weeks ago, it was in the context of being very privileged in Clonmel to have a very profitable and healthy credit union.  Approximately &euro;1.7 million is to go back to the pockets of borrowers and members before Christmas, as happens every year, but the fact it could not hold the AGM meant that this could not been done.  For the members of the credit union in Clonmel and its hinterland of Fethard, Newcastle and Ardfinnan, the excellent credit union in Cahir and those in Kilsheelan and out into the Nire and Ballymacarbry, that money would have been a godsend not only to them - they are entitle to it - but to the business people in those areas who, God knows, have suffered so much this year.  It will never be forgotten.</p>  <p>  We often say n&iacute; bheidh a leith&eacute;id ar&iacute;s ann about a person but we will not want a bliain like 2020 again.   In fairness, I know the credit union movement has offered a loan scheme to members to tide them over Christmas and this is vital because we cannot have the money lenders and loan sharks, who are unscrupulous people, draining the lifeblood out of families at this particular time.  It is so pressurised for parents of young children, and there is Santa Claus and every other need of people at this time of year.  The days are short, the nights are long, it is cold and heating and proper clothing are needed.  Credit unions have always been to help and support them.</p>  <p>  The Bill will amend the Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Act 2010 to include the European Union as a facility lender and make provision on certain loan agreements entered into by the State with the European Union.  The European Union has shown some solidarity this time, which is shocking.  Others have mentioned the social contract with the EU.  When we had the bank crash and the so-called bailout - I referred to it as a clean-out and I voted against it because we were charged up to 6% interest on money when we could get it from the European Central Bank, ECB, for less than 3%, and that was expensive enough - where was the solidarity?  It was nowhere to be seen.</p>  <p>  Ireland has approximately 250,000 small and medium enterprises, SMEs.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle would know them from Gaillimh and ar fud na t&iacute;re.  They play a significant role in Ireland's non-financial business economy and employ approximately 70% of the workforce here at 885,000 people.  Many of these small businesses got their start from the credit unions.  Banks did not have faith in them when they had their dream and they had the initiative to set up small businesses and self-employed people took the plunge from a permanent job.  We need these innovators and leaders and we need to support them.  In the vast majority of cases, it was a credit union that launched them and had confidence in them.  The people in the credit unions knew the families and their good healthy relationship with the credit unions.  These businesses and their employees are being let down by the Government in two very serious ways.  The first is in the context of the &euro;2 billion credit guarantee loan scheme for businesses administered by the pillar banks, namely, AIB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank.  This scheme is failing the people badly.  It is not functioning.  The money was meant to be available to SMEs but it is not.  The way the business liquidity scheme is being operated and administered means that thousands of small businesses will be forced to close due to a lack of cash flow.  The cost of this will be the loss of tens of thousands of jobs.  Credit unions offer the space and viable liquidity and supports when businesses such as those to which I refer need it most.</p> <p>Many of these companies are finding it difficult to collect this year's accounts because of Covid and people's loss of confidence.  They are struggling.  These small businesses have great relationships with people and they always pay, but it is proving difficult right now.</p> <p> Disgracefully, only 3% of the &euro;65 million available under the scheme has been approved for businesses.  What is wrong?  This is shocking.  The Minister of State will take up this matter because he is a practical man, supports credit unions and small businesses and has an accountancy background.  I have worked with him on many issues.  For all intents and purposes, the banks are closed where supporting business is concerned.  Other countries have drawn down copious amounts of the overall fund, and rightly so.  I do not have the percentages with me, but we are entitled to our share.</p> <p> The scheme must be overhauled and simplified and the banks' influence over the process must be removed or reduced.  The scheme should be widened to cover all SMEs.  I see a role for credit unions in this regard.  For the past ten yeas or more, a jaundiced eye has been cast towards credit unions by the Central Bank and the pillar banks.  When former Deputy Michael Noonan was Minister, he tried to squeeze the lifeblood out of credit unions - I heard him in the corners - and diminish their ability.  There was jealousy of credit unions.  Yes, one or two made big mistakes.  Clonmel Credit Union was almost forced to take one over in Charleville, County Limerick.  Thank God, that did not happen.  There were problems in a few places, but nothing like the problems in the banks.  The credit unions are all local and driven by voluntary boards.</p> <p> Instead of being closed next June, the scheme should be extended to the end of 2021.  There should be a role for credit unions.  The pillar banks are not functioning and, as I pointed out when the relevant legislation was before the House, they should never have got their paws on this money because they would not deliver it.  Only 3% has been drawn down as we near the year's end.  That is shocking.</p> <p> The European Central Bank, ECB, has made an unprecedented &euro;1.5 trillion available at interest rates as low as -1%.  That amount of money is a figure I cannot count or comprehend.  It has been made available to eurozone banks directly with the aim of helping the economies of EU member states.  Ireland represents approximately 5% of the EU's economy.  Therefore, Irish banks should have proportional access to &euro;9 billion of the amount distributed in order to lend to and support businesses and families at interest rates as low as -1%.  What is wrong?  Why are we not doing our job?  Why are we not availing of that money?  The banks are not doing it, so we should give the money to the credit unions, which have always stood up and supported people; n&iacute; neart go cur le ch&eacute;ile.  They have the interests of small businesses in rural areas at heart.  We are wiping out small businesses and this funding is not being drawn down.  I would love to see the Minister of State addressing this shameful issue.</p> <p> When I speak to any small business in Tipperary, it tells me that it cannot get a loan and is crippled by the lack of cash flow because of the pandemic.  The Minister of State knows this better than I do.  Every Deputy knows it.  We are rightfully entitled to &euro;9 billion of the EU fund.  What kind of love affair do we have with the EU that we have to be the best boys in Europe?  We are the best boys in Europe in terms of keeping Covid figures down, yet we have the most severe restrictions.  Businesses are being wiped out and there are issues relating to mental health, cancer operations etc.  This money is available to be drawn down and I want to know why it has not been.  Could the credit unions not avail of some of it?  They are honourable and can be trusted.  One or two did some reckless lending and were punished, but they cannot all be tarred with the same brush.  Clonmel Credit Union and other credit unions should be allowed to pay a dividend.</p> <p> I do not know whether this legislation is too late, but I compliment the Government on introducing it.  It will go to the Seanad now, which I hope will pass it.  I also hope that the President will be able to sign it into law.  Even if that process extends beyond the Christmas period, it will be enacted early in the new year.  Some people will have to get loans.  That is not ideal.  In fairness, credit unions have offered loans, but loan sharks are licking their lips and their greasy paws.  They are out there in housing estates, calling to people and literally intimidating them.  Actually, they are not intimidating people, but they are offering gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh like the three wise men, but they are not wise and I would advise wise people to avoid them if at all possible.  It would be horrific and shocking if people were forced into their arms.</p> <p> Irish banks are not making loans available, yet the Government continues to trust them blindly to administer the credit guarantee scheme.  With the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's indulgence, I will discuss the removal of the moratorium.  I know several business people who are receiving phone calls and letters demanding money, but the Government has taken away their ability to earn that money, keep their employees working, pay their taxes etc.  We are treating them appallingly but we are treating the banks with kid gloves and rubbing butter onto something.  I will not say what I was going to say, but this situation is shocking.  The Government's inactive policy appears to be about protecting the banking sector and not small businesses.  This is sad.</p> <p> Credit unions were the start.  They lit the spark.  They are the spirit of meitheal and of the late, great Canon John Hayes.  They support small industries and businesses and have been with them all the way.  I salute them.  It is shameful that the policies of Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party will cost jobs.  Why can we not think of na daoine beaga?  I mentioned this matter to the Taoiseach this morning, but I do not know whether he understood me.  He made some reference to my stature.  I am talking about the little people.  They are the backbone - shopkeepers, small contractors, undertakers, painters, plasterers and so on.  They are out there.  Think about all the shops in our towns.  They have advanced and changed.  Think about the hairdressers, nail shops and beauty salons that have mushroomed.  They are good people.  Maybe they had jobs before going into business.  Credit unions have nearly always helped them out because they had to go back.</p> <p> Why is the liquidity from the ECB not being availed of in Ireland?  What has the Government done to ensure that banks are making other schemes for small businesses work?  Only 3% has been drawn down.  I would not be happy if the figure was 90%, but 3% is shocking.  Will the Minister of State clarify why the Government is allowing this to happen?</p> <p> Turning to the Bill's provisions, mention has been made of the start-up relief for entrepreneurs, SURE, scheme.  It should be used to support families and workers.</p> <p> Regarding the concept of one man, one vote, we do not want to see the same situation here as the US presidential election with all of its court challenges.  There will be no court challenges in Ireland, but credit unions are finding it difficult to ensure the nearly sacred accountability to and representation of its members.  Members have v&oacute;ta amh&aacute;in le gach duine, fear, bean n&oacute; na daoine &oacute;ga when they are of an age to open an account.  That members have just one vote each is sacrosanct and must be protected.</p> <p> What about the role of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC?  Its name is a pity.  I am well aware of another organisation called "IFAC" in Tipperary.  It is an accountancy firm that was set up by the IFA and is not to be confused with the fiscal council.  Why have we ignored this issue and taken our eye off the ball?  For how long has there been a vacancy on the IFAC's board?  This is shameful and shows that the Government is not concentrating on supporting credit unions.  I have no comments to make about the people on the board.  I do not know their abilities.  I am sure they are good and well meaning, but one person has served two terms, which is the restriction under the Act.  I believe it is in section 14 of this Bill that the Government is asking the D&aacute;il to approve allowing people to serve a third term.  That is dangerous.  We need fresh blood and new thinking.  I sit on several voluntary community boards.  They are accountable to the State and a certain number of members have to leave the board every year.</p> <p>Finding volunteers is very onerous but we have to do it.  As I said, I support Deputy Doherty's amendments in this regard.  The voting in advance of the AGM is scary because, as the Minister of State will be aware, these things can be mutilated.  Good and honest people would do this in good faith but it could be abused and could be a process we do not want.</p> <p> I do not know what will happen as regards this legislation being passed here or when it will pass through the Seanad and be signed into law by the President.  Will we be able to hold virtual AGMs this side of Christmas?  I do not think so.  The timescale is very tight, and the credit unions must be able to ensure safety and democracy and all the security systems surrounding that.</p> <p> As for social housing, 56 homeless people have died in Dublin to date this year, and the credit unions have been ready, willing and able in this regard.  We have considered the Sparkasse model in Germany and the way other countries have adapted to help people to get housing loans.  They cannot get the loans here.  There is the Rebuilding Ireland scheme.  I heard this morning at the Business Committee that the housing committee is to waive pre-legislative scrutiny of a Bill brought forward by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy O'Brien.  We are making a lot of noise and introducing a lot of legislation but we are not building the houses.  The credit unions can play and have played a vital role in providing an opportunity to many people to upgrade and extend their houses for family members when they move on and get into relationships and have kids.  The credit unions are there for that.  The Central Bank always casts a jaundiced eye over them and they are being treated very harshly.  When one or two of them, or perhaps a few more, erred, we threw the kitchen sink at them and they were all promptly closed.  When the banks were reckless, however, and when we saw that appalling vista, we brought in emergency legislation to bail them out.  The Minister of State and I and our grandchildren and great-grandchildren will be paying that debt back for decades to come.  I voted for that legislation, much to my regret.  I have said many times in this House that it was the worst political decision I ever made in my life.  We have got nothing from the banks only disdain and mistreatment of borrowers.  In most of the banks I go into now I do not say a word to the staff behind the counter because there are so few of them.  It is robots and machines one meets now.  The banks do not want customers inside their doors.  However, I saw on Monday that the credit union in Clonmel put up a shelter for its members outside the door, on the footpath.  It gives shelter to members queuing outside at present.  I salute again the staff in Clonmel Credit Union, the board of management, the management and everybody who goes into the credit union.</p> <p> I thank the Minister of State for bringing forward this legislation.  I hope it will enable what I have spoken about.  I thank the members of credit unions and offices, the people who spoke to me about this and other colleagues.  This is a reasonable effort.  We should be making legislation to help people, especially in this severe time of lockdown, loneliness, mental health issues and God knows what else.  We will be seen to do this if we can.  I wish the Bill a speedy passage through this House and through Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  I hope it will get up to &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in and get signed and enacted into law speedily.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-12-10a.343" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1519" speakername="Cathal Crowe" time="14:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020121000036#KK00200"><p>I hope this Bill will pass the D&aacute;il and the Seanad this week without too much ado.  It is a very important Bill.  It deals with a whole level of grassroots banking, that is, the model of the credit union, which for many generations has served Ireland and its people so well.  There are three core objectives to the Bill.  The first is to amend the Credit Union Act to allow for general meetings, which are prohibited under current health regulations, to proceed.  Some of the amendments brought in will be permanent, and that is a good development.  Second, the Fiscal Responsibility Act will be amended to allow for a longer term limit for a member of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council.  Finally, the third measure would concern the Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Act 2010 and would include the European Union as a facility lender, which would allow the State to comply with certain provisions contained in the SURE loan agreement.  This is therefore very positive legislation.  It allows credit unions to function normally at a very abnormal time, and anything this House can do to allow grassroots organisations that are so positive in our community to function should be welcomed by the House and supported wholeheartedly.</p>  <p>  The credit union model has worked so well for many years in Ireland but it should also give us an opportunity to look at how we might expand community-level banking.  New Zealand has developed what is called the Kiwibank system, whereby banking and post offices work in tandem in communities providing another very successful level of community banking.  As we look to find a workable and sustainable future for our post offices in Ireland, the Kiwibank model is one we should consider again.  It has been debated in the D&aacute;il a number of times, but it is now time we had some deep analysis of it.  Covid is a perfect time, when we are at a very low starting point with everything.  We are talking about reopening the country properly only in the springtime.  Now is the time to look at sectors such as our post offices, credit unions etc. to see whether they can have a more expansionary role in the community.</p>  <p>  Banking has become rather unfriendly.  Post offices and credit unions are the friendly face of banking.  The experience people had for many decades of going into their bank, going up to the cashier, transacting with them and talking to them is gone.  Banking is now digital.  It is online.  It involves pin codes and remembering the fourth or fifth digit of a code in order to log in.  That is fine for some people, but people of my father's generation - I am not being ageist, I am being honest - cannot do this.  Banking has become unfriendly and inaccessible to them to the point that some people are back putting wads of cash into the back of the wardrobe, stuffing them into socks and so on.  That is happening in rural Ireland.  When I canvassed my county in February, there were a small handful of houses where, as I chatted to someone at the front door I could see in beyond the hall table where he or she had money left insecurely around the house.  That needs to change.  In my county, Clare, Bank of Ireland at the outset of the Covid pandemic identified three branches at which it was to scale down operations, namely Tulla, Miltown Malbay and Kilkee.  They now operate only up to lunchtime every day.  They are totally unfriendly from the point of view of trying to do business in them.  The staff there are excellent, but we need a decision made on high that these banks will be open according to normal business hours, as they were in all the years heretofore.  I have been in touch with Bank of Ireland about the Tulla branch specifically because there is no facility whatsoever to make lodgments there.  For any businesses in that vicinity, when it takes in a lot of cash or has money in its safe that it needs to deposit, there is no facility in Tulla, only an internal ATM withdrawal system inside the building.  It does not help.  It does not support businesses in the way it should.</p>  <p>  This is a very positive Bill.  I do not imagine there will be too much disquiet about it.  I hope there will not be.  It supports credit unions, something we should all get behind.  I implore the Minister of State to consider other ways of supporting community banking.  I have given the example of the Kiwibank system.  I know the banks say "hands off" quite often, but they should, where possible, be more user-friendly to people who are perhaps not IT-literate and to people in rural Ireland who may need to do weekend and out-of-hours lodgments.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the work of the credit union movement, which is a volunteer movement.  I also thank the directors, the boards of directors and the staff who work in all our credit unions.  The point has been well made that they are community-based.  Depending on the amount of time I have, I wish to address some of the issues raised.  If we have only a few minutes left, I can address them at the beginning of Committee Stage, which will follow on directly.</p>  <p>  I assure Deputies that the issues they raised about proxy votes are not a problem in this legislation.  We are proposing to allow credit unions, if they wish to change their rules in due course, to introduce proxy votes if they decide to do so.  There is no request that they should do so.  At the moment, that is specifically prohibited.  If a credit unions wants to change its rules down the road, it is free to do so.  The main issue - and I myself shared the concern when I first looked at the legislation - of people gathering up hundreds of proxy votes will be a matter for each credit union to decide as to how many proxy votes an individual can have.  In one house there might be a son or a daughter who has the two votes on behalf of his or her parents.  One might be a valid limit.  Some might say that three or four should be the limit to cover a family unit in order that one person does the voting on behalf of the family.  We are just allowing the credit unions to introduce the rules as they see fit.  As for the other issue of a non-member having a vote, I understand the point made but, in practice, if a credit union wants to do that, it is free to facilitate the case I have just mentioned in which a son or a daughter might vote on behalf of his or her parents who are credit union members but that son or daughter might not be a credit union member.</p> <p>That will all be decided by each individual credit union. I expect that some credit unions will go down this road in the coming years.  Some may restrict it to one, two or three proxy votes, while others may allow four or five.  Each credit union makes its own rules.  All we are doing is introducing a provision to allow credit unions to allow proxy votes if they wish to do so.  There is no obligation for them to do so.  Some of them will never do it.</p> <p> The issue of voting in advance was mentioned.  I will reply briefly and get into it in a little more detail on Committee Stage.  That provision is actually to facilitate a postal vote, for example.  The Bill allows a credit union to make temporary arrangements for the interim period, that is, the first three months of the new year because of the pandemic.  Thereafter, voting arrangements will have to be decided by the members at a meeting.  Credit unions may go back to having in-person meetings or they can have virtual meetings or a combination of both.  Virtual meetings would involve people using iPhones or laptops to log on securely and that being approved by the secretary or officials of the credit union.  There will also be facilities for people to phone into the meeting so that they can contribute and hear what is being said.  There is tremendous flexibility.  Some meetings will involve a combination of those who are physically present at the AGM, those attending by phone and those using technology to attend the AGM virtually.</p> <p> Some credit unions may choose to allow postal voting.  By definition, this means that members votes have to be posted in before the meeting.  If a credit union does not wish to go down that road, it does not have to do so.  We are removing the legislative obstacles that prevent credit unions that wish to go that route from so doing.  It will increase participation at AGMs if people can attend virtually or by phone.  People may not be able to attend the meeting in person.</p> <p> I genuinely believe that most of the concerns raised will not be an issue.  I am absolutely sure that directors cannot introduce rules on proxy votes in this interim period unless the credit union has already gone that route.  We are not aware of any credit union having such a provision already.  The directors cannot introduce a provision bringing in a proxy vote system when they call a virtual AGM in the interim period up until the end of April.  If the members wish to bring in such a system to be used in the future, they are free to do so.  They are not legally prevented from doing so in the future.  I understand why the issue of proxy votes was raised, but it is up to each credit union to make their rules to suit themselves.</p> <p> I will return to the issue of the IFAC and other matters on Committee Stage and provide further information at that point.</p></speech>

I am deputising for him.  I will be brief.</p><p>Amendment No. 1 relates to proxy votes.  As the Minister of State is aware, we are genuinely concerned regarding the application of proxy voting and how that would operate, as are some credit union organisations across the country.  I understand the concluding remarks of the Minister of State on Second Stage regarding how proxy votes will be introduced as an option for credit unions and that they will not be permitted to use proxy votes during the interim period.  He may correct me if I am wrong.  More work may be done by the credit union movement and, indeed, between the credit union, the regulator and the Department before the proxy voting situation could be applied, assuming that the legislation as it is currently framed is passed.  I understand that there is an urgency around allowing AGMs to take place and making modifications to the rules.  Of course, people are anxious for dividends and so on to be paid early as possible.  Under their own rules, credit unions are required to hold AGMs within certain periods of time.</p><p>Notwithstanding all that, there is a need to address genuine issues in respect of security, the general data protection regulation, GDPR, transparency and other important governance matters.  That is what amendment No. 1 is designed to do.  This is an issue of particular concern to my colleague, Deputy Sherlock, and I am interested to hear the views of the Minister of State on it.  I would also be interested if he could elaborate on whether the Central Bank was consulted regarding this particular provision, as well as the other provisions of the Bill.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-12-10a.353" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1590" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="14:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020121000037#LL00800"><p>I thank the Deputy.  To deal with his last point first, there were consultations with the Central Bank.  The existing legislation would allow the Central Bank, using its discretion, to defer AGMs until the end of April in any event.  However, we believed it necessary for the Oireachtas to decide to put that on a legislative basis.  There is provision in the Bill for further extension of the period within which an AGM must be held if the Minister is of the opinion that is necessary.  We are having this debate substantially because the physical meetings cannot go ahead because of Covid.  The whole concept behind the legislation is to facilitate credit unions, rather than to oblige them to do something.</p>  <p>  I am coming to the issue of proxy voting.  These are what I would call governance and operational matters.  The legislation will allow flexibility in that regard.  I do not think the legislation should be so prescriptive as to set out in legislation strict rules on proxy voting.  The practice in that regard will vary from credit union to credit union.  All we are saying is that credit unions may bring it in if they so wish.  The obligations in respect of GDPR and confidentiality in the context of such issues will be a matter at operational level within each credit union that chooses to go down that road.</p>  <p>  We have received correspondence from various credit unions and credit union representative bodies, including the Credit Union Managers Association, pointing out that it will be difficult.  I agree that it will be difficult.  It will the first time for organisations that wish to go the virtual route to do so.  They will have to consider security and how they will ascertain who is logging in to the meeting.  Ireland has grown up a lot in respect of virtual meetings since Covid came.  There are sporting organisations and farming organisations, including large farming organisations, that are holding virtual AGMs because their members cannot physically come together.  Those organisations are not prevented from doing so but credit unions cannot do so unless we pass this legislation.  The point of facilitating virtual meetings is to allow meetings to happen such that all the members can get the financial information in a timely manner.  It is also important for the audits to be completed and sent back to the Central Bank, which is the regulator, such that it can have a full view of the overall position of the credit union movement as soon as it is fair and practical to do so.  This legislation aims to facilitate all that.  The only real power being given to the boards of directors during this interim period is to permit them to arrange the AGM after 31 January.</p>  <p>  I stress that I already took the Bill through the Seanad.  It was passed by the Upper House on 30 November.</p> <p>Arrangements are in place for an tUachtar&aacute;n to sign it promptly, and credit unions know that this is coming down the tracks.  They will be in a position to arrange AGMs as soon as they have an ability and are free to do so as early as possible in the new year, if they wish.  Some of them might decide to wait and see what health restrictions are in place in February or March and wait to hold the AGM then, and they are free to do that.  Those who wish to do it early can do so by carrying it out virtually if the health restrictions would prevent the members coming together for a physical meeting.  It is important to stress that an AGM can be a combination of a virtual and physical meeting.</p> <p> On some other points, I understand what Deputies are saying about the issue of people voting in advance, but some credit unions might wish to allow members to have a postal vote.  It will be up to each credit union through its software suppliers to ensure the integrity of the voting, that each member gets only one vote and there is a link and a code to link into the system.  It will have to have a system that knows who sent or has not sent in a proxy vote.  I wish to deal with the proxy voting as well and the 48-hour provision in the legislation.  That is the latest possible time.  I expect credit unions to have a system in place whereby they would request their members, if they are arranging proxy votes, to have it in four, five or six days in advance.  Legislatively, however, the last possible moment will be two days in advance of the AGM.</p> <p> There was a question about some credit unions that traditionally hold their AGMs on a Monday, which would mean a great deal of work having to be done over the weekend by the organisers of the meeting.  It might involve weekend work or they could easily move the AGM to a Wednesday or Thursday or another day in the week that would not involve the 48-hour period covering a weekend.  After they get used to it on the first occasion, they will be well able to carry out the proxy voting on the second occasion.  That is if credit unions choose to go down that road.  Most of them might choose not to because of the concerns of members, while others might feel it is appropriate in family circumstances to allow the one, two or three votes.  It is also important that the legislation provides, which is obvious, that a person cannot nominate two different people to be their proxy vote, with two people arriving as proxies for one individual.  That is specifically in the legislation.</p> <p> I hope Members will see that this Bill seeks to facilitate the credit union movement in the future.  The only thing we are facilitating is the board of directors proceeding with an AGM early in the new year, if it wishes to do so.  It can do it virtually.  The board can make that call.  I also wish to refer to the reason for the seven days, if we move to the seven-day period.  Many people might get the notice of the AGM, have a look at it the following weekend and see that they must give in the details of their proxy a week in advance of the AGM.  People tend to make up their minds closer to the deadline.  They can still send it in up to seven days before the AGM, but we are providing that the latest time for its receipt is 48 hours.  It could not be any closer as it would not work physically.  As with most things, I hope people would not wait until the last minute, so it will not be necessary to have that big gathering of proxy votes.  Again, most of that can be done physically.  Some of it will be done virtually as well.  I hope the software will be in place to facilitate the credit union movement.  Many people have had to make arrangements for new technology, so I believe it will be able to do that.  They are the main points about the proxy.  I understand the concerns, as they were my immediate concerns.  However, when I looked at the details of the legislation, it was clear.</p> <p> The final point raised was how soon the credit unions can have their AGMs.  Clonmel has been mentioned in the House by every Deputy from Tipperary in the past week or so.  That credit union habitually held its AGM before Christmas so it could give members an interest refund.  That was strictly its local arrangement.  Nothing in the legislation impacts on that.  It was traditional that the credit union had its AGM early so it could give an interest refund to people before Christmas.  I have made a practical suggestion.  Many of its members might be happy to wait until it has its AGM early in the new year to get that refund, but the credit union will know the members who were reliant on getting that money before Christmas for the Christmas shopping.  It will know how much a person was due to get in a refund had the AGM taken place at the usual time.  The credit union and the member will be well able to make arrangements to tide the member over until the AGM early in the new year.</p> <p> I believe I have covered the points raised.  I might have strayed into one or two of the other amendments, but they are all germane to the credit union legislation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-12-10a.355" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1462" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="14:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020121000038#MM00200"><p>As I said, we support the legislation.  There has been engagement in the House but there has also been engagement with the Department regarding the concern about proxy voting.  It goes against the stated intention of the movement.  There are issues with Covid and the facilitation of online AGMs, but I will take that out of the equation because we are not concerned about that.  There will be support for this legislation across the House, so I am sure we will be able to conclude it in due course.  There are only two or three core issues.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State said that the legislation is not instructing or compelling credit unions to facilitate proxy voting.  However, proxy voting goes to the core of the function of a credit union.  It is about having one's account and shares, and one member with one vote.  It is that ownership model.  As has been pointed out, there could be a situation now where an individual, a non-member of a credit union and perhaps somebody who has a conflicting position to the credit union, could have up to 200 votes at an AGM.  That is a theoretical position, but it is allowed.</p>  <p>  When I look at the legislation, I wonder if it is fair.  The Minister of State is just empowering the credit unions to decide themselves.  Is he empowering the membership of the credit unions or empowering the credit union board?  Who decides whether proxy voting will be facilitated in any credit union in the State?  Is it at the AGM?  If it is, proxy voting cannot happen because the decision has not been made at that point.  Is it prior to the AGM?  That would mean the membership of the credit union would not have a say on a fundamental change in that credit union regarding how voting would be carried out, how key positions would be elected and how the positions of the credit union would be agreed.  I seek clarification on that matter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-12-10a.356" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1590" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="14:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020121000038#MM00300"><p>I am happy to clarify that.  There are two positions here.  There is the interim period, which is only for this round of AGMs up to the end of April.  It can be extended if the Minister considers it necessary to do so, but it is on the basis that we will get there by the end of April next year.  The only power being given to the board of directors is to proceed with an AGM.  The issue of proxy votes is specifically covered in section 11.  Subsection (1) states: "Subject to subsection (3), a credit union may allow in its rules for any member of the credit union entitled to attend and vote at a general meeting of the credit union to be entitled to appoint another person (whether a member or not) as his or her proxy to attend and vote instead of him or her."  In simple English, that says the credit union may allow it in its "rules", which is the important word.  The board of directors cannot do this if it is not already in the rules of the credit union.  It cannot introduce proxy votes unless it is in the rules, and we are not aware of any credit union in Ireland that has this in its rules.  The issue never came to the fore before now.  Second, it will be up to the members at a future AGM to change the rules for subsequent meetings.  It is strictly the members, and it cannot apply in the interim period because the board of directors does not have the power to change those rules.  If it is not in the rules, it cannot happen.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-12-10a.357" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1462" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="14:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020121000038#MM00400"><p>That clarification is very important.  The Minister of State is saying that according to the knowledge of the Department and the Minister, none of the credit unions currently has this in the rules.</p>  <p>As I said, many are opposed to this.  Therefore, there will be no AGM this year that will allow for proxy voting.  There may be an AGM that would have a motion to change the rules to allow for proxy voting in future years, but that would be done by the membership.  That is an important clarification.</p> <p> The second point on this measure is that, from my understanding, the credit unions do not want it, so where is it coming from?  It is not a Covid issue.  It is not a case of someone being vulnerable, as he or she has an underlying condition or is self-isolating, and he or she wants a son or daughter to attend the AGM either physically or remotely in the case of someone without access to broadband or that he or she was not technologically savvy.  It is not a Covid-19 issue because it will not apply in the Covid-19 era, it will only apply post September next year, if it applies at all.  Therefore, where is the demand coming from?  Why has the Department decided to go down this road contrary to what has been suggested by the Credit Union Advisory Committee, CUAC, in its report?  The submissions indicated clearly that people did not want this type of facilitation, if one wants to call it that, because that is what it is, it is facilitating credit unions to change their rules.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-12-10a.359" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1590" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="14:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020121000039#NN00200"><p>In December 2017, CUAC did publish a policy paper on alternative means of voting by members.  I accept that there is not a widespread view among members of credit unions that they should have proxy voting.  Some people have said that it might facilitate a greater attendance at AGMs.  We all know credit unions have thousands of members and there might be 70 people or 80 people at an AGM.  Sometimes, there can be more, but a tiny percentage of members of credit unions actually attend AGMs currently.  We think if we allow this change, that in due course it might increase the attendance and the involvement of people at an AGM.  I accept that it is not for every credit union and that some credit unions will not want to know about it but we want to make it available for those which do want to go that route.</p>  <p>  There are different types of credit union.  Some of them are geographically-based and others are industry-based and there might be different practices, for example, in a credit union that is connected with a particular workforce, which might be more inclined to go there, rather than the type of community-based one that operates in a particular geographic region.  I understand the demand for this is not overwhelming.  Some will not go near it, but for those who want to go down this route, we will remove the legal obstacle preventing them from doing so.  Let us see how it works.  That is my view on it.  If we are here in five years' time, and no credit union has done it, so be it.</p></speech>

I will curtail my remarks on the amendment.  I referenced this particular point in my Second Stage contribution.  Both amendments relate to the word "before".  The Minister of State will be familiar with them.  As I outlined previously, we have concerns about business being dealt with before a meeting takes place and they are based on issues relating to transparency, security, safety and integrity.  We need to proceed very carefully on this matter.  The truth is that, insofar as is practicable, all of the decisions should be made, not in advance but at meetings when people have access to all of the information that they need and can understand fully what is being put before them.  There is a risk of undermining governance and the manipulation of outcomes of meetings.</p>  <p>  While I do not want to stray into other aspects that are not covered by this amendment, there are concerns about the integrity of the technology and the burden that all of this might impose on credit unions that may already be stretched in many ways.  I think the Minister of State would accept and understand that.  We also have concerns about ensuring that the fitness and probity criteria and requirements are followed.  The Central Bank and the credit union movement worked very hard on that in recent years in terms of people going forward for election to sensitive positions.  These issues need to be addressed at meetings, not in advance.</p>  <p>  Could the Minister of State clarify a point he made earlier on voting in advance?  Did he mean exclusively by post or would arrangements be made for individual members or an accumulation of members represented on some occasions by a proxy, to vote by means other than by post?  That would be an important clarification.  I do not think anybody would have an issue with postal voting in advance.  The question I have is whether the Minister of State would be concerned about the integrity of the process if it is done electronically given the risk of exposure involved in that.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 3 relates to a matter Deputy Nash and I have raised concerning pre-voting.  The legislation does not refer to post but rather to electronic means.</p>  <p>  I wish to focus on one core part of the issue.  The amendment is to delete the words ",whether before or", which would not allow for pre-voting.  I know the Minister of State may say this is about enabling the credit unions to decide for themselves but if there is a belief that we should allow credit unions or banks to make up their own rules, then let them make up their own rules and let us not regulate them at all.  The Oireachtas passes laws that allow or enable credit unions to do certain things and the question is whether this is an appropriate power for a credit union to have.  The question is a genuine one that has been raised by the credit union movement itself on the impact the change could have on the integrity of the nomination committee.  The concern has been raised by the Credit Union Managers Association, CUMA, and I hope it can be addressed by the Minister of State today.</p>  <p>  In this section of the legislation the Minister proposes to introduce pre-meeting voting where members who are not present at the AGM can vote prior to it by electronic means or whichever means the credit union may decide.  As the Minister of State is aware, the nomination committee is one of the key committees established under the Credit Union Act, so it is not insignificant.  The purpose of the nomination committee is to ensure that nominees to credit union directorships meet the highest standards.  This is something we discussed previously in other legislation in this House.  It is an essential part of what is described as their fitness and probity regime, which is so important in financial institutions.  A very difficult lesson was learned in that regard by the State, not with credit unions but with the banks.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State will be aware that the Central Bank wrote to lenders and insurers on 17 November warning that they were failing to follow fitness and probity rules.  These are in place to ensure key staff meet the highest standards of confidence, honesty and integrity.  Fitness and probity are vital for lenders, including credit unions.  As part of its process regarding nominees, the nomination committee shares a report with members, those who elect the directors.  That report is shared by the nomination committee with the members and then the members elect the directors.</p> <p>Under the credit union rules, this report is shared in advance of any voting but under section 6(4)(<i>a</i>) of this legislation, a mechanism is allowed whereby votes could be cast by members before a meeting, therefore suggesting that voting would be allowed to take place before the nomination committee sends its report to members.  Consequently, members would be voting on the election of directors, which is crucial with respect to fitness, probity, integrity and all the rest, without the benefit, it could be argued, of having the nomination committee's report shared with them.  That would be crucial in informing them of voting positions.<br/><br/>The matter has been raised with the Department of Finance by credit unions and it is really important that the Minister of State clarifies this.  He commented that we can see how this will work out but perhaps in this case we should take a little more time and not allow for pre-meeting voting at this stage so we can have further discussions with the credit unions.</p></speech>

The section indicates a credit union "may" and I keep referring to that word.  We are here to facilitate and help credit unions run their businesses and the conduct of voting at an AGM should be regulated by the credit union's own rules, which vary between such credit unions, rather than through legislation.  The big change we are making in this legislation is to allow an extra three months for the process, and this requires legislation because a date is specified in legislation already tying it to the end of January.</p>  <p>  On the matter of these meetings being conducted in different parts of the country, we have all spoken about the integrity of the board of directors and key staff.  We should not tie their hands too much in legislation.  The section states: "A credit union may provide for participation in a general meeting by providing or facilitating, for that purpose, the use of electronic communications technology, including a mechanism for casting votes by a member, whether before or during the meeting."  A vote could include a postal vote, for example.  I am speculating but if people said they could not make a meeting on a Monday night and a proxy vote is either not allowed or desired, there might be the option of putting a ballot box in the credit union or wherever the AGM is being held so that people can cast the vote an hour or two beforehand in the afternoon.  There is scope for people to participate in an AGM perhaps by casting a vote by postal ballot in advance.  A credit union would not be excluded by having a ballot box at a particular location in the head office, for example, for 24 hours before the meeting if people want to vote on the day but cannot make the meeting.</p>  <p>  I hope credit unions will take such flexibility on board if they feel it is in their interests.  The Deputy has mentioned that somebody could have 200 proxy votes but I cannot envisage how any credit union would amend rules to allow anybody to have more than a handful of votes to facilitate family member or a neighbour who cannot go to the meeting.  If a credit union went to a very high number of proxy votes per person, it would be open to some big risks and it would be very hard to see how that would pass through an AGM.  Other people would feel they would be outvoted by others with a large number of votes.  I am being practical.  If some credit unions want to go with ten or 20 proxy votes, although I would not personally recommend it, they can make their own rules.  The number of votes that would at any stage be allowed by proxy will be quite limited.</p>  <p>  We know what is different here and it has been mentioned that it is the DNA of credit unions that there is one vote for each member.  Everybody understands that.  When we speak of proxy votes in the Oireachtas, people think of companies and shares where a shareholder may have 25% of the shares.  That shareholder can give a proxy vote to somebody else.  In limited companies with shares, voting strength is determined by the number of shares and it is not a case of each shareholder having one vote.  One shareholder could have the majority of votes in a company.  We often think of proxy votes in that context but the credit union movement has a principle of one vote for each person.  I expect the credit unions will keep very close to that even if they are of a mind to move a little away from it to facilitate older people who might not be able to make a specific meeting, for example.</p>  <p>  I take the point about the nomination committees.  There are practical issues involved.  We should not hold up the legislation with this and it is something credit unions might discuss.  They can consider if there is a mechanism to get the nomination committee report to members immediately before the AGM rather than being physically distributed at the meeting if some people cast their votes beforehand.</p>  <p>  People may want to hear the nominations board recommendation at the meeting and some credit unions may use this as a reason not to introduce early voting through postal votes.  People would vote at the meeting if they are there, online or in another mechanism.  It may be a reason some credit unions may not go down the early voting route while others may be happy to do it.  There is flexibility and, from a practical perspective, each credit union would have to look at a mechanism to have the nomination committee's report out before any of the members cast their vote if they choose, at a local level, to allow early voting.</p>  <p>  I am trying to be fair and reasonable.  We are trying not to be overly prescriptive and we want to give maximum latitude.  I take the point but we are not saying "On you go".  The argument I have heard since taking this role is that there is too much regulation but we are allowing scope on this.  The credit unions normally complain about too much regulation and the additional associated costs.  Members know that just a short while ago we reduced the levies that the Central Bank imposes on credit unions by more than 50% for the coming year.  It is an indication of our support of credit unions and acknowledging where they are.</p>  <p>  I am answering Members' queries as best I can and in good faith.  We all have trust in the credit union movement to do their business properly as best suits their local needs.  That is why I do not wish to include the amendment.  This been through the Seanad but we want the legislation finished well before Christmas and signed by the President as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

This is clearly critical.  We know the credit union movement is essentially the people's bank.  The Minister of State knows only too well the democratic and community-based nature of it.

Everybody is concerned about the integrity of AGMs, including proxies, timing and the secrecy of the ballot.  The Deputy will be satisfied to hear that the amendment relating to ballot secrecy is not necessary as the legislation details exactly when secret ballots are required and that the board of directors of a credit union shall be elected, in any case, by secret ballot.  We have written into the legislation that the election of the board would be by secret ballot so the amendment is not necessary.  The intention is correct but we have the same view, so the issue has been dealt with in the legislation.</p></speech>

The Minister of State heard my comments earlier about concerns raised by some sections of the credit union movement.  Proxy voting is a feature in the election of representatives to different parliaments, as is postal voting.  We do not have proxy voting in this jurisdiction but in the north east of our island, proxy voting is facilitated and has been for many years.  It is a way to increase participation.</p><p>Despite our concerns, what we have done here is to try to deal with the issue.  Proxy voting is illegal or unlawful in credit unions and will remain thus until this legislation is passed.  I note the Minister of State's comments with regard to credit unions allowing for numerous proxy votes to be held in the hands of one individual.  Obviously, casting a vote on behalf of somebody and his or her stated intention - we must assume that would be the case - is one thing but proxy voting goes further than that and many credit unions are concerned about it.  This amendment provides that a proxy voter shall not be entitled to act as a proxy on behalf of more than one person.</p><p>We are trying to reach a happy medium here.  The Minister made reference to the legislation having to return to the Seanad but the Upper House could deal with this in a matter of minutes with a degree of goodwill, as has been the case with legislation that has been sent back from the Seanad to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  Changes can be approved within minutes so there is a mechanism available if the Minister of State was willing to consider this amendment and I would encourage him to do so.</p><p>The 2016 credit union advisory committee published its review of the implementation of the recommendations of the report by the Commission on Credit Unions.  The committee noted that proxy voting was a specific concern for stakeholders.  Section 11 amends section 82 of the Credit Union Act 1997.  It deletes subsection (3) which prohibits members from voting by proxy at a general meeting of the credit union.  Section 11 of the Bill before us inserts a new section 82A into the 1997 Act which allows credit unions to provide their members with an option to vote by proxy at general meetings.  It also sets out the rules governing such voting by proxy.  These include that a proxy would have the same speaking rights as a credit union member and the same rights to vote on a show of hands and on a poll.  That is important.  At annual general meetings, as we all know from attending our own party conferences, for example, members can be delegated to vote on behalf of the branch they are representing.  If members have a free vote, the conversation or debate may have an impact on which way they will cast that vote and may also have an impact on future votes.  The issue of speaking rights and the ability to shape the views of people in the room is crucially important.  It is important in the context of proxy voters because such voters may not be members of the credit union.  The proxy could be somebody who has no right, other than being a proxy voter, to be at an AGM and somebody who has no stake in the credit union movement nationally or locally.</p><p>Serious issues have been raised with regard to these proposals, including the fact that proxy voting could lead to conflicts of interest.  Furthermore, proxy voters could exercise undue influence on voting, as I mentioned earlier.  The possibility of a proxy voter acting as a proxy for several members is what amendment No. 7 tries to address because that could lead to undue influence being exercised by a single individual.  The Minister of State argued that proxy voting is being permitted in an attempt to encourage people to attend AGMs but while I acknowledge that other measures in this legislation will do that, proxies cannot do so because proxy voters would be entitled to attend the AGM if they were members of the credit union in their own right.  The only way that proxy voting could increase attendance at an AGM is if all of the proxy voters were not members of the credit union and that might not be a good thing.  Let us take the example of a credit union AGM at which 20 people turn up.  People have the right to attend if they are members of the credit union so the only way the attendance could be increased is if those attending were not members.  We do not want to see a situation where there are 30 proxy voters who are not members of the credit union outnumbering the members, even though they are acting on behalf of members.  The Minister of State should bear that point in mind.  Concerns have been raised and this amendment would address one of those concerns by ensuring that a proxy cannot act on behalf of more than one person.  This would avoid the situation in which one person could act as a proxy for several members.  It is a reasonable proposal and I ask the Minister of State to show goodwill and take it on.  We are supporting this legislation but there is a bit of concern around this issue.  The Minister of State said that we can monitor what credit unions do in terms of changing their own rules but we need to be a bit careful here.  Limiting proxies to representing one individual will reduce some of the concerns around this issue expressed by credit unions to me and others.</p></speech>

That is why we did not want to be overly-prescriptive by limiting proxy voting such that a proxy voter can only act on behalf of one person.  I gave the example earlier of an elderly couple who want their son or daughter to represent them both at the AGM.  The Deputy is suggesting that one half of the couple can be represented by the family member while the other half will have to call on a neighbour or someone else to act as a proxy.  I see a practical benefit in allowing one family member to represent both parents.  The Deputy's intention in limiting proxies is right and we are all agreed on that.  The tenor of the debate suggests that we all believe the use of proxies should be limited to a very small number to facilitate issues like the one I just mentioned.  We do not want to allow people to gather up proxy votes.</p>  <p>  Families are part of the credit union movement.  Generations of families have been members of the same credit union but to suggest that one member of a family cannot represent his or her parents who are members of the credit union is a bit too strict.  I would be happy to give credit unions the flexibility to decide whether proxies can represent one, two, three or four members or whatever small number they think is appropriate, if they want to go there at all.  Some credit unions may agree with the points made by Deputy Doherty.  They might believe they would be opening the door too much, that if they allow one this year, it will increase to three and then to five, ten and so on.  Some credit unions may decide not to allow proxy voting at all if they are concerned that there could be abuse.  Again, we have provided that non-members can act as proxy voters because, as in the example I gave earlier, a son or daughter may not be a member of a credit union but should be able to represent his or her parents.  That is just one practical example that springs to mind.  There are other examples.</p> <p>Perhaps I might refine my wording, although I am not sure exactly what wording I used an hour ago.  We aim to improve participation at AGMs rather than attendance.  I take Deputy Doherty's point; attendance will only be increased if extra people attend and these would be non-members.  What we really want is extra participation at the AGMs.  There is a real fear that the elderly couple might not go at all.  At least if their son or daughter represents them through a proxy vote they can still participate even though not in physical attendance.  Somewhere along the line, virtual attendance may be possible.  That is what is really behind this Bill.  I know a lot of elderly people might not be familiar with this technology but many are now using Skype to talk to their children and grandchildren.  Many who we think are not able for things like this are well able and more will become able as time goes on, once they are shown how it works.  </p> <p> I understand the point about limiting proxy votes to one per person.  If credit unions are concerned about this, they can limit people to one proxy vote, or even to two or three if they wish.  If they are worried about the concept overall, they need not introduce it at all.  I feel it is not unreasonable to allow a son or daughter to represent both parents.  That is why I do not favour the limit of one proxy vote.</p></speech>

There is, however, an issue with regard to human nature.  We see this in different organisations.  In most organisations, it is difficult to get someone to stand forward and take on a role, such as the role of director.  There are other rare occasions on which someone is trying to get somebody elected for whatever reason.  In an extended family there may be seven, eight or nine individuals who have votes at an AGM but no interest in it.  There could be brothers, sisters, mothers and fathers who have never attended an AGM in their lives and who have no involvement in a credit union, bar having an account, savings or the odd loan with it.  They may not have been involved in the workings of the credit union.  This Bill allows credit unions to change their rules in a way which would allow somebody to gather up those votes.  In this way, somebody who regularly attends the AGMs may have a weighted power when voting at AGMs.  This, in itself, may have a destabilising effect on other members who decide not to do this.</p>  <p>  I am conscious of what the Minister of State has said about leaving it up to credit unions to decide themselves but he has not accepted that position on other issues.  There are serious restrictions placed on credit unions with regard to other matters, restrictions we would like to be resolved.  They are not allowed to design their own models or to decide how they lend or the limits to apply.  In this legislation, we move from a position in which proxies are illegal to one in which there is no limit in law on the number of votes a proxy attending an AGM may gather and cast.  That is challenging and it is regrettable that the Minister has decided not to accept the amendment, which is very balanced and measured given the concerns of the movement in respect of proxies.  For that reason, I will press the amendment.</p></speech>

Will the Minister of State elaborate on, and put on the record, how he believes this 48-hour period would function?  Seven days is fair, given the potential logistical issues when organising meetings.  The question of potentially having to create a unique and discrete database of qualified members who are eligible to vote at an AGM has been raised with Deputy Sherlock and me.  That could present logistical and technical issues.  We would appreciate the Minister of State's observations on that.

It is good to tease out the issue.  The decision to allow proxy voting is at the discretion of individual credit unions.  If a credit union provides for proxy voting, the legislation sets the deadline for depositing an instrument of proxy.  This deadline balances the needs of the member, who is an individual, and of the credit union, which has the resources.  It would be an unfair burden and restrictive on credit union members if the deadline was further out from the AGM, giving them less time to organise an appropriate proxy.  It should be remembered that when people get notices, they put them aside, think about them and come back to them.  It would not be appropriate for the last date to get in an instrument of proxy to be a full week before the AGM.  Many people only make up their minds as to whether to go to an AGM over the course of the week.  If this amendment is passed, it will be too late to send a proxy if somebody has not made up his or her mind not to attend a week before the AGM.</p>  <p>  These questions only arise if a credit union decides to allow proxies in the first place.  It all comes back to that.  If a credit union believes the 48-hour period would result in an administrative or technological burden and that it would be difficult to process instruments of proxy submitted three days in advance, it can choose not to go there at all.  I am thinking of the members.  What is at the core of most of what is before us today is a desire to facilitate participation at AGMs.  Telling people that they cannot arrange a proxy if they do not have their mind made up more than a week before the AGM moves the balance too far towards making members make their minds up very early in the process after receiving the financial accounts and reports to be considered at that AGM.  This measure gives members more flexibility and allows them to make up their minds three or four days in advance of the meeting.  </p>  <p>  I acknowledge that the credit union's resources might be put under pressure by the need to have the technology in place to allow for this but the balance of resources is heavily weighted in favour of the credit union rather than the individual member.  If I am asked to find the balance between encouraging participation at AGMs and acknowledging the administrative burden involved in processing applications for proxy votes, I prefer to keep the balance in favour of facilitating the member up to as late a point as is practicable, that is, two full days.  This allows members to make up their minds up to that point.  The credit unions will encourage people to get such applications in early, that is to say seven, six, five, four or three days in advance, and not to leave it until the last day.  In some cases, the processing of these applications might put an administrative burden on the credit union but I believe technology will ultimately solve that problem.  I prefer to give members the greatest opportunity possible to participate either in person or by proxy.  Requiring that instruments of proxy be submitted seven days beforehand, and forcing members to make up their minds so far out from an AGM, may have an adverse effect on people's participation.</p>  <p>  I understand the point behind the amendment.  I hope the Deputy will see that there is a balance between these two issues.  Yes, we are putting an extra burden on the credit union, but only to facilitate the members and to give them as much time as possible before the AGM to make up their minds.  On that basis, I will not accept this particular amendment, although it was worth highlighting some of the issues that may be involved should credit unions go down the road of discussing the issue of proxy votes.</p></speech>

This should not be happening.  The members of the council have done an excellent job, including the reports they give to the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, of which I am a member.  We differ on some issues and agree with others; that is the nature of it.  The council gives independent advice to the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach.  It published its report on the fiscal rules, irrespective of how we view those rules.  It produces a considerable amount of documentation that never gets discussed publicly but is of great assistance in increasing parliamentarians' depth of knowledge of the fiscal environment in which we operate.  The members have served their positions with distinction.</p>  <p>  Under the current law a member may be appointed to the IFAC for two consecutive terms.  There is nothing to stop them from being appointed-----</p></speech>

The Central Mental Hospital currently operates from a facility in Dundrum which was built in 1850.  That building is no longer fit for purpose.  Construction of a new hospital is a long-standing Government policy and a priority in the programme for Government.  A significant and historic development will occur in 2021, with the opening of the new National Forensic Mental Health campus in Portrane, County Dublin.  This facility is made up of three psychiatric centres, including a new state-of-the-art hospital to replace the Dundrum hospital.  Legislation is needed to move to the new Central Mental Hospital site.</p>  <p>  For 170 years, the Central Mental Hospital has provided secure care, specialist treatment, and rehabilitation for people at high, medium and pre-discharge levels of security.  At present, it is providing inpatient treatment to 94 people.  Most of those people are detained under various provisions of the Criminal Law (Insanity) Act 2006, with smaller numbers under the Mental Health Act 2001, as well as a small number of people who are wards of court.</p> <p>The current hospital was built on a parkland site, as the Victorians believed that people with mental ill health could benefit from space and nature.  That belief was a progressive one, and, indeed, more enlightened than the name of the facility, which was a product of its time.  Today, the language of that time is inappropriate, outdated and offensive.  Unfortunately, as some of it is written in law, I will need to quote from it at times during this debate.</p> <p> In that context, I note that the current legal definition of the Central Mental Hospital comes from the Central Criminal Lunatic Asylum (Ireland) Act 1845.  This Act provided for what was defined as a "criminal lunatic asylum" to be built.  It was constructed in Dundrum and later, under the Mental Treatment Act 1961, was renamed the Central Mental Hospital.  The provisions from those two Acts are what combine to link the hospital to its current location in Dundrum.  This Bill is needed to allow the hospital to operate from a new location.</p> <p> The Bill is short and technical.  Its purpose is to provide a lawful basis for the relocation of the Central Mental Hospital from Dundrum, County Dublin, to a new facility at Portrane, County Dublin.  It also provides for the transfer of persons detained in Dundrum to Portrane and provides for an ongoing lawful basis for their detention.  It provides for the closure of the Dundrum facility, and repeal of section 39 of the Mental Treatment Act 1961, which links the Central Mental Hospital to the location in Dundrum.</p> <p> I will now take the House through the Bill to clarify its provisions.  Section 1 deals with definitions.  It defines the meanings of some of the terms used for the purposes of the Bill, including '"relocation day", "closure day" and "former Central Mental Hospital".</p> <p> Section 2 sets out procedures for fixing a date by ministerial order for the relocation of the hospital.  The date shall be agreed after consultation with the Minister for Justice and the Mental Health Commission.  From the relocation day, the new hospital in Portrane shall be known as the Central Mental Hospital.  A copy of a map marking the location of the new hospital will be included in the ministerial order, with the original map deposited in the Department of Health.  From the relocation day, references to the Central Mental Hospital or Central Mental Hospital Dundrum in any enactment, court order or other document made before the relocation day will be read as meaning the new hospital.</p> <p> Section 3 provides that persons lawfully detained in Dundrum before the relocation day will continue to be lawfully detained in Dundrum on and after the relocation day, pending their transfer to Portrane.  During the transitional period between the relocation day and the closure of the Dundrum facility, persons lawfully detained in Dundrum will be transferred to Portrane and will continue to be lawfully detained during that transfer.  </p> <p> The specific provisions under which persons may be lawfully detained in the Central Mental Hospital are included in this section.  These are: section 202 of the Defence Act 1954, where a person is unfit to stand trial by court martial; section 203 of the Defence Act 1954, where a person has been found guilty of an offence at a trial by court martial but was, as defined by the legislation, insane at the time of the offence; section 14 of the Mental Health Act 2001, which allows for the involuntary admission of a patient suffering from a mental disorder for their reception, detention and treatment; section 15 of the Mental Health Act 2001, which allows for the period of involuntary admission of a patient to be extended; section 21 of the Mental Health Act 2001, which allows for a patient detained in another approved, psychiatric centre to be transferred to the Central Mental Hospital either for their benefit or for the purpose of obtaining special treatment; section 4 of the Criminal Law (Insanity) Act 2006, which allows the detention of a person who is accused of an offence, is suffering from a mental disorder, is in need of inpatient care or treatment for that disorder, and is not fit to stand trial; section 5 of the Criminal Law (Insanity) Act 2006, which allows the detention of a person who has been held to be not guilty of an offence by reason of insanity, is suffering from a mental disorder and needs inpatient care or treatment for that disorder; and section 15 of the Criminal Law (Insanity) Act 2006, which allows that a person, who is detained in a prison and suffering from a mental disorder for which he or she cannot be afforded appropriate care or treatment within the prison, can be transferred to the Central Mental Hospital to receive care or treatment for the mental disorder.</p> <p> Section 4 sets out procedures for fixing a date by ministerial order for the closure of the Dundrum facility as a psychiatric centre.  This date will be no later than the relocation day made under section 2.  The date shall be agreed after consultation with the Minister for Justice and the Mental Health Commission.</p> <p> Section 5 confirms that several existing entitlements for people detained under the Mental Health Act 2001 and the Criminal Law (Insanity) Act 2006 are unaffected by the changes in the Bill.  These are entitlements for a person to have his or her detention reviewed, to appeal against it, to have his or her detention revoked, where appropriate, or to be transferred from the Central Mental Hospital.</p> <p> Section 6 allows approved expenses associated with the administration of the Bill to be paid for from public funds.</p> <p> Section 7 repeals section 39 of the Mental Treatment Act 1961.  That section renamed the building commissioned in Dundrum under the 1845 Act as the Central Mental Hospital.  It must be repealed to allow the hospital to operate from its new location.</p> <p> Section 8 is the Bill&rsquo;s final section, and makes standard provisions setting out the Short Title of the Bill and arrangements for its commencement.</p> <p> For a long time now, the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum has been unfit for purpose.  While efforts have been made to refurbish and maintain the buildings, the permanent solution can only be a move to the new, purpose-built facility.  There are acknowledged capacity pressures on the hospital, of which Members of the House will be aware.  The opening of the new national forensic mental health service campus will help to address these pressures.  Bed capacity in the existing hospital is 93.  The new hospital will have 130 inpatient places.  It will be supported by the phased opening of both an intensive care rehabilitation unit, with 30 places and a ten-bed child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, unit.  The new facility will provide additional bed capacity for women, which will allow for the development of a care pathway for women.  </p> <p> Relocation to the new facility will allow for a world-class service and will ensure that modern, intensive services for those with the most complex mental health needs will be delivered to international standards of quality and excellence and to greater numbers of individuals.  I recently visited the sites of the current and future central mental hospitals and I am hugely impressed and optimistic for the future of forensic mental health services in this country.  Finally, I commend this Bill to the House and ask for the support of Members in passing it in a timely way.</p></speech>

I am aware that one of these issues is not within the remit of the Minister of State, but I need to address it today.  A significant land bank will be freed up when the Central Mental Hospital moves from Dundrum.  We are and continue to be in a housing crisis and it is important that this land is used to provide public housing.  I refer to affordable and social homes for workers and families in order that they can afford to live in Dundrum and surrounding areas.</p>  <p>  I have seen reports stating that the Land Development Agency has indicated that only 30% to 40% of the properties in this development site would be for social and affordable housing, with as little as 10% allocated for social housing.  If the Land Development Agency factors in the cost of land, then, the chances of these homes being affordable for ordinary workers and their families are slim to none.  Public land must be for public homes, social and affordable purchase and affordable rental.  This will be a real test to see if the Government is serious about solutions to the housing crisis, solutions which will put workers and families before developers.  </p>  <p>  I also am concerned that the increase in the capacity in the new Central Mental Hospital will not be enough.  In Portrane, the Central Mental Hospital will form one element of a broader national forensic mental health service campus, as the Minister of State noted.  It will, however, only have 26% more beds than at present.  I have a different figure regarding the present spaces available from that given by the Minister of State.  My figure is 103 beds, which I got from the Bill Digest of the Oireachtas Library and Research Service, while the Minister of State referred to 93.  The current number, however, will expand to 130 beds.  The Minister of State will know that the nature of these beds means they do not become vacant as they would in a standard hospital.  These 130 beds could become full very quickly with patients who could be in the hospital for a long time.  We need an urgent plan to increase the capacity and staffing levels in the hospital.</p> <p>The relocation of the Central Mental Hospital will free up spaces in our prisons, which are not the place for the mentally unwell.</p> <p> The bail system also needs to looked at because mentally unwell people are being released into society without treatment.  They are often a danger to themselves and to others.  Currently, one third of the people entering our prison system have mental health issues and others develop such issues while incarcerated.  Many prisoners released early from prison often have worse mental health problems than they had on entering.  As I said, prisons are not places for the mentally unwell.  The Minister needs to develop a mental health plan for all prisoners.</p> <p> A recent report on Irish prisons by the European Committee on the Prevention of Torture described conditions, including a mentally unwell man lying naked in his own faeces and urine in a cell.  On every level, this is wrong.  I spoke to several people who work within the Irish Prison Service who said that they do their utmost for prisoners.  I have no doubt that they do but prisons are not equipped to house the mentally unwell.</p> <p> Earlier this year, the documentary "The Guards: Inside the K" highlighted the Garda dealing with mental health.  Garda&iacute; featured in the programme called on the Government to put more resources into mental health services for those who may not have access to them.  Chief Superintendent Finbarr Murphy said that many people who end up prison have mental health issues and be believed there is a need for more support around those people, not from a criminal justice perspective, but a health perspective.  I have spoken to garda&iacute; in my area and they have said the same.  People are who are mentally unwell and in distress can act outside the norms of society and come to the attention of the Garda.  We need to put in place a more humane procedure than that available under the current judicial system.  The imprisonment of people in cells who need wraparound supports is a failure.  I have stated many times that we need 24-7 emergency access to mental health supports.  This would take pressure off the Garda and society and it would help people in need of supports.</p> <p> Provision is made in the new Central Mental Hospital for ten beds specifically for children and young people.  This will be known as the forensic child and adolescent mental health unit.  We must ensure that these beds remain separate from the main facility.  I have previously raised the draconian practice in this country of children being admitted to adult psychiatric units, in respect of which there were 54 in 2019.  We must ensure that this practice ceases immediately.</p></speech>

I am happy with the Minister of State's honesty in her opening speech in regard to the existing hospital not being fit-for-purpose.  She is spot-on.  It is archaic.  An article I read recently states:</p> <blockquote> 	It is sobering to think that the brand new, and long-awaited, national psychiatric hospital will be full within a few years, such is the demand.<br /><br />The new Central Mental Hospital, located in Portrane, in north Co Dublin, will increase the number of beds by two-thirds ...<br /><br />In anyone's books that seems like a substantial increase.<br /><br />However, because it is coming from such a low base and because the beds are being taken up by a constant stream of people being sent by the courts as a result of being found not guilty by reason of insanity ... its increased capacity will be soon swallowed up.<br /><br />Over recent years, the ability of the existing Central Mental Hospital, CMH, to take offenders from the prison system - of convicts who have been assessed as having serious psychiatric disorders - has fallen significantly. </blockquote>  <p>That is serious because we are well aware that the prison service is oversubscribed when it comes to people with mental health issues.</p><p>I want to return to the Minister of State's comment that the existing hospital is not fit for purpose.  I read the Inspector of Mental Health Services 2019 report, which found that only one compliance with regulations was rated as excellent and that the hospital scored only 69% in terms of overall compliance.  That is a shocking indictment of a hospital in which our most vulnerable patients are resident.  In the section dealing with compliance and risk, the report refers to people wearing clothing that was rated as non-compliant as being high risk.  In the context of searches, people going missing was rated as non-compliant and a high risk.  In regard to privacy, people had no privacy and, as mentioned by the Minister of State, the premises was deemed not fit for purpose.  It has failed all of the inspections.  Staffing is also an issue.</p><p>Anything that is an improvement is always welcome.  We have had a lengthy wait for this new hospital.  I am curious to know if we will have enough resources to staff it.  No doubt, there will be another inspection report in respect of the existing facility next year.  In the context of the maintenance of records, operating policy and procedure, the rules governing the use of seclusion and the code of practice for the use of physical restraint, the facility was found to be non-compliant or moderately compliant.  I suspect that much of this is down to staffing issues.  Staffing is a matter about which I am very worried.</p><p>The Garda was mentioned.  I remember when I lost my brother.  I spoke to the Bean Garda at the door and I apologised for what was happening that night.  I asked her if she was going home and if she had a family.  She told me she had two young children.  I asked her if she received any training or counselling in respect of mental health and she said &quot;No&quot;.  That was in 2002.  I am glad that has changed and things have moved on but I believe we should be putting a lot more into education for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Ambulance Service, the Fire Service and the Irish Prison Service and into resourcing them as well.  They are the first point of contact with these people.  Whether they are in or out of the prison system these are the first four services they will meet.</p><p>I want to touch on resources.  It was mentioned at the meeting of the Sub-Committee on Mental Health this morning that 114 assistant psychiatrists were taken on last year.  I know of a person who left a post because there was nothing to do.  One or two other people have since moved into the Irish Prison Service.  They are very happy and that is welcome.</p><p>I am pleased that we have moved forward.  I appeal to the Minister of State to ensure that, when this transition occurs, there will be some follow-up to make sure that staff are fully resourced and that patients are protected.  If we can get the new facility off the ground properly, we can be proud of what could prove to be a decent legacy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-12-10a.426" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1564" speakername="Duncan Smith" time="15:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020121000045#TT00300"><p>The Labour Party welcomes this Bill and will be supporting it.  In 1903, St. Ita's Hospital, Portrane, was built.  It was the most expensive building constructed by the British Government in Ireland.  In 2014, it was announced by the then Government and the former Minister of State at the Department of Health, Kathleen Lynch, that the National Forensic Mental Hospital would be built on the same campus and that it would be the most expensive hospital ever built up to that point.  I am sure not sure if the children's hospital has superseded that.  In 2014, a public meeting was held in Donabate, which is located near Portrane and on the same peninsula, to discuss this building.  It was fascinating to be there that night.  There were a number of questions from the floor about the building and the impact it would have on traffic on the Donabate peninsula .  I recall that one individual mentioned the relocation of the Central Mental Hospital as being a negative.  It was unbelievable to see the room rise up to a man and a woman and announce that the community welcomed it and that it had a long tradition of caring for people with mental health issues through the St. Ita's Hospital.</p>  <p>  The meeting that night was not about NIMBYism or people not wanting the hospital in their area.  It was about welcoming the investment and the hospital and the opportunity to care for people again on the peninsula.  From the 1980s onwards, St. Ita's went into a state of decline as we moved to deinstitutionalisation and, thankfully, people began to develop a more enlightened approach to those with mental health issues.  Therapies improved and the whole medical fraternity improved its care for people with such issues.</p> <p> For an asylum-era facility such as St. Ita's, to use the language of the time to which the Minister of State referred, that meant mental health was taken away from it.  The community wanted to continue to help, to be at the forefront and to continue that tradition and move with the times and the care.  It is most welcome that that investment will come back to Portrane and to the peninsula, and that those people will again be at the vanguard of an improved and ever more caring approach to mental health.  For the people of north County Dublin and the peninsula, and Portrane in particular, this is a proud time where the centre of their community is coming back to them.  They are ready, as a community, to care as they have done to the best of their ability over the years.  This Bill before us, which will hopefully be passed in short order, is another positive step in that direction.</p></speech>

It is a much-needed modernisation,  expansion and improvement of necessary services that work with very vulnerable people.  There are a few interesting things to note in the Bill.  The improvement of the child and adolescent mental health side of things is more than welcome.  This is a very specialist service within the child and adolescent mental health services.  It is excellent to see that.  I will avoid my usual rant about how child and adolescent mental health services are just not up to scratch and not fit for purpose.  I will bore the Minister of State with that some other time.</p>  <p>  There is a wider conversation to be had about mental health in the Prison Service.  The Central Mental Hospital operates in that grey area between mental health and prison.  As we have learned from the recent Council of Europe report on our prison services, as well as many other reports, there is a huge problem with failing to provide mental health services for vulnerable prisoners in the Prison Service.  Along with the mental health services in the National Forensic Mental Health Service, that vulnerability for mental health for prisoners is something we need to address.  Maybe the National Forensic Mental Health Service and the Prison Service can link up and there may be a chance for shared resources and knowledge.</p>  <p>  There is a commitment in the programme for Government to a high-level, cross-Department, interagency forum that would look at the issue of mental health and addiction for those in prison.  Issues with mental health and addiction can lead people down a path that will end in prison but equally, people can experience those issues for the first time when they go into prison.  We need to ensure that our prisons are able to handle these challenges and that they are not causing the problem.  We need that working group to be up and running as soon as possible.  I just wanted to take this opportunity to present that matter to the Minister of State and encourage it to be done as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  There is also a commitment in the programme for Government, about which I am talking to the Minister for Justice, to ratify the optional protocol of the UN Convention Against Torture, which would go a long way to supporting the quality service that I have no doubt both our prisons and the new National Forensic Mental Health Service will deliver.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-12-10a.434" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="16:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020121000046#UU00800"><p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this legislation.  I have had some experience of the Central Mental Hospital in my capacity as a union organiser.  Very few people in this House have ever been in it.  Not only have I been in it, but I have been in it on many occasions.  When conducting a ballot for industrial action with shift workers, I have had occasion to be in it until 3 o'clock in the morning.  I should point out, however, that I have never been in it for reasons other than work.</p>  <p>  The hospital is not fit for purpose and has not been fit for purpose for a very long time.  It is welcome that the people in it will be moving to this new facility.  However, this is not just a place where people are cared for or a place for the residents; this is also a place of work.  The people who work in the Central Mental Hospital are some of the best people and workers the Government has working in the health service.  They give 110%.  They give their all and they do so in circumstances that are inhumane for both the people who have to live there and endure them and the people working there.  This is very welcome and is also welcomed by people in Portrane.  There are some concerns about additional traffic, which I am sure can and will be addressed.  People want to keep the additional road that was put in there.</p>  <p>  I am concerned about the potential industrial relations aspects of the move.  A committee is meeting at the moment under the auspices of the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC.  While the move is only 31 km on paper, it will take workers much longer to get to the hospital because they will have to travel along the M50.  I know from representing them that an awful lot of these workers live outside Dublin, in Wicklow and Wexford, and commute to Dundrum.  This is an additional burden on them and I hope they will be adequately compensated for that.  I also hope the phased opening can be accelerated.  As the Minister of State and I both know, that can only be done if additional staff are appointed and my understanding is that there has not been much luck in appointing those staff.  I hope the 200 additional necessary staff can be recruited and that this facility can be up and running as quickly as possible.  The place these people are leaving is not appropriate and we hope the place they are going will be much better.</p></speech>

The Social Democrats welcome the Bill and support it fully.  We have been talking for a very long time about the relocation of the Central Mental Hospital from Dundrum to Portrane.  It is very good that we have gotten to this point where we are about to pass legislation to provide for that relocation and to provide the legal underpinning of that very important move.</p>  <p>  There are a few issues about which we just do not have full information, such as some of the practicalities of the move and the implications for the local Portrane area.  Deputy Duncan Smith spoke about the welcome in that part of north County Dublin for this decision and the very supportive role the community has played.  My colleague, Councillor Paul Mulville, has been very involved in the local community in support of the move and in putting in place all the necessary provisions to enable it to happen in a smooth and satisfactory way.</p>  <p>  There are a few outstanding questions and it might be helpful if the Minister of State was in a position to answer them.  Some local people have raised questions about issues associated with any kind of disturbance or problems with people detained in the new facility.  The nearest Garda station is in Swords, which is a bit away, and people are keen to know what exact provisions are in place for liaison with local garda&iacute;.  The community liaison has been very successful to date in facilitating and teasing out all the implications of the relocation.  It is important that we know if the community liaison with local residents will continue after the hospital becomes operational.  It has worked very well so far during the planning stages.  It would be a good move for that community liaison to continue, and I hope that is what is intended. </p></speech>
