What actions is the Minister taking to examine the expansion of the exemption to other mediums?</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-02-21a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1243" speakername="Josepha Madigan" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019022100003#A00500"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising the important issue of the artists tax exemption scheme which was introduced in 1969.  Under the scheme, the profits or gains accruing to a writer, composer, visual artist or sculptor from the publication, production or sale of his or her work is exempt from income tax.  Under section 195 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, the Arts Council and the then Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht drew up guidelines for determining whether a work within specified categories is an original and creative work and whether it has, or is generally recognised as having, cultural or artistic merit.  On receipt of an application for the artists tax exemption scheme, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners is empowered to make a determination that a certain artistic work is both original and creative and has, or is generally recognised as having, either cultural or artistic merit.  A work shall be regarded as original and creative only if it is a unique work of creative quality brought into existence by the exercise of its creator&rsquo;s imagination.  A work shall be regarded as having cultural merit only if by reason of its quality of form or content or both it enhances to a significant degree one or more aspects of national or international culture.</p>  <p>  The scheme allows the Revenue Commissioners to make a determination only in respect of artistic works in the following categories: a book or other writing, a play, a musical composition, sculpture; or a painting or other like picture.  Where a determination is not made, in effect, the application is rejected.  There is a right of appeal to an independent appeal body in the event that Revenue declines to issue a determination.  The exemption only applies to income taxes and does not extend to VAT.  The maximum amount of income exempted from tax is &euro;50,000 per annum.  The names of recipients of the artists exemption together with the art work for which the relief is claimed are published on the Revenue Commissioners website.  I wish to advise the Deputy that although I have not discussed the expansion of the exemption with the Minister for Finance, these matters are kept under review.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-02-21a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1271" speakername="Niamh Smyth" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019022100003#A00600"><p>It is welcome that the matter is kept under review because, as the Minister is aware, the arts have expanded in terms of the mediums and forms in which art is created.  We now have sound, multimedia and performing artists and it is very important that the scheme is updated to take account of contemporary art practice.</p>  <p>  A recent review of pay and conditions by Theatre Forum found that low pay, poor conditions and precarious work for the performing arts are having a serious impact on artists and arts workers.  Some of the statistics it uncovered are frightening.  Some 30% of performing artists earned less than the minimum wage in 2018.  Some 83% are paid flat fees rather than for hours worked.  Some 53% of art organisations do not have a pension or personal retirement savings account arrangement for their staff, while four fifths of jobs in performing arts are precarious.  Artists working through various mediums have raised the issue of working conditions with me.</p>  <p>  I fully accept that the artists tax exemption is a complicated area on which the Minister must work closely with the Minister for Finance, but it may be one avenue which could be used to address these issues.  Culture 2025 committed the Government to a critical analysis of direct and indirect supports funding arts and cultural activities and to improve funding structures through multi-annual and cross-stream funding and investment in regional and local services.  Will the Minister commit to working with the Minister for Finance to consider the inclusion of artists working through other mediums in the tax exemption scheme?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-02-21a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1243" speakername="Josepha Madigan" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019022100003#A00700"><p>It is important to note that just over 1,000 artists have been granted a favourable determination by the Revenue Commissioners since 2017 under the categories of writing, plays, musical composition, painting and sculpture.  The focus of the Government is on increasing funding for the arts in general, as evidenced by the Taoiseach's repeated commitment to double the amount of funding over a ten year period.  My Department received a 13% increase in funding in the Estimates for this year.  There has been a &euro;6.8 million or 10% increase in funding for the Arts Council, while &euro;1.2 billion in capital funding for culture, heritage and the Gaeltacht has been allocated over the ten years to 2028 as part of the national development plan.  That includes &euro;460 million for an investment programme in our national cultural institutions and a &euro;200 million audiovisual action plan which I launched last summer.  The Government will continue to give consideration to any measures to further deliver on its commitments, including the artists tax exemption which is kept under constant review.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-02-21a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1271" speakername="Niamh Smyth" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019022100003#A00800"><p>It is wonderful that 1,000 artists have availed of the exemption but I assure the Minister that thousands of artists in the creative industries are unable to access or avail of the exemption.  That is why I urge the Minister to keep an open mind on reviewing and broadening the scheme.  I invited representatives of Theatre Forum to Leinster House at the beginning of the year.  It is stark and frightening that some artists are unable to afford certain basic services such as rent, childcare and healthcare.</p>  <p>  Global Ireland 2025 committed the Government to implementing a range of further measures internationally, including the promotion of Irish arts, heritage and culture to new generations and audiences across the world.  One of the key issues raised by the representatives of Theatre Forum in January is the position of Irish artists in Ireland compared to the esteem in which they are held when they represent Ireland abroad.  This is a valid issue.  When artists attend embassies or go abroad, they are held in high esteem, but the reality when they come home is that many cannot afford rent, childcare or healthcare.</p></speech>

As we know, Fianna F&aacute;il, when in government between 2007 and 2011, cut funding for the arts by &euro;67 million.  The majority of the funding available was for the Arts Council, which the Deputy has mentioned before.  There was a decrease from &euro;206 million to &euro;139 million, which is a funding cut of 33%.  In budget 2019, Fine Gael saw funding rise by 37% since the time of the cuts in 2011.  This is a rise to a sustainable level.  Fianna F&aacute;il, when in government between 2007 and 2011, cut the budget to an unsustainable level.  I have outlined a commitment the Taoiseach has given to double funding in this area by 2025.  We are doing a considerable amount to achieve that.</p></speech>

In the run-up to the centenary commemoration of 1916, a number of capital projects were announced.  They were completed in the years running up to 2016.  What are the plans for permanent capital projects for the forthcoming period?</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-02-21a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1243" speakername="Josepha Madigan" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019022100004#B00500"><p>A capital programme of major restoration and development projects was initiated under the Ireland 2016 centenary programme to mark the centenary of the 1916 Rising.  The most recent guidance of the expert advisory group on centenary commemorations, which I published on 8 January, highlighted the fact that the decade of centenaries created unprecedented opportunities for people of all ages to consider and explore some of the most significant events and themes in the history of modem Ireland.  The group recommended that this positive engagement and the associated tangible, long-term benefits continue to be supported beyond the conclusion of the decade in 2023 and that State support be considered for specific, significant decade of centenaries permanent legacy initiatives.  This is a view that I very much share.</p><p>One such legacy initiative is Beyond 2022: Ireland's Virtual Record Treasury, which the expert advisory group has endorsed as a potentially very significant and lasting decade of centenaries legacy initiative, combining historical research, archival conservation, technical innovation and international collaboration.  This project seeks to reimagine and recreate, through virtual reality, the Public Record Office of Ireland and its archival collections, which the Deputy may know were destroyed on 30 June 1922 in the opening engagement of the Civil War.  It is recognised that, while incomparable with the loss of human life, this cultural loss was one of the great tragedies of the Civil War.  A significant national legacy project such as this, which emphasises the importance of open, inclusive and participatory access to authentic archival sources, would support the State very appropriately in its approach to the remembrance of the challenging and sensitive historical events over the remainder of the decade.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>The expert advisory group also welcomed the Government's commitment to capital investment of almost &euro;1.2 billion in Ireland's culture, language and heritage over the next ten years under Project 2040 &mdash; the National Development Plan 2018&ndash;2027.  In its second statement of principles, published in October 2017, the advisory group expressed the strong view that &quot;the opportunity to encourage scholarship at national and local level must be used as fully as possible, with particular emphasis on archival investment and development.&quot;  This significant capital investment will ensure that our cultural institutions and archives will continue to have a central role in continuing the process of broad public engagement, creating an important, tangible legacy that endures well beyond the decade of centenaries for generations to come.</p></speech>

I welcome the information provided.  Two major stores of historical information were destroyed, one when the Free State Army attacked the Four Courts and the other when, under de Valera, the IRA attacked the Custom House.</p>  <p>  My question was trying to build on capital projects such as that at Richmond Barracks, the GPO, Teach an Phiarsaigh and the Military Archives, which are now permanent reminders of the events of 1916 and the role they played in developing our society.  Other than the digitisation projects, is any specific project planned?  Has the Minister invited the national cultural institutions to submit applications for substantial funding for new wings, for example, to add to our institutions, or even for local authorities to have appropriate commemorative statues and memorials built in the forthcoming period?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-02-21a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1243" speakername="Josepha Madigan" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019022100004#B00800"><p>With regard to Beyond 2022, I approved in January a funding allocation of &euro;95,000 to support the transition phase of the project, which will, to some extent, be a capital project of the kind the Deputy speaks about.  I have requested my officials to engage with the project team to ensure that an appraisal is carried out in line with the requirements of the public spending code and to ensure that the appropriate structures, governance and monitoring arrangements are put in place.</p>  <p>  It might be helpful to the Deputy to be reminded of the expert advisory group's advice.  It is suggesting a four-strand approach.  It is talking about a State ceremonial strand, which will comprise a limited number of symbolic acts of national commemoration focusing on themes of remembrance and reconciliation and the commemoration of all those who lost their lives during the period in question.  The group also talks about an historical strand, which will comprise a diverse range of activities designed to encourage authentic historical inquiry about the period and promote the use of primary archival sources.  Some initiatives will be developed in collaboration with State partners, national cultural institutions, institutions of learning and other stakeholders.  There will also be a community strand, which will involve a collaborative approach, similar to that adopted for the 1916 centenary commemorations, between the State, the local authority network, perhaps Dublin City Council in respect of the Deputy's area, as well as national community organisations, including in Northern Ireland, where appropriate.  There will also be a creative imagination strand, which will continue to encourage artistic and creative expression in remembrance of the significant historical events.</p></speech>

Will the Minister revisit this aspect?  To have a permanent structure built and opened as part of the centenary events over the coming years, planning would have to have begun.</p></speech>

What I am trying to point out to the Deputy is the advice of the expert advisory group on commemorations in general.  The local authorities will have a significant role, including Dublin City Council.  There will be an event on 13 March at which the local authorities will come together collectively and will be in a position to explore ideas they may have for the commemorations over the next decade.  A number of events are planned.  I outlined the general themes.  There will be ceremonial events in 2021 on the signing of the Truce.  In 2022, the centenary of the foundation of the State will be commemorated.  There will be a ceremony of reconciliation and there will be a significant academic conference.  The President is involved in respect of a sculpture related to last part of the decade of centenaries.  It will be up to the local authorities and all the people in this country to decide whether they wish to have something suitable in terms of a capital project.</p></speech>

I have written to the Minister about the Land Commission records, which were an all-Ireland set of records.  They are publicly available in Northern Ireland but completely private in the Republic.  They date back to approximately 1892.  The critical issue is that a new arrangement came into place in 1922 across all Departments.  This is an example of something that could give some sort of lasting legacy in the same way as the military pension records resulted in a lasting archive in regard to the 1916 commemorations.</p></reply>

I received her letter and I understand an acknowledgement was issued.</p>  <p>  All matters concerning records of the Irish Land Commission are a matter for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and I have no function in this regard.  As the Deputy will be aware, this is a very complex and sensitive area.  I have had initial inquiries made of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and it has no immediate plans to make the estimated 8 million former Irish land Commission records, located at the record storage facility in Portlaoise, generally available to the public for research purposes or otherwise as these are, in its view, still working documents.  Officials of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine regularly access these records to service queries from the public relating to current and past transactions and for the full completion of the work of the former Irish Land Commission.</p>  <p>  Owners and purchasers of land and their personal or legal representatives are allowed access to and copies of relevant documents and maps.  The records storage facility in Portlaoise is not in a position to provide a research facility, as the provision of such a service would require much greater resources than those currently available.  I am advised that many of these files contain private and personal information and, as such, are subject to data protection, including estates' title deeds lodged in the former Irish Land Commission by landed families when the land was being transferred.  I am conscious of the enthusiastic public interest in obtaining access to the vast repository of former Irish Land Commission documents held.  However, wider access will be a matter for consideration when the completion of the work of the former Irish Land Commission is at a more advanced stage.  Furthermore, the records that are available in paper format are fragile, some of them dating back as far as the early 1800s and this resource is irreplaceable in the event of loss or damage.  To maintain the records, it is essential they are handled and stored appropriately.  I am advised that opening up access to these files cannot be considered until appropriate measures are undertaken to minimise potential damage from routine handling.</p></speech>

The corresponding records up to the foundation of our State are publicly available in the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland so it is difficult to understand why they are not publicly available here.  I accept these are paper records and that they are fragile and need to be handled and digitised to enable access without compromising the data source.  The type of information available in some of these records is of enormous genealogical value.  They include tenant books and other means of establishing title that will be a very valuable resource.  It is entirely appropriate to consider these in the context of the decade of centenaries because land played such an important part in our history.  It would be a legacy for the future if the records up to 1922 were made available.  I would argue that publication of records dating further back would be appropriate.</p></speech>

In 1923, the Land Commission was reconstituted to recognise the Free State.  The Land Commission archive has two main components, the records branch and the administration branch.  The Deputy mentioned these records are publicly available in Northern Ireland.  We do not hold the records in question in the same way as the corresponding records are held by the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland.  We cannot, therefore, make them available for public scrutiny.</p>  <p>  As I said, these documents remain, in part, working records of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and any proposals for public access would, therefore, require careful consideration.  The commission's work obliged it to establish who had legal title to the properties, which is a hugely complex task and so it began to collect wills, correspondence, State records, family tree records, lease books, tenants' lists, maps, deeds and more.</p></speech>

We are discussing historical documents.  While our lifespan is pretty good I do not think it stretches back to the early 1880s or, for most people, the early 1920s.  What I am hearing is the Minister's refusal, put in a nice way.  This is a missed opportunity.  I ask that the commission be specifically asked about these records.</p></speech>

As of 1 February 2019 the National Archives has received transfers of 154,579 files in archival boxes, relating to the termination of fair rents by the former Irish Land Commission, which the Deputy mentioned in her letter.  Unfortunately, the National Archives are currently unable to make these publicly available owing to a lack of suitable storage space from which they could be retrieved for public consultation in its reading room.  This situation is likely to continue until such time as the archives repository project is completed.  In addition, the National Archives does not have sufficient archival staff to carry out the processing and checking work necessary before the records can be released to the public.</p>  <p>  I am advised that as these archives are still required by the Irish Land Commission for the purpose of the discharge of its ongoing statutory functions it is not possible to transfer the fair rent order files to the National Archives. </p></speech>

The differential would be addressed by closing the gap.  I understand the content of independent productions was of equal but a separate concern and it should be addressed separately.  For those who work on the ground in the sector, closing the gap would make a major difference.  Have actions been taken to examine the differential and mechanisms by which it could be closed?</p></reply>

I was very pleased to be in a position to increase funding for it to &euro;75 million in 2019, an increase of &euro;6.8 million, which is equivalent to an increase of 10% on the figure for 2018.  I understand the council recently announced the level of its 2019 funding for the Abbey Theatre to enable it to undertake an extensive programme of work for audiences, both in its home theatre and on tour.  The council will also support the development and presentation of new work in co-productions with some of the most exciting theatre artists making work in Ireland today.  Separately, the council continues to invest in established theatre producing organisations such as the Gate Theatre, the Druid Theatre Company and Rough Magic, as well as companies which are presenting new work to audiences in new ways such as ANU, Broken Talkers and Thisispopbaby.</p><p>The Arts Council which is independent in its funding decisions under the Arts Act 2003 operates within a published ten-year strategic framework entitled, Making Great Art Work<i>.  </i>The strategy prioritises support for artists throughout their careers by the involvement of many agencies in cultural provision, the impact of the arts on the creative economy and the depth and breadth of people's engagement with the arts.  In the area of artist support the council now includes as an assessment criterion an organisation's policy on the remuneration of artists.  It aims to ensure organisations in receipt of Arts Council funding will offer fair and equitable remuneration to artists.</p><p>As Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, I have responsibility for setting the overall vision and strategic direction of Ireland's cultural sector.  In the first instance, issues raised by theatre practitioners should be resolved by dialogue between the theatre chair and board, directors and the theatre practitioners.  I am pleased to report that this dialogue is taking place between the parties, including, I understand, on the legal and commercial issues surrounding remuneration for artists.</p></speech>

The Minister did not address that issue in the first part of her response, although perhaps she might do so in further replies.</p>  <p>  The Arts Council will, of course, have a pivotal role to play in terms of the future of the Abbey Theatre in the light of the decision to restrict funding.  The response to the issue in hand is punitive and there may be an opportunity to introduce a co-operative element.  Independent productions are vital to the long-term success of Irish theatre.  We risk being in a position where too much focus will be placed on the Abbey Theatre, with other sources of talent potentially being left behind in the rush to protect the national theatre.  The Abbey Theatre's letter stated the national theatre reducing its production output would mean that there would be less diversity, but the opposite is also true.  Removing opportunities to access the national theatre, where appropriate, could also represent a loss.  What mechanisms are being considered to improve remuneration for those who work in independent productions?</p></speech>

I can inform her that a meeting took place between representatives of theatre practitioners and the Abbey Theatre on 1 February.  I am pleased to report the meeting was described by both parties as positive and a productive first step.  They have agreed to continue the process of having bilateral meetings to deal with the matters raised by the theatre practitioners, to some of which the Deputy alluded.  They have agreed to provide a progress report for the Arts Council and my Department.  It should be noted the council has been engaging with the Abbey Theatre in recent months on the employment opportunities and remuneration rates it provides for Irish-based artists.  The Abbey Theatre has made it clear that it pays the actors it employs the terms and conditions agreed with Irish Equity, the actors' union.  In presentation or association arrangements it does not set rates of pay.  That has been the prerogative of the producing companies.  The Abbey theatre has stated the matter will be reviewed in the dialogue with theatre practitioners.</p></speech>

I appreciate that in the initial meetings the response appeared to be positive.  However, there is a question about the supports in place for independent productions.  As a result, there has been a reduction of 54% in the number of actors appearing on stage who are directly employed by the national theatre.  The reduction in pay can be as much as 25%.  As there is a matter to be addressed, will the Minister expand on what her approach will be in dealing with the disparity?</p></speech>

As I stated, I acknowledge the necessity for the national theatre to have a degree of artistic freedom in its programming, as all theatres should, but I also recognise the necessity for a strong working relationship with theatre practitioners.  This is vital for the continued success of theatre in this country.  I am very supportive of the collective endeavours of theatre practitioners and the Abbey Theatre to resolve the matters raised.  I welcome the commitment they have given to participate in dialogue and engagement.  I look forward to there being a mutually satisfactory outcome.</p></speech>

Under the community strand, I am encouraging a collaborative approach, similar to that adopted for the 1916 centenary commemorations, between the State, the local authority network and community organisations, including in Northern Ireland where appropriate.  It is, I believe, very fitting that local authorities have a leading role in supporting inclusive, respectful and meaningful community-led commemorations that remember all of the lives lost, augmented as appropriate with support from the State, which will be considered on a case-by-case basis.  In recognition of the very important role that local authorities have played to date, and will continue to play, in encouraging measured and authentic citizen engagement, which is sensitive to the local context, I have requested my officials to organise a special decade of centenaries forum for local authorities, which, as I have said, will take place on 13 March.</p><p>With regard to the Deputy&rsquo;s specific query, I can confirm that I have approved funding of &euro;5,000 to support each local authority, including Wexford County Council, in developing commemorative activities in 2018.  I will make a further announcement in respect of funding for 2019 shortly.  Funding allocations over the coming years will be considered as part of the annual budgetary Estimates process.  I encourage local authorities to adopt a broad focus in responding to the significant events and themes of this period, which recognises all of the dimensions interwoven with the conflict, including military activity, the political context and the social, economic and cultural aspects and legacies.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i></p><p>I believe that, building on the success of the commemorative programme to date, local authorities, our national cultural institutions, trade unions, the media, institutions of learning, and custodians of records, together with creative communities, will have a leading role in supporting the national conversation about the events of this period and encouraging respectful and authentic engagement, debate and analysis </p></speech>

Obviously the period between 1916 and 1923 was very turbulent throughout the country but particularly in Wexford.  In 1916, Wexford rebels took Enniscorthy town during the Easter Rising and subsequently Wexford was very active in the War of Independence and the Civil War.  During the War of Independence there were numerous attacks on Royal Irish Constabulary barracks, the Black and Tans were introduced and there were raids and counter raids.  It became quite vicious.  Many people in Wexford were imprisoned and often mistreated and tortured.  Many escaped from these prisons.  After the treaty was signed, the IRA in Wexford was very much split down the middle and Wexford was very heavily involved in the subsequent Civil War.  In their book, local historians Nicholas Furlong and John Hayes state the split between anti-treaty and pro-treaty adherents was countrywide but County Wexford became one of the most violent counties in the Civil War.  The conflict, which scarred and divided families, followed the pattern of guerrilla warfare.</p>  <p>  Will the Minister outline what the Department intends to do in terms of commemorating in County Wexford events from the War of Independence and the Civil War?  She mentioned an announcement of further funding.  When will that be made?  Will a list be available of the events it is intended to commemorate in County Wexford?</p></speech>

I have heard what the Deputy said about 1916 and the commemorative events that took place in Wexford.  The restoration of the Enniscorthy Athenaeum was important.  There was an interactive 1916 exhibition and a local authority grant scheme.  It might be good for the Deputy to know Wexford County Council did not make a submission in the public consultation on commemorating the decade of centenaries.  A total of 20 submissions from local authorities were received, none of which was from Wexford.  This is not to say it would be precluded from participating in the local authority collective group on 13 March.  It would then be in a position to make a submission by 30 April with any idea it has on the key themes from the expert advisory council and the points it wishes to take on board.</p></speech>

Obviously careful thought and planning of these events must take place.  To this day, memories are still raw.  The 2016 events were very well received in County Wexford and it is imperative the same sensitive note is forthcoming for upcoming events.  Commemorations should take place and sensitivity should not be an excuse for avoidance.  This is about our history, the birth of our nation and Ireland rightly taking its place among the independent nations of the world.  I am somewhat surprised that Wexford County Council did not make a submission as it was very heavily involved in 1916 events.  Perhaps it may have been an oversight on its part.</p></speech>

The &euro;5,000 for each local authority mentioned by the Minister is obviously an initial payment to help them with their plans.  I hope the Minister will ensure a substantial amount will be available to encourage local authorities to match whatever funding she comes up with and to follow on the success they had to deal with the next five or six years of the centenary programme.</p></speech>

It is worthwhile reiterating some of these, including that local stories and experiences, which both Deputies have mentioned, will be significant and local research scholarships and access to local archival sources will support communities in exploring and reflecting upon these events.  A collaborative approach is something that would be of assistance.  Local cultural organisations and the library networks have a significant role to play as cultural brokers in managing conversations, building relationships and engaging communities in a meaningful way through the various forms of creative expression.  There will be great opportunities for each county to become involved.</p></speech>

A budget of &euro;7.15 million was provided as part of budget 2019 to further the delivery of the Creative Ireland programme.  This will ensure the Department can build on the work accomplished in 2017 and 2018, continue to drive implementation of the programme at local level and fund specific projects, actions and priorities that further the wider aims of the programme.</p>  <p>  A total of &euro;1.86 million of the above budget has been allocated to the implementation of the creative youth plan in 2019.  This includes doubling the number of creative schools from 150 to 300 primary, post-primary and Youthreach schools, increasing continual professional development courses and broadening our reach beyond the arts to creative practices among other initiatives.</p>  <p>  A sum of &euro;2 million has been allocated among all 31 local authorities to enable them implement their five-year culture and creative strategies, which I launched last September with An Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, whose Department is providing an additional sum of &euro;1 million to local authorities.</p><p>Each local authority will, therefore, receive a total of approximately &euro;96,000 in 2019 to fund a comprehensive local programme of activities.  Some &euro;800,000 has been allocated lo Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g, which will take place on 15 June 2019 and which aims to get children and young people involved in creative activities with an emphasis on making, doing, seeing and experiencing.  Every local authority has been allocated specific funding in addition to its programme funding for local activities.  We will also be running an extensive awareness-raising campaign nationally and regionally to get as many young people involved on the day as possible.<br/><br/>Approximately &euro;1 million has been allocated to the national creativity fund, which was launched in May 2018.  The 30 partnership projects being funded under this scheme were initiated in 2018 and will significantly add value, scale or both to the wider implementation of the programme.  They will also help inform policy and cross-sectoral development in the area of culture, creativity, health and well-being.  The scheme focuses on three areas: individual and collective well-being; innovation; and connecting communities.<br/><br/><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i><br/><br/>The remainder of the budget will be agreed in the coming weeks in line with the priorities for the Creative Ireland programme in 2019.  These priorities include enhancing the potential of the wider creative industries.  Other costs relating to targeted citizen engagement initiatives, research and costs associated with the effective running of the Creative Ireland programme office will also be agreed in the coming weeks.<br/><br/>The Deputy will appreciate that the overall allocations to each of the above elements at this point are approximate and may vary throughout the year as the programme unfolds.  The matter of funding in 2020 will be examined in the context of the usual annual budgetary Estimates.</p></speech>

I am really anxious that schools in the delivering equality of opportunity in schools, DEIS, system and schools in less well-off areas are able to access this very important programme as soon as possible.  Perhaps the Minister could tell us about that.</p>  <p> The second point I want to make is that much of Creative Ireland will result in events at local community and regional level.  That is all to the good.  However, there is a crisis in the arts community concerning remuneration for people who work in the arts, who are employed not on a full-time basis but part-time or as events arise.  Does the Minister's Department have an embedded policy to ensure that people working at different levels in these programmes get a living wage, or at least a minimum wage?  I am not aware of the Department having a policy of ensuring that all the people employed on a part-time, full-time or temporary basis at the events it supports are paid a living wage. </p></speech>

DEIS schools are the subject of another parliamentary question, as is the issue of the minimum wage.  I can address those now.  I will go into DEIS schools in more detail in reply to the Deputy's other question.  If my memory serves me correctly, 41 DEIS schools are involved.  Many schools can participate in the creative youth scheme.  It cannot be open to just one type of school.  It has to be a cross-section.  If my memory serves me correctly, 41 out of the 150 schools participating in the present scheme are DEIS schools.  I note also that the scheme will be expanded to 300 schools.</p>  <p>  In regard to the national minimum wage and a living wage, I note that as a voluntary initiative the living wage has no legislative basis and confers no statutory entitlement.  The national minimum wage, on the other hand, has a legislative basis.  It confers a statutory entitlement on employees and a statutory obligation on employers.  I am not sure of the other questions the Deputy mentioned.  In general, Creative Ireland will receive funding of &euro;7.15 million, which is an increase of &euro;1.15 million this year.  It will primarily support the culture and creativity teams established in every local authority and allow for the continued roll-out of the creative youth programme, which is of wonderful assistance to children. </p></speech>

The Minister and the Government will be aware that rents are now sky high.  If people involved in the arts are to live independent lives it is critical that all the funding organisations that deal with the arts support a move to at least a minimum wage, and preferably a living wage.  When I was T&aacute;naiste, I secured a deal with Fine Gael to advance a minimum wage in this country and set up a Low Pay Commission to look at issues affecting people on very low pay and in precarious work.  The arts are particularly affected by this.  Is the Minister is developing any kind of policy to deal with the real problem of very low and precarious pay and work in the arts sector, particularly among young people?</p></speech>

The current Government and I, as Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, have been increasing capital and current funding for the arts back to sustainable and required levels.  While the Deputy criticises support for artists, as Minister for Social Protection she introduced the heavily criticised JobBridge programme, which the National Youth Council of Ireland said required significant reform if it was to provide participants with a worthwhile experience that would help them to secure employment.</p>  <p>  The Deputy raised the idea of precarious employment, which she has done on numerous occasions in this House.  With regard to legal protections for workers across the arts sector, it is important to note that employees in every industry and sector are entitled to all existing legal protections.  As Members will be aware, legislation sponsored by my colleague, the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, is working its way through the Houses.  This should improve the security and predictability of working hours for employees on insecure contracts and for those working variable hours.  The existing protections of employment law also have a role to play .  There are institutions for reporting abuse of employment legislation, as the Deputy is aware.  I am satisfied that in general the industry works to a high standard.</p></speech>

I know she has met various people.  We had a searing presentation a couple of weeks ago from mostly young people working in the arts outlining how precarious and low their income was.  The Minister chose to go back to the bank collapse in this country.  Happily, I was part of the Government that got the country out of the mess it was in but we do not have time to debate that now.  Now, on the Minister's watch, young people in the arts are increasingly finding it next to impossible to make a decent living.  Does the Department have a policy?  Does the Minister have a policy for practitioners and people working in the arts?  What we heard in the recent presentation in the AV room would draw a tear from a stone.  Young people cannot afford rent because they are working in the arts.  They love what they do but they need a living wage.  Older people in the arts literally cannot afford rent and cannot qualify for social housing.  I am asking the Minister to get engaged.</p></speech>

The Government's focus is on increasing funding for the arts and we have been doing that.  This is evidenced by the Taoiseach's repeated commitment to doubling funding over a ten-year period.  As I said, there is a 13% increase in funding for my Department in this year's Estimates.  There is a &euro;6.8 million increase in funding for the Arts Council of Ireland - an increase of 10% - which the National Campaign for the Arts welcomed.</p><p>Capital funding of &euro;1.2 billion was announced, as part of the national development plan, for culture, heritage and the Gaeltacht over the ten years to 2028.  It includes a &euro;460 million investment programme in our national cultural institutions and a &euro;200 million audiovisual action plan which I launched last summer.  The Government will continue to consider measures to deliver further on its commitments.  It will balance supports, however, to ensure they are felt across the sector.  I am pleased that we, in Fine Gael, are doing everything we can to support artists with the resources available.</p></speech>

While there are temporary measures in place to try to facilitate some services, there is a cultural void in the absence of the theatre and the cinema.  I have raised this issue with the Minister previously.  It is going to be expensive to redevelop the Briery Gap.  There is significant local funding, with almost &euro;1 million allocated by the county council, but national funding, however, has been very poor.  It comes to only 6% of the overall cost of the redevelopment.  Will the Minister outline what kind of funding streams will be available?</p></reply>

To date, funding of &euro;10.214 million has been allocated to 134 projects under three complementary grant streams.  This is the most significant investment in cultural infrastructure in a decade with funding provided to a range of facilities, including arts centres, theatres, galleries and museums, as well as artists' studios and creative spaces.   A substantial grant was allocated before to the facility to which Deputy Aindrias Moynihan refers.  A full list of all successful projects is available on my Department's website for his information.</p>  <p>  Due to the exceptional circumstances in the case to which the Deputy refers, my Department was supportive of assisting with the reconstruction of this building, under the above mentioned scheme.  My Department offered to provide funding of up to &euro;250,000 to Cork County Council, in principle, to assist with restoration and enhancement of the Briery Gap.  That funding offer was dependent on clarity concerning all reinstatement issues, including the contribution from insurance, and subject to acceptance by the council of the conditions attached to this funding.</p>  <p>  I understand, however, that the council's reinstatement proposal is significantly more ambitious than the available finance and the council has been in ongoing engagement with officials in my Department regarding the project and the funding shortfall.  The council may also have other options open to it to close the funding gap.  My Department will maintain contact with council in this regard.  My grandfather was born outside of Macroom and it is a place close to my heart.  We only have certain resources available to us, however.  Project Ireland 2040 has given explicit recognition to the importance of our culture, language and heritage in general.  It sets out significant investment on a phased basis over the next ten years, including &euro;40 million to secure existing investment in arts and culture infrastructure nationwide and to ensure a regional balance. </p></speech>

Substantial funding has been put in place from a number of different sources but there is still a gap of about &euro;1.5 million.  We need somebody with deep pockets, such as the Government, to bridge a gap of that size.  The county council has already committed more than &euro;1 million to the project.  The &euro;250,000 made available by the Department is positive but it is still only 6% of the overall cost.  Additional funding is needed.  We understand an arts and cultural capital scheme is being discussed.  Is that scheme in place?  How much funding is available for the scheme?</p>  <p>  Project Ireland 2040 is far away and we have been without the theatre and the cultural centre for several years already.  Realistically, we need to move on this faster than 2040, 2030 or even 2025.  Is there a scheme in place at present from which the Minister is considering funding?  What kind of moneys are available in that scheme?  Does the Minister have an active proposal for Briery Gap?  There was great disappointment locally when the rural regeneration scheme did not provide any funding and we need to see if there is another active scheme from which the Minister might consider funding this project.  </p></speech>

That was due to the exceptional circumstances.  There is no question of the merit of this theatre.  It is unfortunate that the insurance did not cover all the costs and that there is a gap.  It is a community arts and cultural facility which included a 200-seat theatre space and associated sports facilities, as well as a public library and an exhibition space on the ground floor.  It has been operating as a theatre since 2000.</p>  <p>  I will be opening the capital scheme again shortly and I am sure the Briery Gap will be in a position to apply.  It will be a competitive process requiring a combination of funding sources to bridge the existing gap.  We also gave other capital funding to the Briery Gap, including &euro;30,000 under the ACCESS II scheme in 2007 for health and safety works and other equipment.  It also got &euro;10,000 in 2013 under the small capital grants scheme for the purchase of carpets and I know that funding was drawn down.  </p></speech>

How much will be available to distribute to places such as the Briery Gap?  Have there been applications already?  We are being told locally by party colleagues that funding has already been committed for Briery Gap and that it is on the way.  Will the Minister confirm that or is somebody else approving arts funding on this project?  Will she also clarify how much will be able to distribute through that new scheme when it is up and running?  Given the gap in funding is about &euro;1.5 million, and the council has already put in substantial funding, what scale of funding would the Minister expect to be distributing through those schemes?  Sums of &euro;30,000 and &euro;250,000 are positive but when a job costing more than &euro;4 million is being undertaken, we need a commitment of more than just 6% from the Government.</p></speech>

From experience to date, the Department has noted better value for money from providing smaller grants to organisations.  When a new round opens, therefore, the maximum grant most likely will be in the region of &euro;200,000 to &euro;300,000.  It is most likely, however, that a smaller capital scheme for amounts up &euro;50,000 will be announced.  We are in the process of elaborating and expanding on that scheme.  I already mentioned some of the funding Briery Gap has received in the past.  I also know that under the Department's philanthropy leverages scheme, Briery Gap received &euro;2,500 for the production of "Titanic: Message in a Bottle" in 2012.  The organisation again applied in 2013 and received another &euro;2,000 towards the all-Ireland transition year drama festival.  It is an important cultural venue and I am aware of that.</p></speech>

One of the conditions requires that hares may not be coursed more than once on the same day.  In addition, the licence specifically requires that hares that have been coursed can be readily identified to ensure that this condition is rigidly observed.</p>  <p>  I agree that there may be some merit in considering the issue of microchipping of hares at coursing meetings and I have requested officials of my Department to examine the possibility of perhaps introducing a pilot project at some coursing meetings during the 2019-2020 season in consultation with the Irish Coursing Club.  Officials of my Department have already made contact with the Irish Coursing Club in this regard.  It is certainly a method used in the tracking, quantification and assessment of certain species in the wild and if it aids the welfare of the wild animal and can be feasibly, safely and cleanly done, then it merits that consideration.  I thank Deputy for suggesting it as a way to ensure the safety and welfare of hares.  I would be open also to receiving submissions from animal welfare bodies on the question of microchipping, as the Deputy mentioned.</p>  <p>  I am aware that the Deputy has raised the issue of illegal - the Deputy mentioned trafficking - trading of hares previously and the suggestion of microchipping is made in that regard too.  I can assure the Deputy that any allegations made to my Department about illegal trading of hares will be investigated where possible.</p></speech>

While recognising that the opinion of the ICC have been sought already, I would ask how the welfare groups, such as Irish Council Against Blood Sports, ICABS, have an input.  Can they now contact the Department?  Is there someone they can talk to?  Of course, the licence currently states that one cannot do this activity.  One cannot traffic in or reuse hares, but the reason the issue of microchipping is being raised is it is difficult to police that, even with the tagging.  There have been some graphic examples of unscrupulous characters hanging around outside coursing events selling on hares to clubs.</p>  <p>  This is a significant concern for many rural communities as well.  Garda&iacute; in Kerry have been on the airwaves about pursuing these hunters who are coming onto land, collecting hares which they should not be doing and then "casing the joint" as well.  It is necessary that we would move to the next stage.</p></speech>

If anybody the Deputy knows has any information, I ask her to get him or her to contact the Department or the National Parks and Wildlife Service.</p>  <p>  The current position is that at a coursing meeting, the hares are tagged, normally, with an ear tag, in order to prevent them being coursed more than once a day.  There would be a cost to coursing clubs, that we would have to bear in mind, in introducing microchipping and it is important that we collaborate with it in terms of exploring the possibility of bringing this in.  Hence, the proposal to undertake a pilot project in co-operation with the Irish Coursing Club is probably the way to go for the moment in order to get its buy-in and the buy-in of everybody involved.  Details would have to be worked out.  An ear tag is readily visible; a chip is not so.</p>  <p>  Over the years, there have been a number of allegations relating to the use of hares by coursing clubs.  Some allegations claim that individuals catch hares illegally and sell them on to coursing clubs and that is something that we obviously want to stamp out as much as we can.</p></speech>

We have passed on specific allegations to the Minister and we will pass on more.  I am sure the people watching will later on after this.</p><p>The illegal trafficking of hares between coursing clubs has always been a problem.  As the Minister stated, in theory, the uninjured hares are supposed to be released but quite often they are caught again and traded on, which is something that we want to stamp out.</p><p>My understanding is that the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, mammal expert has indicated support for the use of microchipping.</p><p>It is relatively cheap to do, as Dogs Trust will do it for roughly &euro;4.50.  I would be keen to see a compulsory system, even if only on a pilot basis at this stage.  It would be a step in the right direction.  Ideally, I would like to see coursing banned outright.  The public would support that as well.  Audiences are diminishing and it is an area that is dying out.  In the meantime, we should be doing everything we can to ensure that the law is upheld and microchipping is cost-effective.  The National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, seem to be on for it and I am really hopeful that we could engage.  Were the Minister in a position to give me the name of a person the groups could contact or to whom they could make their views known, that would be great.</p></speech>

As if that was not enough worry for many of our farming and rural communities, this morning they woke up to a story on the front page of the <i>Irish Independent</i>suggesting that rural communities and the beef sector in particular, will become the latest pawn in this Brexit debacle.  The <i>Irish Independent</i>has reported that the British Government is suggesting the introduction of a range of what it terms are tariff rate quotas to allow produce into the UK without tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  The suggestion being picked up from a speech made by the Secretary of State, Michael Gove, is that those tariff rate quotas will be particularly attractive to countries like Brazil, with which we are in intense competition in the British market.  While we all know and accept there is no comparison between the quality of our beef and beef from countries such as Brazil, that will not make any difference on the supermarket shelves of Britain if their produce comes in on a tariff-free basis compared with ours.</p><p>The T&aacute;naiste does not need to be told about the importance of the beef industry in Ireland.  Each year, &euro;2.5 billion worth of beef is exported, 52% of which goes to the UK.  That is &euro;1.25 billion worth of our economy currently in peril and awaiting clarity over the course of the next 36 days.  Leaving Brexit aside, the beef sector is under enormous pressure, and beef farmers are hugely angry and frustrated at what they see as inaction on the part of the Government to resolve the pressure they are under.  </p><p>Teagasc suggests that average incomes on cattle-rearing farms in 2018 is just over &euro;10,000 per annum.  Cattle prices are down in the beef sector by up to &euro;200 per head, year on year.  Thousands of farmers are turning out across the country in the hope of getting some sort of knowledge or indication from the Government that it understands where they are at, the pressure they are under and the importance of their sector to the Irish economy but they are not getting any signals of that understanding.  All they are seeing is a Government and a Minister that take the attitude that it will be all right on the night and will be fine but no practical measures are being taken to support them.  To add to that frustration, the remarks of the Taoiseach about cutting back on beef consumption did not help their case or situation.</p><p>I ask the T&aacute;naiste to comment on that story in the first instance.  Has he any knowledge, through his interactions on the Brexit issue, of Michael Gove's plans post 29 March?  What plans has the Government in place now to assist the Irish beef sector and to assist Irish farmers in the coming days and weeks to get extra supports from Europe to get through this particular challenge?  What work is being undertaken to deal with this threat to our sector?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-02-21a.108" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019022100012#K00500"><p>First, I thank the Deputy for raising this hugely serious issue.  As a former Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, I assure the Deputy that I and Deputy Creed and the Cabinet as a whole are more than aware of the potential threats to the agrifood industry and the beef sector in particular.</p><p>There are about 130,000 farm families in Ireland and about 100,000 of these get income from beef.  Some 60,000 to 70,000 get all of their farm income from beef.  When it comes to Irish agriculture in terms of numbers, beef is the most important issue and we are aware of that.  That is why the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine has done a detailed assessment of what the impact a no-deal scenario could be in a worst-case scenario.  That is not a report that shies away from outlining the stress and pressure that this sector could be put under if it is not supported and managed by the Government and by the EU in that worst-case scenario.  As result, we have been speaking to the European Commission very directly and to the European Commissioner, Phil Hogan.  We have made it clear, and the Commission has made it clear that it will support us, that we can, if it comes to it, support and protect a sector to ensure it survives through a Brexit transition period.</p><p>We are, of course, all working to ensure that no-deal Brexit does not happen.  We have heard various rumours at different stages coming out of the UK.  At one point, I was being informed that the UK Government was going to look at having no tariffs at all.  Then we saw Michael Gove making announcements that he intends applying WTO tariffs on agrifood products.  On top of that, we are being told that within certain sectors like beef, they may look at tariff-free quotas for certain volumes of beef.  If they were to do that under WTO rules, they would not be able to apply a different tariff system or quota system to Ireland or to the EU, as they would to other parts of the world.  The only thing that would then differentiate Irish beef from beef from other parts of the world would be quality restrictions, which of course are a factor.  In of themselves, however, this will not be reassuring to Irish farmers, as we indeed see in the editorial of the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal </i>today.</p><p>The one thing I want to say on behalf of the Government, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, is that we have been aware for many months of the vulnerability of agriculture.  That is why in the last budget, the beef sector was targeted in a positive way for more supports.  If it comes to it, the Government will not be found wanting to support and work with this sector through a very difficult period, should a no-deal Brexit materialise.  That will involve a significant amount of money and a relaxation of the state aid rules that would allow us to be able to support the vulnerable sectors through the consequences of a no-deal Brexit.</p></speech>

They are under stress and pressure as it is.  This statement from Mr. Gove this morning is adding to this stress and that pressure.  What has the Government done in the last number of years to get access to other markets to reduce our dependence on the UK market?  I put a question to the Minister, Deputy Creed, on lairage in Cherbourg and I got an answer back from him on Tuesday evening more or less shrugging his shoulders and stating that while there is an issue, it can be resolved privately.</p>  <p>  There needs to be a lot more proactivity and involvement on the part of the Government in dealing with blockages in the system.  There needs to be a lot more proactivity on the Government's part in standing up to factories that are not paying decent prices.  We have the lowest cattle prices in the EU, far lower than in the UK, and meanwhile the Government is just shrugging its shoulders and hoping it will be all right on the night.</p>  <p>  President Juncker has said this morning that he is not very optimistic about a deal at the moment.  I am sure the T&aacute;naiste has seen those remarks.  The Government needs to give certainty and clarity to farming families and not speak about stress and pressure as something that might happen in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  It is happening and is real.  If he wants to understand frustration I advise him to look at the minutes of the Oireachtas joint committee meeting on agriculture last Tuesday.  He should read the presentation that was given by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on beef and examine the reaction of members, including those from his own party, to the poorness of that presentation and the complete lack of understanding of the pressure the sector is under and, frankly, the lack of any plan to deal with it.</p></speech>

It has been a difficult year for beef on many levels.</p><p>Regardless of the question marks and frustrations that some people may have concerning factories, their interactions with farmers and so on - that is an ongoing and testing relationship, as it should be - something much more fundamental needs to be dealt with in the context of Brexit, and that is the issue on which we are focusing.  This is a Government that has always prioritised agriculture and farming and always will while my party is a part of it.  Given that we realised and focused on the vulnerabilities of the agriculture and farming sector at an early stage in the Brexit discussions, we will be prepared if necessary in the context of there being no deal.</p> <p> The Deputy asked for certainty and clarity, but one cannot provide absolute certainty if the other partner in the decision making - the UK - cannot provide it either.  We have always approached Brexit by necessity, having to adapt to decisions that are being made in Westminster.

We can all agree on that.  Every Deputy knows patients and families struggling to access appropriate care and help for themselves and their loved ones and children.  We are all aware of the inadequate staffing levels across CAMHS that make it impossible for the services to meet demand.</p>  <p>  Approximately 2,560 children and young adults are on the CAMHS waiting list.  Those 2,560 are being failed.  Almost 300 of them have been waiting for more than a year to be seen.  These figures are shocking and unacceptable, and this situation needs to be addressed.  Early intervention is crucial, but early interventions in mental health cases are not possible when there are extensive waiting lists and a sheer lack of capacity within the system.  CAMHS is not meeting the needs of a large cohort of our children and young adults.  The situation has been this way for far too long.</p>  <p>  Children and young adults who are desperately in need of care and help and who are reaching out for same are not getting the appropriate support in a timely manner.  This is primarily due to the failure to recruit the staff needed to operate CAMHS teams.  Some services are operating on barely half the number of staff identified in A Vision for Change.  When that policy was launched, it was supposed to be a ten-year plan.  It is 12 years since it was launched, though, and it has ceased to have any real meaning because it has been left unimplemented for so long.</p>  <p>  In my area of CHO 1, which includes Cavan, Monaghan and the north west, there are ten vacant CAMHS posts and 240 children who are waiting to be seen.  This is not acceptable.  The T&aacute;naiste knows that, given that the situation in his area is even worse.  In CHO 4, which covers Cork and Kerry, 650 young people are on the waiting list, and more than 100 of them have been waiting for longer than a year to be seen and supported in respect of their mental health.  It is little wonder that this is the case in Cork and Kerry, given that CHO 4's staffing is at roughly 56% of the recommended level.  Approximately 74 CAMHS positions are vacant in Cork and Kerry.  This is shocking and confirms the serious lack of capacity in the system.</p>  <p>  In the interests of our children, we cannot allow this situation to persist.  Where children or young persons need care and help, they cannot be forced to stay on an extended waiting list that puts them and their mental health at serious risk.</p></speech>

It is not the first time that I have raised this matter.  I raised it during Leaders' Questions with the Taoiseach in November.  He stated that he would seek a report on a comparison between resources, staffing and outcomes in CAMHS.  He was going to take a personal interest in this.  Has that report been compiled?  What does it contain?  When will it be published?  We need to see real action and for this issue to be tackled head on so that CAMHS are properly resourced and meet the needs of children who need serious help.</p></speech>

I do not believe that anyone in this House, and certainly not on this side, would contest that.  However, it is an area into which we are putting many more resources.  In the budget, an extra &euro;55 million was assigned to mental health services, bringing the overall budget for 2019 to nearly &euro;1 billion.  It is not like financial resources are not being increased.  That said, it is not just about financial resources.</p>  <p>  The HSE is committed to ensuring that all aspects of CAMHS are delivered in a consistent and timely fashion, including improved access to age appropriate units.  In 2015, the executive introduced a new standard operating procedure for inpatient and community CAMHS.  This has contributed to improving services overall, including a reduction in inappropriate admissions of adolescents to adult units.  It is also designed to reduce CAMHS waiting lists, particularly for those waiting longer than a year.  Access is based on professional clinical assessment and urgent cases are seen as a priority.</p>  <p>  Last year, 114 new assistant psychologists and 20 psychologists were recruited to HSE primary care services to help relieve pressure on the specialist CAMHS.  The Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, recently approved ten new advanced nurse practitioner posts to improve CAMHS.  On the policy front, work is ongoing to complete and refresh A Vision for Change and to produce a draft report, which will be completed shortly.  I do not have a draft timeframe, but I will try to get the timetable for the Deputy, as this is not the first time he has raised the issue.</p>  <p>  The key objective - it is the only objective, really - is to enhance services overall.  There is a recognition that we have had recruitment difficulties in this area.  We have provided more funding to address that and recruitment is happening.  It needs to continue to happen so that we provide consistent timelines across the country and there are no black spots where young children wait for far too long to get the support and care they need.  It is an ongoing process to improve those services by increasing funding and recruitment.  Both are happening.</p></speech>

I am sure the T&aacute;naiste, like anyone else, knows their parents, perhaps people who are close to him, and the torture that they go through worrying about their children, who have already been assessed as needing mental health supports, about the risk posed to their children's mental health increasing and about there being a bad end to all of it.  This is the torture that they tell us about constantly and that they are experiencing.</p>  <p>  The problem is that the situation is getting worse.  Three hundred people have been waiting longer than a year for their initial assessments and 2,560 are on waiting lists.  Of the 72 CAMHS beds, 33 are not operational because of staffing issues.  A Vision for Change told us that we should have 100 beds.  This is complete and utter chaos.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach told me in November that he would take a personal interest in this matter and would look for a report.  Has the report been compiled, will it be published and what will it contain?</p></speech>

They are strong words from a renowned expert.  Even if we do not agree on the causes of the problems, I am sure the T&aacute;naiste agrees that Venezuela is not the only divided country with economic problems, but it is the only one in which there is an unelected, self-proclaimed President who has been recognised as a head of state without any basis in law, including by Ireland.  It is the only one which the US military is circling.  We believe it is landing in the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico and Colombia under the guise of delivering humanitarian aid.  It is eerily like the weapons of mass destruction lie that was used to sell the Iraq war and it is happening on a continent where the provision of humanitarian aid has been used as cover for death squads by the same Elliot Abrams who is now at the head of the US operation in Venezuela.  This is incredibly serious.  One does not need to be a genius to work out that the humanitarian aid narrative is just a Trojan horse.  Even the official organisations, the International Red Cross and the United Nations, want to have nothing to do with it, as it is not aid but provocation.  It is being used as cover for military intervention and regime change.</p>  <p>  The question for us is: are we going to go along with the herd, say nothing, wring our hands and say afterwards, "If only we had known," or are we going to speak out now and add our voice to those opposing military aggression and intervention and in favour of respecting the sovereignty of Venezuela and assisting its people in resolving their differences through dialogue and respect for internal law?  Surely that is what a neutral country should be doing.  Anything less is a facilitation of the latest resources war.  We know that Venezuela has the largest oil resources in the world.  We know that because President Trump and John Bolton have told us that they are in discussions with American oil companies to take the oil from the Venezuelan people.  We know that they have wanted to do this for a long time.  We also know that they tried to overthrow Hugo Ch&aacute;vez and about the sanctions that followed, but this is a turning point.  We know what will happen next.  Look at what happened in Libya, Iraq and Syria and President Trump says Nicaragua and Cuba are next.  Are we going to stay silent or are we going to speak out against US military aggression and intervention and in defence of international law?</p></speech>

We have spoken out and will continue to speak out against military intervention.  As the Deputy will be aware, the most recent EU 28 statement on Venezuela was delivered by the High Representative, Federica Mogherini, on 26 January.  It reiterated that "a peaceful and inclusive democratic solution is the only sustainable way out" of the crisis in Venezula which, by the way, is the worst political, social, economic and humanitarian crisis in its history.  Some 3 million refugees have left the country in the past three years and moved to neighbouring states.  It was clear that if no announcement on the holding of fresh elections was made by President Maduro in the days after that EU statement, the European Union would take further actions, including on the issue of recognition of the country's interim leadership.  I have been strongly in favour of co-ordinated EU action on Venezuela and fully subscribe to the European Union's common position.  Far too often, the European Union speaks with multiple voices and, therefore, has no impact or effect.  Instead it allows other countries to have that impact and effect.</p>  <p>  On 3 February, in the absence of an announcement by President Maduro calling fresh elections in Venezuela, a number of EU member states began to issue statements recognising Juan Guaid&oacute; as interim President of Venezuela with responsibility to facilitate the holding of democratic elections and nothing else.  Not to take a decision lightly, I took a number of days to consider our position and on 6 February decided that Ireland should join the vast majority of its EU partners, including Spain, Croatia, Poland, the Czech Republic, Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia, Portugal, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Denmark, Germany, Hungary, Finland, Austria, Belgium, Luxembourg, Sweden, Slovakia and France, all of which recognise the interim arrangements and support the call for free, fair and democratic elections.  They include neutral and independent countries, countries with socialist and EPP governments and so on.  There is a collective effort within the European Union to try to create pressure.  In our view, the only way to resolve the issue is by facilitating the holding of free and fair presidential elections which we have not seen in Venezuela for many years.  I join the other EU member states mentioned in acknowledging and supporting Juan Guaid&oacute; as interim President of the democratically elected national assembly to enable him to call free and fair democratic elections.  We share this position with 24 other EU member states, virtually every state in South America and many others in different parts of the world.  I cannot be neutral on the dramatic humanitarian crisis unfolding in Venezuela.  If any Member of the House have evidence to the contrary, I encourage him or her to share it.  I reiterate that Ireland does not and will not support military intervention in this case and we have been vocal in expressing our concerns in that regard.</p></speech>

This is not about democracy and the T&aacute;naiste did not in any way address the points I made about the situation having moved on.  Since the backing of Juan Guaid&oacute;, the situation has changed on the ground.  Troops are amassing on the borders of Venezuela under the guise of the provision of humanitarian aid.  This is a country that needs such aid. I have a picture of a 12 year old Yemeni girl who is starving.  She weighs 22 lbs.  There is a need for a humanitarian aid intervention in Yemen, but there cannot be because the Americans are blocking the Saudis.  I am not arguing for military intervention in Saudi Arabia.  What I am arguing for is respect for international law.  within a very short space of time we will be in a situation where the fate of people not only in Venezuela but also in Nicaragua, Cuba and throughout Latin America will be seriously undermined in what is a resources war, about which I have not heard the T&aacute;naiste say anything.

The very mention of Brexit two years ago seems to have given factories across the country the right to cut the prices on cattle.  Prices have fallen by 20 cent to 25 cent per kilogram or in the region of &euro;100 per head.  This leaves many beef farmers unable to cover their costs and causes them to sell their cattle at a serious loss, which leads to huge stress in these family farms.</p>  <p>  Factory prices currently do not meet the costs of producing the cattle.  Some beef producers are also fattening some of their own cattle in their own feed lots.  It is estimated that up to 20% of finished cattle are coming from factory controlled units.  This is putting farmers in west Cork and throughout the State at a serious disadvantage.  Some factories were found to be underweighing the cattle, thus underpaying our farmers for their meat.  Little or nothing is done for the farmer in this regard.</p>  <p>  For a farmer to break even, he or she needs to be getting &euro;4.60 per kilogram but at the moment, the farmer is getting &euro;3.40 per kilogram.  Who is creaming off the farmers' back?  The T&aacute;naiste and I know who it is but nothing is done to stop this carry-on.  Factories are arrogant in this country and have been left arrogant by the Government as we stand idly by and see many farmers who have farmed for generations go out of business.  All we have to do is look across to the UK where farmers are getting &euro;150 per head more for their cattle than Irish farmers get.  How can this happen there and not here? Our farmers are putting out the best quality cattle and getting a shockingly poor return.  Here lies the crisis for our farmers to simply survive.</p>  <p>  The last budget was a great opportunity for Ireland to stand up for these farmers by giving them a &euro;200 suckler cow grant.  The Government, however, failed these farmers by only giving them &euro;40.  Many believe it would not be worth the trouble financially of weighing the cow and calf to just get &euro;40 in return.  The Government has had ample opportunity in the past three years to turn the fortunes of the beef farmer around but on the ground nothing has happened.  This morning we see a new crisis looming for farmers as reported in leading articles in national newspapers.  It looks like our friends in Britain are upping the ante in the battle over the Brexit backstop.  Their plan aims to allow beef-producing countries such as Brazil to dodge the brunt of new import taxes or tariffs after Brexit.  This will mean huge quantities of Brazilian beef being pushed into the UK market and quality Irish beef being priced out.</p>  <p>  Agriculture and fisheries are two of the major industries in Ireland but at present, one senior Minister is responsible for both industries.  This may have worked in the past but now with a very serious Brexit looming, the situation has changed completely.  I see the crisis we are in and the bigger one facing us.  I have called for a senior Minister to be responsible for each of the two industries and I call for that again today.  Will the T&aacute;naiste and the Government see what Ireland sees and appoint a stand-alone Minister with responsibility for agriculture and food to fight to save the livelihood of thousands of farmers?</p></speech>

I chaired a beef forum for a number of years and I know the personalities in the sector well on the factory side and on the farm side.  We have supported and will continue to support the beef sector through the rural development programme, where we have invested &euro;300 million in the current development programme to support the suckler sector.  Another &euro;20 million was announced in the last budget and another &euro;25 million was added to the area of natural constraint, ANC, payments, primarily focused on beef suckler farmers.  The Government has not and will not be found wanting in support for this sector, especially when there are pressures from outside, such as those decisions we do not control that are linked to Brexit.</p>  <p>  On the Deputy's question, I do not believe it would make any sense for us to restructure the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine right now, with regard to the fish sector.  There have been conversations and preparations under way for many months around Brexit and that Department has focused on the pressures and vulnerabilities for both fishermen and farmers.  The idea that we would go through some kind of restructure now with 36 days to go to a no-deal Brexit would not make any sense.  That is about as polite I can be about that.</p>  <p>  I have had the discussion with the Taoiseach and with others at different times on whether we should separate the fishing portfolio from agriculture.  Having thought about it I do not think we should.  It is the food sector and I believe that fishing in particular is enhanced in its representation around the Cabinet table by being linked to the broader food sector, especially when it comes to exports and Brexit, with the potential need for compensation packages and EU intervention in both sectors to ensure they can survive should we have a worst-case scenario of a no-deal Brexit.  Incidentally, I do not believe it will happen but if it did, we would need to be ready and we have a Department that is working night and day to put contingency plans in place should it come to that.  The idea that we would restructure and change our personalities at this late stage is not a decision we should be taking now.</p></speech>

West Cork will be no different tonight.  These farmers are near the edge and are attending in their hundreds hoping this group or someone out there will step in and deal with this crisis.  The T&aacute;naiste keeps telling me that we cannot have a stand-alone Minister with 36 days to go to Brexit.  This should have been done two years ago.</p></speech>

Today, British Ministers are in Brussels for talks with Michel Barnier.  We are told that, thus far, the talks have centred on the interpretation of the backstop and what fudge can be sold to the House of Commons in that regard.  We are all agreed in this House that the basic protections afforded to Ireland in the withdrawal agreement and in the backstop in particular are non-negotiable and cannot be unpicked or diluted in any way.

It is a pretty serious question but I will try to answer it within one minute.  I thank Opposition parties in particular in the House for their support on the broader efforts on Brexit.  We will be asking them for more co-operation next week on the legislation being published tomorrow.  I met Michel Barnier on Monday and received reports from the Juncker-May meeting yesterday.  Our position has been consistent for many months and will not change.  The backstop is a necessary guarantee to reassure people on this island that they will not face the re-emergence of border infrastructure between the two jurisdictions on this island as an unintended consequence of Brexit at any point in future.  That is also the EU's position, which is why it has said that it is not willing to reopen or renegotiate the withdrawal agreement.  The agreement is already a finely-balanced document involving compromises on both sides to achieve important outcomes, in particular from an Irish perspective.  The focus now is on how to give the House of Commons the reassurance it needs around the temporary nature of the backstop which will hopefully never be used but which needs to be in place unless and until it can be replaced by something more permanent which must do the same job the backstop has been designed to do.  That is where this issue of alternative arrangements comes in.  Alternative arrangements are already catered for in the existing withdrawal agreement and in the future relationship declaration.  If there are alternative arrangements that can replace the backstop, as long as they do the same job, they can, of course, be considered.  However, we cannot have time limits or unilateral exit clauses on the backstop without knowing what will come after that.  If we had, it would not be a backstop at all.</p></speech>

On Monday, community employment supervisors were on strike due to the failure of the Government to engage in discussions on a pension scheme for those who supervise community employment schemes.  This relates back to a Labour Court recommendation of 2008.  The T&aacute;naiste may be aware that a process was established in 2015, following discussions with SIPTU and F&oacute;rsa, to address this difficult issue.  As Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform at the time, I put a subhead in the environment Vote to provide for <i>ex gratia</i>payments through Pobal but this process stopped when the Labour Party left Government.  Will the Government reopen and restart that process now to address a legitimate grievance?  I see that the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection may well be about to answer the question.

Simultaneously, they are sabotaging the democratic process of the D&aacute;il to prevent Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith's Petroleum and Other Minerals Development (Amendment) (Climate Emergency Measures) Bill 2018 to progress, notwithstanding the fact that it was passed overwhelmingly by the House.

Will the T&aacute;naiste outline today or early next week the financial cost of buying votes from Deputies Lowry, Grealish and Naughten to oppose the no-confidence motion yesterday?  It was a grubby deal and I would like to know the cost.  They are announcing on Facebook schools, hospitals, roads and other projects and the Government is down to the level of picking up the phone and begging people to come in for an open chequebook.  It is outrageous to buy confidence in the Minister like that and to get votes.  It is despicable.</p></speech>

Yesterday, we all received an email addressed to the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Humphreys, and the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Coveney, saying:</p><blockquote>We the undersigned write as a matter of urgency in advance of the informal meeting of EU trade ministers of February 21st [that is today].  We understand that it is proposed to advance two negotiating mandates for trade talks with the United States of America at these meetings.  This is despite the US President's position on withdrawing from the Paris Climate Agreement and the clear and unequivocal position set out by the EU Commission and EU leaders in 2018 that real commitment to climate action, the Paris Agreement, is a precondition to any trade deal providing access to the EU market, the second largest economy in the world.</blockquote><p>Are we getting involved in those negotiations today or are we stepping out of them?</p></speech>

Of course, we want to advocate for an adherence to the Paris Agreement on climate change, which we will do, but the idea that Ireland would not be supportive of improved facilitation of trade between the EU and the US would be totally counter-productive.</p></speech>

It seems that various Ministers are briefing the press on the Government's position, with measures apparently coming from the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, with a four-year delay and, therefore, the project will not go ahead.  Can the T&aacute;naiste clarify the Government's timeline to consider the issue?  Has it been discussed in Cabinet?  Does the Government intend to present a proposal?  Has there been any agreement?  How can the Government solve the confusion that has arisen from Ministers briefing on the project without any of us having the engineering details to which the Ministers refer?</p></speech>

I am aware of today's media reports on the MetroLink project to which the Deputy refers.  As he will know, the National Transport Authority, NTA, and Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, held a public consultation last year on what was called an emerging preferred route.  That route generated much commentary and there were different views on the various impacts in particular areas, including the potential disruption to the Luas green line service.  I understand that the NTA and TII will shortly publish a preferred route which will reflect the NTA's and TII's consideration of the issues raised and how best to address them, including how to minimise disruption.  That is the position and we must wait for that formal recommendation to come from both of those parties.</p></speech>

Under the programme for Government, with the aim of minimising the cost of insurance there have been insurance reports and the insurance working group.  Is the T&aacute;naiste aware of a cartel-style operation that is currently operating among insurance companies, whereby insurance companies and brokers refuse to give a direct quote to persons seeking to shop around for insurance once that quote has been given to one broker?  Further, the treatment of notification of accidents, regardless of whether a claim is imminent, is experiencing a 50% premium addition for a two-year period regardless of whether the claim is made after an accident is reported.</p>  <p>  I call on the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister with responsibility to insist that, particularly in the latter case, that any premium top-up is refunded once no claim is been made on an accident.</p></speech>

One of the key recommendations of Mr. Justice Kearns' report requires the passage of the Judicial Council Bill 2017 but it has yet to be brought into the Seanad.  The reason it has not been brought to the Seanad is due to the time that has been spent on the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill 2017.  Will the Government prioritise the former Bill to help long-suffering businesses, as opposed to helping the long-suffering Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, who has a personal crusade in respect of the latter Bill?</p></speech>

We have made a number of changes to the law, most notably last year through the passage of the national claims database.  To respond to Deputy Breathnach, there should be no co-ordination in how insurance companies deal with claims.  As the Deputy will be aware, last year there was a raid to gather evidence of any collusion or anti-competitive behaviour.</p></speech>

I raise the matter in the light of the ongoing uncertainty about the future of emergency services at Portlaoise hospital.  When the Minister for Health met me, Deputy Fleming and the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, in December 2017, he committed to begin a public consultation on the future of those services.</p><p>That was 15 months ago.  The facilitator has not been appointed yet according to the most recent replies to the Minister.  When will we see the facilitator recruited?

Many are choosing to leave Ireland and go to Northern Ireland and the UK because of the cross-border directive, especially for smaller surgeries, including joint replacements and for cataracts.  In 2017, more than 2,000 people went and in 2018, more than 3,000 people went.  There is significant concern that, in the event of a no-deal Brexit, people who are scheduling appointments for after 29 March may not get them.

It has recently been brought to my attention that the supply of pendants for the senior alert scheme, worn by elderly people living alone or in rural areas, may be impacted because they are sourced in the UK.  If a person applies for one of these pendants, he or she will currently get it within two weeks.  It is very reliable.

We will publish legislation tomorrow morning.  That is the omnibus Bill that will come into this House for Second Stage next week.  One section of that legislation deals with cross-border healthcare.  Even in a no-deal, worst case Brexit scenario, the Bill will facilitate the UK and Ireland working together in certain areas, including cross-border health, to ensure that people who are availing of health services in Northern Ireland and <i>vice versa</i>can continue to do so, since it goes both ways to access expertise and so on.  That will maintain the services that are available today after 29 March, should there be a no-deal Brexit.  We will deal with it in the emergency legislation that will be introduced to the House next week.</p><p>I do not have the exact information for Deputy Butler on the product concerned.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-02-21a.277" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1250" speakername="Robert Troy" time="13:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019022100020#S01000"><p>I move:</p><blockquote>That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to amend the Road Traffic Act 2010 to make provision for the use of digitally recorded data from electronic devices of footage and/or other readings from road traffic safety cameras/closed circuit television cameras as evidence of the unlawful entry into or parking in a bus lane or cycle track and to provide for related matters.</blockquote><p>The purpose of this Bill is to permit the usage of footage or other readings from safety cameras as evidence for the enforcement of certain road traffic offences.  Section 81 of the Road Traffic Act 2010 provides a list of traffic offences that CCTV evidence may be used for, for example, speeding.  It is not, however, possible to use evidence from these cameras to enforce the following offences: parking in bus lanes, which is prohibited under SI 182 of 1997, Road Traffic (Traffic and Parking) Regulations 1997; parking in cycle lanes, which is prohibited under SI 274 of 1998; driving in bus lanes, which is prohibited under section 32 of SI 182 of 1997; and driving in cycle lanes.</p><p>Unfortunately, these laws related to cycle and bus lanes are frequently violated and present a significant inconvenience to bus drivers, the people who use buses and to cyclists.  In the case of bus lanes, the presence of non-authorised vehicles slows down bus traffic and it takes longer for service users to get to their destination.  It can also result in bus drivers having to swerve unexpectedly to avoid them.  This presents a considerable challenge to bus drivers and clearly poses a safety risk to both car and bus users.  In the case of cycle lanes, the presence of vehicles also presents a significant risk as cyclists must swerve into traffic to avoid parked vehicles.  Ireland's cycling infrastructure is wholly inadequate as it is without it being rendered unusable by the presence of parked cars, skips and multiple other items being put in the way.  These are widespread issues.  I frequently take Dublin Bus.  One morning, I spotted at least 15 cars parked illegally in a bus or cycle lane in a relatively short distance between Portobello and College Green.</p><p>We need to drastically improve our detection of these traffic violations.  I believe that this could be done through the use of CCTV cameras to reinforce these new road traffic laws and increase detection of these offences.  For example, Dublin Bus vehicles could be fitted with CCTV cameras to detect violations of these laws.  This is already the case in the United Kingdom, New Zealand and many other jurisdictions.  Evidence from these jurisdictions suggests that this enforcement works.  In the borough of Gateshead in the United Kingdom, there was an initial surge in the number of fixed charge notices issued to motorists, which quickly fell by nearly a half.  It is evidence that as drivers became aware that they were taking risks by using the bus lane, they wanted to avoid a fine.</p><p>A report last week by INRIX, a global company which specialises in transport analytics, confirmed that Dublin is now the slowest city centre in all of Europe.  We are robbing people of one of their most valuable assets, time.  This legislation is but a small measure that would help to speed up buses and make them more attractive, and be safer for cyclists.  I hope that the Bill will enjoy cross-party support, given its importance to all transport users in Ireland.  Our capital city is becoming one of the most congested in Europe.  We must do all we can in the short and medium term to get Dublin moving again.</p></speech>

That is what delayed him coming here today.  On a serious note, when there was traffic chaos in Gatwick Airport he said we had no reason to have any fears and that, in his opinion and on the advice available to him, this would not happen in Dublin.  It is an appropriate issue to raise with the Minister today now that it has happened.  Thankfully, there was only very minor disruption but the potential for much more serious disruption is there and given that we are talking about Dublin Airport today, I would like the Minister at some stage in his seven minute contribution to outline what he has done.  He has convened a working group on the regulation of drones at Dublin Airport.  How often has that group met?  What recommendations has it brought forward to mitigate against something like this happening again because we cannot have our national airport brought to its knees by a drone that might only cost &euro;50?  Perhaps the Minister would address that.</p>  <p>  Last night I was making the point that, unfortunately, given that there is disagreement between the residents and the DAA, any decision to change, amend or modify the existing planning conditions that have been introduced by An Bord Plean&aacute;la will revert to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  We can have full confidence in it as in the past An Bord Plean&aacute;la has acted in a very balanced manner.  In respect of this section and the amendment on health, will the Minister clearly outline why he has tabled amendment No. 59, which is grouped with amendments from other colleagues, to this part of the Bill?  Can we have confidence that this amendment is a direct result of what we sought on Committee Stage?</p></speech>

The residents who were in attendance last night, whose lives and health are on the line because of this, are shocked at the Minister's lack of knowledge and more particularly his lack of interest in these matters.  The Chairman of the Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy O'Dowd, raised some very important questions last night on the matters raised by a number of us regarding the correspondence between Fingal County Council and the Department expressing its reluctance to be the competent authority for a number of reasons that we outlined last night.</p>  <p>  Deputy Darragh O'Brien made the point, which was confusing for many people, that Fingal was problematic but that for some reason, at some stage last week, it was posed that if Fianna F&aacute;il pressed ahead with Fingal County Council and its motions that the Government would withdraw the Bill.  What is this nonsense?  This is the first time I heard this.</p></speech>

Residents who have requested information under freedom of information tell us that after that letter from AnnMarie Farrelly, which was in <i>The Irish Times</i>, there is no other evidence under freedom of information of other correspondence of any significance between the Department and the council.  There were emails in February 2018 where the Department said it did not have a clue about the council's rate base and asked to be told a bit more about that excuse.  There are huge questions here and this Bill is seriously compromised as a result of this.  I want those issues answered but I also want Fianna F&aacute;il to take note, it facilitated this appointment, so it must remedy that as well.</p></speech>

It also referenced the European legislation.  The Minister replied that the letter was written in 2017, which we have confirmed.  That makes absolutely no difference whatsoever.</p><p>Nothing has changed in the intervening period to make Fingal County Council independent of this process.  The Minister also said last night that the council's concerns have now been addressed.  How could its concerns have been addressed if the relationship has not changed in that time?  The issue is not whether Fingal County Council's concerns have been addressed.  The issue is whether the independence required to comply with EU Regulation No. 598/2014 has been addressed.  There are serious questions to be answered here.  </p> <p> I asked a question last night and I did not get an answer in the Minister's response.  I will ask it again and demand an answer.  Did the Minister bring it to the attention of his colleagues and of the Taoiseach that this was a factor and that Fingal County Council had written to him?  Were the Taoiseach and his Cabinet colleagues aware of this, because it is a very important matter?  I asked about this last night and I am looking for an answer.  I would be surprised if the Taoiseach was to run with this.  </p> <p> Fianna F&aacute;il's position on this is that, although there are some concerns about Fingal County Council, An Bord Plean&aacute;la is there to pick up the tab if there is an issue.  That is like saying it is okay for a judge who has a vested interest in a case to hear that case on the basis that there is an appeals mechanism.  It is absolute nonsense.  </p></speech>

The reference from director of services, AnnMarie Farrelly, in respect of the 2018 rates bill for the DAA noted that it came to just under &euro;18 million, which represents 14.76% of the total rates levied by Fingal County Council in 2018.  It is a highly significant element of its income.  The grave reservations this senior official had raise questions.  I presume the whole Fingal management team had been entrusted with this role.  It put it in an invidious situation.</p>  <p>  Our Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues are getting a reputation in this House as being the abstainers.

This is one of many commercial conflicts of interest.</p>  <p>  I tabled an amendment, No. 60, which was about having a dedicated health action plan based on the World Health Organization evidence.

To deal specifically with items that are of relevance to this Bill, our transport spokesperson tabled an amendment on Committee Stage, which I moved on his behalf, to establish a separate unit within Fingal County Council.  This amendment was debated on Committee Stage and was unfortunately voted down by five votes to two.  Those who were there will know that.  I received a note from the Department which I circulated to the forum on 8 February.  I have the written note to hand.  It effectively says that, taking all of this together, the proposed amendment undermines the coherence of the appointment of Fingal County Council as the competent authority and that, while it would have to consider the matter, it is unlikely that the Government could allow the Bill to proceed on that basis.  That is it in black and white.  I circulated that.</p></speech>

I actually put it on the floor of the House again yesterday, as did Deputy Troy.  That is the unfortunate reality of it.  We must now ensure, as we did yesterday evening, that residents' health is absolutely paramount in any surveys carried out in respect of decisions of the noise regulator.  It has to be clear and transparent.</p>  <p>  I understand where Deputy Brendan Ryan is coming from, but I am actually pleased that there is another arbiter involved.  I am sure the Deputy is not saying that he does not want to have An Bord Plean&aacute;la involved at all, but it is good that it is there, should it be needed as an independent arbiter.  If the DAA or residents take any further decision to the board, I would much rather that the board be involved than not.</p></speech>

Is it not ironic that Fingal County Council had voiced the exact same concerns that many of us had voiced in respect of its capacity, its lack of in-house experience, and the fact that it determines planning applications and makes decisions?  Many of us had raised all of those issues, including the issue of the potential for conflicts of interest arising from Dublin Airport being a source of revenue for the council.  The reality is that the Minister made this decision in haste.  I believe that is fair to say.  He left it too late.  All along he had been planning for the Irish Aviation Authority to be the competent authority.  When he realised it was not permitted to carry out that function because it failed the independence test, he then rushed to Fingal County Council, completely ignoring the concerns it raised, the same concerns which many of us had raised.  One has to ask again: how can Fingal County Council be truly independent in regulating an entity from which it receives an income?  That income is quite substantial.  The Minister may say that it is only 8% but 8% of a council's overall budget is pretty substantial.</p>  <p>  The Minister has said that neither the Commission for Aviation Regulation nor Fingal County Council had the relevant expertise.  If the Commission for Aviation Regulation is going to take on additional functions in the regulation of civil aviation, as we now know it will, would it not make perfect sense for it also to regulate noise?</p><p>It is not even surprising that the Minister did not flag the correspondence.  The concerns Fingal County Council has aired are the same as the ones many of us have aired.  It is disappointing but not surprising.</p></speech>

As we said last night, the letter was written in 2017.  It was well known to everybody that there was a discussion ongoing on the relative merits of Fingal County Council, the Commission for Aviation Regulation, the Environmental Protection Agency and anybody else.  The letter expressed very sincere and perfectly legitimate concerns about Fingal County Council.  The concerns were part of a discussion in which everybody was involved, publicly and privately.  My officials were engaged intensively in discussions with all three of the main candidates and looking at other alternatives.  When the issues arose, the issue of a conflict of interest which has been raised by everybody here was referred to one place, the Office of the Attorney General.  That is the correct thing to do when such issues arise.  The Office of the Attorney General which had rejected the Irish Aviation Authority as being conflicted came back and stated specifically that Fingal County Council would be given the all-clear.  That is what happened.</p></speech>

There was extensive debate last night and last week about which was the right organisation to appoint as the noise regulator.  While some of it was not particularly well-informed, a number of very important issues were raised, particularly by Deputy Troy, which I wish to address.</p>  <p>  I am willing to acknowledge that he has been consistently on my case for the last number of years in relation to regulation and has been vocal on the matter of Fingal County Council, especially.  Indeed, it is fair to say he was the first out of the blocks on this particular issue, which is something I should point out to other people in this House.  I want to acknowledge this because, while there has been heavy criticism from the Deputy, he has brought forward some sensible ideas which have improved the Bill overall.</p>  <p>  I want to contrast that with some of the loopy ideas which have come from other people in this House.</p></speech>

The amendments passed include provision for a review to take place of the performance by the regulator of its functions under this Bill.  The first such review must happen within seven years, and every five years thereafter.  That first seven-year period is necessary to ensure the regulator and the appeals body have one full regulatory cycle under their belts, so that the first review can look at all aspects of how the structures have worked, including the assessment process, the consultation, the decision-making, any appeal and the monitoring.  In practice, I expect the first review will happen sooner than this, but there is no point in forcing a review after three or five years and finding that it is too soon to provide a full picture of how things have worked and are working.  The outcome of the review would be formally reported on that report to be published.  If there are any matters of concern arising from the review, I would fully expect the Oireachtas committee to examine the matter further.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the amendments passed last week also provide that the regulator will produce an annual report detailing the work it has undertaken in the previous year and setting out its programme for the forthcoming year.  This will be entirely separate from and in addition to any annual report produced by the council with regard to its other work.</p>  <p>  I want to quickly come back to the matter of the references to health, which was an important debate.  As I said, this Bill must be read in tandem with Regulation (EU) 598/2014 itself and with other related EU directives, including the environmental noise directive.  All of these apply to Fingal County Council as the new noise regulator.  I want to assure the House that in this Bill, as it is now drafted, whatever is decided at EU level in relation to the WHO guidelines will have full applicability to Fingal County Council, in its role as noise regulator.  I have tried to explain that Ireland cannot move unilaterally on that front, when giving effect simultaneously to Regulation (EU) 598/2014 in this Bill.</p>  <p>  Going back to the matter in hand, amendments Nos. 51 and 90 to 92, inclusive, introduce a practical and workable complaints procedure.  In the first instance, under amendment No. 51, it would be a matter solely for the noise regulator to consider if there are grounds to review a noise assessment, where circumstances may have changed.  It also gives power for the regulator to direct the airport authority to provide it with any necessary information it requires to undertake such an assessment.</p>  <p>  Under amendment No. 91, a new subsection would be inserted into section 2, the section which relates to the regulator's monitoring powers.  Under this new provision, any person can make a complaint to the regulator and ask it to review the effectiveness of noise mitigation measures which are in place.  This provides for a mechanism by which a person with a genuine complaint has somewhere to go and be heard.</p>  <p>  Amendment Nos. 90 and 92 are consequential to amendment No. 91.  I note that my amendments have the effect of replacing Deputy Clare Daly's amendment on Committee Stage.  The intention of that amendment, however, is retained and expanded on.</p>  <p>  In summary, only the regulator can consider if there is good reason to open a regulatory decision in between the five-year regulatory cycle, but any person can complain to the regulator at any point and request an investigation into non-compliance with a regulatory decision.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-02-21a.356" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1259" speakername="Clare Daly" time="14:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019022100026#Y00400"><p>It is unfortunate the way this group of amendments have morphed a little bit and strayed.  When this Bill was first drafted there was no facility whatsoever for residents to make representations to the competent authority.  The Bill provided that the DAA could go to the competent authority and ask it to assess the situation.  The select committee agreed with my amendments on Committee Stage and put in a provision for residents to be able to do that.</p><p>However, there was another part to that, that the decision on whether or not to investigate a complaint rested solely with the competent authority, which would decide whether or not to conduct an assessment.  I do not have a particular problem with that.  There may be spurious complaints and we do not want the authority to have to go through a full investigation.  However, what I am merely providing for is that in the event that it decides not to carry out an assessment, it needs to inform the person in writing as to the reason for that.  The way the Department has drafted these amendments means there is no facility that bit to go in, unless it goes into the original text, which the Department has dramatically changed by splitting it into two parts.  I want to hear from the Minister that the bit about it being in writing will be resubmitted with amendments Nos. 90 and 91 in the Seanad to properly deal with this issue.  If it is not, we have a bigger problem, and I will come back to that.</p><p>On the matters the Minister spent most of his time dealing with, clearly the officials had time to write the speaking note to deal with some of the issues he was not able to deal with when they were raised on the floor of the House.  We have a substantial problem, as do the residents, with the perceived lack of independence of Fingal County Council being the competent authority.  The Minister's responses to us have not been adequate.  He got very blustered and </p><p>said that it was all history because when Fingal County Council's senior official wrote expressing these concerns, the Attorney General came back and said that there were no conflict of interest.  Therefore, the matter was over.  The Minister is, however, patently ignoring what the official said.  She did not just raise an issue of a conflict of interest.  She also raised the issue that Fingal County Council did not have the requisite competencies available of aviation operations noise and economic feasibility assessments and that another independent organisation would be better.  That was in November 2017.  On 30 January, the Minister announced Fingal County Council as the competent authority.  In terms of freedom of information, and conveniently the freedom of information officer is on holiday this week, so cannot clarify this, no records have emerged to date of any meetings between Fingal County Council and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to address those issues the Minister said were extensively discussed with the three candidates, the other two being the EPA and the Commission for Aviation Regulation Ireland, CAR.  Interestingly enough, there is no information under freedom of information about any intensive discussions with them either.</p><p>Can the Minister explain how, between November and his announcement in January, all these issues were addressed, particularly when we have correspondence under freedom of information where his senior official wrote back to Fingal County Council?  This was in May more than two weeks after he made the announcement about Fingal County Council.  It read:</p><blockquote>Hi AnnMarie <br /><br />See the link below.  This issue about independence is likely to have prominence.</blockquote><p>The link was to a debate that took place in Fingal County Council, where the elected councillors expressed concern about the lack, or perceived lack, of independence of their council.  The official in the Minister's Department went on to say that the Minister was, of course, defending this robustly.  I have not seen much evidence of that but we will park that.  The letter stated, &quot;Any help you might be able to give around defensive points would be appreciated&quot;.  It further stated: &quot;For example, as a starting point, I do not know if the proportion of Fingal rates that is claimed by the DAA of 20% is correct.&quot;  If the senior official dealing with this issue, after the date the Minister announced Fingal County Council as the competent authority, did not know the level of rate base of Fingal County Council, and its reliance on the DAA, and the Minister does not think that is a problem, then I think there is something seriously wrong with him, to be honest about it.</p><p>It is a fundamental problem and shows that the points about Fingal County Council's independence have not been adequately addressed.  We do not have to rely on that correspondence alone.  We also have correspondence from the EU expressing its concerns about the issue of independence.  The Minister is saying that everything is okay and the issues have been addressed because the Attorney General said that there was not a conflict of interest.  Let us say that we accept that, but the Attorney General did not say that there would be a conflict of interest with the Commission for Aviation Regulation or the EPA either.  The conflict of interest issue is not the only consideration, as the competent authority also has to have expertise.</p> <p> We now have a major problem because of the manner in which this issue has been handled.  In that sense, the complaints procedure takes on even greater prominence.  When the Minister's own Government colleague and Chair of the Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport asks questions about letters and this information not being brought before the committee, it is an unprecedented problem.  The manner of the Bill's handling in the House has been shambolic from start to finish.  In some ways, my heart goes out to the officials.  It is a difficult job, but we have tried to engage.  I recognise that we have made improvements to the Bill, but if the Minister believes he can shout and roar in the Chamber and say that there is no conflict of interest and that the Attorney General will address the issues we have raised, he is wrong.  Will he please address the issues that Deputies across the Opposition benches have raised about these points?</p></speech>

I have raised this issue with the Minister.  We have discussed levels of competence, experience and so on with the officials.  We have been told that there would be consultations on same.  A great deal more work is needed on these matters.</p>  <p>  On Committee Stage, amendments were passed regarding the making of complaints.  It is good that we will have an authority to which residents can make a complaint, as that has been a major issue, with the DAA effectively being the only avenue open to people to date to make complaints.  Most of us would agree that the majority of complaints have not been heard fairly.</p>  <p>  The issue of complaints receiving written responses if the competent authority decided that a complaint was spurious or that it would not proceed with an investigation was the spirit of the Committee Stage debate.  My colleagues in Fianna F&aacute;il and I supported Deputy Clare Daly strongly on that amendment.  While we acknowledge that there will be somewhere to make a complaint to and that the competent authority will be able to decide whether there is enough in the complaint to take the matter a step further, we agreed on Committee Stage that, if the authority decided that it could not or would not proceed, a written explanation would be given.  That should be the bottom line.  We understand that spurious complaints can be made and, hence, we were not saying that the competent authority had to investigate every complaint, but if there is a reason for it being unable or unwilling to investigate, that needs to be explained to the complainant in writing.</p>  <p>  I support the request that, when the Bill is before the Seanad-----</p></speech>

Much of the delay is probably inevitable, but arrangements should be made to deal with a number of issues which I believe the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, could address with some speed.  She is not present for the discussion, but she must bear in mind that we now know that there are approximately 150,000 adoption files held by Tusla, of which 50,000 or more are since adoption was legally introduced in Ireland in 1952.  I have been asking questions and campaigning on this issue for a long period and one of the problems is that in most cases many of the parents of the children are now deceased, while many of the children are much older.  The unfortunate part is that the Minister is continuing to cling to a social worker-led model when people just want to receive their information.  They want to receive information on the mother and baby homes, with their personal information and files.</p>  <p>  Since we last discussed this matter, the information on burials at Sean Ross Abbey has come to light, with suggestions the number of children buried there is far more significant than previously believed.  This is very distressing for all of the people connected with Sean Ross Abbey, but everybody was aware of the information.  Certainly, my mother used to say to me when I was a child that children had died like flies in these institutions.  They died from what are now treatable illnesses such as gastroenteritis.  They also died from a range of other illnesses which nowadays can still take babies' lives such as meningitis.  If there was an infection in a home, it appears that it spread like wildfire.  I welcome the Minister's decision to have excavations carried out at Sean Ross Abbey.</p>  <p>  The biggest mother and baby home in the Dublin area was St. Patrick's on the Navan Road.  I was always told and people connected with the home have repeatedly said approximately 2,000 babies are buried in the Holy Angels plot at Glasnevin Cemetery.  In fact, others have suggested the figure is higher.  In addition, many people living in Dublin at the time, particularly poorer people, who lost a baby buried him or her in the Holy Angels plot.  That issue must be addressed.  It is part of a very sad history in Ireland, but the people affected deserve to have it addressed.</p>  <p>  I have with me the reply I received from Tusla last June about the number of people who were seeking to trace their origins.  The numbers are extremely high, but, more importantly, where the process is still ongoing, the number amounts to many thousands.  Last year the Minister made a public announcement on the 126 files related to St. Patrick's Guild which ran a home on Temple Hill in Blackrock.  I am aware of many people from St. Patrick's Guild who have been approached with a letter from the Minister and Tusla offering social worker services.  People do not particularly need social worker services unless they ask for them.  They are adults.  The people referred to were born between the late 1940s and the late 1960s; therefore, almost everybody is well over 40 years old.  Some might need counselling and the help of a social worker, but more than anything they need information.</p>  <p>  My view is, given the way it is set up, Tusla will never be able to deal with more than 10% to 20% of the inquiries it faces.  Before Christmas we received the news that St. Patrick's Guild which was one of the biggest adoption societies in Ireland had gone into liquidation.  That means that almost 100 years of its history is gone.  I believe Tusla has the records, as the Minister can confirm, but the position is far from satisfactory.  I understand there were legal cases, some of which were in the public domain last year, and that the guild may have had to make legal redress to some of the people involved.</p>  <p>  What is the current position?  We are in the middle of a detailed mother and baby homes investigation which is being carried out by some eminent and trustworthy people, but the problem with the Government is that it is not prepared to expand its remit to address very important issues, some of which are relatively resolvable in the time that is left.  I refer, first, to Bethany Home.  After almost three years in office, the Government has not addressed the issues involved.  Almost every Member is aware that the people from Bethany Home are now mainly of considerably advanced years and deserve to be addressed in a fair way.  I ask the Minister of State to convey that message to her senior Minister colleagues.</p>  <p>  Second, with regard to St. Patrick's Guild and the files on the 126 people mentioned, I introduced a Bill to deal with informal, false and illegally registered adoptions.  It would provide people with a mechanism to approach the court to have their circumstances validated.  There are a number of people who were registered as the natural children of their adoptive parents.  I assume that the nun gave the happy parents the baby they were going to adopt and told them to register him or her.  They probably never knew that they were doing anything untoward, but there must have been arrangements which facilitated it.  An increasing number of cases came to my attention following publication of the Bill.  Ms Anne O'Meara is a barrister who was adopted and whose birth certificate turned out to be illegal.  She has spoken on the Sean O'Rourke radio programme and spoke at the launch of the Bill.  She is quite clear that she was adopted by a very loving family who brought her up, with her siblings.  However, when they were given her, they went and registered her as their natural born baby.  Therefore, her birth certificate is invalid.  In addition, she was born in Belfast.  As in most cases, her adoptive parents always told her that she had been adopted.  She was adopted in Belfast.  She must have a remedy whereby she can go to court to have her life validated as it has been lived, in other words, that she was adopted by her parents.  The registration of her birth was false and wrong and she needs a mechanism to resolve the issue.</p><p>I really plead with the Minister of State because I know she knows a lot about this issue, to get the Government to act on the legislation I have brought forward.</p> <p> Regarding St. Patrick's Guild, we are told there are another 746 cases that are of concern, to use the words of the Minister.  As St. Patrick's Guild is just one of many adoption societies, if one uses one's imagination one will know this affected many people.  I have dealt in recent days with a case of someone whose original birth certificate, when they obtained it, had been utterly falsified.  Again, there was something irregular about the birth certificate they got.  However, there is no remedy whatever available to this individual, and what is more, they do not even know how they should have registered their children in terms of their children's parentage and their own identity.</p> <p> There is a lot that could be done about this.  I stress that we can work together on this and with the various organisations which have been lobbying on this issue.  We can help people without having to say, as is inevitable, that they will have to wait three, five or seven years for a social worker.  That is just neither a practical nor a realistic solution.</p> <p> The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection handles vast amounts of people's data, as do other Departments, such as the Department of Health.  It is possible to have access to one's own data, and that is a human right, for information purposes.  It is proposed, however, to put up a roadblock and say all data must go through some social worker model.  The children who are young now and have difficulties are the people who need the social worker and the family support, whereas the Government just has to make a decision on the people who are more mature and want their information.  The Minister, Deputy Zappone, was very vocal about this when she was a Senator.  She supported me on a lot of legislation which was socially very advanced for the Ireland of the time, such as legislation providing for marriages to be celebrated by civil solemnisers and humanists and, similarly, legislation providing for transgender people to be allowed a birth certificate in their required gender.</p></speech>

Since then, we have had four interim reports: two in 2016, one in 2017 and one in 2018.  The final report was due on 17 February last, but now this extension has been asked for.  It further pushes out the process until February 2020.  We are told it is to ensure there will be an accurate and comprehensive final report but the whole history of this matter has been one of delay after delay over many years.  It is even a number of years now since the then Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, apologised to the ladies of the Magdalen laundries, who still face a number of outstanding issues.  This is all related: the Magdalen laundries, the mother and baby homes and the industrial schools.  It is the treatment of unmarried mothers that was inhumane.  This included treatment by their families, the fathers of the babies of those unmarried mothers, many people in the clergy and many people in officialdom.  They were not all unmarried mothers.  One of the saddest stories I heard was of a lady I met who had been put into an institution by her father because his second wife did not want the children from the first wife living with them after that first wife had passed away.  It is quite incredible to think Irish people could behave in such a cruel and inhumane way.</p>  <p>  I must mention the mixed-race people because I was very privileged to meet them and it is so good that they are involved.  Two of them are chairing particular groups.  Their stories are even more heartbreaking because of the additional pain, trauma and stigma they faced, being from a mixed-race background.  I found it a very humbling experience to meet them and others I have met in my time here.  They have survived with dignity and compassion, and I think we all benefit from that experience and from their insight.</p>  <p>  We know there are survivors who are extremely angry about the way they have been treated, and that anger must be acknowledged and respected.  Now, to add to the exasperation already being experienced, there is further delay to people getting information, as they found out through the media that an extension was being sought for another year.  Will the commission be looking for another extension this time next year?  Perhaps an extension is really needed in order that all the information be available, but surely it is just a matter of courtesy that those who are most affected, namely, the survivors, would hear first and in an appropriate way of any extension.  It should not have happened the way it did.  I know that on 13 February, the Minister did express her sympathy with survivors' concerns that their ages and health profiles mean there is an urgency to resolve this situation.  I hope this means there will not be any more unnecessary delays.  Dr. Shannon has been asked what can be done with the current legislative framework in respect of collecting biological samples and safeguarding those samples.  Eight weeks from now, before Easter, we should have that report from Dr. Shannon.</p>  <p>  I am aware that the commission had a very extensive body of work in meeting former residents and those connected to the institutions being investigated.  We know there are more individuals awaiting hearings, and they must be heard.  Then there is the analysis of the documentary evidence, the cross-referencing and the forensic excavation of the burial ground at the children's home in Tuam.  We were told the Departments of Health and Children and Youth Affairs provided a lot of material, but why was some of it received so late by the commission, with possibly more material to come?  It is almost like a drip-feeding of information to the commission.  It is hard to understand all the requests for the extensions and why an exercise was not carried out at the start of the process that would have come up with realistic deadlines based on the amount of work that was to be done and the expectations involved.  The deadlines were never going to be met and they are still not being met.  With each missed deadline trust is being eroded, and with each delay confidence in the process of realising justice has been seriously undermined.  Then there is a question of the cost of each delay.  Is there a costing of where we are to date with the extra delays?  Are there further costs for staff and for the premises being used?</p>  <p>  I acknowledge the invaluable work of Catherine Corless, in the discovery of the remains of 796 children in 2014, and that figure could be conservative.  It is really hard to comprehend and envisage almost 800 children buried in the one area.</p>  <p>  The excavations yesterday at Sean Ross Abbey indicated there may be 269 buried there.  How many more bodies are going to be found?  The campaigners' research would indicate that as many as 800 children may have died there.  In the case of Bessborough mother and baby home, the register shows 470 infants and ten women who died there between 1934 and 1953.  Behind each body is a real person with an identity, but that identity has been eroded.  Apart from not having a life, even in death these people did not get recognition in the form of a plaque, a monument or a stone with their name on it.  We have been rightly horrified by the mass graves in Rwanda, Bosnia and Syria.  It is just so ironic, so incredible, that we are looking at a similar situation, similar graves, here in Ireland.</p>  <p>  The Tuam Home Survivors Network has said, "Results from our ageing and, in some cases, frail membership should be banked to eliminate any delay in returning human remains to identifiable relatives for dignified burials."  Those human beings were not given any respect or dignity in life, so surely the request for dignity in death and burial can be expedited.  We are all very disturbed by those who would deny the Holocaust, for example.  It is important we do not do the same here and deny or try to hide behind what has happened.  Again, Catherine Corless's point is that our history is never forgotten.  The relatives and the survivors are entitled to comprehensive information, and if they do not get it, that means that the ill-treatment, the mistreatment and the abuse continue.</p>  <p>  I have a positive view of restorative justice.  I have seen its effectiveness in the healing process.  However, for it to have a chance to help or to heal, information is vital, and the information must be available.  The question then is, can justice be achieved if none of the information being sought by the survivors is forthcoming?</p><p>People talk about closure, but I dislike that word.  It almost suggests that the door can be closed on the past and the pain, which I find disrespectful.  The pain can be eased, however, and it can be released but the experience will live with people for ever.  The release and relief will come when those affected have all the information.  We seem to have a terrible fear of acknowledging, facing or coping with the truth, not only in Ireland but also in other places.  I am reminded of another group with which I am involved, namely, Justice for the Forgotten, which represents the victims of those caught in the Dublin and Monaghan bombings and their relatives.  They have waited 45 years for the truth, as are the families of those who were killed in other atrocities in the Troubles.  Authorities have sat on the information and the truth, which is disrespectful, indifferent and callous to the pain and heartache of those affected, who are waiting on the truth.  While apologies, redress and financial payments are important, the truth is paramount.  Nevertheless, this continued secrecy remains, whether in the case of the mother and baby homes, the Magdalen laundries or Justice for the Forgotten.  The secrecy and lack of access to information and truth continues the abuse.</p> <p> We might reflect on the Holocaust and how it has been remembered through memorials and preservation, whether in the Holocaust museums in Berlin and Jerusalem or the concentration camps, all of which face the truth.  All the information is available and the victims' names are printed in order that people can see.  For the same reason, we need a repository for all the records and an appropriate, dignified memorial.  The most effective redress is access to information, which means not being afraid of the truth.  That leads us to the subject of access to birth and adoption records.  Some of those who had been adopted did not know, for various reasons, that they had been, some did not know from where they had been adopted, while the parents of others passed away before the information could be passed on and, therefore, no records were left.  I acknowledge the work produced by the Justice for Magdalenes, the Adoption Rights Alliance and the Clann Project following extensive interviews and conversations with people who sadly had been separated from their family members and communities through an appalling system, which took children into institutions such as mother and baby homes and enforced secret adoptions and disappearances.  It was such a blight on Irish society.</p> <p> In reply to a parliamentary question I tabled, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, welcomed the Clann Project submission and the courage it took to provide the testimony.  I had asked what would happen to the records and the Minister replied that it would be a matter for the prescribed Minister.  She is supportive of transparency and the importance of the truth but those two words - "transparency" and "truth" - demand acknowledging the pain.  That is more important than closure.  It is an extremely dark aspect of our history and we cannot just close the door on it.  We must acknowledge and recognise it.  A suitable, appropriate memorial, which concerns the access to truth and everything that happened, would be fitting.</p></speech>

We saw the commission as a means to bring justice to the victims of these homes.  However, while the commission was established in February 2015, which was four years ago this month, to investigate the concerns related to the institutional care of unmarried mothers and their babies, we must recognise and acknowledge why it was set up.  It was established on foot of disturbing reports that a significant number of human remains had been discovered at the site of the former Bon Secours mother and baby home in Tuam, County Galway.  Like previous speakers, I pay tribute to Catherine Corless who did exemplary work to ensure that the story got out and that the victims would have the opportunity to be treated with dignity and so on.</p>  <p>  The deeply saddening discovery of five years ago, the aftermath of which continues, underscores the importance of the ongoing commission of investigation into mother and baby homes throughout the country.  The initial report of the commission was originally due in February 2018 but it was granted an extension.  It is a little disappointing that the commission now has another year to publish its final report, which will now be available in 2020 at the earliest.  The Government has stated, however, that it can make no decision on compensating the dwindling band of former residents until the commission has delivered its final report.  Some survivors of these institutions who are in their later years are losing hope that they will ever see a report from the commission.  Fianna F&aacute;il is disappointed to see yet another extension to the commission of investigation's timeline, particularly for the survivors and their families, who have waited for the report for one year and will continue to do so for another year.  The Government must do everything in its power to ensure the report is completed as soon as possible.  I take on board Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan's point about closure.  There will never be complete closure but there is a way to recognise what women and their children went through.  We must try to acknowledge what happened and restore some dignity to the survivors.  That is extremely important.</p>  <p>  Although we must try to reach some type of conclusion in supporting the survivors who have waited a long time and must establish some type of dignified memorial on the site, we are speaking about historical abuse of women and children.  We cannot lose sight of women and children who are suffering today.  Some 1,400 children are in direct provision, while almost 4,000 children are in emergency accommodation.  While it is important that we look back on the wrong deeds that were done to the children of years past and a previous generation, there must be a renewed focus on supporting children who are currently in direct provision and emergency accommodation.  I have no doubt that in 20, 30 or 40 years' time, Deputies will stand in the Chamber and discuss what was done and not done to help those children.  A commission may be put in place at that point to investigate why more was not done for them.</p>  <p>  I thank the Minister of State for listening.  I have no doubt that she will convey our messages to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and the Cabinet.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-02-21a.402" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1345" speakername="Martin Kenny" time="15:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019022100033#KK00300"><p>The issue is close to me because I know a number of women who were residents of the homes and who raised various issues with me.  Their lives, as well as those of their families and others around them, were traumatised and they feel aggrieved that the situation has been pushed back again.  They had expected and looked forward to the conclusion of the issue, not now but sooner.  In the case of two women I have come to know well, their upbringing in the traumatic circumstances of the homes affected them, their relationships with their children and their relationships with others in their families.  They believe the State has not provided for them and that it has instead turned its back and walked away.  The situation has been allowed to continue and the commission has not achieved the results it was expected to achieve.  While I understand many people have been interviewed and much work has been done, in reply to various parliamentary questions tabled by my party colleagues and others about whether everything was on stream, whether the report would be finished on time and whether the commission was working, we were assured at all times that everything was hunky-dory and that there was no problem.</p><p>At the 11th hour of the 11th day, it is postponed again for another year.  Many of these people are of advanced years and failing health.  It is not just about their physical health.  Many of these people have had very traumatic lives of very poor mental health.  Mental health issues are prevalent in many of these problems that many women involved have suffered.</p> <p> I have been conscious of a number of people who were children who grew up in some of those homes over periods and have ended up out in the community.  I spoke about it before.  In decades gone by, many children who came from the homes were put out with families and farmers, and worked with farmers.  In my area, they were known as home boys.  While some of them were treated very well in some places, in many cases they were not and had very difficult lives.  They grew up in an institution, had no experience of family life and no experience of how to interact in a community.  In many cases, they were the butt of a joke, made fools of and were maligned in the community.  My mother often talks about how, when she went and worked in England, she met them in the dance halls.  They were equal there as with all Irish immigrants but it is the first place that they found equality.  Many of those young men grew up and have a very bitter attitude towards the country that they came from.</p> <p> I know many in my community.  I remember there was an old man, when we were going to school, Eddie Whiffen, who had a big long beard, big long coat and a slight twang of an English accent.  Everyone laughed and joked about poor Eddie but Eddie was one of those people who came from a home and suffered greatly throughout his life.  There were many others throughout rural communities all over the country.  Many of them were treated very badly.  That was a reflection of the society that we lived in at that time.  It was a cruel, difficult Ireland.  We have an opportunity to acknowledge that, accept that significant wrongs were done and move forward.</p> <p> Much of this is about the unfortunate children who did not survive in those homes and who died there, as we have seen in Tuam and many other places.  While that has been exposed, most of us are aware that much more is to come with regard to all of that.  It is clear that the Government has to step in and not just acknowledge what has happened but actually do something for them.  The bodies of the victims in those situations need to be given proper, dignified burials.  There needs to be acknowledgement of the wrong that was done to them, sometimes by religious institutions but also by the State.  All of this has to happen in a way that reflects the new Ireland that we want to be and the future that we want to build.  We have to leave that past behind and grow up out of it.  If we are to grow up out of it, we need to make this happen very quickly.</p> <p> Waiting and waiting is telling these people who are victims of it that they do not matter.  I think they matter.  They are equal citizens and have an equal right to a space in our society and community as everyone else does.  They need to be acknowledged and the only way to acknowledge them is to lift them up.  The issues that many of them faced are in their past but they still relive it.  While they may never be able to get over it, the only way for us as a society to get over it is to do the right thing.  Unfortunately, what we see happening here with this being pushed further out all the time and a lot of vagueness about where it will end is that many of these women come to the conclusion that they do not matter, that their lives do not matter and that the children they saw die in the homes do not matter.</p> <p> There is a significant responsibility on the Government to do the right thing here.  The direction it has gone so far makes many wonder whether Government is really committed to doing the right thing.  The sooner we can get to a conclusion, the better.  Pushing it out for another year without any sense of delivery is not the way forward.  That has to be acknowledged by the Minister.  Having said that, we in Sinn F&eacute;in want to support anything that can be done to drive this forward, but the right thing needs to be done and it can no longer be hidden.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-02-21a.404" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1355" speakername="Mick Wallace" time="15:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019022100034#LL00200"><p>Retraumatisation is a conscious or unconscious reminder of past trauma that results in a re-experiencing of the initial trauma event.  It can be triggered by a situation, an attitude or expression, or by certain environments that replicate the dynamics and the loss of power, control and safety of the original trauma.  Not being believed or listened to is another factor in trauma and retrauma.  The whole issue of the experiences of people who were incarcerated, locked away and hidden behind the walls of the so-called mother and baby homes is only one part of a legacy of incarceration that is an open wound in this country.  It is a wound that we continue to leave untreated because the State has consciously avoided it and is now conducting a tactic of delay until they die.</p><p>The most recent delay has caused a great deal of distress for those survivors and their families who are still waiting for acknowledgment, for an apology and for redress.  To be clear, redress is not just about financial compensation.  It is also about acknowledging what happened, accepting responsibility and someone being held accountable.  Until we do that, the State continues to drag people through more traumas and cruelty every day.  We saw the awful way in which a small group of Magdalen survivors were wrongfully excluded from the redress scheme and the Government was heavily criticised by the Ombudsman for that exclusion.  It was unjustifiable and, in a similar way, the exclusion of a tiny group of survivors from the Protestant Bethany Home should also be heavily criticised.  The latest delay by the commission has a consequence of continuing that exclusion for that small group of people.  There is no legitimate reason for them to have been left out in the first place and it is absolutely shameful that the Government is not intervening now.  There is ample evidence of cruelty and neglect of children and babies at the Bethany Home.  There is also evidence of the State's involvement in placing children in this home, of funding this home and of concerns flagged about the conditions there.</p><p>In 1939, the clerk of the Rathdown Board of Assistance wrote to the secretary of local government, raising concerns about a child in poor health and rickety condition, and specifically asked that provision is made for inspection of the Bethany Home.  In 1940, a request directly to the medical inspector of local government asked that the matter be inquired into as several children have been sent to the nurse in the district from time to time from this home suffering from rickets.  Between 1922 and 1949, 223 children from the Bethany Home were buried in Mount Jerome Cemetery in unmarked graves.  Some 175 were between four weeks and two years old, 25 were aged from a few hours to four weeks old, and 19 were stillborn.  The causes of death recorded tell a story of neglect, with 54 from convulsions, 26 from malnutrition, 12 from delicacy, seven from pneumonia, and 19 with no cause given.  That the State played a role in the use of the Bethany Home structure is undeniable.  Correspondence in 1946 from the secretary of Monaghan County Council states:</p><blockquote>I am directed by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health to refer to the County Manager&rsquo;s Order (no. 4711) and to state that he will not object to payment being made at the rate of 15 shillings per week in respect of patients maintained in Bethany home Rathgar.</blockquote><p>Last week, a survivor, Joyce McSharry, got in touch with us.  She sent her story.  She also sent it to the Minister in the hope that it would be read and viewed with some empathy as it deserves to be.  The response from the Minister's office was, sadly, a typical bureaucratic reply that did not acknowledge the story that Joyce went to great lengths to write and explain that it had actually been read.  I have no doubt that it was a very difficult and traumatic thing for Joyce to have to put down in writing.</p><p>I do not have time to read it all but here is a selection from her letter:</p><blockquote>My birth mother Emily Sheppey was born in Islington in London in 1928 she was a member of the Church of England.  She gave birth to me in 1951 in the Protestant Bethany home in Dublin where I remained with my mother until the following December, at which time I underwent a peculiar irregular adoption.  Over the last thirteen years I pieced together my roots with some success.  I have two life stories, one told to me and one I discovered.  I am unable to obtain a long version of my birth certificate, as the state has only an irregular version of my details.  My adoptive parents informed me that my mother died in 1951.  They said that a social worker visited a flat in which a woman was found dead in her bed from TB.  I was reportedly discovered in the bed beside her.  I was brought to St Ultan's hospital and then to the Bethany Home.  These details were elaborated upon as I grew.  The story is a lie.  I was shocked to discover in 2013 that my Parents always knew it to be a lie.  My mother Emily did die in a flat, but aged 48, lonely and alone, apart from her pet dog, a poodle, in Weston Super Mare, UK, in August 1976.  My second Presbyterian baptism was designed to erase the fact that my mother, Emily Sheppy, resided in the Bethany Home and was not dead.  In 2013 and 2014 I obtained adoption documents from PACT (formerly the Protestant Adoption Society)  One of them was an 'agreement' from 1951.  Its content is deeply upsetting.  It indicates that my mother was probably pressured into giving me up.  My adoptive parents participated in this charade and were therefore aware that my mother was alive.  I may have been told the &lsquo;death-of-TB-in-a flat&rsquo; story in an effort to prevent me from searching for my mother, and the document may have been designed to frighten my mother into not seeking me out.  Besides stipulating that I was to be brought up Protestant, the penniless Emily was threatened in the 'agreement' that should she attempt to contact her daughter, she would be liable retrospectively for &pound;26 minimum per annum (valued at &euro;913.25 in 2013), plus educational, medical, clothing and other costs.  An owner of the solicitor firm who drew up the documents was appointed as my mother&rsquo;s 'attorney', but not to represent Emily's interests.  It was designed so as to avoid contacting Emily under anticipated Adoption Act legislation.  This was explicitly stated.  This man (Ralph Walker) was a nephew of Bethany Home Residential Secretary, Hettie Walker, who also signed the 'agreement' ..... Thirteen years ago, In January 2002, I began attempting to trace my roots by contacting PACT (Protestant Adoption and Counselling Trust), which holds Bethany Home records.  For a &euro;100 fee, they first gave me a copy of a single line in a register and, in May 2003, my first cousin Pam's UK telephone number.  I therefore rang Pam cold.  She was astonished to hear this strange lrishwoman, about whom she had recently learned.  What astonished me was that Pam knew my mother, who was alive for the first 25 years of my life.  I did not know in 2002 that my (by now deceased) adoptive parents also knew.  Finding out in this way made me start to question all I thought I knew.  I was emotionally drained and extremely upset.  In fact I became very ill ..... I contacted Pam again in 2013.  We spent months talking on the phone getting to know each other.  It was decided I would go over to London to meet her and the family.  I had also contacted my mother&rsquo;s other brother, Fran, who lived in Shrewsbury.  I told him I was coming over and would like to meet him ..... Uncle Fran was always aware of my existence.  Fran gave me a very special and to this day treasured gift from my mother, 12 photographs of me from my Christening to six months old.  It was the first time I had seen photographs from this part of my life.  Fran kept them perfectly preserved after my mother died nearly forty years earlier in 1976.  She kept them all of her life.</blockquote><p>Joyce concludes her letter by saying how she would &quot;love to contact any other mothers who were present in Bethany between April and November 1951. It may help me to better understand the awful circumstances my mother endured there.&quot;  The heartbreak of her story, the damage of forced separation, the lies and cover-ups, the dodgy arrangements around illegal adoptions, are all connected back to mother and baby homes, and the Bethany Home behaved in the same manner as the other homes, the pain is no less for the survivors because they were Protestant rather than Catholic.  It is long overdue that we call a halt to this cruel exclusion of the survivors of the Bethany Home from redress.  I ask the Minister of State to read Joyce's letter in full and give her a good response.</p></speech>

I am sorry if I left anybody out.</p>  <p>  We all know about the unbelievable cruelty that happened in this country in the past and is probably still happening in some places and the loss of those children's lives and the loss for the parents of being able to hold their babies and of having their babies taken away from them.  As most speakers said, time is running out and it is up to us in government and elsewhere to make sure these people have the answers they deserve before they depart this world.  Deputy Wallace's contribution uncovers a story that most of us have sadly seen on television in the past year, where people are united not only with their parents but with siblings they did not know they had.  When watching programmes like that, I realise how lucky I was as a child to have the parents I had and to have known them as I did.  For many children, sadly, that did not happen.  I have taken some notes - I hope I can read my bad writing.  I thank the Deputies for their honesty and their in-depth knowledge of what happened and the discovery of the unbelievable records that we have and do not have and about the fact that so many children and mothers are buried in unmarked graves.  That is a real darkness that hangs over the country and all of us, as politicians and as members of society.  I assure all the speakers that I will bring some of the matters raised back to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, when I have had a chance to read my notes and put them in an email to her.</p>  <p>  I will read the prepared statement, but as I have only two minutes, I will not read it all.  On behalf of the Government, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs has asked me to thank the Deputies who made contributions to the debate this afternoon and previously on 7 February.  Unfortunately, she cannot be here, which she regrets.</p>  <p>  The Government understands and shares the frustration and disappointment felt at the extension to the commission's timeframe.  The commission's work is a key step in our determination to establish, confront and accept the truth about this dark chapter in our recent history.  By remaining committed to this statutory investigation and by allowing an additional year for the commission to complete its work, we can achieve the necessary holistic understanding of what went wrong in the country.  As a country and a society, we shy away from establishing these deep truths at our peril.</p>  <p>  The options facing the Government were either to insist on the timeline and accept incomplete reports next month or allow the important work to be finalised.  The  Government believed the public interest was best served by facilitating the commission to complete its important work.</p><p>However, the Minister sought and received assurances that work which was completed in the meantime would be published.  A significant step in that regard will be the publication of a burials report in March.  It will give not only more background information on the site in Tuam but also on other sites of former mother and baby homes.  It would be wrong to predict or speculate on what the report will state on any particular site, but it is a significant piece of work as we continue towards establishing the truth about that period of our history.  The Minister has committed to bringing the report to the Government as soon as possible after it has been received, with a view to publishing it with Government approval.<br/><br/>The terms of reference for the inquiry were rightly ambitious in terms of their scope and timeframe.  Nobody thought it would be easy or quick.  Let us not forget that the commission is seeking to investigate circumstances and practices which, in some cases, were deliberately hidden and certainly not subject to intensive scrutiny at the time.  There are no short cuts to establishing the truth.  The Minister has asked the commission to make every effort to deliver its reports as soon as is practicable and in advance of February 2020, if possible.  In considering the time required to conclude its reports we must acknowledge the volume and complexity of the work before the commission.<br/><br/>In its report the commission acknowledges the extensive material provided by the Department of Health and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  While the report states the first tranche of discovery was delivered in March 2017, the commission has acknowledged that this is incorrect and that, in fact, the discovery of records commenced in February 2016. <br/><br/><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i><br/><br/>The delivery consisted of more than 200 files that had been selected by the commission as a matter of priority.  The joint discovery process between the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the Department of Health is now complete.  In respect of the discovery of records from the HSE or any third party to the commission, it is important to state this is not something in which the Minister or her Department has a role.  The Minister is, however, satisfied that the commission has all of the necessary legal powers to obtain the records and testimony it needs to inform its investigation.<br/><br/>In response to the recent requests to begin collecting DNA samples of survivors and relatives the Minister has asked Dr. Geoffrey Shannon to examine whether it is possible to meet this request within the current legislative framework.  The examination will be carried out in the context of what is scientifically possible.  The terms of reference for the examination are available to view on the website of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.<br/><br/>Deputies have noted that there was upset among the survivor community as a result of finding out through the media about the commission's request for an extension.  For survivors to find out this upsetting news through the media was not what anyone wanted.  I have been assured that the information did not issue from the Minister's Department.  Communicating with former residents is a key concern of the Minister and the Government.</p></speech>

In fact, I absolutely hate paying above the odds.  I remember being outside the old Lansdowne Road stadium in the early 1980s when tickets were being sold at an awful price and I could not afford to buy them.  I got a fellow to give me a leg up onto the wall and then the roof.  When I jumped down, I was seen by a garda who chased me as fast as he could.  I ran up the ramp of the south terrace and the place was jammed.  I put my head down to knee level and went right down into the terrace as fast as I could.  Of course, the garda never caught me.</p>  <p>  I remember another day on which I could not get a ticket and decided to try my luck.  I went through the turnstile as if I had a ticket and gave the man in it a tenner.  He let me in as it was a tenner for him and he did not mind one bit.  One could probably have called it bribery.  </p>  <p>  I remember attending the World Cup final in 1982 when Italy played Germany and won 3-1.  Rossi, Tardelli and Altobelli were the three scorers and it was a powerful win.  I did not have a ticket, but on the Saturday evening it was announced that tickets for the game, to be played on the Sunday afternoon, would go on sale at the stadium at 8 a.m. on the Sunday.  When I went there at approximately 7.45 a.m., without exaggeration, the queue was 2 miles long.  I did a count and there were about 6,000 people queueing for the 1,500 tickets available.  I went up to an Italian fellow who was fourth in the queue and asked if he knew how many tickets he would be allowed to buy.  He could speak a little English and said he did not know.  I told him that he would be allowed to buy four and asked how many he needed.  He only needed two.  I suggested he buy four and told him that I would give him 50% above the price of the other two.  Lo and behold, I got the two tickets I needed, unlike most of the people who had been queueing since the middle of the night.  One could have said it was also bribery, but I would resort to using any trick to get a ticket for a football match.</p>  <p>  To return to the subject of the Bill, the primary responsibility of any Government is to take the best care possible of those most in need of help.  I would say the same about legislators.  We should be putting all of our energy into dealing with issues such as the price of housing and dealing with homelessness.  Worrying about who can charge extra for a ticket should be down the list of our concerns.  This legislation is not workable and will only drive touting underground.  Making it illegal will not work.  As I said, it is illegal to sell drugs in Ireland, but there would be less drug use if they were legal.  Driving something underground does not work.  This is poor legislation.  As legislators, we have a responsibility to make better use of our time.</p></speech>

I am getting sick at the number of times we have had to deal with such legislation.  I am awaiting the introduction of a Bill dealing with apple pie, something to which no one could possibly object but which would not bring apple pie to anybody.  This Bill will not deliver regulation of ticket touting either.  We are told that it will make it illegal to sell tickets for what are called "major sporting, musical or theatrical events" in venues with a capacity of more than 300 people at more than face value.  The Minister of State has said the 300-person limit will be raised to 1,000, just to make it really clear that nobody is really interested in what happens in small-scale venues or the grassroots arts.  It is all about big ticket events.  I am not really sure why the arbitrary 300-person limit was included in the Bill in the first place.  Is it the case that the promoters of the Bill want to see tickets for small gigs being sold at an exorbitant price?  What is the reasoning behind it?  If we are to ban above-cost ticket touting, I do not understand why we would not ban touting across the board.  Why make a distinction?  The only goal in having an arbitrary cut-off point seems to be to tell small-time artists and their fans that they do not really matter.  It is an unnecessary kick in the teeth for them.  The music industry is suffering as a result of this domination.  It is all about the big events and the media hype.  As a result, bands no longer tour in the way they used to.  They no longer travel around the country in a tour bus.  They play in one large venue and that is it.  The way in which the entertainment business is being organised does not harness creativity and waters down the experience of attending a live music event.  That is a debate we could be having.</p>  <p>  I go back to the random cut-off point of 300 which is soon to be raised to 1,000.  That tells us something about from where the Bill comes.  It springs straight from the hullabaloo about tickets for big events such as the U2 concerts in Croke Park or the all-Ireland finals when tickets sell for thousands of euro.  It is very amusing to see a Government that absolutely loves to charge Opposition Deputies with populism come here with legislation such as this.  As Deputy Wallace said, there are 4,000 children throughout the country who do not have a home.  The number of homeless families has quadrupled in a decade.  It is conservatively estimated that there are 10,000 people in the country who do not have a roof over their head, yet we are here talking about this legislation.  Last night the Government and Fianna F&aacute;il decried Sinn F&eacute;in's stunt of tabling a motion of no confidence in the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris.  People in glasshouses really should not throw stones.  </p>  <p>  When the D&aacute;il resumed last month after the Christmas recess, we were told that the decks had to be cleared to deal with Brexit.  We were told that only the most pressing items of legislation would make the cut this session, that everything else had to be put into cold storage, yet here we are debating a Bill dealing with ticket touting.  It really gives us some idea of the Government's priorities at a time when nearly 1 million people are on HSE waiting lists.</p></speech>
