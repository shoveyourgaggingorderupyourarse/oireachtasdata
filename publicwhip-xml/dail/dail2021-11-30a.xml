Ar dt&uacute;s b&aacute;ire ba mhaith liom tr&eacute;asl&uacute; leo uilig at&aacute; ag troid ar son an chirt maidir leis an scannal m&iacute;oca agus pir&iacute;t, agus an ceart acu agus fios acu caid&eacute; mar at&aacute; ceart agus c&oacute;ir.  N&iacute;l dabht ar bith go raibh f&aacute;ilte acu roimh cuid de na ceannl&iacute;nte a bh&iacute; &aacute; bhf&oacute;gairt maidin inniu, is &eacute; sin 100% taca&iacute;ochta, ach nuair a amharcann siad ar na sonra&iacute; ansin t&aacute; imn&iacute; ar go leor teaghlach i nD&uacute;n na nGall agus n&iacute;os faide.  Ba mhaith liom go bhfreagr&oacute;dh an Taoiseach c&uacute;pla ceist f&aacute; dtaobh de sin.</p>  <p>  I commend all those who are fighting for justice for those who have been impacted by the mica and pyrite scandal, particularly those from my county of Donegal.  Right up and down the west coast of Ireland, they opened up their hearts and opened up their homes and told us their personal stories.  They told us about the impact their crumbling homes have had on them, their families and their mental health.  They have fought for justice and fought for what is right.  From the schoolkids who came to protest outside the gates of Leinster House to all those around the world who supported this campaign, these campaigners won the hearts and minds of the Irish nation.  They have moved the Government into a position where I believe it never wanted to be and a long way from where it was.</p>  <p>  This scandal has devastated the lives of ordinary families and is a direct consequence of the Celtic tiger era, an era of no regulation and light-touch regulation.  These families have worked hard all their lives and have scrimped and saved to build homes for themselves and their families.  They want what every single person would want, and that is a place that is safe and secure and a place where they can raise their families.  Through no fault of their own, however, they find themselves in a nightmare situation where their houses are literally crumbling around them.  They have fought hard and fought a good campaign and they deserve our praise today.</p>  <p>  We have been here before, however, and the devil is always in the detail and in the implementation of these schemes.  These families previously signed up to a scheme only to find out that it did not do what it said it would do.  This time it needs to be different.  In Sinn F&eacute;in's view - and we have raised this with the Taoiseach - the Housing Agency, just like it did in the north Leinster pyrite scheme, should be tasked with delivering the scheme and families should not be left to fend for themselves.  However, we are already hearing contradictory reports about what is on the table.  We are informed that the campaigners were told this morning, before the Cabinet meeting, that what would be on the table as redress would be &euro;145 per square foot.  We are now informed that that is only available for the first 1,000 sq. ft and on a sliding scale thereafter.  I wish to press the Taoiseach on why the Cabinet made such a decision.  Did it run the numbers and look at how they would affect families in Donegal and elsewhere?  Is the Taoiseach aware that, in respect of the scheme that currently operates, the average cost for demolition and rebuild of a home that has been notified to Donegal County Council is &euro;150 per square foot?</p> <p>The average size of a mica-affected house in County Donegal is 2,300 sq. ft.  According to the Government's sliding scale, a homeowner will have to find &euro;45,500 to rebuild their house.  In the case of the average one-off house, which comes in at just shy of 2,600 sq. ft in this State, according to the sliding scale that the Cabinet has signed off on, the homeowner will have to find &euro;56,000.  The families are asking how this could be, and where they will find the money.  They thought they would get 100% redress.  They thought the Government had heard them.  Can the Taoiseach confirm to the D&aacute;il and, more importantly, reassure those families that the numbers I have referenced are not those that will be applicable?  If the Government runs a scheme that provides &euro;145 for the first 1,000 sq. ft and &euro;110 for the rest, families will have to make such a contribution.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-11-30a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="14:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021113000004#B00200"><p>First, I say to the Deputy that every party and every D&aacute;il Deputy in this House is extremely well aware of and very concerned about the devastation wreaked on many families as a result of the mica scandal.  The scandal is not about the absence of regulation; it is about a failure by certain operations to adhere to the regulations.  We must call that out.  Those responsible need to be held accountable for what transpired.  That is the first point I make.</p>  <p>  Families need their houses rebuilt.  To be fair to the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, he has focused on this issue for quite some time and has worked with the working group.  I went up last summer to meet with the working group.  I heard their main concerns about the original scheme, which was meant in good faith.  The scheme was accepted and endorsed by the Deputy's party at the time.  Indeed, so satisfied was his party with the last scheme that it did not even reference it in its general election manifesto.  Those are the facts.  We also asked the Deputy's party leader, who cannot be here today as she is on her way to the United States, to submit the party's proposals and specific ideas around how this scheme could operate, but it decided not to send any suggestion to the working group or to the Minister.</p>  <p>  The new scheme will improve the 90% maximum grant to a 100% grant for all remediation options 1 to 5.  The maximum expenditure cap for option 1, demolition and rebuild, will be increased from &euro;275,000, under the original scheme that the Deputy's party endorsed, to &euro;420,000.  It is estimated that the new scheme will cost over &euro;2.2 billion.  There will be a central role for the Housing Agency.  There is a clearer damage calculation and the introduction of an independent appeals process.  Social housing and homes will be remediated at a cost of around &euro;180 million.  There are 900 rented properties that are registered with the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB.  They will also be eligible for the scheme, with one application per household permitted, to the cost to &euro;160 million.  A fixed sum of &euro;20,000 will be allocated to each homeowner to rent alternative accommodation should they have to leave their house for reconstruction, and they will be allocated storage costs of up to &euro;5,000.  Under the scheme, &euro;145 will be provided per square foot for the first 1,000 sq. ft.</p>  <p>  The Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland, SCSI, has developed the methodology that will be used.  It comes up with an annual average.  Currently, the average rebuild cost is &euro;138 per square foot.  We are going with &euro;145 for the first 1,000 sq. ft.  That will change again in April with the publication of the new surveyors' guide.  We will be guided by the SCSI and its methodology, which uses a sliding scale.  If you talk to any quantity surveyor, that is perfectly understandable.  There are economies of scale at play in the context of larger houses.  We are absolutely adamant that the scheme should not disadvantage smaller houses, which represent the bulk of houses covered by this scheme, by the introduction of a flat rate, for example.  The sliding scale is an appropriate way to do it.  We need to depoliticise the methodology around the pricing and the square footage.  We believe we can do that by that working with the SCSI on an annual basis.  The scheme will also take into account inflation over the years.  We have also built in certification and a State guarantee for remedial works, so that an applicant who chooses from options 2 to 5, does not demolish the property and does other repairs and so on will not be penalised if subsequently something untoward happens again.  Such a person will have the option to apply for a second grant.</p>  <p>  Without doubt, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage has worked extremely hard with all of the parties to find a very comprehensive solution to this issue and to put in place the correct governance around the scheme to ensure we can deal with a very pressing and unacceptable situation for too many families in County Donegal and in other counties.</p> <p>We are determined to get started on this now and to get the job done.</p></speech>

These families are going through an absolutely terrible situation.  You can never realise it until you are invited into their homes, where they tell you their own story and let you into their own personal scenario.  We need to ensure this scheme is fit for purpose.  I have asked the Taoiseach a simple question.  I have the SCSI calculator and I have just entered into it a 2,300 sq. ft home in the north west.  The calculator says that it would cost &euro;334,000 to build.  These are the same numbers I gave out earlier.  The problem with the Government scheme is that it drops to &euro;110 per square foot after 1,000 sq. ft and the family will have to find &euro;45,000.  That is a big problem.  These families do not have &euro;45,000.  If a family has the average one-off house, they will have to find &euro;56,000.  The SCSI calculation currently for the north west is based on a rate of &euro;145 per sq. ft, and it does not have a drop down to &euro;110, on which the Cabinet signed off.  I ask the Taoiseach to explain this and, more importantly, to say to the families that he is wrong, and that they will not have to put their hands in their pockets for that amount to have their homes rebuilt due to something that was not their fault in the first place.</p></speech>

We are saying we must depoliticise the methodology around the costings here.  The SCSI on an annual basis updates the square footage building costs.  They accept a sliding scale.  Most people involved in building and surveying accept the methodology of a sliding scale.  We did not want to disadvantage the smaller houses.  If you look at the property tax returns, for example, you will see that the vast majority of housing in Donegal is around the &euro;200,000-plus mark.  I accept that rebuilding costs can be more expensive than current valuations in terms of the cost of construction and so on, but it is a much more advanced scheme than the previous scheme with regard to the &euro;20,000 grants-----</p></speech>

It lacks urgency, cohesion and rationality.  This is particularly evident in the approach to antigen testing, which is more like Lanigan's ball - in again and out again - than fact-based and deliberative.  As we now know, the Government led pharmacists and retailers on a merry dance during negotiations to agree a subsidy for the tests, before abruptly walking off the dance floor.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, in a casual aside during a long interview yesterday revealed that a subsidy is no longer being contemplated, apparently because the market will provide.  According to the Minister, a person can now get tests for &euro;4 in certain supermarkets.  The State's role in making tests affordable has been replaced by the market, or has it?</p>  <p>  There are a number of glaring problems with the State's hands-off approach to the provision of antigen tests.  First, I will address the issue of quality.  Between June and early October, the European Commission rejected 160 separate applications from various producers of antigen tests, while six tests were removed altogether from the list during that time.  Clearly, there are a lot of sub-par tests out there.  There is no regulator for diagnostic tests in Ireland.  The Health Products Regulatory Authority regulates medicines but it has no role in regulating antigen tests, nor does any other body.  While retailers may be supplying tests at somewhat reduced rates, what assurance does the State have that these tests have been subject to any kind of quality control and are reliable?  </p> <p>Does the individual's personal responsibility in the fight against Covid-19 now extend to policing standards for antigen tests that may be on the market?  It is also a reality that antigen tests at &euro;3 or &euro;4 each, when the advice is that they should be taken twice a week, are simply out of reach for many low- and middle-income workers who are already struggling to cope.  The Minister for Health&rsquo;s glib advice that people should simply shop around for the best price is beneath contempt.  </p> <p> Can the Taoiseach be clear?  First, is this Government is happy for those who do not live near large discount supermarkets to pay through the nose no matter what their financial circumstances?  Second, how does the State propose to ensure a consistent supply of affordable tests in the absence of having some role in their provision and supply?  Third, and probably most important, does the Government have any plans to regulate diagnostic tests, specifically antigen tests, or does it also intend to foist responsibility for that work on to ordinary citizens?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-11-30a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="14:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021113000006#D00200"><p>The Deputy said the Government&rsquo;s Covid-19 response in general was haphazard and chaotic.  I would like to put that comment in context.  More than 8.1 million vaccines have been administered in Ireland.  We have the highest vaccination rate in the European Union, with 93.4% of the adult population fully vaccinated.  The executive director today of the European Medicines Agency, EMA, outlined how Ireland has the highest vaccination rate in Europe and stated:</p> <blockquote> 	...the deaths per 1 million population over the last 14 days were 15.  But in two other European countries with vaccination rates of less than 50% the equivalent death rates were over 250 per 1 million of [its] population. </blockquote>  <p>I respectfully suggest to the Deputy that this country and this Government's performance on vaccination is anything but chaotic and haphazard.  The plan this week is to administer 220,000 to 240,000 primary vaccines and, of course, the booster vaccine.  Already, 800,000 booster vaccines have been administered.</p><p>Some 212,000 free lab tests were completed in the past seven days.  This is the highest volume of lab tests completed to date in a seven-day period.  Approximately 1.1 million tests have been conducted in the past six weeks.  Total expenditure on testing and tracing during the pandemic is at approximately &euro;846 million.  Since 28 October, 93,346 - and it is closer to 100,000 as of today - close contacts have used antigen tests.  We have sent out 100,000 free antigen tests to close contacts.  Antigen testing of close contacts in schools has commenced and 8,000 were dispatched yesterday alone, all free of charge.  </p><p>Yes, we did engage with leading retailers to achieve a price target of between &euro;2 to &euro;3 for antigen tests.  In our view, if one takes, for example, the serial testing, which is also free, in respect of agriculture, where well over 100,000 free tests have been used in food production centres, and in universities and the third level sector, which have been using free antigen tests, we have a very targeted and effective approach.  This also applies to the quality of the test where there are established tests that the major multiples adhere to.  The European Commission has published a guide and has given advice to member states on the range of quality tests that are currently on the market.</p><p>The broader picture, as the Deputy knows, is that the public health authorities have not been as enthusiastic as she is  I support the position on the use of antigen testing.  Where we are now is a very significant advance on where we were previously during the pandemic.</p></speech>

I raised questions specifically on antigen tests.</p> <p>How can the Taoiseach guarantee affordability and quality?  The current European direction states: "The performance of antigen tests is self-assessed by the manufacturers prior to their release."  The group chaired by Professor Mary Horgan, which examined this issue, made very clear that it does not recommend specific tests for use and, therefore, it is important that we "ensure there is robust ongoing monitoring and evaluation of the performance of the test".  How does the Taoiseach propose to ensure there is "ongoing robust monitoring" of these tests to ensure quality standards?  At the moment, the market decides the price and, if people are chasing a low price, it is inevitable poor-quality tests will come on the market, given the lack of regulation in this area.  How does the Taoiseach propose to ensure quality and affordability in regard to these tests?</p></speech>

However, having watched the press conference given by the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, I am shocked at what is emerging, as I was by the Taoiseach's response to an earlier question.  It appeared on some levels that the Government had finally listened to the victims of its failures of oversight and regulation and intended legislating for that.  However, we will have to keep a watching eye over that as well.  There is a touch of the ghost of Christmas past here in that when the previous iteration was cobbled together just prior to the general election, it was sold by Government Deputies in County Donegal as being much more than it was.  It appears to me that Donegal families are facing the same again, despite this morning's fanfare of leaks from the Cabinet.  Many of the county's mica-affected homeowners are still not sure if they can see a Christmas future under the new scheme.</p>  <p>  I have just spoken to members of the Mica Action Group, who confirmed that when the Minister spoke to them this morning, there was no mention of a split rate or sliding scale.  He talked about the price per square foot and that was it.  He stated today that the sliding scale will be &euro;110 per square foot after the first 1,000 sq. ft.  This means, as was outlined earlier, that for the average 2,300 sq. ft house in Donegal, there will be a deficit of &euro;45,000 still to be met by the homeowner, which is almost 15% of the cost.  It is not a 90:10 scheme and it was not going to be.  I stated in my manifesto that I was opposed to the previous mica scheme because it was not adequate to meet the needs of homeowners, which has been proven right.  I also responded to the Minister's request for submissions on the scheme on 11 August this year.</p>  <p>  It is time for the Taoiseach to be honest that he is not delivering 100% redress.  He can dress it up whatever way he wants but the mica-affected homeowners will not be hoodwinked again.  I think there is going to be a real soul-searching on their part.  Is the Taoiseach going to have a proper scheme that will compensate families properly, so that they do not have exorbitant costs to meet under the scheme?</p> <p>It is not on; they cannot afford it.  That is what is going to happen.  Is the Taoiseach saying that the figures I quoted are wrong?  Can he show where they are wrong?</p></speech>

That is a substantial contribution by the taxpayer of today and the future and the Exchequer to any housing remediation scheme.  That needs to be acknowledged in the first instance.</p></speech>

Everyone in life has responsibilities.  Let us stop trying to excuse people on the ground of regulations.  There are regulatory frameworks today and there were regulatory framework then.  Certain people did not adhere to them.  That is the point.  No one will ever call that out because it does not suit them to call it out.  The Government must always be the first resort.</p>  <p>  I have no issue with sorting this out and helping families to rebuild their homes.  I have been in a house where I have seen how devastating this is for families.  We need to rebuild these houses, but we need to get on with it and get it done.  </p>  <p>  I have been in government for approximately 18 months of this.  This has been going on for years.  Deputy Pringle has been a Member for ten years.  This has been going on for too long.  We can have more and more campaigns, but nothing gets done in the meantime.  We can get the scheme up and running.  In my view, this scheme is a very good accommodation.</p>  <p>  When we first met, homeowners had to put up all of the upfront costs themselves.  That has been taken out.  In addition, a &euro;20,000 facility will be made available for rental, something which was not available in the past.  A facility for storage was not available under the previous scheme.  We should use the methodology used by the Society of Chartered Surveyors of Ireland, which has it will change the square footage rate on an annual basis to meet the current market position.  Let us depoliticise the methodology around this.  That is what the scheme provides for.</p>  <p>  Let us look at the valuations.  I accept it is not exactly the same, but in terms of the LPT, up to 36,000 homes will be valued at between zero to &euro;200,000 in Donegal.  The cap is up to &euro;420,000.  The first 1,000 sq. ft will be capped at &euro;145 per sq. ft.  That could change in April when the society updates the figures.  There are no upfront costs for homeowners on this occasion.  The Housing Agency will play a central role in helping homeowners to deal with this.  </p></speech>

That is the only rationale.  This level of State intervention is unprecedented.  It has never happened previously at the level it is happening now.  It is because it is a social priority.  In other words, we believe the residents and homeowners in Donegal, given the situation in which they find themselves, are not in a position to rebuild these homes.  It is not their fault the blocks were defective.  That is my point - the blocks were defective.  These people did not know that.  Let us be very clear here and let there not be any implication that I was blaming homeowners.  That would be wrong, and anything I have said today is the contrary of that.  We must help the homeowners.  That is the spirit and ethos of our scheme.  It is designed to enable the homeowners to rebuild their homes and to ensure they will not have expenses while they are rebuilding those homes or having them rebuilt, through the &euro;20,000 for the rent and the storage.

If people cannot afford to fuel a lorry or the local bus, what is the Government's solution?  Everyone is looking for a solution but they hear nothing from the Government.</p>  <p>  Look at the public transport comparison between rural Ireland, including west Cork, and Bray in County Wicklow.  The only public transport that leaves the Beara Peninsula, the Sheep's Head Peninsula and the Mizen Head Peninsula is one service by Bus &Eacute;ireann at approximately 7 a.m.  This goes through Schull, Ballydehob, Skibbereen and Clonakilty.  Now look at the transport in Bray.  The DART to Dublin leaves Bray station and returns from Dublin to Bray every five minutes up until 10 a.m.  After 10 a.m. the frequency is every ten minutes.  From 7 a.m. to 10 a.m. there are more than 25 trips to Dublin.  That does not include buses from Bray to Dublin.  Mizen Head, Sheep's Head and Beara have two services in total out of the peninsulas in the same time period, with nothing coming in.  The same applies from Dunmanway to Clonakilty and to places such as Drinagh, Ballinspittle and Barryroe.  There are little or no public transport services.</p>  <p>  This is a small example of an unfair society and shows the massive gap between two counties in the same country.  The climate action plan and the Government's carbon tax dream bubble hit fuel the most and severely hit transport in rural communities.  Instead of putting the horse before the cart, it is the other way around.  Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party have hit the people of rural Ireland first, straight in the pocket to pay for pet projects in the capital.  Common sense is very scarce up here.  It was sadly lacking when the Government taxed fuel to put it out of the reach of the ordinary people who have no choice but to use a car to work, shop, collect their pensions, get basic food items and transport children, as the bus that leaves west Cork at 7 a.m. is the only means of public transport until 7 p.m. when it returns to Goleen.  We hear proposals for a BusConnects service in rural communities, which is welcome, but it is said it will take up to five years.  If this is the case, stop the carbon tax applying to rural Ireland immediately until there is a public transport service whereby people can jump on buses, the same as others in this country, every five or ten minutes, with buses coming to and going from places such as Dunmanway to Clonakilty and Ballineen to Kinsale.  All these services should link with West Cork Connect, a private operator whose buses leave Bantry and Skibbereen several times a day for Cork city and back.</p>  <p>  Will the Taoiseach promise to stop the carbon tax applying to rural Ireland immediately until there is a public transport service in place?  If not, will he tell me and the people of rural Ireland what his plans are to cut the extraordinary fuel charges in this country, unlike those in any other country, at present?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-11-30a.75" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="15:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021113000010#H00100"><p>First, I believe in a stronger public transport system throughout rural Ireland.  The Minister for Transport and for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Ryan, published a substantive investment programme in rural transport recently which represents a significant advance on what we have had heretofore.  It is very important we improve transport overall, including public transport, and give additional supports to existing transport operators in rural Ireland.</p>  <p>  We will not have a DART, I suspect, from Bere Island or from Beara.  Obviously, in areas of high population, in Wicklow, for example, there will be a greater frequency, but we need to increase frequency.  I note Deputy Christopher O'Sullivan suggested to me this idea of one every hour in every village.  That is a significant target, but that is the type of approach we want to move towards in respect of public transport in rural Ireland and our climate responsibilities.</p>  <p>  The carbon tax is not the issue in terms of the current increases in fuel and energy.  A global issue is fundamentally responsible for the significant increases in fuel and energy pricing.  Electricity, eventually, will follow through.  It is hoped that will abate in the first quarter of next year.  That is what the European Central Bank and others are saying.  I accept the jury is out on that.  The Government has responded to this in the budget in terms of social protection and taxation measures to try to alleviate and make some contribution to help people cope with the increase in fuel.  The carbon tax will deal with substantial investment in retrofitting which ultimately will give lower energy costs for homeowners across the board.  It is far more sustainable into the future.  However, it is not the main driver by any yardstick of the current increase in energy prices across Europe and the globe, of which Ireland is part.</p>  <p>  We acknowledge there is a lot of pressure on people and Government is constantly keeping the situation under review in terms of what measures we could implement to try to reduce the electricity bills for householders in this country.  That would be in addition to the measures that we took in the budget in terms of social protection and in terms of the taxation measures themselves.  That is our position.</p>  <p>  In the context of rural Ireland, the Deputy must acknowledge the variety of schemes we have initiated and substantially resourced in the past 12 months in terms of rural funding, capital projects, LEADER funding and CL&Aacute;R funding.  Substantial schemes have been initiated across the board.  The Government has demonstrated a real commitment to rural Ireland, and that is manifest in the level of resources we have allocated and which will continue.  I can assure the Deputy of that.</p></speech>

I would say the Taoiseach should stop thinking about that dream.</p>  <p>  The public transport is the same, with the Minister, Deputy Ryan, kicking the can down the road.  It might happen in the next few years, the Taoiseach is saying.  A Deputy said this and a Deputy said that.  There is no delivery.  There is one public transport service leaving the Mizen Peninsula at 7 o'clock in the morning.  Nothing is returning until 7 o'clock in the evening.</p>  <p>  I asked the Taoiseach for solutions to this fuel crisis but he has no solutions.  What do I say to the haulier operator who is paying &euro;1,000 a month more on fuel this year than last year and cannot continue?  What do I say to the local bus operators who are barely surviving?  Look at West Cork Connect, an independent bus operator who goes to Cork several times a day from Skibbereen and Bantry, providing an incredible service, whom it was costing &euro;110 on a round trip last year and is now costing &euro;165.  The Taoiseach does not seem to be able to grasp the crisis that is out there in rural Ireland as there is little or no public transport for us to avail of as the Government continues to take &euro;57 of tax, one way or another, in every &euro;100 spent on petrol.  Will the Taoiseach immediately reverse that carbon tax increase in rural Ireland and let us know further measures, or any measures, the Government is taking to save many of those I spoke about earlier from going out of business?</p></speech>

It is not kicking the can down the road.  The programme has been announced in terms of an enhanced and expanded rural transport network.</p> <p> I am a great believer in public transport.  My late father drover many a bus to different parts of west Cork and I am fully aware of the needs of Mizen, Glengarriff, Beara and all those areas that need a good regular bus service.  They are growing and developing and we must put in alternative investments into these locations and towns in rural areas as well.  We must do that right across the western seaboard.  I know the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Humphreys, and her team at the Department through the rural regeneration and development fund is really expanding that.</p> <p> There has been approximately &euro;250 million allocated, covering 164 projects.  That is a real and substantive allocation, which the Deputy should acknowledge from time to time.  I know the Deputy must raise matters and I do not dispute that.</p></speech>

Members of the Opposition are having an each-way bet every day and every week on a whole range of issues.  It seems to me that it suits the Opposition at times that there is paralysis in getting things done.  Let us consider the Maritime Area Planning Bill, which is essential.  Last week, Deputies were complaining that a major wind energy company was pulling out because we did not have our planning frameworks through.  The Bill has been given a fair degree of consideration-----</p></speech>

Now, they are saying we are bringing in legislation that will be restrictive of citizens' rights.  It is more incoherence and inconsistency.  They label the Government with that from time to time.  Every single month it changes in here.  I am simply saying that the public health measures have to be extended.  That is all we are doing.  The Deputies are familiar with them.  We debate and discuss them at committees and the plenary session.  They are not the third secret of Fatima.  That is all that is being put forward.  What is happening is the consolidation of existing different pieces of legislation.  The Health (Amendment) (No. 3) Bill will be published and that is what is in it essentially.  We want to have the mandatory quarantine capacity on the Statute Book again.  There was an expiry date in the previous measures.</p></speech>

It did not happen on either occasion.  Last Wednesday, the Taoiseach said his Government was committed to providing subsidised antigen testing and, yesterday, the Minister for Health said he is ditching plans to subsidise antigen testing because the market has solved the problem for the Government.  However, the price of an antigen test in many places is still anything up to &euro;8.  Does the Taoiseach acknowledge this is out of the reach of struggling families, particularly if they have three or four children and want to follow the advice of the Government, which is to use antigen testing?  Does the Taoiseach believe antigen testing should be made convenient, accessible and affordable to those who are asymptomatic?  Does he believe that &euro;5, &euro;6 or, indeed, &euro;8, which is charged in many outlets, is unaffordable to such families?  What is he going to do about it?</p></speech>

Will the Taoiseach stand up for Europe, including this country, and ensure we give a TRIPS waiver?

We must pay tribute to the South African authorities for the honesty, transparency and speed with which they have responded to Omicron.</p> <p>They should not be punished.  We have to develop mechanisms to support countries that identify very quickly and in a transparent way such variants.  The Omicron variant is likely to be in this country.  There are now a number of cases on which work will have to be done to identify and to confirm whether or not they are Omicron.  They could have been right throughout November or indeed in October and there is a look back going on now in terms of people who have travelled in from various locations.  There are cases emerging all over Europe, at very low levels it must be said.  Delta is the predominant variant here.  On the last occasion, with Alpha and so on, we enhanced genomic sequencing capacity here.

They are still forced to buy the antigen tests for around &euro;8 because the discount stores are selling out within 20 or 30 minutes at the price of &euro;3.  There is no contact tracing at all in the sector, which means that the illness is spreading in the sector.  Some parents are so desperate to go to work that they are sending their kids in with Calpol and hoping for the best.  This is incredible.  Other parents are being told they cannot send in their children.

Over 100 nations support this position, yet it has effectively been blocked by the US and the EU.  We know that it has been public money that developed these vaccines.  For example, less than 2% of the identified funding for the AstraZeneca vaccine came from private industry.  These are our vaccines.  As Mike Ryan has said, we have been brought to our knees by a virus not because the virus is smart but because we are stupid.  We have not been able to use groundbreaking tools in the smartest way we could have.  The issue is to be discussed at the World Trade Organization TRIPS council this week.  As a nation we have an opportunity to be on the right side of history on this.  I ask the Taoiseach to go to that council and support us and support the TRIPS waiver being given to the rest of the world, as it has been asked for by the South African Government.</p></speech>

I do object to the sloganisation and the ideology around it because I am not convinced at all that it produces one extra vaccine.  In the case of BioNTech or any other company that has produced vaccines in record time, if you waive the intellectual property, who will do the next vaccine in six months' time for the next variant?</p></speech>

They were all over the place at European level and globally in terms of production of vaccines.</p> <p>I accept that we need to get vaccines to less developed countries.  There are many issues involved.  Some of those countries refused the Pfizer and other mRNA vaccines initially because they thought AstraZeneca was going to be the vaccine at the time.  The Deputy will recall all the issues with the manufacture and supply of the AstraZeneca vaccine.  There is a whole range of issues.  I would argue that Europe has been the most progressive contributor on policy and the mechanics of getting this done.</p></speech>

However, there is some confusion and people have been ringing me.  My understanding is that there must be a five-month interval following vaccination before someone can get the booster.  I ask the Taoiseach to clarify that.  There is a bit of confusion about it.</p>  <p>  I also want to raise the issue of GPs.  There is no permanent GP in the family medical centre in Tullow.  I have contacted the HSE and I have been told that it is in the process of recruiting a GP.  There is a locum in place but it is only temporary.  A lady came to my office yesterday and told me that she had been to five GP surgeries as a private patient, which were unable to take her because they are so full.  It is a concern.</p></speech>

According to clinical and medical advice from NIAC, there must be a five-month interval between the vaccination and booster vaccination.  The EMA has also stated that the optimal time to get the booster is five months after the second mRNA vaccination.  For the Janssen vaccine, it is three months after the administration of the vaccine.  That is the current position.  That is something that is kept under review.</p>  <p>  In respect of GPs, there has been a challenge over the years securing GPs for rural Ireland.  That is clearly manifesting itself in Tullow, which is an area of significant population.  I can understand the difficulties there.  That is an issue that I will work with the HSE and the Minister on.</p></speech>

What we saw at the weekend was a packed Aviva Stadium, which shows the potential of the League of Ireland.  What we have, in reality, is a League of Ireland that is struggling day to day.  What we need is meaningful support for the league.  We need better facilities and investment in academies.  Post-Brexit, young people who are looking to improve themselves and build a career in football can no longer access academies in the UK.  We need to reform the unrealistic target of 30% matched funding for the sports capital grants, which many of these clubs and facilities cannot meet.  What will the Government do to provide meaningful supports to the League of Ireland?</p></speech>

I believe, under the current leadership within the FAI, that there is a genuine agenda, working with the Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Deputy Chambers, to develop long-term plans for the strengthening of League of Ireland football.  It should be acknowledged that there has been a considerable investment over the years in League of Ireland facilities, including Tallaght Stadium and Turner's Cross Stadium in Cork city, where I have witnessed a fantastic transformation over the years.  However, sustainability is needed.</p>  <p>  I want to congratulate St. Patrick's Athletic on a very good win.  Tradition comes through.

Within one month of the announcement of the intention to introduce a new scheme, we, in County Mayo, submitted 18 different suggested changes to make it workable.  The Taoiseach is not correct to say that we did not submit suggestions.  We went through the old scheme painstakingly.</p>  <p>  I want to clarify some points.  Does the 100% redress mean 100% redress to rebuild?  Will that exclude nobody impacted by pyrite?  Does it include the planning, demolition, engineering and architect costs?  Homeowners who have been forced to emigrate are now returning home.  Will they be included in the scheme?  Is there retrospective provision for the small number of homeowners who had to rebuild before the scheme came into effect?  I ask the Taoiseach to clear up as many of those questions as possible.</p></speech>

It will cost more than &euro;2.2 billion, over a protracted period admittedly, because not all the houses will come on stream together.  The scheme has been expanded in an unprecedented way to cover rental properties as well.  There has to be a framework.  Decisions have to be taken.  All of the upfront costs, which originally, householders had to take on board, will now be dealt with by the Housing Agency.  There is &euro;20,000 being allocated to cover rent and storage.  This is a far more expansive scheme than its predecessor.  That should be acknowledged.  I believe we now need to get on with doing the work.</p></speech>

In addition to that, the UL Hospitals Group is the only hospital group in the country that does not have a dose adjustment for normal eating, DAFNE, clinic, which is now recognised as an essential part of the care for adult diabetics suffering from type 1 diabetes.  The reason for that is that despite the fact the funding was approved about 12 months ago to recruit specialist staff, they have not been recruited as yet.  When are those staff going to be recruited?  I realise that the Taoiseach may not have the information to hand, but I would appreciate it if he would check the matter out and get back to me.</p></speech>

These include the establishment of an office of the T&aacute;naiste and an office of the leader of the Green Party within the Department of the Taoiseach, located in Government buildings.  There are 16 special advisers employed within the Department of the Taoiseach, covering the T&aacute;naiste and the leader of the Green Party, including the Government Chief Whip.</p> <p>They work with the various office holders in the Department.

It is an unprecedented number of advisers.  I would say it is the highest in the history of the State.  When the Taoiseach was in opposition he asked an awful lot of questions, as did his colleagues, as to why they were all required.  The Taoiseach has gone and beaten the record.  It includes 16 names, as the Taoiseach has outlined,  I do not believe that this includes some other drivers.  On top of that there are other offices.  If you add in those who are working in secretarial roles, assistant roles, driver roles, and the Government press secretaries and advisers to the Attorney General etc., how many are there in total?  This is so we can clearly see what the overall cost is.  I have a cost of &euro;3 million per year.  Is that accurate?  Is there a system of reviewing how this is performing?  Surely the Taoiseach has some system of managing it and looking at the performance.  It is a significant cost.  Perhaps the Taoiseach would outline to us what this is.</p>  <p>  Will the Taoiseach confirm that every aspect of all of the communications from all of these advisers, including WhatsApp, emails, messages, voice notes, and other electronic messages, is available under freedom of information and under parliamentary questions?</p>  <p>  I was very intrigued by the announcement made by the Taoiseach at the end of September on the comprehensive review of Irish planning legislation, which is to be led by the Attorney General.  In principle, the review of planning legislation is something I welcome.  I did a review of An Bord Plean&aacute;la a number of years ago.  It is intriguing that this proposed review is to be led by the Attorney General.  Is this in accordance with the Cabinet handbook?  What is the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, whose remit covers planning, responsible for?  Why is he not leading this review ?  Why is the Attorney General leading it?  What resources are being put into the review and how many people are involved?  What are the costs of it?  Have additional resources been provided?  There are three special advisers in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, the Department that covers planning.  Are they involved in this review or are their roles being duplicated?  Why was the Minister with responsibility for planning not in charge of this?  Why is the Attorney General in charge of this?  The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage decides what legislation he or she wants.  The Minister is in charge of policy, not the Attorney General.  The Attorney General is not the policy chief.  He advises the Government legally, so why is he leading on this?  Is this a dangerous precedent?  Has the Taoiseach seen this before?  I admit that Attorneys General always advise legally, but they do not lead on policy.  How is it that the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, who is responsible for planning, is being absolutely bypassed here and a role is being set up for the Attorney General to do this when in reality it should be a member of the Government who has responsibility for it?</p></speech>

There are people dealing with different aspects of disability across a whole series of departmental silos, and as a result we do not have a rights-based approach to disability matters in the context of the UNCRPD.  For example, I met a woman recently who spoke about her son who has Down's syndrome and who is constantly having his medical card entitlement reviewed.  In our own area at the moment there is a door-to-door transport service called Accessible Community Transport Southside, ACTS, for people who are wheelchair users and those with mobility issues.  The service's lack of funding means several thousand people with mobility issues or who use wheelchairs and cannot use public transport are going to lose the service through the lack of a relatively small amount of money.  I could go on.  The problem is that all these things are dealt with by subsidiaries of departmental silos rather than having a co-ordinated approach, which the Taoiseach's Department should lead, towards ensuring a rights-based approach to disability matters in line with the implementation of UNCRPD.</p></speech>

I wish to raise these matters again today in the hope the Taoiseach will address our specific concerns.  As the Taoiseach is aware, the Government rejected a Sinn F&eacute;in amendment to the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill last year that would have brought the appointments process to the advisory council in line with other public bodies.  Specifically, our amendment was based on the process of appointments to the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.  Like his Minister, the Taoiseach has yet to explain why he continues to oppose an open and transparent system of appointments to the advisory council.  This is a serious matter.  The manner in which these appointments were made flies in the face of public administration norms and undermines the important work of eminently qualified people.  The Taoiseach argues the appointments follow the letter of the law, but he does not acknowledge that his Government, which drafted the legislative provision, enabled the Minister to appoint party members as advisers in the first place.  This is particularly relevant as the same legislation provides for the advisory council's significantly enhanced oversight functions.  These are valid questions by the Opposition.  Rather than play the man, surely the Taoiseach should now play the ball and explain why he and his Government opposes an open and transparent process of appointments to the Climate Change Advisory Council.</p></speech>

I agree with the Deputy that it is an important aspect of modern government, and that was an initiative taken by the Labour Party at the time.  This is in line with that.  We are a three-party coalition.  If Deputy Kelly was in government as the leader of the Labour Party, he would demand the exact same accommodation in respect of advisers as the Green Party or the Fine Gael Party currently have.  It is completely in line with the Public Service Management Act 1997.  The limits are there.  This is in accordance with those limits.  It is also transparent and public.  It is all done under the terms of the Public Service Management Act 1997.  The Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste of the day, and their party leader in Government, may have more than two special advisers.  A Minister of State who attends Cabinet may have two special advisers, and the Minister of State who does not attend Cabinet can have one special adviser.  All special advisers must be formally appointed by the Government.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has published guidelines setting out the arrangements for the staffing of ministerial offices for the Thirty-third D&aacute;il.</p>  <p>  On the issue of communications and texts, communications in respect of Government business must be available for freedom of information requests.</p>  <p>  Deputy Kelly asked about the planning review.  This was done in consultation with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy O'Brien.  He is very keen this would take place.  There is a very strong legal dimension to this with regard to the Acts and the laws that have been passed over the years.  The need to streamline these from a legal perspective is very important.  That is the exercise under way, and I believe it is a worthwhile exercise.  Deputy Kelly himself had raised with me some time ago his sense that the An Bord Plean&aacute;la structure needed increased capacity.  Deputy Kelly had identified to me that An Bord Plean&aacute;la was losing cases in the High Court a bit too regularly.  That is the context for this review.  It is not just about An Bord Plean&aacute;la; it is the full gamut of the planning system.</p> <p>The Minister, ultimately, retains policy primacy in this and he has consulted with the Attorney General and he is satisfied that the Attorney General should lead the legal overhaul and consolidation of the Planning Acts.  It is very important that we get this done.  It has to come before the House and ultimately the Government has to decide and the Minister has to be satisfied from a policy perspective of any changes that may emerge from this.  Obviously, if this is to manifest in legislation, which we hope it will, we will then be able to bring that before the House.</p> <p> One of the challenges that we have in this country is getting major infrastructural projects through in a timely manner.  Deputies will come into the House on a regular basis and will complain about how long the metro, or you name it - a whole range of projects - is taking.  Housing is even taking an inordinate length of time to get done.  We have an issue in getting projects developed, planned for and provided in a timely manner.  In some instances it is taking the best part of a decade to get things done.  On the Maritime Area Planning Bill 2021 about which there was a row earlier, one is still looking at years before wind energy projects will actually come on stream.  I am very conscious of that delay which is now endemic in how we do infrastructure projects in this country and it is very problematic for our future development.</p> <p> On Deputy Boyd Barrett's points, one of the big innovations of this Government was to move disability from health as a core responsibility to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth - it is a long title - to try to give a singular focus to the question of disability.  Operationally, the HSE will be involved in the delivery of services but from a policy perspective, there will be one key Department which will have the function of co-ordinating and developing policy and initiatives for people with disabilities.  The Deputy has referred to a Down's syndrome child, for example.  I would have thought they would have received the domiciliary care allowance and have automatic entitlement now to the medical card and certainly to the GP-----</p></speech>

One of the bigger areas that I am interested in - I am interested in all areas of special needs and disability - is employment.  That area needs to be worked on much more pro-actively in getting agencies and Government Departments employing more people more quickly in respect of disabilities.</p>  <p>  Deputy Mac Lochlainn raised the area of appointments, and these were transparent and in line with the legislation.  He said that he put forward an amendment.  There was a debate in the House on that amendment and his amendment lost.  There comes a time when the Deputy must also accept parliamentary democracy at work.  The two people concerned have considerable expertise in the area of environment and climate and have considerable academic experience which the Deputy seems to have ignored.  He accused the Government of playing the man and not the ball.  I argue from the outset of this that he has attempted to create a controversy and undermine the reputation of the individuals concerned and that is not fair.</p></speech>

Since then the level of infection has more than trebled among primary school children although in the absence of properly collected data by the health system, the incidence rate may be higher.  No satisfactory explanation has been provided by the Government as to how schools went from being safe to unsafe virtually overnight.  We support the Government in its intention to keep the schools open but what we cannot understand is why the Minister for Health has not reinstated fully resourced schools-specific contact tracing.  Why is that left to principals and parents?  Surely it is the HSE that must lead testing and tracing in our schools, including risk assessments and referrals for PCR testing where a child is a close contact.  Antigen testing should supplement not replace PCR testing.  It is not the job of educators to carry public health duties and we all know how stretched the school system is.  The capacity issues for PCR testing also need to be addressed in this context together with outstanding issues in regard to supply and distribution of antigen tests.  What update on both can the Taoiseach provide us with?</p>  <p>  Finally, on the roll-out of high efficiency particulate air, HEPA, filtration in classrooms, CO2 devices monitor air quality but HEPA filters actively remove contaminants from the air.  Does the Taoiseach agree with that and what does he intend to do about it?</p></speech>

We need to work together to try to find as many solutions as we can.</p>  <p>  On antigen testing the Ferguson report recommended it last April.  I presume the Government is open to tweaking the system because it needs to be tweaked and the antigen tests need to be based in the schools instead of being posted out afterwards and this is my honest assessment.  This is something we all must collectively change.</p>  <p>  I also ask the Government to consider buying HEPA air filters as they would be a good investment throughout this virus.  We should just do it.  Ventilation is critically important.</p>  <p>  On vaccines, post-Christmas, now that we have a report from the European Medicines Agency, will that vaccination be done through the schools?</p>  <p>  Finally, on the leaving certificate, I heard, accept and, in fact, agree with what the Taoiseach said earlier, probably, but is there are a continuing analysis of the fact that so many students at leaving certificate level have missed so many hours and days and teachers have also been out of the schools?</p></speech>

The Government has failed to intervene and the Christian Brothers are continuing to push through with that decision to sell off to private property developers the school playing fields.</p>  <p>  In the past week the parents were absolutely shocked to get a letter from the Christian Brothers, from the Edmund Rice Schools Trust, saying that it was not reappointing a board of management to the school but was going to have one manager and no board.  This is despite the fact that the parents and teachers have put forward representatives who could have formed a board.  The trust is empowered to do this under a statutory instrument brought in in 1998 by the former Minister for Education, Michael Woods, which means that the school simply has to notify the Government - I would like to know if it has done so - that they cannot supposedly find suitable people for the board.  This is retaliation by the Christian Brothers against the parents, teachers and school community because they oppose what the Christian Brothers are doing.  Will the Taoiseach intervene and prevent them from doing this because this has wide implications for other schools?</p></speech>

Yesterday the Minister for Health told RT&Eacute; radio that the expert group within the HSE had looked at this, namely HEPA filters in schools, in great detail and its advice to the Department of Education and to the Department of Health is that they are not recommended.  Exactly what the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, was referring to there is not clear from anything that is published on the relevant websites.  The NPHET expert group on ventilation recommended back in March that HEPA filters would be useful for schools, particularly for winter months when it is not possible to have windows open all day.</p> <p>The report stated that HEPA filter devices "may be useful in reducing airborne transmission in spaces with insufficient ventilation".  Yesterday, Dr. Kim Roberts, a member of the expert group, spoke at a press conference we organised about our ventilation Bill and the need for HEPA filters in schools.  The Department of Education, in May this year, said that, in a certain scenario, consideration should be given to a room air cleaner with a HEPA filter.  When will the Government change its position and invest in HEPA filters for every classroom?</p></speech>

We have seen good interventions by the Government over the past week in addressing substitute teacher shortages in primary schools and, yesterday, in secondary schools.  Some of those measures are very positive and will lead to a huge influx of people back into classrooms, stabilising the whole system at a time when we really want to keep schools open.  It very much concerns me, however, that the incidence of Covid in cr&egrave;ches and childcare settings has increased by 500% over recent weeks.  It should be noted that this is consistent with other age cohorts.  Covid is simply on the rise.  The same actions the Government is taking to address staff shortages at primary and secondary level must now be taken in the preschool context.  In a recent SIPTU survey, one third of childcare managers said their facilities are now at risk of closing and 61% said they will have to reduce capacity if all things remain equal.  We need to get the students in their final year of preschool studies in our third level centres back in.</p>  <p>  Contact tracing was removed from the primary school context in late September, when the rate of Covid infections was in a very different space.</p></speech>

This is of crucial importance for building new homes and for meeting our climate change and retrofitting targets.  Apprenticeships in key construction trades, such as bricklaying and plastering, are at only some 10% of their 2004 levels.  In other countries, such as the UK and Norway, public contracts for large infrastructure projects include a clause that a percentage of the workforce must be made up of apprentices.  In South Australia, for example, 15% of labour hours on specified public contracts are for apprentices and other targeted groups who need upskilling.  What is the Government doing to increase the number of apprenticeships in key construction trades?

In fairness, the Minister, Deputy Harris, has indicated strongly his interest in this specific area.  In the context of the establishment of the new Department and the shared island initiative, further education could be a real beneficiary and its further development would be of major benefit to students for generations to come on a cross-Border and all-Ireland basis.  At present, there is cross-Border co-operation on an <i>ad hoc</i>basis.  As we move forward, we should have structured co-operation on an all-Ireland basis.  Cavan Institute, the first board of management of which I had the privilege of chairing, became the first dedicated post-leaving certificate college in 1999.  It is the leading further education provider in the southern Border region.  Specific arrangements should be put in place to intensify and lead co-operation on an all-Ireland, cross-Border basis by having specific sister college arrangements with similar institutes in Northern Ireland.</p></speech>

Here, HEPA air purifiers could be provided for every Irish classroom at a cost of approximately &euro;12 million.  However, the Government has decided not to take this step.  I find this incredible, given that Covid is an airborne disease and our school buildings house school communities of approximately 1 million people, five days a week and for six hours most days.  Members of the State's expert group on ventilation, a subcommittee of NPHET, has been critical of the Government's failure on this front.  Indeed, four of them were forced to go public yesterday to challenge comments made by the Minister for Health on this issue.  Children have been asked to forgo Christmas parties and pantomimes and they are shivering in the cold in their classrooms.  People are doing that.  When is the Government going to do the right thing by them and put air filtration systems into every classroom in the State?</p></speech>

This is from the very same Deputies who will argue consistently for the need to adhere not only to public health advice but to even more severe public health advice in respect of zero Covid and so on.  When it suits them, they turn it all around and say that anything they do not like is done by the Government, not on the basis of public health advice.  It was the Government working on the advice from public health that took this decision because, at the time, the view was it was leading to disruption within schools and children being out of school.  The Deputies cannot have it both ways, but Deputy Murphy tends to have it both ways and each and every way every time he comes in here.</p></speech>

The fundamental view of that group, by the way, is that the most important ventilation is fresh air.  That is the most basic rule of thumb it has applied.  On the costings, people have magically come up with a figure of &euro;12 million.  I have been given an estimate that it could cost up to &euro;80 million if every single classroom were to be ventilated with a HEPA filter.  Again, that can be worked through.  What cannot be argued with is that hundreds of millions have been allocated to our education system for Covid preparedness.  The fact there are up to 35,000 CO2 monitors in schools throughout the country, in almost all classrooms, has been very important.  I have touched base with some schools in this respect and they have found it very useful in terms of managing their way through this.  In respect of air filtration in schools, there is a facility there to avail of that, working with departmental technical people who will advise schools that are in difficulty in regard to ventilation and help them to put in ventilation systems.  That facility is there and there is also the minor capital works programme and so on.  There is a sufficiency of capital there for people to have bespoke solutions for their particular school, because every school is different.</p>  <p>  The most important advice to give to schools and preschool settings is that where children are symptomatic, they should not be sent to school.  That is the most fundamental advice.  As I keep on saying, one of the biggest issues for the past three months has been respiratory syncytial virus, RSV, in terms of children getting ill and being hospitalised.  RSV and other respiratory illnesses have been the dominant issue this winter among children, which has proved challenging.  The symptomatic advice applies across the board and will be very helpful.  Someone said earlier that parents were sending children in with a spoonful or two of Calpol.  That is not the thing to do.</p>  <p>  Antigen testing has been introduced and 8,000 tests were dispatched.  I take Deputy Kelly's point and will follow up and reflect on it.  The target now is to get to the Christmas break, recalibrate and review how we deal with the next semester.  The advice we have received this week from the public health doctors is that they believe children should reduce their socialising.  Why?  They showed us graphs yesterday, which they published, showing that infections among five- to 11-year-olds are going through the roof in terms of numbers, or had been for the past number of weeks, as well as among their parents.  They are the two big bars in the graph showing where the numbers have gone up.  They want to bring that level down, just like we did in the rest of the population.  Two weeks ago, our pubic messaging worked in terms of making a statement asking people to follow the advice on working from home and our exhortations to people to reduce their socialising.  That has led to a moderation and stabilisation of hospital and ICU numbers, but we are still at too high a level of incidence.  The same advice now is being applied to children from the public health doctors, namely, that if we can reduce socialising overall, we could turn that curve the other way, which is down, in terms of those case numbers.</p></speech>

There needs to be more structured co-operation and I am working on that through the shared island initiative.  We are endeavouring to get the various education institutions together and we will support partnerships.  I would be interested in a further education partnership.  Work is under way in terms of third level and research partnerships.

I will follow that matter up with the Minister for Education.  Some clause in the 1998 Act has probably been invoked, and therefore a manager has to be put in place.  That appears to me to be regressive.  Let me follow through on that.  I do not have the full answer here.  I will alert the Minister for Education to the issue.</p>  <p>  Deputy Cathal Crowe dealt with contact tracing, five- to 11-year-olds and other school measures.

The ten Cabinet committees established by the Government reflect the full range of policy areas that it will work on during its lifetime, as set out in the programme for Government.  Cabinet committees meet regularly to continue this work.  The strategy statements which have been prepared by Departments reflect the key national priorities as outlined in the programme for Government.</p>  <p>  My Department has been involved in progressing some key programme for Government commitments in recent months.  They include ongoing monitoring and management of the impact of Covid-19; the provision of Covid and non-Covid healthcare; driving the delivery of our shared island commitments on a whole-of-government basis through the shared island unit in my Department; the establishment of a unit in my Department to help to support social dialogue; the implementation of the Housing for All strategy, which is driving the delivery of key housing related commitments; a major review to inform the revised national development plan, which was published in October; the delivery of the economic recovery plan, which was published on 1 June, after which a progress report will be compiled in the coming period to outline the considerable progress the plan has made in transitioning Ireland's economy; and the development of a well-being framework for Ireland, the first report of which was approved by the Government and published in July.  A follow-up phase of considerable consultation and engagement on the initial well-being framework is under way.</p>  <p>  The national digital strategy, which is being actively developed, will set out our overarching vision and ambition to position Ireland as a digital leader to the benefit of our people and the economy.  We published the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill, the climate action plan 2021, the marine planning framework and the Maritime Area Planning Bill.  There has been engagement with European Union leaders to advance a range of high-level objectives in the programme for Government, in particular regarding Brexit, Covid, the EU budget and the EU green agenda.  The commitments also include the implementation of Global Ireland 2025, supporting the work of the United Nations through our membership of the UN Security Council, the establishment of the Future of Media Commission, the completion of the work of the Citizens' Assembly on gender equality and ongoing oversight of the implementation of a policing service for our future, including the Government's plan to implement the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.  The Government will continue to work proactively to ensure the delivery of every aspect of the programme for Government.</p></reply>

Over 2,000 families in Dublin and north Leinster have availed of the scheme.  The Housing Agency does the testing, makes the prognosis, engages with building contractors and assists with rental accommodation.  From start to finish it is involved in the process.  Why is the Housing Agency not overseeing the defective concrete blocks scheme in Donegal and the west of Ireland?</p>  <p>  If the Government is so confident that the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland, SCSI, figures it is standing over today are fine, why does it not ask the Housing Agency to get the deal out there?  The outdated numbers from the SCSI for a typical average house to be demolished and rebuilt refer to houses that are 2,300 sq. ft.  On the SCSI's website, that would cost &euro;317,400, based on the numbers given today.  I hope those numbers are wrong.  The campaign rejected a proposal of &euro;108 per sq. ft.  The Minister assured them that would not be the figure.  The proposed scheme is even worse than they thought.  I ask the Taoiseach to clarify urgently that this information is wrong.  Why is the Housing Agency not operating the scheme in the west of Ireland as it does in the east to ensure that families who are traumatised do not have to carry this burden?</p></speech>

I ask the Taoiseach to clarify that because there is a lot of confusion out there, as I stand here.  There is a different view about the matter.</p><p>Will legislation on the Limerick mayoral election be passed early next year?  Will the election go ahead after the summer break next year?  Will the Taoiseach finally put this matter to bed?  A number of councillors in Limerick have come together to ask that the election go ahead.  If it does not, it is unlikely that it will go ahead at all, given when the local elections will be held.  The people of Limerick have voted for this and deserve it.  It should go ahead.  Can the Taoiseach clarify that?  </p><p>According to the <i>Business Post</i>, a package on energy is being put together.

The local connection rule is still causing significant issues and problems, perhaps not on the same scale as last year, but people are still being refused emergency accommodation because of the rule.  People have been told to leave emergency accommodation because of this rule.  It creates a huge problem for people in emergency accommodation who want to progress out of it and into more permanent housing.  The rule makes no sense.  It can mean that a person who is originally from Dublin and has moved to Galway to take up a job is recorded on some database as having his or her last employment in Galway.  If the person moves back to Dublin and become homeless, he or she is refused the services and supports he or she needs.  It is a bureaucratic rule and it needs to go.  Will that commitment in the programme for Government be realised?  What is the Government doing to sort out and get rid of the rule?</p></speech>

I am the chairperson of the all-party Oireachtas committee on diabetes.  The Taoiseach will be aware that my colleagues and I meet regularly with various organisations to discuss the issues facing people living with diabetes here in Ireland.  Those same people are keen to see the expansion of digital health services, the delivery of care more effectively, the empowerment of patients to access their medical records and the provision of more services to patients in their homes and communities.  They would like to see more investment in modern e-health and ICT infrastructure, in line with Project Ireland 2040 and the e-health strategy for Ireland.  Significant progress on medical ICT infrastructure was made during the course of the pandemic, with GPs improving e-health measures and providing for the secure electronic sharing of patient information and lab results, etc.  The electronic health record system, with its individual health identifier programme, is being rolled out within Children's Health Ireland and the initiative should be expanded across the HSE hospital network.  Perhaps the Taoiseach could give an update on this area and raise the matter with the Minister for Health.  </p></speech>

I also ask that payments such as carer's allowance and child benefit be disregarded when assessing who does or does not qualify for fuel allowance, especially when the only income of the household is a social welfare payment.  I will give an example of the type of individual who calls to my office or contacts me about the fuel allowance.  She is a lady over 66 years of age whose only income is the widow's pension.

They need the Government to lock up the house and keep the rent increases out, but it appears that the Government has left the front door on the latch and the back door swinging wide open.  The following is a quote from the <i>Irish Independent</i>website this morning regarding the proposed rent cap legislation: &quot;Landlords will be able to hike rents by multiples of new rent control caps if they have not increased rents in several years.&quot;  Is that quote correct?  If it is incorrect, can the Taoiseach explain how it is incorrect?  The website also says that the Government's stated aim is to cap rent increases at 2%, but with this legislation a 5.9% increase would be possible in some circumstances.  Does the Taoiseach disagree with that?  If so, can he explain what is his basis for doing so?  Clearly, what is needed is a three-year rent freeze, at least, with no loopholes, no exemptions and no get-out clauses for landlords.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach knows there is a crisis in the horticultural sector as a result of peat shortages.  Successive Governments over recent years have allowed that crisis to fester by not preventing the export of peat, not investing in finding alternatives to peat and allowing and forcing companies to import peat from the far side of Europe.  The Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Noonan, has the report of a working group he established to examine this matter and proposed recommendations to resolve it.  I have asked about this previously.  He has had the report for almost six weeks.  Will the Taoiseach ensure that the Minister of State publishes it this week and that the Government immediately sets about implementing its recommendations?</p></speech>

In light of the announcements yesterday, one has to wonder if that is going to be healthcare by Lidl's middle aisle.  The way the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, attempted to explain this U-turn and retreat from the previous policy that the Government would subsidise antigen testing by saying that the market has done it by itself really required a brass neck.  Does the Taoiseach not accept that price gouging will still take place for those who do not manage to get the antigen tests in the middle aisle and that we need to provide antigen testing for free as part of the public health service, as is happening in the NHS in Britain?</p></speech>

On 2 November, the cross-party group on music and entertainment wrote to a number of Ministers asking that those sector-specific supports, particularly the part-time self-employed scheme, would form the basis of an income support whereby musicians, entertainers and taxi drivers, as was the case previously, could earn up to a certain amount and get some support, given that their work has dramatically reduced as a result of the public health measures at a time when they would have expected to make quite a lot of money coming up to Christmas.</p></speech>

The key elements of that programme have been groundbreaking and significantly developed.  Delivering Housing for All is the biggest State investment in housing in the country's history.  I suggest that Deputy Cian O'Callaghan refer to the Minister with the specifics because the Minister is adamant that the local issue does not arise anymore and the accommodation should be provided.</p>  <p>  We have confronted and responded to the climate and biodiversity crisis.  Other parties have not; they are playing politics with it.  The Government has decided to go for it and has passed the law and passed the climate action plan and the carbon budgets.  We need those who are against the climate and almost in denial about the climate to come on board, because this has to be an Oireachtas approach.</p>  <p>  Managing the country's safety through the Covid pandemic has been a significant achievement of the Government so far.  We have rolled out one of the most successful vaccine programmes globally.  We have plotted the country's social and economic recovery, which has been significant since the spring, with unprecedented direct financial supports and Ireland's largest ever capital investment programme in the national development plan.  We are also developing and delivering the most significant initiative on North-South relations in decades through the shared island initiative.  We are embedding health reform in the lessons learned from Covid-19.</p>  <p>  In respect of bespoke measures for the entertainment and music sector, the Minister has announced some schemes.  We will continue to work on that and the Government will keep it under review in terms of more bespoke models to support those who may still be under pressure in the current situation.</p>  <p>  Regarding peat, let me be clear that the Government cannot break the law and cannot advocate breaking the law.  </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-11-30a.309" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1546" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="16:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021113000023#W00200"><p>I move:</p> <blockquote> 	That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approves the following Regulations in draft:  	Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund Regulations 2021, copies of which were laid in draft form before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on the 20th October, 2021. </blockquote>  <p>An important pillar of Government policy is to ensure that the horse and greyhound racing industries achieve their maximum potential and in doing so contribute to economic and social development over a wide geographical area.  As we know, the horse and greyhound racing industries make a valuable contribution to a balanced regional economy.  It is estimated that the thoroughbred industry has an annual economic impact of &euro;1.84 billion with direct and indirect employment of 29,000 people and that the greyhound sector benefits an estimated 10,000 people economically.  The thoroughbred industry, in particular, also brings a high level of international investment.</p><p>Government funding in addition to supporting these key industries presents an excellent opportunity to yield a high return on its investment leading to a flow throughout the economy thereby providing widespread benefit to our society.  Support for certain strategic industries is important for future economic growth and can provide widespread benefits for society as well as for our economy.  The Irish equine breeding and racing industry is extremely competitive internationally.  It is a real beacon for excellence.  We are the third biggest producer of thoroughbred foals in the world and estimates place Ireland only behind the United States as the biggest seller of bloodstock by auction globally.</p><p>The Government acknowledges the importance of these industries and has supported them through legislation and policy initiatives.  The support provided by public funds through investment in these industries has enabled Ireland to develop a world-class reputation for excellence in horse racing, greyhound racing and breeding.  Thanks to the hard work and exceptional support of the Irish people for the vaccination programme, the Government continues the gradual reopening of society.  Since 22 October, following the easing of Covid restrictions in line with the strategy of Reframing the Challenge, Continuing our Recovery and Reconnecting, full attendances have been allowed at outdoor events.  This situation is being kept under review.</p><p>The horse and greyhound racing industries receive financial support from the State through the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund under section 12 of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001.  My Department makes payments from the fund to Horse Racing Ireland and to R&aacute;sa&iacute;ocht Con &Eacute;ireann.  From 2001 to date, &euro;1.46 billion has been paid from the fund to the horse and greyhound racing industries in accordance with the provisions of the Act.  The cumulative upper limit on payments from the fund provided for under the relevant legislation has been reached.  Exchequer support provided from the fund is crucial for the survival and continued development of the horse and greyhound racing industries.  In order to give effect to the provisions of budget 2022, this cumulative upper limit must be increased by regulation approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas.</p><p>The Estimates for my Department passed by both Houses as part of budget 2022 include an allocation of &euro;88 million for the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund.  That is to be distributed in accordance with section 12(6) of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001 with 80% or &euro;70.4 million going to HRI and 20% or &euro;17.6 million going to R&aacute;sa&iacute;ocht Con &Eacute;ireann.</p><p>In order to allow my Department to provide the moneys allocated in budget 2022, it is necessary to comply with the technical requirement under section 12(13) of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act to increase the cumulative limit of the amount payable from the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund by &euro;88 million to &euro;1.54 billion.  This is achieved by way of the regulation submitted to this House today.  The aggregate limit on the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund was increased in this manner in 2004 and in 2009 to 2021, inclusive.</p><p>The 2017 Deloitte report into the economic impact of Irish breeding and racing, commissioned by HRI, indicates that the total direct and stimulated expenditure from the Irish breeding and racing industry is estimated at &euro;1.84 billion in 2016.  In addition, it is estimated that there are 15,200 jobs at the core of the racing and breeding industry or in directly related industries.  Horse racing helps drive a balanced regional economy.  It generates a very significant return to the rural economy in Ireland and a positive international profile for our country.  Of course, behind all the facts and figures are the thousands of men and women who directly and indirectly make the Irish racing and breeding industry what it is today.</p><p>While the Covid-19 pandemic has had a major impact on all levels of the industry, particularly in attendances at racecourses, the numbers of horses in training, owners, racers, fixtures and races have all shown strong growth over the corresponding pre-pandemic figures for 2019.  Figures published by HRI for the first six months of 2021 show that the number of horses in training, which is a key driver of rural employment for the industry, had increased by 24% on the comparable figure for 2019, with ownership up by almost 24% and new owners registered showing a 31% increase on the 2019 figures - all very strong figures.  Turnover in 2021 is estimated to reach &euro;154.7 million by the year end, an increase of &euro;48 million on 2020, but down by &euro;10.5 million on the pre-Covid pandemic year of 2019.  HRI continues to engage with all racecourses to crystallise the losses incurred during the pandemic.</p><p>As proven in 2021 to date, Irish owners, trainers, jockeys and horses are setting standards globally.  Their stellar achievements and enduring influence underscore Ireland's international prominence.  The Irish equine breeding and racing industry is extremely competitive at a global level, despite other racing nations having much larger populations and economies.</p><p>The importance of having a strong welfare and integrity foundation is crucial to this highly successful industry and this is well recognised throughout the industry.  My Department and I continue to work with HRI, the Irish Horseracing Regulatory Board and other relevant stakeholders to ensure the highest standards of integrity and welfare are maintained.  In that regard, I have received the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and Marine on integrity in racing published earlier this month.  This followed a series of meetings with this forum involving officials from my Department, HRI, the Irish Horseracing Regulatory Board and the Irish Racehorse Trainers Association over the summer.  We are examining that report and I will fully consider its findings shortly.  I thank the committee, under the chairmanship of Deputy Cahill, for its work for producing such a comprehensive and important report.</p><p>The EU and UK trade and co-operation agreement for Brexit reached in December of last year, which included the Northern Ireland protocol, was a welcome development for all of us.  It should be noted that challenges remain with the movement of horses between Ireland and Britain, and between Ireland and mainland Europe for those who are using the land bridge.  The global nature of major breeding operations illustrates that while Ireland now arguably holds a leadership role in Europe, its pre-eminence is not guaranteed.  According to the 2021 Power report, the greyhound industry provides and supports considerable employment both directly and indirectly across the Irish economy.  It is estimated that in 2019, the industry supported more than 4,000 full-time and part-time jobs.  In addition, there are more than 6,000 active greyhound owners.  The total number of people deriving economic benefit from the sector is estimated at over 10,000.  The funding provided to the sector helps sustain a long-standing tradition as the industry as part of the social fabric of the country.  This funding underpins the economic activity in what in many instances are highly rural areas.</p><p>The future of the industry is dependent on a strong governance platform and on the industry having the highest standards of integrity and welfare founded on a strong regulatory system.  There is a strong commitment to improve animal welfare in this sector under the programme for Government.  My Department, along with the sector itself, is committed to continuing to strengthen the welfare standards in the greyhound industry and future funding in the sector is contingent on welfare standards being upheld.  This is reflected in the annual parameters set out by my officials in their dealings with R&aacute;sa&iacute;ocht Con &Eacute;ireann.  Provisions of the Greyhound Racing Act 2019 came into effect on 28 May of that year and will make a real difference in this regard.  This legislation strengthens the legal basis for the industry with a view to fortifying the integrity of the greyhound racing sector and improving provision for greyhound traceability.</p> <p>The new Act improves governance of R&aacute;sa&iacute;ocht Con &Eacute;ireann, strengthens regulatory controls in the industry, modernises sanctions and improves integrity within the sector.  It provides the industry with the real tools with which it can effect fundamental change and reform.</p> <p> A key element of the new legislation is the provision for the first time of a full information technology traceability system for racing greyhounds.  The R&aacute;sa&iacute;ocht Con &Eacute;ireann traceability system came into operation on 11 January 2021 and the system provides a mechanism to ensure racing greyhounds are properly registered and traceable throughout their lives.  The sections of the Act commenced on 1 October 2020, signalling a new era for greyhound racing.  It facilitates the board in focusing on its priority objective, achieving the highest standards of care and welfare for greyhounds.</p> <p> Further commencement orders to commence the majority of the outstanding sections are currently being drafted.  The Greyhound Racing Act 2019, when fully implemented, will enable R&aacute;sa&iacute;ocht Con &Eacute;ireann to ensure the important heritage associated with greyhound racing in Ireland can continue under the appropriate rules and regulations.  The industry is predominantly rural, with a strong urban support base.  The Covid-19 crisis has, in a way similar to other sectors in the economy, resulted in a collapse in commercial activity in the sector and a significant reduction in activity generally.  Recovery for the industry will require ongoing support to aid the restoration of normal levels of activity.</p></speech>

There are, however, clear issues with how this fund is delivered.  This has been evidenced by the fact that the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine recently held numerous meetings further to allegations about animal welfare matters within the horse racing sector.  The subsequent report of the committee acknowledged that while the vast majority of those in the sector operate to the highest international standards, there are practices and structures that could undermine public confidence.</p><p>The Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund has increased considerably over the years.  The allocation in 2014 was &euro;54 million and this compares with &euro;88 million being proposed by the Minister today.  By any standards that is a huge sum and it should be matched with absolute accountability and transparency.  Put succinctly, if the D&aacute;il is to approve the expenditure of nearly &euro;90 million of taxpayers' money, we must have full confidence that the funding is having the most beneficial impact for everyone involved in the sector and the wider economy.  We must be clear that standards for animal welfare are above reproach.</p><p>Until 2009, the amount of funding was linked directly to betting taxes but the allocation is no longer calculated in such a manner.  As such, the automatic 80:20 split between the horse and greyhound sectors is increasingly bizarre.  For any sector, those seeking Government funding must outline exactly what they are planning to deliver with taxpayers' money.  This includes day-to-day costs, what would be spent on infrastructure or strategic development goals or how the success of the spending is to be measured.  With this fund, however, the Minister would have us believe the best return every year comes from an exact 80:20 division between two organisations.  Surely logic dictates there would be some variance in either direction as both organisations seek to develop their sectors at different times.</p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in's concerns regarding the efficacy of these funds are laid bare with a simple glance at the Horse Racing Ireland, HRI, allocation of prize money in any year, as there is normally only a difference of 1% or 2%.  Where does the prize money end up?  Looking at the awards over the past three years, the same small number of elite trainers are raking in the bulk of the fund.  In 2019, against an allocation of &euro;67 million, HRI had a prize fund of &euro;66 million, of which breeders only received &euro;385,000.  At the same time, the most successful horse race trainer received &euro;7,792,083, or nearly 10% of the entire fund across both horse and greyhound racing.  I do not mean any disrespect but I am not convinced that particular trainer needs any more of an incentive from the taxpayer to be involved in the sector.  At the same time, the backbone of Irish horse racing - those involved with horse and pony racing - are crying out for small amounts to merely survive.  From speaking with many breeders and others involved with the greyhound sector, I hear similar reports that they do not see the benefits of substantial State funding.</p><p>Again, Sinn F&eacute;in fundamentally agrees with providing investment to both the horse and greyhound racing but we are just not convinced that this or previous Governments have done enough to ensure the funding benefits the largest number of people across throughout the sectors and rural Ireland more broadly.  Equally, we are not convinced the Minister has adequate oversight of the fund generally.  We are certainly not convinced the Government has seen to it that safeguards are put in place not just to ensure animal welfare standards are met but that, in light of this significant investment, we are recognised as setting the global standard.  That is why we are asking the Government to accept our amendment in order that the Minister would conduct a full review of the social and economic impact of the fund, including an examination of whether the current manner of distributing the fund is most appropriate to deliver the greatest benefit to the largest number of people across those sectors and the rural communities that depend on them.  That is in addition to ensuring animal welfare standards and oversight are more than adequate.</p><p>Under the current model I fear the big lads will continue to get bigger and stronger while most of those involved with these important sectors will see little benefit from substantial taxpayer investment.  This needs to change and I hope and trust the Government will accept our amendment.</p></speech>

Today we are discussing the allocation of &euro;88 million to the fund and although this is less than the sum given last year, the amount retains a third of the unprecedented funding increase for 2021.  The fundamental question is whether the money is being administered correctly and the public is being provided with total transparency in how its money is being disbursed and used.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately, I cannot say I am convinced by the discussions I have had on the administration of the fund or how effective it is in supporting the smaller operators in these sectors.  This is not just the point of view I have garnered from engaging with the Minister, the Department and the organisations concerned; it is something that is drawn to the attention of most Deputies when the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund is due to be discussed.</p>  <p>  There is a perception that the money given through this fund does not make its way down to the small operator.  The total prize fund for 2019 was &euro;66 million or &euro;1 million less than the money allocated for the same year, when only &euro;385,000 made its way to breeders.  The impression is that the funding we are now discussing ends up in the pockets of the elite trainers rather than being spread in a more equitable manner throughout the industry.  For example, representatives of the horse and pony racing sector argue that despite this funding going to HRI, they face real financial problems.  This matter was put to the Minister at last week's agriculture committee meeting but, unfortunately, he was not prepared to give a commitment to address it.  If the funding we are discussing is not making its way down to smaller operators, is it being used effectively?  Is it being used for the benefit of the industry from start to finish?</p>  <p>  There is also the question of the 80:20 split in funding between the HRI and greyhound racing.  Despite repeated questioning on the matter, we are never told why the ratio has never changed.  It is unlikely that year-on-year the split reflects the needs of one body against the other and it is hardly as if the needs of the two sides never change.  Last year, we were asked to increase funding significantly and now we are being asked to approve funding of &euro;88 million for 2022, which is 10% higher than the sum only five years ago.  There is no explanation or justification of an increase that leaves both sectors standing at an exactly 80:20 split.</p>  <p>  There are major shortcomings in transparency.  The public must know where its money is going and what it is being used for.  It should have a full account of how worthwhile has been the contribution.</p>  <p>  Welfare matters have come to the fore in both sectors in recent times.  I am convinced the vast majority of those involved in the sectors treat their animals in line with the highest of animal welfare standards.  I regularly see the dedication that operators local to my area in Tipperary have for their animals.  There is an issue, however, with the level of transparency that the public has for the measures that HRI and Greyhound Racing Ireland, GRI, take to ensure animal welfare obligations are fulfilled and effected.</p>  <p>  At last week's agriculture committee meeting, I asked if the Department audited all the welfare commitments given by the two organisations ahead of the approval of funding, specifically the level at which they have lived up to those commitments.  In response, I was given assurances and some expenditure figures, along with some metrics, but those metrics do not measure welfare.  Telling the public that metrics suggest that everything is being done will not comfort those who have seen dreadful reports from both sectors in recent times.  We must know the real benefits, how the welfare of animals has improved and be given a full account of how this success is measured, not just a financial balancing act when new funding is on the horizon.</p> <p>I fully support the horse and greyhound sectors, and that is why my party, Sinn F&eacute;in, and I support the provision of funding to these sectors.  However, as I outlined, I have concerns about the way this fund is administered and how effective the spending of each euro is.  That is why Sinn F&eacute;in has tabled an amendment to deal with these concerns.  Our support for this Bill is contingent on the amendment being accepted and acted upon.  We ask that a full review of the Exchequer funding to the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund is conducted with a view to examining the social and economic impact of the fund.  This would include the efficacy of the fund in supporting the development of both sectors and the many people involved in them throughout our rural communities.  This review would also examine whether the use of the grant to subsidise prize funds represents the best value for money.  It would also examine the effectiveness of the fund in ensuring the highest levels of animal welfare standards.</p> <p> If the amendment is adopted, the findings of this review would be reported to the House within 6 months.  I do not believe there is anything in the amendment that anybody could take an issue with.  If anything, it seeks to benefit the two sectors by ensuring the funding is used effectively and for the benefit of the industries as a whole and the animals involved.  We all have a duty to ensure the money given to this industry, on the public's behalf, is used effectively to ensure it has the social, economic and welfare benefits that we all want.</p></speech>

It is a sport that has gone on for generations.  The vast majority of people in both these industries have contributed hugely, locally and socially, and look after their animals, be that in horse racing or greyhound racing.  I have spoken to many of them.  In the county I live in, they are on every corner.  They feel the equity of distribution of this fund needs to be looked at, particularly regarding the volume of funding that goes to small operators.  It is a real issue now.  There is one issue I ask the Minister to consider, if he would get off the phone for a moment.  I ask that he look at the equity of distribution of the fund as regards how it gets into the hands of smaller operators as opposed to big operators who, as previous speakers have said, do not need it proportionately.</p>  <p>  Animal welfare is a serious issue in both codes and we must have a zero-tolerance approach to any abuse of animals in sport, on farms or in homes.  It is unacceptable in this day and age.  On the subject of the motion, the fund provides support to two indigenous industries that provide significant employment throughout rural Ireland and give much enjoyment to people.  A GRI report showed that it supports 4,150 full-time and part-time jobs in 2019.  Last year, a total of &euro;96 million was allocated under the fund and of that &euro;76.8 million went to HRI and &euro;19.2 million to GRI.  Budget 2020 allocated &euro;88 million, which is &euro;8 million less.  A ratio is used to allocate the funding with 80%, or  &euro;70.4 million, goes to horse racing and 20%, or &euro;17.6 million, goes to greyhound racing.  Of this allocation, a minimum of 10% is to be spent on welfare; no more than 60% must be applied to prize money; no more than 3% on operational grants to private tracks; and no more than 27% on regulatory and administration costs and other statutory functions of GRI.  It is critical that the 10% ring-fenced in 2021 for welfare initiatives is maintained, and I ask that this amount be increased in the future.  Will the Minister confirm he is confident that this funding is spent in the proper way?</p>  <p>  Last year, I also raised the need for a greyhound trust to be set up.  The volume of greyhounds that need to be rehoused remains high.  There is only one centre and I have raised this issue on multiple occasions at the Committee of Public Accounts and in the Chamber.  The allocation needs to be 15% to 20% and work needs to be done on that very quickly.  People must be able to see progress so that they can see this issue is being dealt with appropriately and be in a position to support the industry as a result.  Last year, the Department also allocated record funding of &euro;3.2 million to more than 100 animal welfare charities separate to these funds.  I ask that the Minister provides clarity on what the allocation will be next year.</p>  <p>  Many proposals have been put to the Minister and the GRI by people who work with greyhounds and I hope their voices will be listened to.  It also needs to be ensured, from an industry point of view, that many of the racecourses do not end up being liquidated because of the way in which the current funding is set up.  It is perilously dangerous that this will be the case.</p>  <p>  In my remaining time, I wish to raise two other issues.  In horse racing, in particular, too many people are badly paid.  The Labour Party believes, given the legislation my colleague, Deputy Nash, has brought in and which was used again in recent days in Ireland, a sectoral employment order is needed for people working in the industry.  This is something that we will push for.  Across this major industry, those who love horses and love the sector should be respected as should their expertise, and they should be paid appropriately and consistently.  I urge the Minister to do that.</p>  <p>  It will not be strange for the Minister to hear me raise the issue of gambling addiction again.  As a country, we need to look at a ban on gambling advertising.  The proliferation of gambling advertising must be dealt with quickly.  My party colleague, Senator Mark Wall, has put forward legislation on how to deal with it.  The number of advertisements that are visible all over the place when watching sport on television is obscene and disgusting.  I sit down regularly with my daughter, who is 11 years of age, and all she sees is gambling ads morning, noon and night.  It is wrong and it needs to be dealt with quickly.</p></speech>

What I find interesting while listening to the debate is that Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party are not alone in this regard.  They are joined by Sinn F&eacute;in and the Labour Party in their support of this very concerning industry.  The Government continues year-on-year to prop the industry up.  Despite the overarching concerns of standards of care and the loss-making nature in the industry, it is impossible to understand why the Government continues to increase State funding year-on-year in this sector.</p>  <p>  Between 2001 and 2020, more than &euro;260 million of public money was given to the commercial greyhound industry.  There are sports clubs, community pitches and animal welfare organisations that could never hope to get money like that.  A previous speaker described how the greyhound industry is part of Ireland's identity and culture.  It is certainly not part of my Irish identity.  It is certainly not part of my working-class heritage and background or of anyone else who I grew up with or of anyone in my party.  The majority of people in Ireland do not want this funding continued.</p>  <p>  Let us compare the &euro;260 million funding with the &euro;1.5 million allocated in the budget for animal welfare organisations, which is double what it used to be.  That is less than 10% of the amount the greyhound industry gets.  In 2019, the Irish Guide Dogs for the Blind received &euro;886,000 from the State.  The organisation had to raise &euro;5 million itself.  Can anyone say that the public money would not have been better spent on guide and assistance dogs?  However, the Government prioritised greyhound racing instead.</p>  <p>  There is an issue with the State propping up this industry, and jobs are often used as a justification for this.  I ask the Minister and the Government to have some vision when it comes to rural Ireland and these communities and create jobs that benefit the entire community, wildlife and ecotourism.  They should not target an industry that is on its last legs and finds it very difficult to get support except from the Government.  The Government should have a vision for something productive and positive for rural Ireland rather than doing the same thing each year.  The Government is stuck in a rut in this regarding.  It continues to fund the industry because it has done so every year.  Each year, it gives a little bit extra and if it does not, some very vocal individuals will complain.  I ask the Government to have a vision for rural Ireland to make sure people can see the benefits of the &euro;260 million funding.</p>  <p>  There has been a catalogue of appalling practices in and declining public support for this industry.  The Irish Greyhound Board: Anti Doping and Medication Review, published in 2015, found that there were "longstanding and significant deficiencies in policies, processes, and ... implementation[s] that have been undermining the integrity and reputation of greyhound racing in Ireland."</p> <p>Another IGB document, prepared by Preferred Results in 2017, stated that the industry in Ireland was not focused on the sport of greyhound racing but on breeding and that it was failing from both a commercial and a regulatory point of view.  Despite this, the Minister's Government and previous Governments and oppositions continued to support it and to give the industry money.  I just cannot fathom why.  It is 2021 and this is where the Minister thinks taxpayer's money should go.  Only eight countries in the world allow greyhound racing.  The industry is closing, or near to closing, in Mexico.  It is banned in all but five states in the US and is significantly contracting in Britain, yet the Government is propping the industry up here.  The public does not want its money spent on supporting this industry.  There are a great many better ways to spend it.  State funding has enabled this financial basket case, these animal welfare issues and these overbreeding practices.  Governments have insulated the industry from commercial reality and allowed the IGB to ignore public opinion.  Without the annual injection of millions in public money, this industry would have had to rapidly reform or collapse.  Instead, money granted by successive Governments, including this one, has propped up a failed industry, an industry that continues to fail the animals it exploits.<br/><br/>I will finish with a quote because I know Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il are great for the old quotes.  Joe Biden said:</p><blockquote>	Don&rsquo;t tell me what you value.  Show me your budget, and I&rsquo;ll tell you what you value. </blockquote> <p>I will expand beyond the Government and say this to Sinn F&eacute;in and Labour as well.  What will they spend money on if they get into government?  Will they continue to fund the greyhound industry?  Will they give it more money than this Government is giving it?  They need to put that on the record and make it absolutely and blatantly clear to voters where their priorities lie.</p></speech>

On the central issue of animal cruelty, as Deputy Whitmore has pointed out, it is clear that it is not only the Government, that is, Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and, shamefully, the Green Party, that support handing over significant public moneys to the horse and greyhound racing industries, but also Sinn F&eacute;in and the Labour Party.  Since we dealt with this last year, as this motion is an annual event, we have seen the appalling spectacle of prominent racehorse trainer, Gordon Elliott, posing for a photo while sitting on top of the dead body of a horse.  This was another glimpse of the casual cruelty behind the airbrushed image of the horse racing industry.  Once again, we are going to see an enormous sum, &euro;17.6 million, being given to the greyhound industry for 2022.  Nobody can pretend not to see or not to be aware of the widespread and well-documented cruelty within greyhound racing.  It is an unavoidable element behind the industry Deputy Carthy described as a success story that should be celebrated.  It has been two years since "RT&Eacute; Investigates" exposed that the industry was breeding ten times as many puppies as it needs and that up to 6,000 dogs a year were being killed because they were not fast enough.  Greyhounds are exported to places with few, if any, animal welfare standards and there are horrific stories of dogs being mistreated and, in many cases, boiled alive.  There is a very deep cruelty involved in all of this.</p>  <p>  I will make a brief point and call in respect of hare coursing.  We need full clarity on what happened in regard to Loughrea Coursing Club, which had its licence suspended indefinitely.  When I asked for the results of any post-mortem investigation into the deaths of the hares through a parliamentary question, I did not get an answer.  We need full clarity on all of that.</p>  <p>  The basic point, which the vast majority of the public would agree on, is that we would be far better off if we were to, for example, double the funding to the Health and Safety Authority by taking funding away from the greyhound racing industry.  That is the choice the Government makes.  It decides not to fund many very worthwhile things and to instead invest in an industry that is unsustainable and based on animal cruelty.</p></speech>

I do not agree with that.  Deputy Kelly of the Labour Party says that he has a small interest in a racing greyhound.  Both Deputies have voiced their support for animal welfare but ignore the fact that animal cruelty is at the heart of the greyhound industry in this country.  If the average age of a racing dog is two and a half to three years, what happens when the dog is too old?  What happens if it is injured or if it is too slow?  "RT&Eacute; Investigates" answered those questions in its programme.  Nearly 6,000 dogs were slaughtered in 2017 alone.  This is a declining industry.  Attendance fell by 55% between 2008 and 2018.  Tracks have lost &euro;30 million since 2019.  RED C asked a cross-section of people whether they felt the State should continue to fund the industry.  Only 16% said "Yes."</p>  <p>  The industry is being kept alive by State funding and sponsorship.  There is to be &euro;17.6 million for next year and there has been &euro;310 million since the inception of the fund.  I will give the Minister a suggestion as to how that fund could be better spent.  The fund is basically the State's take from gambling on these two industries being handed back to them and amounts to an incredible &euro;1.5 billion since the inception of the fund, which says something about the scale of gambling in this country.  Rather than giving this money back to industries that thrive on gambling, why not give moneys to support people who suffer from addiction?  It is a very significant issue in this country.  Some 50,000 people are severely affected by gambling addiction while 200,000 are at risk of gambling addiction.  This would be a far better way to spend some of those moneys than to hand them back to the industries, including the greyhound industry, which has animal cruelty at its core.  It is not incidental; it is at its core.  Deputies should not be covering up for that.</p></speech>

Our racing and breeding activity is among the most prominent and respected in the world.  The core breeding and racing industry in Ireland is estimated to generate a staggering &euro;1 billion in gross expenditure.  This figure, in turn, provides an input of &euro;914 million to our economy.  In recent years, Ireland has been second only to the US as the biggest seller, by value, of bloodstock at public auctions.  We bred more than 20% of the top 100 flat horses in the world.  The industry directly supports up to 10,000 jobs while indirectly supporting many thousands more in areas such as equine science and veterinary services along with farriers, transporters, stable staff, those who work in on-course and off-course betting, those who maintain and service our racetracks and others providing a multitude of services.  The economy cannot withstand the loss or reduction of such revenue.  Now more than ever, we need to promote our assets and attractions on the world stage.  Horse racing in Ireland is a key attraction for tourists.  Our reputation in the industry means that race meetings held in Ireland are popular with both Irish and overseas visitors.  They, in turn, generate revenue for our hotels, guest houses, pubs, restaurants and local businesses.  The contribution made by horse racing to the economy, tourism and the image of Ireland can never be underestimated.</p>  <p>  In recent months, the industry was affected by a smear campaign that cut to the very heart of horse racing.  Fabricated allegations of doping ran rampant among the horse racing fraternity.  Poisonous darts were thrown at the industry with the clear intention of causing as much mayhem and damage as possible.  The fallout was felt by everyone involved in the industry.  It placed everyone in the spotlight.  People felt fingers pointing at them.  No one was named so no one was said to be guilty.  Because no one was named, everyone was seen to be guilty.  This had a devastating impact on the men and women working at all levels in the industry.  Even the most seasoned and well-known names spoke out publicly about the crushing effect of these rumours.  Everyone felt the long finger of suspicion pointing in their direction.  Everyone felt guilty until proven innocent.  It caused anguish and animosity.</p> <p>On 8 July this year, the IHRB's disciplinary committee, having carried out extensive investigations, reported that it had taken 2,500 samples, of which 72% were taken on racecourses and at point-to-point meetings.  The remaining 28% were taken as part of an-out-of-competition testing programme.  The IHRB stated the vast majority of results were negative.  In fact, of the 2,500 test samples taken this year, ten adverse analytical findings were confirmed.  Not one of these involved Horse Racing Ireland.</p> <p> Damage has been done to the industry in recent months.  I have no tolerance for rumour and innuendo.  Facts speak, but rumours cause destruction.  Suggestions leave a trail of damage that can destroy innocent people.  The Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine supports the testing system now in place, and I support that stance.  I also support its call for a review of the system to ensure Ireland&rsquo;s procedures match international best practice.  Equally, I agree with the committee&rsquo;s recommendation that the Department consider developing testing capacity in Ireland that builds national expertise in testing.  It is a welcome move by the HRI to provide funding to the IHRB for the installation of CCTV in stable yards at Irish racecourses.  Such measures form part of the agreement between those bodies to maintain the integrity of horse racing.</p> <p> The provision of funding for this endeavour is crucial in protecting the industry and it cannot be delayed.  No one is foolish enough to think high-value sports are not open to misconduct.  However, if an individual has reason to suspect, or has definitive knowledge, that rules are being broken, he or she is obliged to make such information known to the proper authorities.  Chinese whispers are not the way to deal with any situation.  Casting aspersions through the media is not a responsible way to deal with a matter that has the potential to cause widespread damage.  This form of commentary threatens the horse racing industry and threatens the reputations of sports governing bodies.  All sports are open to malpractice.  Vigilance is required at all times to ensure the field of competitive sports remains level.  Those who choose to withhold factual evidence are as guilty as those who break the rules, and they too must be held accountable.  The integrity of the sport of horse racing must be protected.</p></speech>

I seldom support what the Minister puts before us, but this proposal is welcome.  It helps to support the horse and greyhound industries.  Directly or indirectly, they account for 39,000 jobs, which is a large number.  We must secure and maintain those jobs in this country in future.  I sincerely hope these funds will make their way down the chain of those involved.  It should not be the rich and wealthy horse owners at the very top who end up getting most of this money.  It should work its way down to ordinary people, such as those I see in my community, who love their horses and race them during the year in places like Drimoleague, Durrus, Goleen, Bandon and places like that.  I would like to ensure, and perhaps the Minister might acknowledge if this is the case, that these funds will indeed make their way down to ordinary people.</p>  <p>  Most of the opposition to this measure is coming from Deputies in Solidarity-People Before Profit and the Social Democrats.  Have they ever visited those who care for their greyhounds?  I have.  I visited Collins's farm in Church Cross some time ago.  The beautiful and immaculate way in which these animals are cared for must be commended as top class.  Instead of coming in here and opposing this, if these Deputies were to go out there to see these places, they would see at first hand what a fine way these greyhounds are being treated, from their earliest years to their oldest.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister for giving this &euro;88 million.  The only regret I have is it is a reduction of &euro;8 million from last year.  We all know the cost of everything is going up.  Why do we have to come in here every year to approve this spending?  Should there not instead be a standing order that the horse racing and greyhound industries would get their money every year?  I ask that because these industries return these funds back to the coffers in abundance.  It has been said horse racing accounts for some 29,000 jobs, while the doggy people provide 12,000 and are working very hard with their dogs.  They treat them very well.  It was sad the industry got a bit of a bad name for a while because of a few rogues, but 99% of these people are genuine.  They live for their dogs and their communities and they make a serious contribution to rural Ireland.  That is the case in places like Gneevgullia, Cahersiveen, Scartaglin, Castleisland and north Kerry, and over to Knocknagashel and Brosna.  The difference this makes to the people in those areas is massive.</p></speech>

Of course, there are people who may not be right at any sector of life, but the vast majority of people who have greyhounds and dogs adore them, and if it is horses, they adore them.  Those people live for their animals and care for them and nurture them and want to protect them.  They also, of course, want to have sport with them, because that is what this is all about.</p>  <p>  When it comes to funding, however, I want money to be provided, but I also want it to be used well.  Greyhound Racing Ireland must be forced, as a condition of funding, to engage proactively with all stakeholders.  The body can no longer be allowed to alienate the very people it was established to serve, namely, those people who adore their dogs.  For too long, this organisation has operated in a silo capacity and has only been willing to engage with people who did not query its operational objectives.  This is wrong.  The greyhound industry in Ireland has the capacity to be great.  It was great, it can be great and it will be great, but the current operating model is destroying the sector and protecting the elites.  It is time for the Minister to intervene and to continue to give funding but also to ensure the same levels of transparency and openness are to be found in the greyhound sector as those that are commonplace with Horse Racing Ireland.  There must be absolute transparency and full accountability when it comes to the State funding being allocated to the horse and greyhound racing industries.</p>  <p>  It is important because we all want to see our tracks continue and ensure they continue to exist.  We want to ensure there is a future as well, however, for the really important people, namely, those people I know and meet on Friday and Saturday nights at the racetrack in Tralee, those people who come there with their vans and their trailers to take their dogs in for a race.  As I said, they do not just love their dogs, they adore their dogs.  It is wrong for those people to be at home hearing Deputies in this House saying cruelty is rampant.  It is an awful brush to cast upon a vast number of people.</p></speech>

I welcome the opportunity to speak on this issue, because when people talk about public opinion, there are more places than those around Dublin.  Public opinion comes from all around the country.  What should be known far and wide is that there are people who might be farming sheep, cattle or whatever and who also breed a horse that might turn out to be good.  We must realise what that does for those families.  They might know damn all about horses, but it encourages them.  It is the same with greyhounds.  Therefore, we need to know what public opinion on this issue really is when we talk about this matter.</p>  <p>  Our committee report has a few low-hanging fruits, and I have outlined them before.  We brought in the animal identification and movement, AIM, system for cattle, I think when the Minister, Deputy Coveney, held the agriculture portfolio, and it was probably one of the best systems that ever came in for traceability.  We should examine that type of system for accountability in the horse sector.  It is one of those initiatives that is a low-hanging fruit, because a system already exists there for us to work off.</p>  <p>  In addition, regarding those who breed horses in a small way, we must examine initiatives such as the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS, and the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, to allow us to find a way to incorporate this type of endeavour within such programmes.  Some aspects were introduced to TAMS that were intended to apply to horses, but I do not think they were ever implemented.  I ask the Minister to examine that aspect.</p> <p>Also there are youngsters with ponies.  Insurance is becoming a problem around the country.  In fairness to the Minister, he did say that he was going to look at it before.  We have to think of them.  They will start off as youngsters and move their way up along.  Some will stay at it and some will not but it is the enjoyment of it.  On the benefit of the sector and indeed the greyhound sector, look at the Galway Races.  It is one of the best known race tracks.  It is not alone the people who go to the races - some people might never even look at a horse - but the spin-off for the hotels and the money spent within the city.  It is the economy created in the different places.  It is the same thing in respect of greyhounds.  A lot of people start off and might buy one dog.  No more than in every walk of life there will be one or two people who will not do things right but 99.9% of people will do it right.  We will always get the high-profile programme that will castigate everyone or tar everyone with the one brush.</p></speech>

To be honest about it if I had as much room as an animal that goes out of this country on a boat, I would nearly be able to sleep on the broad of my back.  That is the amount of room they get.  We have to be constantly trying to go against other types of society.  It is not a big number of people who are out there but they make themselves very loud.</p>  <p>  In the greyhound sector, the one thing we need to make sure is that we have an even balance of the greyhound tracks right around the country to support rural areas.  They have come through a torrid time with the Covid and different restrictions.  It has been tough.  On the point to points, last year there was a lot of pressure on them.  These are people who breed a horse and if they win a point to point the value of their horse will be known.  For a while they were held up under the different regulations.  They did get going but I ask the Minister to make sure they are facilitated.  In the line of the report we have done, I think there is some low-hanging fruit.  I ask the Minister to look at it and take those things into account.  We in the committee did not do up a report for the sake of doing it.  We went through it meticulously and took time at it.  We had many a conversation about it in private meetings.  There is good stuff in it that the Minister should implement.</p></speech>

To summarise, in order to allow my Department to provide the monies allocated in budget 2022, it is necessary to comply with the technical requirement under section 12(13) of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001 to increase the cumulative limit to &euro;1.54 billion to accommodate the extra &euro;88 million we are allocating this year.  One of the overarching objectives of the Government is to ensure that the horse and greyhound racing industries achieve their maximum potential and in so doing contribute to economic and social development across the country.  That is very much reflected in our programme for Government commitments as well.  The Government strongly supports these sports and the industries surrounding them and has underpinned them through legislation and policy initiatives over a long period.</p>  <p>  The horse and greyhound racing industries have a wide geographic spread and make a valuable contribution to a balanced regional economy.  The welfare of horses and greyhounds is a cornerstone of both industries and I am assured that HRI and RC&Eacute; are striving to ensure the highest standards with both industries making substantial investment in integrity and welfare initiatives.  The horse and greyhound racing fund has played a key role in providing this investment and has been instrumental in shaping the destiny of these industries.</p>  <p>  Brexit and Covid-19 present unique and substantial threats to the Irish economy as we have discussed.  We are a small economy naturally prone to volatility.  It is therefore crucial that we support these industries given the challenges of both Brexit and Covid-19.  Supporting both of them will protect the jobs and the economic benefit derived by individuals involved in the two sports.  That is really important.  These jobs and the associated economic benefit support thousands across our country.</p>  <p>  In conclusion, this funding has been pivotal in shaping the destiny of both the thoroughbred and greyhound racing industries.  The funding this year is particularly important.  The Irish equine breeding and racing industry is very competitive at a global level and is a beacon for excellence.  We are the third highest producer of thoroughbred foals in the world.  This a success story that has been many years and generations in the making.  It is particularly important that we continue it for that reason.  The greyhound industry is predominantly a rural industry with a very strong urban support base and is important in our economy as well. </p>  <p>  I do not propose to accept any of the amendments that have been tabled.  I feel the proposals we are bringing forward and the terms and conditions we have attached in respect of expectation as to how the funding is allocated are appropriate.  I ask for the support of the House in ensuring that this funding is delivered for 2022 to both R&aacute;sa&iacute;ocht Con &Eacute;ireann and HRI.</p></speech>

I welcome this opportunity.  Let me start by recalling that the Middle East peace process is a key priority for Ireland including during our tenure on the Security Council.  There have been a number of recent developments on the ground that make this discussion very timely.  I wish to underline my serious concern, which I know many Deputies share, regarding the designation by Israel's Ministry of Defence of six Palestinian NGOs as terrorist entities on 22 October last.  This includes organisations in receipt of support of Irish Aid and EU money.  We were not informed in advance of these designations, nor have we received substantial evidence to support them.  I made a statement on this matter on 27 October and raised the issue directly in my meetings in Israel during my recent visit to the region on 1-5 November.</p>  <p>  We are working closely with our EU partners on the issue and EU officials have met with Israeli authorities to seek further clarification.  Ireland took part in the discussion at the Security Council on 8 November on the designations as well as on the recent settlement announcements.  In a joint statement afterwards we, alongside France, Estonia, Norway and Albania, underlined our serious concern at the designation and the potential political, legal and financial consequences.  Terrorism is of course a very serious issue that needs an unambiguous response but it must be addressed on the basis of evidence to back up decisions also.  However, these designations have the potential to impact not only six organisations but civil society more broadly and to undermine legitimate humanitarian and human rights work seriously in the Occupied Territories.</p>  <p>  Ireland has consistently and strongly opposed illegal settlement activity.</p> <p>We do so on the basis of international law and the resolutions of the UN Security Council, including Resolution 2334, which states settlements are illegal under international law and constitute a major obstacle to the achievement of a two-state solution.</p> <p> On 28 October Ireland released a joint statement with 11 other European countries urging the Israeli Government to reverse its decision on more than 3,000 additional settlement units in the West Bank and reiterated its strong opposition to Israel&rsquo;s policy of settlement expansion.  In May this House declared the extent and scope of settlement expansion in the West Bank and its intended permanency amounted to de facto annexation.  It reflected our collective concern about the intent of Israeli actions and their impact on Palestinians.  Ireland has addressed this issue at the Security Council and will do so again at its monthly meeting on the situation in the Middle East today.</p> <p> My visit to Israel, Palestine and Jordan at the start of this month was an important opportunity to meet the new Israeli coalition Government, the Palestinian Authority leadership and civil society.  During my visit to Israel, I had useful and constructive exchanges on a range of issues, including the situation in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory, antisemitism, the response to Covid-19, and the situation in the wider Middle East region.  I met President Isaac Herzog, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Lapid, and the Minister for Health, Mr. Horowitz.  I restated Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to constructive engagement on the Middle East peace process.  I welcomed the outreach by members of the new Israeli Government to their Palestinian counterparts.  We know from our own peace process the importance of building these relationships and rebuilding trust between all parties.</p> <p> On Israel&rsquo;s policies on Palestine, I was very clear in my engagement with the Israelis that settlement expansion needs to stop.  I heard in detail, from the Palestinian Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister, about the increased impact of settlements on communities and the contiguity of Palestinian territory in a future state.  I visited communities in the West Bank, where I saw at first hand the impact of the expansion of illegal Israeli settlements on local Palestinian populations.  It is not just a matter of the settlement units themselves but also of the associated infrastructure projects in area C designed to meet the needs of ever-increasing settlements, which entrench division and inequality.  These projects erode political trust in addition to degrading adjacent Palestinian agricultural land and affecting negatively the availability of already scarce water resources.</p> <p> Separately, in my meetings with Palestinian Prime Minister Shtayyeh and Deputy Prime Minister Abu Amr, I emphasised the need for democratic renewal in Palestine, particularly in light of the postponement of the May elections.  I also underlined the importance of the Palestinian Authority assuming its responsibilities with regard to the rule of law, the freedom of expression and civil society engagement.  These issues, and the Middle East peace process more generally, continue to be a significant priority for me as Minister for Foreign Affairs.  I regularly discuss Ireland&rsquo;s position on outreach with key officeholders in the EU and UN, including the UN Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process, Mr. Tor Wennesland, whom I met in Jerusalem during my visit, and the EU Special Representative for the Middle East Peace Process, Mr. Sven Koopmans.</p> <p> Progress requires dialogue, and ultimately there can be no substitute for direct negotiations between the two parties.  I remain committed to taking all appropriate actions to assist in resolving this conflict and ensuring equitable treatment for both peoples.  I hope I will get cross-party support in those efforts.  Ireland is most impactful when it remains credible, persuasive and consistent as an international actor in using its influence, whether it be in the EU or at the UN.  We have a unique opportunity for the next 12 months as Ireland continues to be a member of the UN Security Council.  I hope I will be able to use that position to generate new momentum and positivity in the context of the Middle East peace process next year.</p></speech>

It is important we recognise the sumud &mdash; the steadfastness &mdash; of the Palestinian people in the face of ongoing, grinding occupation.  In our debate on the cross-party motion on de facto annexation earlier in the year, we spoke with a clear voice about the breaches of international law perpetrated by the Government of Israel.  We also spoke about the settlement building, the land it takes and the de facto annexation it represents.  Settlement building does not happen in a vacuum.  It is closely linked to land confiscations, housing demolition, checkpoints, permits, the infringement of freedom of movement, the impact on children&rsquo;s access to education, and harassment and violence by the military and police.  These are the daily experiences of the Palestinian people living under occupation.</p>  <p>  If we examine the treatment of the Palestinians in East Jerusalem in particular, we see more than de facto annexation alone.  In the words of our motion, we agreed that &ldquo;Israel has altered and purports to alter the character and status of Jerusalem&rdquo;.  What we are seeing is the Israeli Government deliberately inflicting on the Palestinian people policies and conditions of life calculated to destroy their presence in their community in East Jerusalem.  This is also happening across the West Bank.  We note land confiscations, the declaration of military zones, and house demolition, all amounting to a forced population transfer.  Calling this behaviour out and naming it for what it is is an essential task for all of us in this House.  We need to do more than that, however.  We need to respond to this behaviour.</p>  <p>  Given that yesterday was the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People, I want to use the little bit of time I have remaining to talk about some of the international actions we should be taking.  The Minister has spoken about our unique opportunity at the UN Security Council.  We should be using that as much as we can.  Within the EU, we saw Belgium take strong action in recent days on differentiation and the labelling of settlement goods.  We could consider this in our country.  We have worked on it before but we could ask whether we are doing enough.  Equally, we could be supporting other member states that share our thinking on the conflict to do more.</p>  <p>  We agreed on a motion on annexation in the House.  It would be great if we could encourage other member states to do the same and, as the programme for Government states, consider an appropriate response to annexation at both national and international levels.  Ultimately, however, the rule of international law means nothing without meaningful enforcement.  We must ensure we protect and support the work of the International Criminal Court.  It has begun its own investigations into war crimes in the region and must be allowed to continue to do this work fairly, impartially and without any single state or group of states seeking to interfere with it or undermine it.  If we want to establish international law that is meaningful, it is essential this happens.</p></speech>

These NGOs are among the most prominent human rights organisations in the occupied territories.  They have a proven record of competence, credibility and professionalism.  Consistently and courageously, they have vocally acted in defence of the Palestinian people and human rights.  They brought Israeli repression, colonial expansion and apartheid policies under the spotlight for a global audience.</p>  <p>  The groups Al-Haq and Addameer have been responsible for providing the International Criminal Court with information that is central to the investigation into possible war crimes committed by Israel within occupied Palestinian territory.  Both receive financial assistance from the Irish taxpayer through Irish Aid.  Both organisations also receive funding from the EU and other international organisations.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, previously outlined the depth of the oversight his Department maintains on organisations funded through Irish Aid.</p> <p>There are strict controls governing the spending of funds coupled with independent evaluations and auditing.</p> <p> I welcome the Minister's comments in the aftermath of the designation.  He stated that Ireland would continue to support these organisations as the Israeli authorities have failed to provide any proof that supports the designation of the NGOs as terrorist entities.  The French media outlet Mediapart published the evidence proffered by Israel and, along with all other objective observers of the evidence, concluded that the Israeli authorities have no real evidence against the NGOs.  All of these groups - Al-Haq, Defense for Children International - Palestine, Addameer Prisoner Support and Human Rights Association, the Union of Agricultural Work Committees, the Union of Palestinian Women's Committees and Bisan Center for Research and Development - play a critical role in promoting international law, human rights and democratic values in the occupied Palestinian territory.  The decision to designate the groups as terrorist entities is an attempt by the Israeli Government to incapacitate the NGOs in order to silence their work in bringing global attention to the human rights abuses, the colonial expansion of settlements and the apartheid policies of Israel which have carved the Palestinian territory up into a series of Bantustans.  John Dugard, a South African legal scholar and former UN rapporteur, has stated, "Even the apartheid regime in South Africa never outlawed human rights defenders in the manner that Israel just did when it declared six Palestinian organisations to be 'terrorist organisations'."  Israel means to smear, to persecute and to delegitimise these groups in front of a global audience to create an international chilling effect that would end the funding of these NGOs by countries such as Ireland and institutions such as the EU.</p> <p> Earlier this month we learnt that an Israeli security company with close affiliations to the Israeli Government and security apparatuses had installed spyware onto the personal phones of staff members of Palestinian human rights organisations to monitor their communications and their locations.  Ireland must make clear that we as a society and as a people who have worn the yoke of colonial oppression are prepared to stand in solidarity with any legitimate organisation committed to democratic and human rights principles.  Although it has been over a month since the designation of the groups occurred, the EU has yet to state clearly that it rejects the Israeli designation, nor has it called on Israel to revoke its decision or in any way made clear that it will continue to fund the NGOs.  It is critical that the Irish Government gives a commitment not only that the funding to these groups will continue but also that it will do everything possible to guarantee their safety.  We must demand that Israel rescind immediately its designation and guarantee the safety and welfare of all the six organisations and the people who work for them.</p></speech>

In any democracy the role of NGOs in holding the government to account is absolutely critical.  All of the six civil society organisations and non-governmental organisations that have been designated as terrorist are internationally respected and endorsed.  I have been at numerous international meetings of parliamentarians over recent weeks at which I have listened to testimonies on the importance of their work.  You get to the point where you wonder what it will take for the European Union and the international community to stand up and defend these rights.  We have the reports from B'Tselem and Human Rights Watch, and I understand there are other reports designating the regime from the Mediterranean Sea to the Jordan river as an apartheid regime.  However, because the Government here does not confront it or deal with it as we did with the South African apartheid regime, it continues to act with impunity.  I am therefore not the least bit surprised that it has taken this action because it is never held to account in the international community.  It will pay no price for these actions.</p>  <p>  What is the impact of this?  These organisations' offices can be closed down, staff arrested and potentially jailed and equipment confiscated.  These are internationally respected human rights defenders supported by this State and civil society organisations in this State, so this is an important opportunity to unite together in saying this House condemns the Israeli state and demands that it reverse this decision.</p></speech>

There has been and continues to be much abuse by Israel on the Palestinian people.  Among those abuses, which the Minister probably saw at first hand when he was over there on his recent visit, are the illegal settlements that no one can stop, the blockade of Gaza that no one can stop, apartheid Israel's systematic violation of children's rights, the shooting dead of countless children and the illegal administrative detention process.  Hisham Abu Hawash has been jailed without charge since October 2020.  He has been on hunger strike for 104 days.  Nidal Ballout is 27 years of age and has been on hunger strike for 31 days.  He is also being held under administrative detention.  It is important that the Irish Government and the EU intervene on behalf of these individuals.</p>  <p>  I wish to ask a question specifically about the designation by apartheid Israel of the six Palestinian advocacy groups as terror groups.  My understanding is that the six organisations have now been listed on the National Bureau for Counter Terror Financing of Israel.  This shows that Israel is starting to act on the designation orders.  Also, the Israeli military commander communicated to the organisations two days ago, on 28 November, that they must cease work during the appeal process.  This means that the work and funding of the organisations are under direct and immediate threat.  What is Ireland doing, along with the other EU states, to pressure Israel and the Defense Minister of Israel to rescind the designation?</p>  <p>  Welcome back, a Cheann Comhairle.  It is good to see you in good health.</p></speech>

There are very few issues that unite most if not all in this House, but this is one of them.  I do not doubt the bona fides of the Minister, Deputy Coveney, on this issue but I wish in the few minutes I have to deal with three specific issues.</p>  <p>  First, I add my voice to the issue that is now current and immediate, that is, Israel's designation of six Palestinian NGOs as terrorist organisations.  That is a clear and absolute assault on democratic norms of accountability and human rights monitoring.  No democratic nation, no nation that presents itself to be fully democratic, can be allowed simply to extinguish human rights bodies from existing within its territory.  The impact of this is immediate.  There is an immediate concern for all the people who have worked, sometimes for decades, in advocating human rights and monitoring what is going on on the ground in Israel and in the occupied territories that they will be subject to arrest if they enter their own premises or access their own funding.  The whole idea is to stop them functioning as human rights organisations.  Even totalitarian regimes have not resorted to this.</p> <p>The idea is that if you extinguish the eyes of the people of the world, somehow, what is going on in Israel and the occupied territories will not be noticed.  It really is a brazen act that we need to respond to.</p> <p> The second point I wish to make relates to the ongoing occupation and annexation of Palestinian land.  We must make it clear to the state of Israel that it has abandoned the two-state solution.  I listened to the Minister's words very carefully.  It has abandoned the two-state solution.  There can be no two-state solution if the viability of the state of Palestine is eroded through occupation and eviction.  It seems to be the settled policy of successive governments of Israel to simply extinguish the possibility of what we have all hoped for, namely, the creation of two separate states, one for the people of Israel and one for the people of Palestine, both viable, with issues like control of the city of Jerusalem to be determined as the capital of both.  The Minister's statement is most welcome, but it charts, still, a course that is being demonstrably undermined as we speak, day in, day out, by the official actions of the Government of Israel.</p> <p> The final point I wish to make concerns what we must do now.  We need to stop coming in here and having endless statements.  We have to do something.  I am taken by the actions of the Belgian Government, which has set out a formula for dealing with bilateral agreements with Israel.  Further treaties between Belgium and Israel will contain a territorial clause stipulating that they must not apply to territories brought under Israeli control since 1967.  On customs, trade and databases, we must apply in very strict terms our policy in relation to the illegality of the occupation of Palestinian territories not only in recent days, but over recent decades.  I hope that the Minister might come to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence with a strategy setting out what specifically Ireland is going to do.  Hopefully, Ireland will lead both in its position as a member of the UN Security Council and also as an influential and important member of the EU Council.  </p> <p> There are obviously dissenting voices in the EU Council in relation to Israel; we know that.  However, the moral case to be presented is persuasive.  It falls to countries like Ireland to make that moral case before the court of European public opinion and before the international public opinion of the UN, so that we can, before it is too late, stop the disintegration of the possibility of a long-term peaceful two-state solution.  </p></speech>

I strongly condemn the scenes of violence being inflicted on Palestinian people in their own territories.  Settler violence is the inevitable outcome of occupation.  There has never been a time in human history when the illegal occupation or annexation of one territory by another has been accepted.  A state should not use violence as a means of enforcing its will.  This week, once again, we watched that violence being inflicted on Palestinian people in their own territory.  This week, once again, we lamented and expressed solidarity and support, but still, we are not going to take action to match those words.</p>  <p>  I wish to speak once again about the Control of Economic Activity (Occupied Territories) Bill 2018.  It is an issue that I know my party and Fine Gael disagree on.  The Control of Economic Activity (Occupied Territories) Bill was agreed across this Chamber.  The Minister's partners in government, Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party, supported it.  It was in Fianna F&aacute;il's programme for government, as it was in the programme of government of the Green Party.  People in the Chamber held up the Bill as the means by which Ireland would say that no more would we accept what we came to call annexation.  The Bill is means of demonstrating that if we watch the scenes that are happening in occupied territories, we will not make ourselves complicit by saying that we strongly condemn them, but yet continue to do business as usual.  For me, the Control of Economic Activity (Occupied Territories) Bill is the means by which we can send out the strongest message that we will not be complicit in this violence and we will take a stand.</p>  <p>  The Control of Economic Activity (Occupied Territories) Bill is one that I believe the Minister feels breaches EU law, despite the fact that numerous legal experts across the EU have held that this is not the case.  To demonstrate real solidarity and take action showing leadership throughout the world, the Minister should bring the Control of Economic Activity (Occupied Territories) Bill back to this Chamber, or at least outline to us the legal advice and opinion by which he has decided that the Bill breaches EU law, and publish that advice.</p>  <p>  There is another issue I wish to raise.  The derogation of the six NGOs has already been discussed.  Two of those NGOs received funding from the Irish Government.  They have now been labelled as terrorist organisations.  I imagine that we strongly disagree with that.  We should take action to demonstrate our disagreement.  I am very conscious that those six organisations, including the two that received funding from the Irish Government, are now under considerable threat of violence, as they work in Israel and Palestine at the minute, at the hands of vigilante groups.  The cost of running these NGOs is going to increase dramatically.  The Minister has a strong track record of supporting NGOs and being compassionate.  I think we should put our money where our mouth is and increase funding to those NGOs to which we have already given funding, to support the increase in funding they are going to need for security and the increase in the cost of doing business.  We must demonstrate solidarity with them.  That could be an action we could take to show that we do not accept the designation of these NGOs as terrorist organisations and that we will take appropriate action to demonstrate that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-11-30a.345" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1478" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="18:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021113000031#EE00300"><p>First, I wish to welcome the fact that we are discussing the situation on Palestine the day after the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People.  I commend D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, which voted to fly the Palestinian flag yesterday, following a motion proposed by Councillors Hugh Lewis and Melisa Halpin.  I believe Galway City Council also flew the flag, as Dublin City Council has done before.  That speaks to the enormous solidarity that exists in this country, historically, for the plight of the Palestinian people.  There is a recognition of the persecution the Palestinian people have suffered - the oppression, the denial of rights, the displacement from their land, the status as exiles of millions of Palestinians, the cruel injustice, the colonialism and the apartheid laws that are so similar to the Irish Penal Laws that were imposed on the Catholic population here.  We understand the plight of Palestine in a way few others can fully empathise with because it mirrors so closely our own history under colonial rule.  In that context and on the day after the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People, we have to say, and I do not mind admitting, that the Irish Government is better than most governments, at least in terms of the statements it makes about the mistreatment of the Palestinian people.  However, the problem is that nothing ever changes.</p>  <p>  I got involved in politics because of Palestine.  I spent a year living there in 1987, the year of the first intifada.  I was shocked to my core to see the endemic racism in the treatment of Palestinians by the Israelis.  Israeli farmers on the farm I worked in regularly used to say things like the only good Arab is a dead Arab.  That is how bad it was; it was absolutely rampant.  Young Palestinians who I worked with, and who travelled for hours from refugee camps in Hebron, brought me to their refugee camp as the first intifada began in 1987.  They showed me the caves where their families lived for two years after they had been forced by Israeli terror gangs out of their homes in 1947 and 1948, the year of the Nakba, when they had to live in caves until the UN came along and built refugee camps.  They, their parents and grandparents have lived in those refugee camps ever since.  It just goes on and nothing changes.  </p>  <p>  Six peaceful NGOs have been designated as terrorist organisations because the Israelis can just get away with it and nobody does anything about it.  A nation state law was introduced a while ago which gives only the Jewish people the right to self-determination, which is an international right that people have and Palestinians have.  </p> <p>A siege of Gaza has been going on for years with the most inhumane conditions imposed on men, women and children in defiance of international law, yet nothing is done.  Nothing has been done.  Day in and day out there is administrative detention of Palestinian people and for their youth there is internment without trial.  It goes on and nothing is done.</p> <p> It is 25 years since the Oslo Accords and from day one Israel was breaching that agreement with further annexation of Palestinian territory, which was the little bit of Palestinian territory that was left under that absolutely miserable and humiliating deal.  They could not even respect that deal.  They go on with ethnic cleansing and in Jerusalem seizing territory and annexing territory and the world does nothing.  Before that they occupied the West Bank and Gaza in 1967 and of course the horrible crime of the Nakba itself.  Has anybody ever been to the Palestinian refugee camps in Beirut?  They are absolutely shocking.  Three and four generations of Palestinians are living in the most disgusting and appalling conditions.  Nothing is done.  Even though under international law they have the right to return, nothing is done.  We continue to entertain the nonsense that the State of Israel that does this is a normal state, which we should talk of as if it behaves in any kind of normal way when it clearly does not.</p> <p> I ask the question honestly of the Minister: when are we going to do something?  When do those crimes, which have been ongoing for decades and generations day in day out and ever getting worse, finally prompt action by the European Union to end the favoured trade status that Israel has, or to impose some kind of sanctions?  Instead, we just get words.  There is no action and the suffering of the Palestinians continues.  I ask honestly of the Minister if there is ever going to be action to stem the tide of injustice, brutality and oppression the Palestinian people have to suffer.</p></speech>

The situation in the occupied Palestinian territory is incredibly concerning as we hear of increased levels of disposition, violence and insecurity.  The designation of six Palestinian civil society organisations as terrorist by the Israeli defence minister is especially concerning.</p><p>Palestinian property has been confiscated and Palestinian families are forcibly displaced.  This has been particularly difficult for families in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic, especially given the large-scale demolition of health facilities that occurred there during the pandemic, so much so that only 22% of health facilities in Gaza now remain open.  At the same time we have heard reports of Israel selling its surplus vaccinations overseas while, as of August, a mere 16% of eligible Palestinians have been vaccinated.  This is absolutely disgraceful.  Ireland needs to step up to stand against this inequality and this apartheid state.</p><p>I would like to take this opportunity to speak on the substantial impact of the pandemic on Palestinian women and girls.  The pandemic has exacerbated domestic violence, sexual abuse and forced marriage in the region, with an appalling 70% rise in calls received reporting gender-based violence.  There are currently 34 Palestinian women in Israeli prisons.  We must condemn violence against women in the strongest way possible and we must be a voice for the voiceless.  We need to ensure that our trade does not legitimise the continued breach of international law and violations of human rights by Israel.  I call on this Government immediately to stop blocking the Control of Economic Activity (Occupied Territories) Bill, introduced by Senator Frances Black and the Civil Engagement Group in 2018.</p><p>The Irish people share a strong and unique bond with the people of Palestine due to our shared history of struggle and oppression.  We saw this when we voted unanimously to condemn Israel&rsquo;s <i>de facto</i>annexation of Palestinian land in the occupied territories.  We saw this when thousands attended rallies across the country in solidarity with Palestine and we have seen it in the calls from the Irish people to boycott Israeli goods and to expel the Israeli ambassador.  By ignoring these calls, by not recognising the state of Palestine, despite the already passed motion, and by blocking the occupied territories Bill this Government is not representing us.  They are not representing the Irish people.  Palestinians are quite literally living in an open-air prison and we will continue to speak out until Palestine is free.</p></speech>

There is a lot I would like to say about the occupied territories but I will confine myself to the six human rights organisations that have been designated as terrorist organisations.  From my calculations it has been six weeks since then and other than expressing concern we have done little else.  While I have never doubted the Minister's bona fides, we have done little else in six weeks.  The latest step has been the military commander clarifying to the organisations that if they wish to appeal then they must stop immediately functioning as human rights organisations.  It is time that we did something more than concern.</p><p>Of course, this did not happen overnight.  It has happened because the Israeli Government got away with a succession of acts that they never should have been allowed to get away with.  If we look at the culmination of the year in relation to the proceedings before the International Criminal Court, there was a number of different issues during that year.  We will start with February 2021 and where a pretrial chamber ruled on the jurisdiction, which obviously did not please the Israeli Government.  I make a distinction always between the Israeli Government and the Jewish people.  Then, in October 2021 we learned that the new prosecutor and his office confirmed that it was taking up the fight again and the investigation would be mobilised.  Then we got the designation and this extra step from the military commander.  Prior to that, phones were infiltrated and a surveillance operation was mounted.</p><p>We can go back.  We could take any number of years but in the interest of brevity I will just mention that in 2016 the Israeli Parliament adopted the NGO disclosure law to force Israeli NGOs to disclose funding sources, which had a chilling effect on donations.  In 2017 Israel enacted an amendment to the Citizenship and Entry into Israel Law barring those human rights workers who advocate for Palestinians from entering.  In 2018 the Israeli Ministry of Strategic Affairs called on the EU to cease donating to or funding human rights organisations.  I could go on but I will not because my time is limited.</p><p>There is any amount of concern and condemnation expressed by different groups but I would like to zone in on the Israeli organisations.  The Israeli newspaper <i>Haaretz</i>has called the decision to designate the six organisations &quot;a stain upon Israel&quot;.  It said: &quot;The outlawing of human rights groups and persecution of humanitarian activists are quintessential characteristics of military regimes, in which democracy in its deepest sense is a dead letter.&quot;  A joint statement against the designation has been issued by 21 human rights groups calling the designation &quot;a draconian measure&quot;.</p><p>I am over my time now.  As I am always giving out about speaking time I will stop on time.  I put it to the Minister that it is time to take action as opposed to continuing to express concern.</p></speech>

I also wish to recognise that yesterday was the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People.  They would have got a very strong signal from Ireland with Irish people's continuing concern for their struggle.</p>  <p>  I will address a number of the issues that have been raised.  I have been very vocal on the issue of the six Palestinian NGOs, at home nationally and at EU level.  I have raised the issue very directly with the Israeli Government.  While I was in Ramallah with senior officials we met with Al-Haq and with Addameer, the two NGOs of the six organisations, which Ireland financially supports.  It is modest financial support but it is support nonetheless.  We will continue to talk with both of those NGOs about how we can continue to support their work, which is obviously not easy in the context of the current conditions in which they are being asked to operate.  I have also been very vocal in the international media on this issue.  I have called out the antidemocratic nature of what has happened.  NGOs and civil society are there to represent minorities that often have real vulnerabilities with regard to where they live, how they operate and the conditions under which they operate.  Any democracy needs to facilitate a role for civil society and NGOs, often asking hard questions of governments.  That is exactly what they are supposed to be doing: creating an uncomfortable space at times, asking hard questions and testing the legality of government policy.  From my experience, that is what Al-Haq and Addameer have been doing.  Addameer is supporting prisoners and Al-Haq is taking legal cases and is involved in international advocacy.</p> <p>It is something I will continue to raise with Israel and at UN and EU level.  It is something that they need to think again about and it reflects very poorly on the new Israeli Government in the context of this decision.  </p> <p> People keep calling on me to take action.  I am not quite sure what they mean by that.  I do not believe that by bringing forward the occupied territories) Bill that we will necessarily increase pressure on the Israeli Government, but we could certainly undermine Ireland&rsquo;s influence both at UN and EU level in what we are trying to do, particularly during our term on the UN Security Council.</p> <p> Even if we wanted to do that, it is not any coincidence that when a party moves from opposition to Government and actually listens to what the Attorney General has to say on these issues, that its position changes somewhat.  We cannot bring the occupied territories Bill forward on the advice of two consecutive Attorneys General because it is effectively about trade policy, which is not a national competence.  </p> <p> I take the point and I do not want to get in to a tit-for-tat argument.  The contributions this evening have been about asking me to focus on what we can do beyond simply condemnation and words.  I take that on board in the context of settlements, settlement expansion, forced evictions, demolitions and settler violence that goes at times without consequence by way of impunity and lack of policing.  I have met and seen the communities myself across the West Bank who have been impacted by all of that.  I have been five times to the West Bank in less than five years, as Minister for Foreign Affairs.  </p> <p> This will continue to be a priority and a focus for us.  We are all about trying to find a way to take action to change the direction of the Middle East peace process, which has been going in the wrong direction for too many years.  We want, however, to use our influence to do that internationally.  Ireland acting alone will not change the course of history in the Middle East but Ireland acting with other partners within the EU and in the UN can do that, acting as a small but, I hope, persuasive partner and voice in an international political environment that can change the direction of travel that we have unfortunately seen in recent years.  </p> <p> This is a new Israeli Government.  We should try to build a relationship with it and this is what I intend to do.  The current Palestinian Authority leadership also needs both Irish solidarity, financial support and political support internationally to re-establish legitimacy, to find a way of holding elections and, of course, to advance reconciliation, which is of great importance for a future Palestinian state.  We will work on all of those issues, both with the Israeli Government and indeed with Palestinian authorities in an effort, as many people have asked for, to take action to try to bring about a peace process again that can deliver a dividend I believe we are all after.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-11-30a.352" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="18:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021113000033#GG00300"><p>I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>  <p>  The Houses of the Oireachtas Commission came into existence on 1 January 2004 under the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission Act 2003.  This founding commission legislation then led, in summary, to two consequences; one, that the commission became the sanctioning authority for expenditure and for deciding on staff numbers up to the grade of principal officer and the provision of services and related matters to the Oireachtas; and, two, that the system for the allocation of budgets to the Oireachtas changed from the annual Civil Service Estimates and Vote procedure to a different process involving a three-year budget from the central fund.</p>  <p>  The new budget is set every three years following negotiations between my Department and the commission.  The budget is approved at political level by the commission and the amending legislation is then passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.    Under the terms of the inaugural commission Act, a three-year budget covering the period 2004 to 2006 was provided for the commission.  Further Acts were enacted in 2006, 2009, 2012, 2015 and in 2018.  A new Oireachtas commission Act is now required as a matter of priority as the financing provided under the 2018 Act expires as of 31 December coming.  </p>  <p>  As all of the Members will be aware, the commission oversees the provision of services to the Houses and their Members by the Houses of the Oireachtas Service, the parliamentary administration, in accordance with the commission Acts.  The primary functions of the commission are to provide for the running of the Houses of the Oireachtas, to act as governing body of the service, to consider and determine policy on this service and to oversee the implementation of that policy by the Secretary General. </p>  <p>  The commission is not responsible for the management and day-to-day operations of the Houses.  The Secretary General has overall responsibility for these functions in accordance with the commission Acts.  It is important to note that the commission does not set the level of remuneration payable to Deputies and Senators.  Responsibility for salaries, pensions and allowances for Members is conferred on me in my role as the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. </p>  <p>  The commission is accountable to the Parliament and presents annual reports of its work to both Houses, together with estimates and accounts of its expenditure. </p>  <p>  I would like to acknowledge at this point the hugely valuable role played by secretarial, parliamentary and administrative assistants, in supporting Members and delivering a high -quality service to the Oireachtas.   As a Member of this House for more than 14 years, I am acutely conscious of the extraordinary work that all of our staff do, day in and day out. </p>  <p>  The scheme for secretarial assistance is the mechanism under which secretarial assistants and others are engaged.  Under the scheme, the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission has the power to regulate the provision of secretarial facilities to Members and to qualifying parties.  Secretarial assistants, administrative assistants, parliamentary assistants, administrators and chefs de cabinet are employed by Members and by qualifying parties but are paid by the commission.  The commission also regulates the number of staff employed under the scheme and has oversight of the operation of the scheme.  Under the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission Act 2003, the commission must obtain the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform of the day before reaching an agreement with any person on rates of pay, conditions of employment or superannuation rights. </p>  <p>  In practice, this means that the commission advises on matters relating to resourcing, grading and terms and conditions of employment, and submits proposals to myself for consideration and agreement.  In that regard, I am aware that there is a process under way at the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, dealing with various issues, including alignment with the current public service pay agreement: Building Momentum - A New Public Service Agreement 2021-2022, between the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission and SIPTU.  I look forward to a successful resolution of the matter and an early presentation of proposals for my agreement. </p>  <p>  The Houses of the Oireachtas Service is the public service body that administers the Houses of the Oireachtas on behalf of the commission as the governing authority.  The functions of the service are set out in legislation and can be broadly summarised as the provision of professional advice and support services to the commission, the Houses and their committees, and Members of the Houses.</p>  <p>  To serve the people of our country, we need a modern, fit-for-purpose, well-resourced parliamentary system and I believe the allocation over the next three years provided </p>  <p>for in this legislation supports that aim.  The sole purpose of this Bill is to make available the funding for the commission over the coming three years.  The Bill proposes to make available to the commission a sum not  exceeding &euro;462.505 million to carry out its functions for the three-year period from 1 January 2022 to 31 December 2024.  This sum has been agreed between the commission and my own Department and takes into account foreseen expenditure over the three-year period.  The figure of &euro;462.505 million over three years comprises &euro;160.7 million in 2022, &euro;150.8 million in 2023 and &euro;151 million in 2024.</p> <p>This represents a &euro;40.2 million, or 9.5%, increase on the allocation for 2019 to 2021.  Within the overall envelope of &euro;462.5 million, it should be noted that pay and pensions comprise &euro;323.4 million, or 70%, of the overall budget allocation.  Members' allowances total &euro;37.9 million, or 8%, of the overall budget allocation, while non-pay expenditure amounts to &euro;101.3 million, or 22%. </p> <p> Ireland has a very proud parliamentary tradition and a large portion of the extra funding that has been provided is for an ongoing programme of parliamentary reform, which I fully support.  Chief among these reforms is an enhanced role for the Parliamentary Budget Office, PBO.  Building on initiatives in other countries, such as the Congressional Budget Office in the United States, the PBO was put in place to provide independent and impartial budgetary and economic analysis for all parliamentarians in the Oireachtas.  Further Oireachtas reforms include the development of the Private Members' Bills policy unit with the Office of Parliamentary Legal Advisers, OPLA.  Based on my own experience, I acknowledge the crucial role that office plays in supporting the work of Members of the Oireachtas.  Without such an office, it is hard to see how the Oireachtas would function on a day-to-day basis.  OPLA's main objective is to provide independent legal advice to members of the Oireachtas and Oireachtas committees.  It also assists Members with research, development of policy proposals, drafting of Bills and amendments and pre-Committee Stage scrutiny.  Extra funding is also being provided to cater for the larger number of Oireachtas committees and the associated staffing requirements that follow.  Committees provide a critical avenue for scrutiny of Government and Government policy and it is altogether right and proper that they should be funded to fulfil this important role.  While these measures will result in increased staffing and administration costs, I believe they represent a very welcome commitment to the further enhancement of our parliamentary democracy.</p> <p> Other elements in the new funding envelope include the provision for financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, pay restoration measures.  I am pleased that the allocation for the period 2022 to 2024 will include provision for a significant investment in ICT infrastructure as part of the ongoing Oireachtas digital transformation programme.  In total, &euro;22.8 million has been set aside for this purpose over the next three years.  We have all experienced at first hand the importance of modern methods of communications in the 21 months or so since the pandemic arrived on our shores.  It is to the credit of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission that the ongoing work of Deputies and Senators was supported during the periods in which our physical presence was severely curtailed.  The digital transformation programme, through the funding provided for in this legislation, will provide technology in the Chambers that will implement long-term solutions to facilitate collaboration and productive workflows, digitise existing processes and ways of working and provide modern tools to support Members and staff when carrying our parliamentary activities, implement advanced technology to enhance the research and analysis capabilities within the Oireachtas and improve transparency between the Oireachtas and the general public.</p> <p> It should be noted that a once-off general election allocation of &euro;10.5 million has also been provided for in the overall envelope, although we are not, of course, expecting a general election within the three-year period for which this budget is being provided. </p> <p> While funding is the sole purpose of the Bill, a number of amendments of a technical nature are also required.  I will refer briefly to the details of these amendments.  Section 1 amends section 5 of the principal Act to provide funding for expenditure incurred by the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission during the period of three years from 1 January 2022.  The amount of funding for that period is capped, as I said, at &euro;462.505 million.  Section 2 is a standard form provision setting out the Short Title, collective citation and commencement date for the Bill.  I look forward to the debate and I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>

I have something that predates Covid, which I believe is called the common cold.</p><p>Various measures have now, rightly, been enacted to increase the pay of public service workers.  They followed on from the cuts that were made in the wake of the previous financial crisis.  Many public service workers remember only too well the impact of those harsh cuts, imposed by way of the FEMPI legislation.  Those cuts have now been undone and the new public service stability agreement was broadly welcomed by public service workers and voted for overwhelmingly by the union membership.  Even groups such as the section 39 organisations, the employees of which are not technically public service workers but work in sectors dependent on public funding, recently got a deal.  However, there is a group of workers who have been left behind.  They are very close to home, so close that some of them may be working in the Minister's constituency office in Cork.  They certainly are working for members of his party in the Seanad.  I am talking about Oireachtas parliamentary assistants, secretarial assistants and constituency secretarial assistants.  Political staff are not technically public service workers as they are employed by Members, but their human resources management is overseen by the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Minister's Department, is responsible for their pay, terms and conditions.  Although these workers were not part of the FEMPI process, their pay, terms and conditions were very badly impacted, with pay freezes, reduced overtime and the removal of recognition of previous experience and qualifications.  They agreed to accept these changes as, like their co-workers in the public service, they believed they needed to be done in the public interest.  They also did so in order to maintain their link with the public service.  That has not been honoured because the Department believes the link has been broken.  As a result, a secretarial assistant today may be earning below the living wage.  Secretarial assistants start at &euro;24,423 per annum, which equates to &euro;11.75 an hour.  I hardly need to remind the Minister that the living wage is &euro;12.90 an hour.</p><p>In 2015, the moratorium on pay increases was theoretically lifted.  The then Minister even made an announcement to that effect, but the Department never signed off on it.  In 2017, when talks around pay restoration were picking up pace, the unions raised the issue again.  In 2018, it was forced to lodge a pay claim with the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC.  SIPTU lodged the claim on behalf of secretarial assistants, which called for the introduction of a parliamentary assistant role in the Seanad and a compression of the secretarial assistant scale in order that staff would be rewarded for the essential work they do in the Oireachtas.  It asked that prior service and qualifications be recognised once again.  In 2019, the Seanad passed a motion calling on the Minister to meet with staff and union representatives as a matter of urgency.  No such meeting has ever taken place.</p><p>We are about to enter 2022 and the time for meetings has long passed.  The staff want to see action from the Minister immediately.  The offer he made to secretarial assistants this year, of a pay increase of 1% in October, 1 % in February and a further 1%, was derisory.  It would bring their salary to &euro;25,162 per annum, or &euro;12.09 per hour, which is still below the living wage.  It was a slap in the face to the people who are doing the constituency work of the Minister and his fellow Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies.  It was a slap in the face to the people who are working extremely hard for his party's Senators.  How on earth he has not seen fit to reach a fair deal with these workers is absolutely beyond me.</p><p>Turning to the Bill, I am happy to support the amendments, which have achieved cross-party support.  That is welcome.  I understand a member of the Government has even signed off on them.  If enacted, the amendments will be an improvement on the <i>status quo</i>but they do not go far enough in some respects.  It is not in the remit of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission, nor should it be, to set anyone's wages.  There are separate mechanisms for wage-setting and we must not interfere with them.  Nevertheless, the amendments seek to move secretarial assistants onto a parliamentary assistant pay scale.  As my colleague, Senator Gavan, said in the Seanad, we all know the title of secretarial assistant is a misnomer.</p> <p>These people do the same jobs as parliamentary assistants, but are paid dramatically less.  We believe that consideration should certainly be given to appropriately benchmarking the grade of secretarial assistant, but it should be based on job evaluation.  </p> <p> We also think that pay for secretarial assistants in constituency offices needs to be addressed.  These people are working at the coal face.  They work in the Minister's constituency office.  He should thank them for their efforts in getting him elected.  They are the ones who follow up with councils, help constituents deal with housing issues, make representations on his behalf and are the face of his constituency service.  </p> <p> No staff member should earn less than a living wage.  Political staff deserve a fair pay deal, bringing all staff up to at least the living wage.  It would cost less than the &euro;81,000 increase the Minister recently gave to the Secretary General of the Department of Health.  As a Deputy, the Minister's salary is more than &euro;100,000 per year.  He also receives a ministerial salary in excess of &euro;80,000 on top of his salary as a Deputy.  He gets lavish expenses, yet if he tried to recruit a new secretarial assistant tomorrow, he or she would earn just &euro;11.75 an hour.  How can he justify that?  He certainly cannot justify it on the basis of fiscal prudence.  There is nothing fiscally prudent about failing to enact the amendments to the Bill.  The costs would be minor, but the change would have a significant impact on the lives of political staff.  Enacting the amendments would cost approximately &euro;2 million.  Let us put that in context.  Since it was announced that the national children's hospital had received planning approval, it has cost approximately &euro;1.9 billion.  That works out at &euro;950,000 per day  or close to &euro;1 million a day.  Between now and Thursday, the cost of the children's hospital would be about the same as the cost of enacting these amendments.  Let us remember that only recently &euro;81 million was blown on faulty ventilators that were never put to use.  With that money, we could have enacted these amendments 40 times over.  </p> <p> The inflation rate is running at in excess of 5%, a 14-year high.  We have the highest rents in the EU.  The Government is facilitating a build-to-rent housing market for which people need an average salary between &euro;50,000 and &euro;60,000.  The cost of living is spiralling.  None of this would be affordable for Oireachtas staff members.  </p> <p> I do not know how the Minister looks his constituency staff in the eye.  I know many Government Deputies are embarrassed by this situation, but like the others who have gone before them they hide behind the, "If it was up to me, I would give it to you" line.  In some ways, they are correct.  They have a point, because it is not up to them; it is up to the Minister.  He holds the purse strings, power and authority.  He is the only one standing in the way of these workers getting what they deserve for the valuable work they do. </p></speech>

We will support its main thrust.  I understand some quarters put a spin on this, but the reality is that it is about workers' rights and it is a workers' rights issue.</p>  <p>  Legislators, as Members of the House, are responsible for many things.  One of the things for which we are responsible is workers' rights.  We have to stand up for the staff we employ, because if we do not do that, who will?  At the end of the day, the secretarial assistants working in our staff and constituency offices around the country are at the coal face of everything we do.  Everyone acknowledges and understands that.  They deal with, for example, people who are upset because a husband has been diagnosed with cancer, and they are trying and failing to get a medical card because they are being put through all kinds of hoops by the relevant Department.  Secretarial assistants in constituency offices are those who make the phone calls, send the emails and stay late in the evening to try to sort through the issue and get all of the documentation together to help and coach people through the process.  </p>  <p>  In my constituency, they deal with farmers who have difficulties and cannot get grants, whose payments are late and who are in trouble with banks and loans.  They deal with myriad situations that nobody could imagine.  As well as being the people who send emails, make representations, write notes down and click "Send" on computers, they are counsellors because they are dealing with people on a daily basis.  The fact that they are so poorly remunerated is one of many scandals in politics.</p>  <p>  The cost of living has gone through the roof in this country.  People who are working hard and trying to manage on salaries that are quite low are finding it difficult because they have nothing to fall back on.  They find it difficult to pay rent, meet mortgage payments, pay car loans, get their children through school and do all of the things they have to do to try to manage life.  It is a real struggle for people.  If these amendments are accepted and implemented, we can change things for secretarial assistants.  </p>  <p>  This Bill goes some way towards righting the wrongs of the FEMPI legislation introduced by a previous Government, which punished public servants for something that, in reality, they had nothing to do with.  Secretarial and parliamentary assistants had their wages cut and frozen due to that legislation, and none of their previous experience or education was taken into account.  As the Minister knows, a secretarial assistant earns a starting salary of &euro;24,423 per year, which equates to approximately &euro;11.75 per hour.  That is well below the living wage of &euro;12.90 per hour.  Many are earning such low salaries that they qualify for family income support or supplement, which is happening in other workplaces in the public and private sector all over the country.  Many Deputies will wring their hands, and say there is nothing we can do about this and it is out of our control.  This is something we can control.  The Minister needs to resolve this issue.</p>  <p>  The fact that SIPTU had to lodge a pay claim at the WRC says it all in respect of where we are at.  Since my election in 2020, I have handed back three pay increases, as did many other Deputies.  That reflects the reality of the situation.  I am paid well enough for this job.  I am privileged to represent the constituency I represent.  The staff who work in constituency and parliamentary offices are also privileged to represent constituents and do the work they do.  They are delighted to do the work, and want and are eager to do it, and it is a scandal that they are so poorly paid.  They enjoy their work.  They find it rewarding that they can make a difference to people's lives, as all of us in politics do.  People, even in local politics, have always found that, more than anything else, is the reward we get for this job.  When somebody comes into the office in a difficult situation, it may take a week, a fortnight or a month but we are able to help that person and make a big difference to his or her life as they move forward.  I think it was Bill Clinton who said, "Money isn't everything, but it is up there with oxygen."  That is true, but at the same time there are things money cannot buy, such as the sense of self-achievement and self-worth we get from helping somebody.  I know secretarial and parliamentary assistants also get that, and that is something we all need to acknowledge, but their remuneration needs to change.  </p>  <p>  People in offices around the country are working on low wages.  We need to recognise that.  We also need to recognise that while money is not everything, it is an awful lot if one does not have enough of it.  It is a big problem for very many people out there who do not have enough money and are struggling to get by.  There is no point telling them not to go out for lunch and instead bring sandwiches to work.  That is some people's answer to this problem.  That is not the answer.  The answer is to pay people properly.  I implore the Minister to support the amendments and ensure that the Bill makes a difference for those people who do very hard work and make such a positive difference to so many people in constituency offices up and down the country.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-11-30a.363" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1453" speakername="Thomas Gould" time="19:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021113000036#KK00100"><p>It is vital when discussing the pay bill for the staff of the Oireachtas that we give recognition to the secretarial assistants working in our offices who have been fighting for fair pay since 2017.  I will take a minute to talk about my secretarial assistant, Mr. Ken Weldon, who works in my office.  Ken manages my office and organises my clinic.  He deals with patience, kindness and empathy with every person who calls to, emails or telephones the office.  He is the front line of my office and the first point of contact for many of my constituents.  There are days when Ken supports people in very distressed situations.  He hears dozens of stories daily of people whose lives are being destroyed by the housing crisis, the cost of living or the crisis in children's disability services.  I have no doubt there are people like Ken in constituency offices throughout the State, people who turn up every day with empathy and passion and who go above and beyond their job title to support people who are struggling.</p>  <p>  We are expecting people to do these jobs, jobs that are difficult both mentally and emotionally and which require skill and in-depth knowledge of numerous Departments and local authority departments, but we are not even paying them the living wage.  Ken and all the other SAs are working tirelessly in offices and helping people at the lowest points in their lives.  However, when the secretarial assistants and their unions were ready to engage at the Workplace Relations Commission in a meaningful discussion about their poor pay, representatives of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform could not be bothered to turn up.  To be clear, we should have a living wage.  A living wage is not a massive sum.  It is the bare minimum somebody can earn and live on.  It is not a luxury wage.  It is not like the hundreds of thousands of euro that are paid by the Government to some people, such as the heads of the HSE and aides employed by the Minister and his Government colleagues.  It is the bare minimum a person can earn to ensure he or she can pay the bills and the rent and go to bed at night without worrying.</p>  <p>  I believe the Government is completely out of touch with ordinary people.  It cannot imagine what it is like to live on a living wage, not to mind the people who have to live on a wage that is lower.  One need look no further than the Minister, Deputy O'Brien's plans for affordable housing.  Like me, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform is a Corkman.  The Minister, Deputy O'Brien, believes affordable housing in Cork could be a maximum of &euro;400,000.  That is &euro;400,000 for an affordable house.  This goes to the heart of why this Government is completely out of touch with ordinary people.  If you are on the living wage of &euro;12.90 per hour, that amounts to &euro;26,832 per annum.  To afford the Minister's affordable houses in Cork, you would have to be earning &euro;102,857.  It is no wonder Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael are so reluctant to discuss the living wage.  They are out of touch with the reality that ordinary people have to face.  Does the Government understand the vast majority of people in the State are not earning &euro;100,000 so they can buy an affordable house?  Affordable homes in Dublin will potentially cost more than that.</p>  <p>  The secretarial assistants deserve to be treated equally.  There are also people who are struggling to buy an affordable house.  At the end of the day, surely to God the Minister will personally recognise that the minimum we should pay people is a living wage.  I believe that and Sinn F&eacute;in believes it.  That is why we believe the people who work for us deserve at least that as a minimum.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-11-30a.364" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1599" speakername="Gerald Nash" time="19:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021113000036#KK00200"><p>I am pleased we are having this debate.  It is more than timely.  To the best of my recollection, although I have not checked the transcripts of the debate on the previous Bill, we did not have this conversation three years ago.  That is unfortunate.  It is a conversation we should have had in this Chamber, but it appears we did not.  The fact we are doing so now is illustrative of the degree of frustration our secretarial assistant colleagues are experiencing at present and have been experiencing over the past couple of years.</p>  <p>  We talk a great deal, both inside and outside this Chamber, about the concept of a living wage.  If we are serious about the introduction of a living wage and transforming the minimum wage to a living wage, the Government must lead by example.  The truth is there has not been a real discussion at Government level about the prospect of a living wage since 2015, when I established a Government forum on the living wage.  A few months later, as soon as the good people of Louth in their wisdom gave me their direction, by a small margin in the election of February 2016, that they no longer required my services, the next Government simply stopped talking about it.  We know the living wage is an ambition of the programme for Government, but I will believe that when I see it.  I say that because when a government treats its employees and those whom it is responsible for paying in this way, we must question its commitment to transform the national minimum wage that is paid to a significant number - tens of thousands - of private sector workers.  We must ask if it is serious about introducing a living wage in this country.</p>  <p>  It would cost a very small amount of money to ensure every public sector worker and those who are paid out of public sector funds would be on the living wage.  Remember that the living wage rate is considered to be a reasonable amount of money on an hourly basis that a single person would require to live some type of moderate existence.  It is not extravagant but a moderate, basic level of existence.  I ask the Minister to reflect on that.  By the way, I have some sympathy for the Minister in terms of the demands made on him or his officials to meet the staff who are affected.  It seems that given how this is organised and given his consent is required to sign off on anything, that would make things legally difficult for the Minister.  I understand and appreciate that, but he could send a political signal that he wants to see a system introduced that is fair for the secretarial assistants.  I genuinely believe that is something the Minister wants to see.  I know he is committed to public service.  While we all may disagree politically and have different philosophical, ideological and economic views, I appeal to the Minister to send a political message that he wants this matter resolved in the interests of those on whom we depend in our offices each day to provide the service we are elected to deliver.</p>  <p>  This Bill is fundamentally about enabling this Legislature to run and to be run well.  I am glad the Minister put on the record at the outset his gratitude to staff, here and across the public service, who worked so hard in the very challenging circumstances of the pandemic to respond to the demands that were placed on this House and to ensure the House could continue to operate.  I put my thanks and gratitude on the record to the staff who made that happen and allowed us to fulfil our democratic mandate, because people have been looking to us for leadership.  Regardless of political mistakes and so forth that may have been made in the management of the pandemic, we in this House all united and were enabled to meet when things were very difficult for this country.  We hope we will not see the difficulties experienced over the past two years resurface.</p>  <p>  This place has changed dramatically over the past 20 years.  My first full-time job after college was working here as a secretarial assistant in 1998.</p> <p>I know I look far too young to have worked as a secretarial assistant back in 1998.  Deputy Shortall, who has joined us, will remember that a Member could only rely on one staff member at that stage.  That staff member was a secretarial assistant who would have fulfilled several different roles until the role of the parliamentary assistant came along.  That was an addition Deputies at the time very much welcomed and a resource we all use well.</p> <p> I was reflecting earlier that back in 1998 I first came into these Houses as an employee of a Labour Party Deputy, Derek McDowell, who happened to be the party spokesperson on finance.  Little did I know that quite some years later I would be fulfilling that function myself.  It is interesting how things move on and evolve.  In 1998, we were just starting to use email.  Fax was as high-tech as it got.  I am afraid we are still using Lotus Notes, something the House should look at and scrutinise much more carefully.  As I said, there was one staff member Deputies could rely on and that staff member had to fulfil a range of different roles.</p> <p> That secretarial assistant role has evolved dramatically over the past 20 years or so.  The pressures placed on secretarial assistants now are enormous compared with the moderate kind of pressure I experienced in my day-to-day work as a secretarial assistant back in the late 1990s.  The job description alone is a complete anachronism.  It conjures up images of someone who takes dictation, writes letters, works nine to five Monday to Friday and that is the end of it.  They are much more than that.  They are the essential cogs and keep a Deputy's service going.</p> <p> Often, they are the first person a constituent speaks to when they phone or call into an office.  Their work is far from being merely clerical or administrative.  They are an advocate and an expert in getting things done, as we know.  They are real experts on public administration, entitlements, services and so on.  However, for some time they have been treated extremely shabbily.  The ironic thing is they are being treated very shabbily by those of us who really should know better.  Their rates of pay, their conditions and the basic levels of workplace respect and dignity afforded to our colleagues, the secretarial assistants, bears little relationship to the real value they bring to their job and to the service they provide to the people who elect us.</p> <p> It shames these Houses that this work and those who do it so expertly are taken for granted.  I think they have been taken for granted by the system.  It is almost as if the system has decided there is a premium for working in politics.  So many people want to work in politics and get that experience that they seem to be required to take a hit for the first few years of their career and hope they get a better paid job as a parliamentary assistant or as an adviser, or that job in the political party might come along.  That is part of the thinking and part of the culture.  It is wrong and needs to change.</p> <p> Having served as a Senator in recent years I have seen how the role has changed.  The role of secretarial assistant for a Senator is very different from that of a secretarial assistant for a Deputy.  There is a world of difference and a fair system needs to be devised take account of that difference in the context of the resources to be allocated under the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission Bill we are discussing this evening.</p> <p> My union, SIPTU, has been actively engaged on this issue in recent years.  I pay tribute to my Labour Party colleagues, Chloe Manahan and Ellen Murphy, who have worked tirelessly as union representatives to try to resolve this issue and to advance this just cause.  Other representatives who work with all political parties are engaged in this process.  A pay claim was lodged in 2018 when I was a Senator.  That was designed to compress the secretarial assistant scale for D&aacute;il staff and to introduce a parliamentary-assistant-related scale for Seanad secretarial assistants.  A derisory offer was made to secretarial assistants in recent times and I can entirely understand why that was rejected.</p> <p> I am not a negotiator and I am always conscious we make remarks in this Chamber in the context of a negotiation that is ongoing.  This is not me instructing anybody what to do but we need to get real and set appropriate pay scales for secretarial assistants.  We need to be much more transparent on that.  Rather than the existing 18-point pay scale could secretarial assistants not be moved to a much more appropriate scale like, for example, the executive officer, higher scale that would start at &euro;34,000 and move up to about &euro;56,000 with fewer increments along the way?  It takes 18 increments for a secretarial assistant to get to the top of their scale.  Given the rates of pay at the moment, it is most unlikely any secretarial assistant will be in position long enough to be able to get to the top of the scale; why would they?  </p> <p> While I understand the Minister cannot engage in industrial relations negotiations, which would be inappropriate, I appeal to him to send a political signal here this evening that he supports the work our secretarial assistants do.  I know he does, but I would like him to make a political intervention and appeal for this to be resolved in the best interests of the secretarial assistants who work so hard with us, who represent our operations so well and are much more than the description "secretarial assistant" could ever really define.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-11-30a.366" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1575" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="19:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021113000037#LL00200"><p>I am pleased to be able to talk about this important Bill, which covers the entire running of this House.  I would like to address two things.  The pay scales of the secretarial assistants go from &euro;24,223 to &euro;46,888.  There is a difference of something like &euro;16,500 between their pay scale and that of parliamentary assistants at the bottom of the scale.  After 18 years, the gap is closed but that is a very long time to have served as secretarial assistant.  As the Minister knows, this is precarious employment because many secretarial assistants only last in the job as long as we last.  As we have seen in the recent election, the turnover in this House is quite dramatic.</p>  <p>  I would make a general point.  I believe the gap between the low paid in the public service and the top paid has widened in real terms since the 1960s, and that has been retrograde in society.</p>  <p>  The work of our secretarial assistants is not the same as the work of somebody working in a big office as a clerical officer.  Our secretarial assistants have unique features.  They are doing a public-facing job.  They have a major work burden.  Then need to multitask and know about many schemes in the public domain at any one time.  When they are working in the constituency office and we are up here, they are virtually working on their own on their own self-initiative.  They cannot ring the Member about everything.</p>  <p>  A job analysis of what they do would find they are atypical workers with very unusual work conditions and, as I said, their work is quite precarious because it only lasts as long as the people who are elected last.  That issue needs to be addressed urgently.  I am not sure how the mechanisms work.  Ultimately, the Minister must provide the money.  He needs to give a clear signal that if money is awarded, it will be there and will be paid.  The Oireachtas, as a collective, needs to look at the issue of people like this who are so crucial to the operation of democracy in this country.</p> <p> A second matter has not yet been addressed by anybody here.  It is a parallel question as to whether we are resourcing ourselves properly to do the work the public wants us to do and whether we respect democracy enough to believe our work is vital and we must be resourced to do it properly.  There has been mention of years as far back as 1998 but I first came to these Houses as a Senator in 1989.  We had one secretarial assistant in those days between three Senators but the world was so different.  There were no emails and everything came by post, so everybody had to complete an onerous task of typing or writing a letter.  There were virtually no mobile phones and although there was an odd brick-type phone, constituents did not have them in their pockets.  They did not expect instant contact and there was very little media to be done in those days.</p> <p> The procedures of this House were totally different, as was the amount of paperwork.  The complications from consultations were different, as was the amount of research we must do.  The roles then and now are worlds apart.  People have spoken about the change between 1920 and 1950 but the changes in the 30 years since 1989 have been just as dramatic when analysed.  We must go with such changes to do justice to the job.  We did not have pre-legislative scrutiny at the time or all the committees in which we now spend so much time preparing reports and doing detailed work etc.</p> <p> It amuses me at times to look at what the public thinks we have and what we really have.  I often have people contacting me and asking that I have a member of staff look at the diary before reverting.  My staff are so crazily busy that the staff member dealing with the diary is me.  If I do not do it, my staff must do it and if that happens, they cannot be doing something else for me.  It is a question of how the labour is divided.  The reality is we have two staff who are entitled to holidays and breaks.  They sometimes get sick and so on.  The idea that we have a bevy of staff, with one for the diary, one for constituency work and one preparing us for Parliament is not true.  We all know it is not that way but we are shy or afraid of saying it because certain sections of the media might not like it.  Such sections of the media purposefully do not want to understand the importance of democracy.  We must be fearless and do something about it.</p> <p> This always reminds me of something that happened many years ago when a lady rang my constituency office to complain that I was effectively getting paid to get re-elected; in other words, that the people working in my constituency office were helping me to be re-elected.  I noticed the number was from Dublin because in those days people rang on landlines.  I rang her back, and she was giving out about my constituency office.  I said, "By the way, you rang my constituency office."  She said, "Yes", and I said, "You did expect the phone to be answered even though you weren't even in my constituency."  She said, "Yes", and then she suddenly realised that she had put her two feet in it and she started laughing.</p></speech>

My belief is the ordinary plain people of Ireland want us resourced to do the job.</p>  <p>  I suggest those of us who engage in committees and put much time and effort into them in these Houses should be given more support staff.  It is time-consuming work.  I know in saying that I will be criticised by people who do not wish to understand the workload, not only on us but on our staff.  Collectively and without any petty politics, we should make a stand for democracy in this House.  We should do it fearlessly.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-11-30a.370" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1567" speakername="R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall" time="19:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021113000038#MM00400"><p>The Bill before us seeks to increase the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission funding from &euro;422.27 million to &euro;462.505 million, an increase of more than &euro;40 million, which is a vast amount of money.  It is not exactly clear what the purpose of the increase is but we are told there is a plan to employ 111 additional staff over the next three-year period.  All of this would happen while secretarial assistants continue to be denied a living wage.  There is no doubt some money should have been set aside to address the matter of low pay in the case of secretarial assistants.  There is a very strong case and amendments to be tabled about increasing funding further to provide for the additional funding required to address the question of the pay of secretarial assistants.</p>  <p>  As others have said, the starting salary for secretarial assistants is &euro;24,423.37, or the equivalent of &euro;11.75 per hour.  This is clearly well below the living wage of &euro;12.90 per hour.  In the programme for Government, in the general sense there was a commitment to progress to a living wage over the lifetime of the Government, and in January the T&aacute;naiste asked the Low Pay Commission to examine this programme for Government commitment and make recommendations.  Its report was expected in the second half of this year and I do not know if it is still coming.  What is the status of that report?  There is no doubt low-paid staff within the Oireachtas and across society are struggling to make ends meet.  People on low pay and below the living wage are finding it particularly difficult.  Many people in all kinds of circumstances are finding it difficult now because of the increased costs of living, but people below the living wage are really put to the pin of their collars.  They are struggling very badly.</p>  <p>  A survey carried out by the Houses of the Oireachtas human resources section during the previous D&aacute;il indicates many secretarial assistants are doing similar work to parliamentary assistants.  There is no doubt about that.  We expect them to do all kinds of work and be experts across a wide of range of areas.  We expect them to know about social welfare and healthcare entitlements.  We expect them to know about housing and to be able to deal with a full spectrum of queries.  They must work really hard to create that knowledge base and develop that expertise.  The person in question must really be very bright and well-informed as well as being very empathetic.  These are all characteristics that do not come easily.  It is all very challenging.  Nonetheless, secretarial assistants are paid significantly less than the parliamentary assistants.  Much of the work of parliamentary assistants and secretarial assistants is very similar, especially in the case of the Seanad, but secretarial assistants are paid much less.  Their salary is not much more than 50% of the parliamentary assistant salary, and that is not fair.</p>  <p>  The survey indicates secretarial assistants were regularly carrying out higher level parliamentary assistant tasks.  There is no doubt that is the case, certainly with the secretarial assistants allocated to Senators.  In many ways it is the same for Deputies as it is not just the case the secretarial assistant just does what would be termed secretarial work.  They must deal with a broad range of matters as well as researching, writing documents and dealing with the public face to face, which is one of the most challenging aspects of their work.</p>  <p>  For example, according to the survey, 45% of D&aacute;il secretarial assistants were writing newsletters and managing allowances, including Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO, returns.  That is an entire other area of compliance they complete on behalf of the Member in question.  Again, it is challenging and they must get the figures right and be very clear about compliance requirements.  It is very responsible work.</p>  <p>  From these survey findings, it is clear the current secretarial assistant pay scale does not in any way accurately reflect the roles and responsibilities undertaken.  Everybody should be entitled to equal pay for equal work but this is certainly not the case when it comes to political staff in the Seanad.  One of the most glaring disparities in the Oireachtas is the difference between secretarial assistants in the D&aacute;il and in the Seanad.</p></speech>

I bring this motion on behalf of the more than 380 staff in local employment services and job clubs throughout the State, many of whom have given up to 20 and 25 years of service to their communities and are highly skilled and educated with vast experience.  I am proud to bring forward this motion having met and engaged with many of those workers.  I do so as someone who firmly believes in the not-for-profit community-based ethos of the job clubs and the local employment services, LESs.</p><p>When the plan to tender out these existing LES and job club services became apparent, we were repeatedly told this was a legal requirement due to EU procurement laws and I presume this is an argument that will be put forward by many Government Deputies in this debate.  Yet, the same EU directive is crystal clear in stating that no member state is obliged &quot;to contract out...the provision of services that they wish to provide themselves or to organise by means other than public contracts&quot;.  Legal advice sought by the Irish Local Development Network, ILDN, from a leading law firm in Ireland confirmed this and concluded that the Department is not required to tender out these services.  This legal advice was shared with the Minister.  She is aware of it.  The ILDN has written to the Minister on three occasions and she has yet to respond.</p><p>Added to this is the fact that the unpublished report from the Institute for Employment Studies in England, which the Minister contracted to review all current public employment services and to propose a new design, was clear that a decision needed to be made on whether to use powers to reserve the award of some or all of the contracts for non-profits.  The Minister made that decision, which she was neither obliged nor required to.  Even if it was the case that she was legally obliged, she was legally obliged to bring forward a public and open competition tender for these services.  She was not obliged to dismantle and change the current model entirely.  She was not obliged to move from a not-for-profit to a for-profit model.  That was a decision the Minister made.</p><p>The Minister has also repeatedly cited advice from the Comptroller and Auditor General.  A recent letter I received from the Comptroller and Auditor General confirmed that a different contracted service was brought to the Department's attention as not being compliant with procurement and the Department then expanded the non-compliant procurement disclosure to the LES and job clubs.  The Institute for Employment Studies also warned that if the Minister were to open the market to full competition, it would clearly need to be done carefully in order to maintain the support of stakeholders and command political support.  What stakeholders support the Minister in what she is doing?  Who are those stakeholders?  As regard to commanding political support, the Minister will know that the cross-party Oireachtas committee on social protection looked at all this.  We brought in those involved, including officials from the Department, and recommended that the LES and job clubs remain in their current form.</p><p>The same report on which the Minister has based many of her new proposals for employment services also stated that requiring financial qualifications criteria will likely make it more difficult for many existing providers to achieve a pass.  The report recommended that the Minister set low financial criteria thresholds and offer an advanced payment to level the playing field, as they put it.  The Minister did neither.  She required an annual turnover for the four lots that have already gone through phase 1 of between &euro;1.2 million and &euro;1.9 million for community not-for-profit organisations that have charitable status.  They were locked out of phase 1 of this tender process.  The economist Jim Power, on looking at the first phase of the tender, concluded that the proposed model is for-profit and that the model put forward in phase 1 is &quot;not likely to prove viable for charitable not-for-profit companies&quot; and that is exactly what has happened.</p><p>Many issues have been highlighted in phase 1 of the tender process, such as the annual turnover about which the Minister was warned in the institute's report more than a year ago.  The Minister also said in the Chamber last week that she has done everything &quot;to ensure the importance of social value and community linkages are reflected in the procurement process.&quot;  I would love to know how private companies Seetec or Turas Nua proved or showed any link to the community or social values, and perhaps the Minister will share that with us.  We have seen what privatisation has done to employment services.  We have seen it through JobPath, which has had a success rate of 7% in the last six years.  Of the more than 370,000 people referred to it, there was a cost to the taxpayer of &euro;275 million for 7% of those people to be sustained in a job for 52 weeks at least.  What the Minister is doing is a mistake.  I ask that she look at it again.  Everybody involved has asked that she look at it again.  The staff on the ground in the local employment services are not happy.  The Minister is aware of that and she needs to listen.  There are no stakeholders on board with what she is doing and the vast majority of Members of this House are not on board either.  This motion asks the Minister to look at this again and I ask her to consider that.</p></speech>

The Government's stance is mind-boggling.  The tendering process does not make sense and the community not-for-profit model must be preserved and not dismantled.  I find it hard to understand why the Government would do something like this from a community point of view, a jobs point of view and a political point of view.  Taking the decision to commercialise these schemes and introducing targets and quotas and commissions means that staff will have little incentive to ask what is actually best for a person coming through their doors and would seek to make a profit from them.  It will cause a loss of jobs.  Groups such as NEWKD, South Kerry Development Partnership and IRD Duhallow have gathered knowledge and skills over the past 25 years and have become experts in career guidance.  They have guided our communities through the financial crash and subsequent Government austerity measures.</p>  <p>  Since 2008, more than 2,000 people have gone through the doors of the South Kerry Development Partnership.  The organisation never said no to them.  It kept its doors open when everyone else was turning people away and suggesting they go to Australia.  It trained these people and brought them back into the jobs market.  The Government says that there is nothing it can do, which translates as "there is nothing it will do".  The Government says it has legal advice.  The Minister has seen the legal advice that states the Government is not obliged to tender.</p> <p>These schemes, such as the rural social scheme, have been of great benefit to rural communities.  They support the essence of community work, activities such as driving buses, taking the elderly to centres and maintaining sports grounds.  Kerry social farming has also seen massive success.  The six-year rule will send men in south Kerry away from fulfilling, life-enhancing work in their communities that gives them a sense of pride and return them to the dole, leaving them with nothing to do in these isolated areas and limited social interaction.  Why pay them to stay at home?  Why not keep them on the schemes?  The Minister should admit now that this is a mistake.  Who is going to do the community work in deeply rural areas when her 2017 payment structure rules are in force?  Rather than helping employers to get cheap labour and introducing a system she knows will fail - and the Minister has heard the statistics in that regard - she should broaden and top up the schemes.  She should commission an independent review.  A 2009 report said that for every &euro;1 spent, the quantifiable benefits amount to &euro;2.89.  The Minister should act now for her own sake.</p></speech>

After &euro;300 million has been spent to achieve a success rate of just 6%, I have been proven correct.  I also said the same about her other madcap scheme, JobBridge.  I was also right when I highlighted at the time the concerns among the local employment services and jobs clubs that they could face extinction as the type of privatisation that underlay JobPath would likely expand into their services and now here we are.  Where will it end?  What is next?  Is it the disability services?  I will say it again; this scheme is the stuff of nightmares for the unemployed.  The latest tender is aimed at dismantling community-based not-for-profit services and doing away with the wealth of knowledge and expertise they have built up in working with local unemployed people, addressing their issues, lending them support and often going beyond the call of duty to help those whom private contractors look upon as cash cows rather than people in need of supports to re-engage with employment.  A for-profit ethos should have no role in community services but this Government and all governments since the days of the Progressive Democrats have had blind faith in the market to deliver for struggling communities.  It does not do that and everybody in this House should know that.</p></speech>

In my constituency of Dublin North-West, local employment services are provided by the Ballymun Job Centre and similar services are also provided by the Dublin North West Area Partnership in Rosehill House in Finglas.  Both have provided an immensely valuable service to the community in helping to assist people in seeking employment and in the creation of jobs and supports for small businesses.  These local services provide what the services themselves would describe as a walk-in, person-centred, community-based employment service.  The local element of such services is very important and will be totally lost if such services are regionalised.  The proposed closure of these centres will be a blow to the clients of such facilities including those seeking employment, the long-term unemployed and those seeking employment who are in addiction or recovery.  There will also be a great loss to the community in terms of the local knowledge and experience of those working in these local services.  The present model of local employment services works well.  Why change something that is not broken?  Privatising these services will make such services profit-driven, to the detriment of the individual seeking assistance.  I do not see how an unemployed person will benefit from the proposed consolidation of these services.  The considered opinion of those with experience in local areas is that this will simply not work.  I agree with this view.  Centralising resources will mean that local areas will lose out in direct funding.  The proposed model has been rejected by stakeholders, expert organisations and the Oireachtas committee.  The model lacks transparency, is untested and will be a results-based process that will put profit before people.</p></speech>

I commend her on bringing forward this motion.  Rather than dealing with the situation State-wide, I will point the Minister to a service she knows very well, the Monaghan local employment service.  This service has been in operation since 1998.  It has secured the esteem and goodwill of the wider community.  More important, by any matrix or standard, it has proven to be effective when compared to operations such as JobBridge and JobPath, about which you hear terms like "disconnected" and "out of touch" used.  You never hear such terms in respect of the Monaghan local employment service because it works.  It is a good service.  Rather than putting it under threat, we should be expanding the local employment service in our county.  I am asking the Minister not just to support the Sinn F&eacute;in proposal today, but to actually implement it to ensure that services such as the Monaghan local employment service are driven by a not-for-profit community-led ethos so that they can actually secure jobs for those who need them, where and when they need them.  We have a model that has been proven to work time and time again.  It has operated under the auspices of Monaghan Integrated Development, which is probably one of the best integrated development companies in the State.  It works and I ask the Minister to ensure it continues to work.  She should implement the motion put forward today and end the practice of introducing for-profit elements to our unemployment services.</p></speech>

The Government is proposing the total privatisation of employment activation services through the JobPath model.  JobPath was introduced by the former Labour Party Minister, Joan Burton, and the Labour Party has stood over it for years.  It has failed to provide quality employment for the vast majority of those who have used it.  Since 2015, 283,000 people have used JobPath but only 22,000 of them retained employment for more than 12 months.  Its success rate stands at less than 8% with the cost per job coming in at &euro;11,227.  That is not value for money.  Research carried out by our party has exposed the terrible experiences of many people who have been forced to accept jobs that are totally unsuited to their backgrounds or the areas in which they wish to work.  Others have been forced to give up education or part-time work for fear of losing their welfare entitlements.  Included in this cohort are substitute teachers.  The service is focused on making money rather than on helping people to get sustainable jobs.  In contrast with JobPath, we want more investment in jobs clubs and local employment services.  These are run on not-for-profit models and are more effective.  A 2018 Indecon report concluded that jobs clubs could source full-time employment positions at a cost of &euro;2,444 per person, which is far better than the JobPath cost, which is more than &euro;11,000.  In Laois-Offaly, workers and companies respect jobs clubs such as those in Portlaoise, Birr, Tullamore and Portarlington but these are now to be closed down and replaced by a Thatcherite for-profit model.  This is a bad decision based on right-wing ideology from Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Labour Party, which put it in place.  It is not good for workers and not good for taxpayers.  I bring it to the attention of the Minister that the Committee of Public Accounts will be launching a report on JobPath on Thursday which will underline many of these matters and set out clearly what the committee found when it brought in the Department and others to discuss this subject.</p></speech>

Eight of the top ten unemployment black spots are in Limerick city.  I recently commissioned a report on unemployment black spots across the State and it makes for stark reading.  Many people rely on the local employment services in Limerick.  They have done a great job and would have done a much better job with even a portion of the funding given annually to JobPath in its different incarnations.  These services are vital to many Limerick communities.  They are a crucial service particularly for those who are furthest away from the labour market.  Aside from providing the necessary skills people need to get back into the labour market, they also offer hope.  We have yet to see the external review conducted on behalf of the Department of Social Protection on the basis of which the request for tender was introduced in May.  The Minister has demonstrated her intention to privatise employment services and undermine the not-for-profit ethos of the existing services.  This is a mistake and I think the Minister knows that.  The Government is putting profit margins before the well-being of those who have been marginalised.  Limerick deserves better as the black spots I referenced earlier are nothing new.  Over six years, &euro;275 million was spent and only 7% of those on the scheme found employment for a year or more.  Can the Minister imagine the effect it would have had if the local employment services had a fraction of that &euro;275 million?</p> <p>The Minister stated that she was obliged for good governance and by public procurement rules to put the LES contract out to tender.  There was no need to take this approach, and no need to approach the tender process in this way.  While employment services should be extended across the State, that should be done under the current LES model, which, if funded, that model will deliver better results.  In Limerick, over the years, the People Action Against Unemployment Limited, PAUL, Partnership, of which I was a board member for several years, has done a fantastic job with the LES scheme.  I hope to God that we save it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-11-30a.382" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1513" speakername="Pauline Tully" time="19:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021113000041#PP00200"><p>I recently submitted a parliamentary question regarding the need to halt the tendering process for the LES until a proper engagement with the relevant stakeholders could develop a more suitable model.  In her response, the Minister stated that "extensive consultations" had taken place.  However, representatives of SIPTU informed the Joint Committee on Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the Islands that its engagement with the Minister&rsquo;s Department took place on 17 September 2021, which was after the tendering process for the operation of regional employment services had commenced.</p>  <p>  The response went on to state that "clear legal advice" had been obtained from the Attorney General that the current procurement "process is not in keeping with our procurement obligations".  This legal advice, however, has not been released to the joint committee for examination.  The committee noted that Directive 2014/24/EU, regarding public procurement, states that it should be recalled that "...nothing in this Directive obliges Member States to contract out or externalise the provision of services that they wish to provide themselves or to organise by means other than public contracts within the meaning of this Directive".  </p>  <p>  The Minister&rsquo;s reply further stated that the new regional employment service, RES, "is not privatisation of employment services" and that her "officials are striving to ensure that the new model does not create any barriers to the community and voluntary sectors or inhibit their ability to submit a [...] tender".  Yet, a report commissioned by the Irish Local Development Network, ILDN, CLG, found that the model used in the initial request for tender, RFT, is a for-profit model and that it is not clear that this approach can meet the needs of the long-term unemployed, excludes some cohorts of people, such as carers, lone parents and those referred from complementary programmes, and is unlikely to provide viable, for-charity, not-for-profit companies.  This is plainly a privatisation of this service, with minimal consultation and the withholding of relevant documentation.  I commend the motion, therefore, which aims to protect our local employment service from privatisation and to let our communities know they are not for sale.</p></speech>

I fully recognise the hard work, professionalism and commitment of all those working on the front line in providing employment services and supports to people who are out of work.  I know very well the good work that the LES does in my home county of Monaghan.  The services throughout the country provide valuable support and assistance to people at a time of need and it is important that should be recognised tonight.</p>  <p>  What I cannot escape, however, is the clear legal advice from the Attorney General that these services must be subject to a competitive procurement process.  Representatives of the ILDN have written to me to state that it has legal advice to say that there is no legal requirement to tender.  The legal advice from the ILDN was not shared with me or my officials.  Instead, the organisation provided a high-level synopsis of the legal opinion in a letter to me.  This was shared with the Office of the Attorney General and its view is that its original advice still stands: there must be an open procurement process.  I must follow the legal advice of the Attorney General, and whether the Government likes it, we have no choice but to put these contracts out to tender.  We must all remember that the most important people in this debate are the jobseekers.  My first job as the Minister is to ensure that quality services are in place and available to help them.  I cannot do that if there is a question mark about the legal status of the contracts or if there is a lack of transparency about how those contracts are awarded.</p>  <p>  Of course, any change requiring existing service providers to submit tenders in a situation where they have not had to do so for more than 25 years will be unsettling.  I recognise these concerns, and that is why my Department has engaged extensively over an extended period, going back as far as 2018, with representatives of the service providers.  We also split the procurement process into two phases.  The first phase extends coverage into areas where there is no LES provider at present.  In this phase local partnerships were successful in two of the three lots where they submitted bids.  This shows clearly that the community sector can bid successfully for these services.  I have no doubt that this success will be replicated in the second phase.</p>  <p>  Members will be aware that my Department commissioned an external review of LES and job clubs provision.  This review, led by Indecon, involved extensive consultation with the service providers and culminated in the production of two reports in 2018.  These reports recommended the consolidation of the LES and job clubs into a single service, which is the basis of the new regional employment service model.  The Indecon reports also recommended improving the governance of existing services, along with the need for open and competitive procurement for contracted employment services.  As a next step, the Department then commissioned the Institute of Employment Studies and the Social Finance Foundation to advise on how best to proceed, taking account of the wider employment services landscape.  These are not-for-profit organisations with international expertise in delivering employment and labour market and social change policies, and, again, these bodies consulted with service providers.  They recommended a revised regional employment services model consolidating the services currently provided by LES and job clubs and focusing on people who are very distant from the labour market.  While the report is confidential, because it contains detailed costs analyses that it would not be prudent to disclose prior to or during a procurement process, a redacted chapter of the report, relating specifically to the RES model, was provided to the members of the Joint Committee on Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the Islands.</p>  <p>  Some Members mentioned the need for further engagement with the sector.  There has been extensive engagement, and I will give a brief overview.  In 2018, the CEOs of all the local partnership companies were briefed, while, in January 2019, my Department hosted a briefing on Indecon's recommendations.  The Institute of Employment Studies also consulted with representatives from the sector and the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed, INOU.  In 2019, my officials visited every provider to inform them of the process and to garner their views and suggestions.  Briefings then took place on the first RFT process and a further briefing session on the approach to phase 2 was held this month, which was exclusively reserved for staff or board members of parties interested in bidding.  As part of this session, feedback was sought on views with respect to the design of the first procurement phase.  I also instructed my officials to meet with representatives of SIPTU, F&oacute;rsa and the ILDN in a forum to discuss their issues, including their feedback on the first RFT.  I also met with representatives of the ILDN, and I will again meet with them, and with representatives of all the local partnerships, later this week.  Therefore, there has been and continues to be a significant level of engagement in this regard.  </p>  <p>  The bottom line, however, regardless of this major degree of engagement, is that existing providers would, understandably, prefer if the tender process could just be halted.  I have no doubt that every Deputy would also like to have their contracts renewed continuously, regardless of performance, but that is not how the world works.</p>  <p>  Stopping the tender process is not an option and everybody in this House concerned about compliance with EU law and proper standards of transparency and governance knows that this is not an option.  However, I assure Deputies that suggestions arising from the extensive consultation with the sector have been incorporated into the design of the RES model and feedback from the first phase of procurement is informing the finalisation of the tender design for the second phase.  In particular, the design will address issues such as cash flow and minimum referral volumes, and will include a strong emphasis on social value and linkages.</p>  <p>  The Sinn F&eacute;in motion once again attacks JobPath, a contracted employment service delivered by Seetec and Turas Nua.  The two companies involved are community and staff-based enterprises.</p> <p>One is owned by a farmers' co-operative and the other is majority owned by its staff via a staff trust.  Between them the two providers employ over 480 staff all around country.</p></speech>

The evidence from the OECD report clearly shows that individuals who were supported by JobPath were more likely to enter employment, remain in employment for longer and have higher earnings from employment.  I encourage the Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies to speak to their party colleague in Northern Ireland, the Minister for Communities, Deirdre Hargey, MLA, who clearly recognised this when her Department recently awarded employment service contracts to one of the JobPath providers, Turas Nua.  That is the same JobPath provider Sinn F&eacute;in is so critical of in this House.  It is happy to give it contracts in Northern Ireland.</p></speech>

I think it is important in the context or this motion to note two important facts that are central to an informed and accurate discussion.  First, LES and job club services are not delivered directly by the State.  The decision to establish LES and job club services on an externally contracted basis is not a new decision but was in fact taken 25 years ago.  These services have always been externally contracted.  That is a simple fact.  On the basis of the legal advice received, there is no escaping the obligation to contract out the delivery of services.  I am aware that some observers think that there might be an escape clause of some type.  There is not.  This advice comes from the Attorney General and has been discussed at Cabinet.  There is an obligation on the Government, myself as the responsible Minister and my Department to act in accordance with this advice and adhere to procurement law.</p>  <p>  My number one priority as Minister is to provide the best possible service to help those who are unemployed.  I value the work of all the staff and services providers who work with my Department to deliver on this important objective.  I want to support them and help them to ensure that they can continue this work.  However, I must do this in way that is compliant with the law and that adheres to the necessary standards of transparency and good governance in public procurement.  My Department has listened carefully to all of the concerns expressed.  In particular I emphasise that the regional employment services tender includes a strong focus, with a high level of marks awarded, on delivering social value through clear embedded linkages with the local community.  Despite Sinn F&eacute;in's assertion to the contrary, the evidence from the phase 1 process is that community and voluntary groups can succeed in securing contracts.  I have no doubt this will be replicated as part of phase 2.  The Government and I are committed to expanding the provision of high quality services across the State so that we can support all those who need assistance in progressing towards employment.  It is imperative that we deliver the best possible services to our people, that these services are available, effective and are procured in a way that meets the State's legal obligations.</p></speech>

I know a little more than most about this subject.  I was on the national executive of the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed many years ago when these job clubs and local employment services were being put together.  We were part of the team that worked around a community based response, working with people who were unemployed to put together tailor-made training programmes to help them get back into the world of work.  This is good for unemployed people and good for businesses, which get workers who are fitted and want to stay in that career path down the line.  This makes sense from every perspective.  The importance of the motion of my colleague, Deputy Kerrane, is that it is about community working together.  I will tell the story of our local job club in Buncrana.  It is 20 years in place.  In all of those years I have been a public representative and not once have I had a complaint about that service from people who are unemployed or from businesses.  It was a tremendous service that is serving our community for 20 years, a whole generation.  When it comes to JobPath and the Tory, right wing privatisation model, I could not tell the number of people in the community sector who are unemployed and have had a terrible, demeaning, dehumanising experience within that Tory model.</p>  <p>  Does the Minister know what she sounded like when she was speaking earlier?  She sounded like Margaret Thatcher.  The lady is not for turning.  This is right wing, anti-community politics dressed somehow as prudence.  It is not.  It is anti-community.  The Government is dismantling services that work for unemployed people, businesses and communities.  For that reason, I say shame on the Minister if she is not going to reverse that position.</p></speech>

This is certainly not the case here.  The new regional employment services are no match for the local employment services and job clubs.  With over 25 years' experience under their belt, they are far better placed to service their communities than profit-driven private entities.  I do not see how the Minister can tender out services currently provided by job clubs and local employment services based on an unpublished report and incorrect reference to EU procurement of contracts.  This is based on the previous record of JobPath, which had a success rate of 6% between 2015 and 2021, costing the taxpayer &euro;275 million.  Worst of all, it is based on the ethos of privatisation, throwing citizens into a cauldron of box-ticking exercises with the whole purpose being driven by financial results and massive profits while simultaneously taking out walk-in and wrap-around services.  This disproportionately affects lone parents and people with disabilities, including those with limited education.</p>  <p>  I have spoken with my local employment service officers.  They are a tremendously hard-working group of people providing vital walk-in and wrap-around services, particularly to those on the lower employment scale.  They have been cost-effective for over 25 years.  The services they provide are totally person-centred and community based.  The Minister must foster and protect the not-for-profit local employment services, not deplete them or replace them with an alien entity whose goals we all know will be far removed from the welfare of our local communities.</p>  <p>  We ask that the tender process be re-examined as it is stacked on the commercial privatisation side.  Local employment services are not-for-profit organisations with charitable status.  Therefore, they will not be able to compete with the current austere terms and conditions, one of which is that they must have a turnover of &euro;1.2 million.  This multiplies the risk which is held individually by each manager and therefore will threaten the existing 26 branches and exclude them from the tendering process along with closing 40 job clubs.</p>  <p>  With this in mind, we are asking the Government to see the merit and true value of our local enterprise services and to support our motion.  I wish to acknowledge the Trojan work of my colleague, Deputy Kerrane, in preparing the motion.</p></speech>

It is fantastic work.  The Government thinks it has a Midas touch where it can turn everything into a money-making opportunity for its friends and squeeze a profit out of issues such as homelessness, the health crisis and asylum seekers.  Society is not supposed to turn monetary profit.  It is supposed to support social goals like low crime rates, support the vulnerable, especially our older people although that is for another day's work, and the provision of vital community services.  One such vital service is the local community employment service.  It provides an excellent service on a local level and has a supportive and sympathetic approach, unlike the suspicion that the likes of the disastrous JobPath scheme encourages, a scheme which has cost close to &euro;300 million since 2015.  If only local employment services could get similar funding.  Of the almost 400,000 people referred to JobPath since July 2015, just over 26,000 found employment which lasted for at least 52 weeks.  That is a success rate to date of 7%.  Privatisation is not working.  Commodification of local employment services will not work.  Sinn F&eacute;in remains strongly opposed to the Government's most recent move to commercialise those seeking employment, which would put profit margins ahead of the needs of ordinary people.  Private companies receiving bonuses to tick a box when someone gets a job - any job - leads to poor outcomes for jobseekers.  Some 40 job clubs will close their doors at the end of next month and 81 people will lose their jobs.  This cannot be allowed to happen.  The Minister can be sure that we in Sinn F&eacute;in will continue to stand against a harmful model of private employment services that this Government has put forward.  Now more than ever, our employment services are not for sale and our communities are not either.  I will finish on this.</p> <p>Athy, Newbridge and Kildare town, all in County Kildare, and Portarlington, County Laois, are in my constituency.  Their job clubs will be closed.</p></speech>

They have been under Cork City Partnership for over 25 years.  Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and Green Party councillors in Cork have come out in support of them.  The Taoiseach made clear his support for them in the past.  The local employment services provide valuable services for those seeking employment, including vulnerable groups, those returning to the workforce after long periods, carers and lone parents.  Why, therefore, is the Government still pushing the privatisation agenda?  We need a stronger community sector, not profit at all costs.  Local employment services provide a vital service that helps people to get work in communities that desperately need jobs and the services provided.</p>  <p>  There is so much more I want to say but what I am saying is that what is happening to the local employment services in my constituency, which provide valuable work for the people of Cork, is completely wrong.  Shame on Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party because this is Fine Gael's privatisation agenda, which it had pushed in respect of Irish Water, bin collections, addiction services, recovery services, homelessness services and local authorities.  Ultimately, Fine Gael is the privatisation party in this D&aacute;il, and Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party are allowed to get away with daylight robbery.  It is about time that they stood up and said to Fine Gael that there should be no more privatisation of our community services.</p></speech>

The proposed changes will result only in a process of commercialisation which will leave those who most need the services behind.  The Government parties' continuous attempts to commercialise those seeking employment are both out of touch and utterly bizarre.  The Government puts profit margins above the needs of the people the service was designed to support.  From speaking to those involved in day-to-day operations, I am aware that the Government's approach results in people being pushed into unsuitable, short-term positions to tick a box or move them from one column to another.</p>  <p>  The Government's tendering process risks pricing the local employment services and job clubs out of the process entirely.  That would be a tremendous loss to the public.  The community approach, the walk-in option available through local employment services and job clubs, meets the needs of the community in a way that profit-focused models never can.  It appears to even the most casual observers that Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, in particular, are enamoured with a profit-driven business model for everything from healthcare to homelessness.  It is no surprise, therefore, to see its tentacles spread into the provision of employment supports.  What is not clear, however, and what has never been adequately explained is why the Government is insisting on removing local employment services and job clubs from the picture to promote a privatised model of service provision that has no proven record of success.</p>  <p>  Having listened to the Minister's speech this evening, it has become incredibly clear to me that she is determined to try to fix a system that is not broken but is crying out for genuine supports to reach its full potential.</p></speech>

I thank my colleagues &mdash; including Deputies Howlin and Sherlock, councillors N&iacute;all McNelis and John Maher and others in the party &mdash; who have contacted me to express their concern over the tendering process proposed by the Department and to express their support for this motion, which I am glad to support.  I have received other representations from individuals in local employment services and those affected in Dublin, Cork, Wexford, Galway and other locations right around the country, including my area, Dublin Bay South.</p>  <p>  I spoke this afternoon to SIPTU's public administration and community division organiser, Mr. Adrian Kane.  I am grateful to officials in F&oacute;rsa, whom I am aware have also been working on this matter.  I know from engagement with SIPTU, F&oacute;rsa and others that we will see SIPTU members in local employment services in County Offaly, including Tullamore, and in Portarlington, County Laois, engaging in industrial action next week owing to a dispute resulting from the Government's termination of its contract with the local community sector companies that employ them.  I am aware of the great concern of so many over the prospect of redundancy as a result of the tendering process.  I ask the Minister to engage with the unions to ensure redundancies do not occur as a result of the decision.</p>  <p>  I am aware that the Minister has spoken about engagement but further, meaningful engagement is clearly necessary.  The call from SIPTU is for the Minister to instruct her officials in the Department of Social Protection to put concrete proposals on the table to deal with the job losses in the sector that have already resulted from round one of the tendering process and to halt it or pause it, as the motion requires, before it moves on to round two.  All of us will be cognisant that it is a stark situation for local employment staff to be in.  They fear they will lose their jobs.  Many of them have worked for many years in a system in which they have built up institutional knowledge and know-how on behalf of the State in assisting those who are out of work.  There are now fearful that they themselves will lose their jobs.  They provide many services in assisting people's transition to full-time employment or additional training.  In many cases, these are simply not quantifiable in monetary terms.  We are anxious that the baby not be thrown out with the bathwater owing to the change in process.</p>  <p>  What many of those in the sector genuinely feel is that the net effect of the creation of the new service and process will be that a set of metrics will be put in place that will specify impractical and unrealistic targets and milestones.  There is genuine concern that the new tendering processes will lead to the wholesale privatisation of local employment services and effectively force out community-based, non-profit providers.  While I accept that the Minister says that is not the intention, there is clear and genuine concern that this would be the effect of the process.  Although we are still working through the devastating Covid pandemic, we are all conscious that these sorts of community-based, not-for-profit services are needed, now more than ever, in local areas.  That is why I stress again the need for meaningful engagement with representatives of staff, service providers and service users.  We want to ensure the services provided are not monetised in a way that results in job losses and takes the heart out of them.  What is unique about the current circumstances is that both employers and trade unions are effectively united on this issue.  That does not happen often.</p>  <p>  Let me refer to the multiple local employment services that carry out vital work in my area, Dublin Bay South, particularly at St. Andrew's Resource Centre, Pearse Street, which I have visited many times.  The service at St. Andrew's, Eastside &amp;amp; Docklands Local Employment Service, is a joint enterprise of St. Andrew's Resource Centre and the Inner City Renewal Group, Dublin 1.  My colleague Senator Marie Sherlock commended this service in the Seanad when addressing the Taoiseach last week.</p>  <p>  It is really worth mentioning some of the work done through the St. Andrew's centre.  Staff there told me they spotted significant demand some years ago for construction skills.  We are all aware of shortages in that sector.  The service started a construction-skills programme that takes in 20 men every week, many of whom are from backgrounds of severe disadvantage, in some cases involving prison terms or addiction issues.  The individuals can start work on a construction site after the intensive training provided on the course.  They start work in a skilled job that pays well and that will see an increase in income as time goes on.  This is transformative in the lives of the individuals concerned, but the intrinsic value of such a transformative service often cannot be measured in the monetary terms or by the metrics that may be prescribed as a result of the new process.</p>  <p>  The service I have mentioned is just one that I am familiar with in my area.  I am conscious that there are services in Crumlin, Dolphin's Barn and the Liberties.  Among the many individuals who have contacted me &mdash; and, I am sure, others &mdash; is Ms Una Lowry, the CEO of the Dublin South City Partnership, Dublin 12.  She has expressed her concerns and those of her organisation regarding the new models being rolled out.  She has said they are being rolled out without establishing any forum that would research and scope out the best model of employment services for those outside the labour market and without seeking sufficient engagement with a stakeholder forum to build a robust new model.  When we examine the kinds of models that exist, including the partnership in Dublin 12 and the service at St. Andrew's, Pearse Street, we see genuine engagement with local communities and businesses.</p> <p>To give credit to Dublin Port, it has given St. Andrew's Resource Centre a site from which to operate its construction skills programme free of charge.  We see real engagement at a local level on the ground because these services are community-based and, therefore, have access to funding for a variety of activities that might not be available to privately run or commercial providers.  That is the crucial transformative programme that is functioning so well under the current model.</p> <p> There are, therefore, real concerns that the changes will lead to a deterioration in levels of engagement, community involvement and community benefit.  The Minister referred to the ILDN.  It is seeking meaningful engagement on the advice secured from third parties on procurement, the financial model, the impact of citizens and the sourcing of funding for redundancies if they arise.  The network has reiterated concerns that the model proposed is an unsuitable for-profit model that has not been proven to work anywhere in the world, particularly for those who are distant from the labour market and who will need additional supports to become employed or to enter the labour market again.  The ILDN is concerned that the model is not evidence-based, has not been tested or piloted and has not received endorsement from academic researchers.  It is also concerned that it will transfer risks from the funder to the contract holder, thereby jeopardising not-for-profit community organisations not just at bid stage but also in implementation as there is considerable risk of operating at a loss that cannot be addressed by reserves or alternative income.  These are real concerns that highlight the difficulty not-for-profit community providers face in seeking to enter a competitive procurement process that is very likely to have the effect of favouring the bigger, for-profit providers, which, realistically, will have more experience in making these sorts of tender applications and will, therefore, bring very different kinds of measures to the table.  The Minister has said phase 2 will refer more to social value and social engagement.  That is welcome but it still does not go far enough in answering those valid concerns that have been expressed by so many entities, including F&oacute;rsa, SIPTU, the ILDN, the individual service providers, the CEOs of the services and, most importantly, those who are being given the chance to make transformative life changes through the work of the services.</p> <p> It is unsustainable to continue on the current trajectory.  I ask that the Minister consider, as the motion requires, suspension of plans to tender out services and consider, with her Government colleagues, supporting the motion, as we in Labour Party do.  The sector is united against the current trajectory and we ask that she listens to all those who are on the front line.</p></speech>

I thank Deputy Kerrane for tabling the motion.  It is timely, and I know it is appreciated hugely by the LES workers throughout the country.  Earlier, at the gates of Leinster House, we welcomed them from as far away as counties Mayo and Galway to Ballyfermot and County Meath.  They came from all over Dublin as well as from the west.  That goes to show the commitment these individuals have to the job they do.</p><p>I sometimes wonder when I am in this House what is really going on.  One of the Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies touched on this earlier.  I will quote many different people in my contribution.  The first I will quote is the Taoiseach.  Back in 2016, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin spoke in favour of the LES schemes in his constituency in Cork:</p> <blockquote> 	The reality is we're losing too many community public services.  More and more is being lost and it's being driven by a Government policy that does not value communities or public services...<br /><br />I want to invest in public services.  I want a Government that values communities ... and will protect the role of the Local Employment Service and other [such] schemes that we need operating on the ground. </blockquote>  <p>I could quote other members of Fianna F&aacute;il.  One famous one - we all know where he stands on this issue - is Deputy O'Dea, from Limerick who stated: &quot;I have always had instinctive reservations about the idea of the private sector being involved in job activation on behalf of the State, as there is obviously a conflict between the company providing the service, whose main objective is to make profit, and the needs of the individual whom the company is supposed to serve.&quot;  What is going on in this House that I can quote the Taoiseach and a leading, long-time member of Fianna F&aacute;il backing up the substance of the motion while the Minister stands there and tears apart what the LES stands for.  She might say that she is not doing that, that she is letting it out to privatisation but that she must do so because the Attorney General advised her as much.  What I cannot find in her speech is why the Attorney General gave her such advice and what prompted him to do so.  She did not tell us that.  It is not in her speech.  It is not clear why, when something is working and does not need to be fixed, she is breaking it up.  That is exactly what she is doing with the LES by putting it out to tender.</p><p>This is pure Fine Gael ideology and harks right back to Michael Noonan, when he was Minister for Finance, saying we must pick the low-hanging fruit first.  Fine Gael has not stopped picking the low-hanging fruit.  It is doing this with local employment schemes and it intends doing so with the local drugs task forces later this year.  We really need to check ourselves and see what is going on here.  The ideology that goes after the most vulnerable and the most marginalised is just not tolerable.  There is a sense of class snobbery from Fine Gael in that its members do not get what goes on in communities such as Cherry Orchard and Ballyfermot.  They do not understand it.  I will further quote from an LES worker, as this might put it up to the Minister:</p> <blockquote> 	Payment per client pushes those most vulnerable and distant from the labour market further down the list.  If we are dependent on payments for progressions, it only makes sense to focus on those that need little support to get employment.  So, who will focus on those with barriers to employment?<br /><br />The Minister has recently increased places on Community Employment, however, as referreals to CE are not financially beneficial to a service why would the service make such referrals.  Also, as CE also must meet targets and get participant into work, CE schemes will also be selective in who they take on the scheme.  Again, pushing those furthest from the labour market further down the list. </blockquote>  <p>I will have to finish sooner than I had thought because my colleague has arrived.  I will read out another quote.  I am not sure when this was written but it is by Seamus Feely, who worked in the office of the T&aacute;naiste.  He wrote a paper entitled, The Origins &amp;amp; Context of Local Employment Services, in which he stated:</p> <blockquote> 	In essence ... [local employment services have] grown out of recognition that there are no mechanical or 'quick fix' solutions to the problem of long-term unemployment.  The solution requires a considered and intensive response that takes full account of its complexity and the reasons for its persistence.  Its success will require all actors to work closely together to deliver a co-ordinated and person-centred service.  It will require flexibility in the nature and delivery of services and recognition that no one agency acting on its own can solve the problem. </blockquote>  <p>Finally, I recommend that the Minister, if she has not already done so, watches Ken Loach's film &quot;I, Daniel Blake&quot;.  It will put into context for her where this Tory-driven, privatised idea of tendering out local employment services and other needs of the most marginalised and the most vulnerable leads.  I recommend she watches that film because it shows the rabbit hole the Government is going down if it pushes forward with its proposal.</p></speech>

I do know that in many hard-pressed working-class communities across the State this will be seen as an important issue being debated.  For example, in my constituency, Cork North-Central, thousands of people's lives have been improved by the quiet and painstaking work of local employment services and job club workers down through the years.  It is not an exaggeration to say there are many people out there in our communities whose lives have been turned around by those workers.</p>  <p>  The Government's plan has two key components.  The first is to rip these services out of our communities.  There are six local services in Cork, which will be replaced by just one centralised office.  The second is to privatise the services.  The Government can huff and puff all it likes about how the existing services can compete through the tender process, but the proof of the pudding is in the eating.  There have been four competitive tendering competitions to date; the private sector has won out in half of them.</p> <p>In fact, the winners will tend to be not just private sector operators but big overseas private sector corporations who operate on a pure and unsentimental for-profit basis.  Local employment services that do win tenders will only do so on the basis of cost-cutting, job losses and redundancies.  Workers in the LES in Cork city have already been told as much.</p> <p> The argument the Government has no choice in the matter and is bound by a European directive will only wash with people who came up the Liffey yesterday in a bubble.  The legal advice provided by Arthur Cox that local employment services and job clubs cannot be considered external contractors in any sense by which that term is normally understood is compelling, given these services were fully integrated into F&Aacute;S and now the Department of Social Protection, and that has been the case for 25 years.</p> <p> A Fine Gael pro-privatisation agenda is being pushed here.  The fact it is being supported by both Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party is testament to the fact that Fianna F&aacute;il, a party that once had its ear to the ground in working-class communities, has lost it completely.  The radical image previously portrayed by the Green Party has also fallen by the wayside.  No faith can be placed in any of these parties.  Faith can only be placed in the strength of the workers' fight and the support they win from the communities.  The ballot for strike action in Offaly is a positive step.  When workers throughout the country step up the pressure on the Government on this issue, they will have my full support and that of all the People Before Profit-Solidarity Deputies.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-11-30a.401" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1628" speakername="Paul Murphy" time="20:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021113000045#TT00200"><p>Often in here, the Government accuses us in People Before Profit and Solidarity of being very ideological.  How else can the Government's approach to local employment services be described except as purely ideological?  The basic approach of the Government is what is the point of doing anything if it does not create a profit for some private company?  On the other hand, the essence of the work done by local employment services, those who work there and job clubs etc. is to provide a service for people and to assist people in getting into decent jobs.  It is what most people would perceive the purpose of social protection to be.  It should not be there to make profits.</p>  <p>  What is being prepared here is JobPath 2.  The estimated cost of JobPath was &euro;11,000 per successful participant.  There is a model of incentivisation not for people to end up with the best possible jobs and to be given every possible support possible, but instead for companies like Seetec and Turas Nua to make massive profit from the public.  People power and workers' power can defeat these attacks.  I welcome the ballot by Offaly local employment service workers, who were due to lose their jobs and are prepared to go on strike on 6 December and 7 December.  We need to build solidarity here.  The trade union movement should mobilise to protect the jobs.  If the Government can outsource these jobs, it will push to outsource more and more of our social welfare and protection services.  Workers' power needs to be mobilised in action against this.</p></speech>

I have had lots of engagement with people in local employment services since these proposed changes were published.  It is safe to say the changes have not been met with resounding approval by them.  One such email I received recently was from a lady in County Wexford who works at Wexford Local Development, WLD.  She pointed out that, on 9 November 2021, the Oireachtas committee published its report supporting the retention of LES, while on the same day the Department of Social Protection was hosting an online information session for prospective tenderers for employment services.</p>  <p>  Some of the main issues that were highlighted in the email I received are issues I have already represented in writing to the Minister's Department.  The Department did respond.  The issues include the following.  Impossible timelines have been set without any back-up plan to support long-term unemployed individuals who need one-to-one support.  Wexford is about to lose a highly regarded quality-assured local employment service.  The effects of this decision will be felt from 2022 onwards, when it will be too late to correct the damage.  The LES contractors have been informed they will only receive a six-month contract for 2022, then the service will end.  This service will be replaced by a model which will operate similar to the current JobPath, and with the price paid per client instead of a not-for-profit model.  If we look at what happened in the past as a good guide to future behaviour, we can see there is not sufficient time to have this in place by 1 July 2022.  For example, the JobPath request for tender was issued in December 2013 and successful bidders were only announced in July 2015, commencing operations in late 2015.  The uncertainty for the skilled local employment service staff throughout the country is extremely stressful.  Every day, LES staff professionally assist unemployed individuals to identify their strengths, develop new skills, boost confidence and find employment.  The feedback from clients keeps the LES positive, but the current cruel uncertainty is taking its toll.</p>  <p>  Wexford Local Development provides local employment services.  It is a not-for-profit organisation that was set up in the early 1990s to help those in long-term unemployment.  If the proposed changes are introduced, organisations such as WLD and others throughout the country will be placed in an invidious position.  They essentially have two choices.  They either tender for the LES or they do not tender.  If they tender, they will not be able to provide the service within their budget and therefore will be financially unsustainable because the costs are front-loaded.  If they do not tender for the LES, their main purpose for existence will be lost.</p>  <p>  Organisations such as Wexford Local Development have done fantastic work through their existence.  They have great experience in getting people back and ready for work and are invaluable to society from that point of view.  One of the key aspects of the work done by WLD is the time and effort it puts into helping those with special educational and employment needs to develop themselves into a position where they are ready for employment.  Under the new scheme, the time will not be available for such work and those who benefited from it will be lost in the system and will find it difficult to be in an employable position, possibly ever.  It can take up to two years to help get an individual ready for the world of work.  The new scheme only provides for a time period of 12 months.</p>  <p>  The other issue raised with me by members of Wexford Local Development is that the new scheme allows for a maximum of 438 clients per year for the entire county of Wexford.  To put that into context, there are currently nine guidance officers in Wexford, with a caseload of approximately 150 cases each, which represents 1,350 cases, not counting walk-ins.  A reduction of 900 cases is very concerning.  We cannot allow hundreds of people in need of employment support to slip through the net.</p></speech>

I thank Sinn F&eacute;in for bringing forward the motion.  In the past year I have received a huge amount of correspondence from people in my constituency, right across County Galway and the west, expressing their concerns, not least the local employment services workers.  They have highlighted to me that the new scheme will see the demise of the voluntary, non-profit local employment services.  It will also see the introduction of more for-profit ethos into the employment services.  I have heard all the speakers today, including the Minister, compliment the local employment services for what they have done in terms of the services they have provided.  The question has to be asked if there is an issue with these local employment services.  What are they doing that another organisation could do better, if they are doing it so well?  Often, we talk about people bringing in rules and regulations and wanting to improve structures and introduce more accountability.</p> <p>That sometimes gets lost because we introduce all of these systems, paper chasing and paper ticking exercises, and now computer ticking exercises.  People cannot go any place without a laptop or an iPad to make sure they have their paperwork up to date.  While the whole place could be falling down around them, the computer and the system is right.  We must look at this in a common-sense way.</p> <p> I refer in particular to JobPath.  Over my time as an elected representative I have received many representations from people who found that JobPath is actually depriving local community services of the ability to access participants for the schemes.  This is because JobPath is based on a numbers game and a particular way of doing things.  One incredible aspect is where people who are in their late 50s are being asked to go back on JobPath to train up for jobs they probably will never get.  We should be concentrating the employment services on the younger people in their 20s, 30s and 40s to make sure they gain sustainable employment into the future.</p> <p> The argument is always made that we must train people for employment.  There is no better way of training people for employment than by putting them out on a community employment scheme, a rural social scheme or a T&uacute;s scheme so they can actually interact with people.  They might end up finding a job before the scheme is finished, perhaps through their interview with a local man delivering the blocks or a load of fill from the quarry, and there is work available for them.  We need to make sure we get people employed rather than having the paperwork right.  I believe the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, understands where I am coming from with all of this.</p> <p> With this whole tendering process we may lose the local knowledge and we may lose the whole area where the local people know best and they know the local people.  Regionality is great, and it is great to read about the regionalisation of services.  The problem, however, is we will lose the common touch and the local feel.  We will lose the local interest.  We will have a service and a system whereby if we want to talk to somebody, we will not be able to ring them.  We will have to email them.  We will be back to the same old codology we had for a long time.</p> <p> I put it to the Minister that it is important to listen to what people are saying.  The trade unions are saying they are not happy with this.  I am aware the Minister has engaged, but further engagement is required.  She has said she cannot stop or suspend the tender process.  I ask the Minister to consider, whatever happens after this, that it is important the local employment services are available and used because of the asset they are for us in creating jobs.  We should not lose sight of that.  A huge amount of effort goes into lots of things and into creating something that will probably be no better than what is there already.  I have not heard one Member in the debate saying it is time to get rid of local employment services.  No one has said that.  Why do we try to fix something and change it when it is not actually broken?</p></speech>

Workers' representatives in local employment services and job clubs have been outlining their concerns about a new proposed tendering process for local employment services by the Department of Social Protection.  The trade unions SIPTU and F&oacute;rsa have said the process will lead to possible redundancies and a disruption in services as people return to work following the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>  <p>  The Department is arguing the range of service providers for the provision of employment services and supports for jobseekers in returning to the labour force fall within the provisions of Directive 2014/24/EU governing public procurement and must be procured through open competitive tendering.  The Department's argument rolls around a determination that to comply with the provisions of the EU directive governing public procurement, there needs to be a competitive procurement process for employment services contracts.  However, the Department of Social Protection seeking to tender the services will directly mean workers are now preparing to lose their jobs.</p>  <p>  The overarching objective of this Private Members' motion is to end the Government plan to privatise and greatly scale back local employment services.  Ultimately, many people believe that a tendering process will more likely suit private contractors who will provide a generic type of employment service.  The local employment service, LES, has been working in the community throughout Ireland for 25 years.  It means the structure of the scheme is aware of the barriers faced by people from disadvantaged areas and the service is familiar with the people it works with.  It is believed private contractors would not have same knowledge or experience of working with people within the community as the current community employment structures do.</p>  <p>  Some staff have already left their positions because of the insecurity around their future.  F&oacute;rsa and SIPTU unions who represent the workers are seeking the establishment of a stakeholder forum and a stay of execution on the public tendering process.  They say the Department has told them a tendering process is necessary because of EU law.  I ask the Minister to stop hiding behind the Attorney General.  This is the way and means around it.  There are ways and means around it if the Minister wants to try.  The Minister is, however, backed by Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party, and they have backed the Fine Gael agenda by doing this.</p>  <p>  The Department has said it is working to expand its provision of employment services capacity to deliver high-quality employment services that are designed to meet individual employment assistance and support requirements.  We believe the Government should abandon its plans to privatise the local employment services.  The new State-wide services expect to begin in January and it appears this will see the end of all job clubs and possibly many, if not all, local employment services.  Staff currently employed in these centres are understandably very worried about the prospect of losing their jobs.  The new proposed model will see the end of the not-for-profit, community-based, job activation service supports.  It will also see the end of walk-ins without referral, impacting on those furthest from the labour market, as well as carers and lone parents, alongside the existing wrap-around supports that are now more important than ever as we emerge from Covid-19.  </p>  <p>  The Minister has repeatedly said it is open to local employment services and job clubs to tender for the new model, but the majority are priced out from this tendering process.  The first tender saw a turnover requirement in the millions of euro with many LES and job clubs unable to take this financial risk.</p></speech>

I will be supporting this motion.  I honestly feel the services we have are good enough.  While perhaps at times they could have been better, I am very worried that what we will get will be worse.  When something is for profit, I am afraid the people who will suffer are those who are on the margins and seeking employment in trying to get going.  We know how people are fixed after the virus and the lockdowns.  Many people who had not recovered from the breakdown of the economy in 2008 and 2009 still need assistance.</p>  <p>  I put it to the Minister that if something is working well enough, why do we not leave it alone?  I give as an example Turas Nua, a company that was employed to deal with people in trying to get them back to work.  In reality it was about getting people off the dole, regardless.  It made it impossible for them.  I know of one young man who was about 30 miles from Tralee out on the side of a hill at Knocknagashel.  He had to thumb every Monday morning from his house, along the side of the main and dangerous road where many people have been killed, and go into Tralee to present himself, prove what he had been doing and who he had asked for employment.  This went on for more than 12 months.  Many people would not understand the torture this poor young fellow went through, only if they stood where he left to go into Tralee every Monday morning.</p>  <p>  I believe the Government should now abandon the plans to privatise local employment services.  Staff currently employed in these centres are understandably extremely very about the possibility of losing their jobs.  It will also see an end to people walking in without a referral.  Many people do not have a referral and that is how some of the services worked.</p> <p>The Minister has said it is open to local employment services and job clubs to tender for the new model.  The majority, however, will be priced out of this tendering service.  We have seen in the past where privatisation of job activity services like the disastrous JobBridge<b><font color="#5F5F5F"></font></b>scheme has failed.  That particular scheme has cost close to &euro;300,000 since 2015.<br/><br/>The local employment service is and was a vital service in communities throughout the country and is a far more holistic service than the standard profit-driven employment service.</p></speech>

If you had a death wish, you would not be doing more than what it is proposing to do here.  It has already been stated over and over again that if a system or something is not broken, why in the name of God would you want to go at it to fix it?</p>  <p>  I am proud of the work that is being done in County Kerry in the schemes there and in the way they have worked, organised their work and the way the walk-ins have been facilitated.  Walk-ins are a very important aspect of the employment opportunities that have been given to people over the years and I will explain why that is the case.  I am sorry and very surprised that nobody in Government seems to understand it.  It suits the people who work on schemes very well in many cases.  They are very talented in certain ways and the people who are organising the work can get the most out of those people because they can put them into situations that suit their own particular fields of expertise.  In every part of the county that I know, come from and represent in Kerry, we have people who are greatly talented in varying and different ways, and the schemes and the way they were organised suited them.</p>  <p>  This privatisation of the jobs activation services will be greatly detrimental to the excellent model that is there.  I will be very interested tomorrow night to see who will vote for the Sinn F&eacute;in motion, but more importantly I will be acutely watching who will be voting with the Government in this.  Any person who calls him or herself a public representative, a Teachta D&aacute;la, a messenger of the people, and who will come up here tomorrow night and vote against this motion, I will tell the House what they can be doing when they go back to their constituencies and I am laying it very clearly on the line to them.  They can explain to the people who voted them in and sent them up here why they thought this motion was wrong, why they thought it was unfounded, and only they can explain how they would go against the very people who sent them here in the first instance.</p>  <p>  This is really getting to the heart and soul of the nub of the issue of a Government being completely out of touch with reality.  I ask the Minister again to please publish any advice obtained from the Attorney General in respect of the need to comply with these EU procurement rules because she has failed to do so so far.  Sinn F&eacute;in would not be bringing forward this motion and would not have to if the Minister brought forward written advice and said this is why we are doing this.  She cannot and I do not see why she is not doing it.</p>  <p>  Again this is a kamikaze Government engaging in something that will have what I would call disastrous consequences for it.  We will account for ourselves here tomorrow night but how the Government will face the people after doing this, I do not know.  It is beyond me and I do not understand it.</p></speech>

Tonight we are speaking of the value of community-led local development, of community knowledge, response and support to our long-term unemployed.  The Minister&rsquo;s proposal will undermine this community approach and replace it with a for-profit model that will not put the unemployed person at its core.  This model will force the providers to provide inadequate services to those who so badly need good quality services with wrap-around supports that are tailor-made and services that facilitate their transition, often from long-term unemployment or underemployment, to a job that is suitable for them.</p>  <p>  One of the crucial aspects of the current scheme is that it is local and that people feel comfortable in approaching their local job club and local LESs.  The approach is informal.  Now, the focus will be much more commercial and the drop-in days will be long gone.</p>  <p>  Nobody is saying the current system is resistant to change.  It would welcome reform but two things should be noted.  The Committee on Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the Islands has asked the Minister to halt this process.  Why will she not do so?  Second, I have consulted job clubs and local development companies in Sligo, Leitrim and across the north west and they are very dissatisfied because they do not believe their views or those of the sector were taken on board in the consultations referred to by the Minister.  Was it a box-ticking exercise, the obligatory consultation process, and a case of we will do what we planned to do in the first place?</p>  <p>  I have spent long enough dealing with issues around the public procurement directive to know that member states are not under any obligation to contract out the provision of services they wish to provide themselves or to organise this by means other than by public contracts.  I remember very clearly the tendering of the last LEADER programmes, which was started by one of the Minister&rsquo;s predecessors, former Minister Phil Hogan.  It took a letter from the European Commission to ensure we had an open tendering process rather than the preferred Government option of local county development committees, LCDCs, running LEADER.  We know some governments, at least, have form when it comes to using European legislation to achieve their own policy objectives.  </p>  <p>  We have another European directive, the transfer of undertakings directive.  How will that apply to those who are currently working in job clubs and who may lose their jobs?  I put down a parliamentary question to the Minister on this very issue and she told me that in phase 1, it was likely those people would be employed by the successful bidders, with appropriate terms.  My question is: will that employment be on the same terms?  Can she guarantee this to those workers?  She said that in phase 2, should the possibility of redundancies arise, it will be the primary responsibility of the employer.  The Minister and I know the employers, namely, the current job clubs and LESs, have no resources whatsoever to provide any redundancy payments.  If that is the situation, will the Department stand up and fulfil its obligations to workers in Leitrim, Donegal, Roscommon and throughout the country under another European directive, the transfer of undertakings directive?</p>  <p>  I was not happy that the Minister in her comments said many Deputies would like to remain in this House irrespective of performance.  Obviously, she used this as a direct comparison to the current job clubs and LESs.  That is a very strong statement.  It is easy to have a go at Deputies in this House as she is on very safe ground there.  She is on thin ice, however, when it comes to making that comparison with those who spent ten, 15 or 20-plus years serving the most disadvantaged into employment.  Yes, job clubs are not perfect, but for the vast majority of people who work in those services, it is not a case of them wanting to remain in their jobs irrespective of performance.</p>  <p>  I must comment on Deputy Michael Healy-Rae&rsquo;s statement, and he will not mind if I quote him again when I say that I believe this is a kamikaze action on a system that works well.</p></speech>

I was greatly concerned to hear about the new tendering process that the Minister for Social Protection is introducing, which favours for-profit providers over the current community-focused non-profit providers.</p> <p>This will affect those working in local employment services and jobs clubs, who have been loyal to the service for years and whose livelihoods are now potentially at risk.  I have been contacted by staff in my constituency who are incredibly concerned.  Services in areas such as Donegal are ending on 31 December, with no plan in place for the demobilisation of those services.  This would be a huge blow to our community.  The staff there have been left in limbo as they have not been informed of any new job opportunities or any potential redundancy that may be offered.  It is completely unacceptable to have staff left in the dark, not knowing whether they will have a job in the new year.  The Minister obviously has no sympathy or care for the stress and anxiety this is causing people.  I urge her to give reassurances to those staff members as soon as possible.</p> <p> By allowing a tendering process for the provision of these essential public services, she is failing to recognise the crucial knowledge and skills of the staff in this sector to support jobseekers, particularly those furthest from the labour market.  This is particularly concerning at a time when youth unemployment is so high.  Both SIPTU and F&oacute;rsa have called for a halt to this process but have been met with silence from the Department and the Minister.  I completely disagree with allowing private companies to bid for State contracts.  How many times must we allow this to happen before we realise it just does not work?  We only have to look at the disastrous roll-out of fibre broadband to see that.  It is clear that privatisation does not work, including in the provision of community services.  I urge the Minister to commit to continuing to provide community-based, non-profit services to local jobseekers in our communities.</p></speech>

I know the Minister is busy but it is unfortunate that she did not wait for the end of this important debate.  The ideology is all on that side of the House, which is extraordinary given the constant jibes across the floor that we are ideologues.  This is a very moderate and reasonable motion.  It notes the commitment, hard work and professionalism of the people working in job clubs and local employment services.  The Minister did the same in her speech, before going on to endorse a model that will undo all of that professionalism.  The motion acknowledges "the importance and value that not-for-profit, community-based activation services provide for users".  The Minister, however, went on to say she is going down the for-profit route because, first, experience tells her it is better and, second, we have no choice but to do so under European legislation, without providing any evidence whatsoever to back up that statement other than the advice of the god who is the Attorney General.  We are not privy to that advice.  We cannot see it and are not even told its context.  We are simply told the advice has been received and the Minister is going right down that route.</p>  <p>  The Acting Chairman, together with Deputy Kerrane, is a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the Islands, which produced a report on this issue.  I had a priority question on it last week and I am glad of the opportunity to raise it again in this debate.  We have all read the committee report, which includes nine recommendations, some of which overlap with the motion.  It calls clearly on the Minister and the Government to see sense on this matter.  It recommends that the Department review JobPath once the referrals cease.  I will not read out all the recommendations but the last one asks that the Minister responds to the report.  Perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy Brophy, can tell us whether a formal response has gone back to the committee, which was unanimous in its recommendations.  I do not see any minority report or any member diverging from the opinion set out.  It is very unusual to have that happen with a cross-party committee.  Even in the case of Sl&aacute;intecare, there was some divergence, even though it was called an all-party committee report.  In this instance, nobody diverged from the opinion and the nine recommendations.  It places the democratic process in a very difficult position when a cross-party committee is pleading with the Minister not to take a particular action.</p>  <p>  The Minister, in her speech, acknowledged the wonderful work that is being done in this area but then undertook to do the opposite of what was recommended by the joint committee.  She is either trapped by the Department, trapped by an ideology or she fully endorses that ideology.  I know her as a very hard-working Minister and I have often praised her on the floor of the D&aacute;il.  She must see sense in this matter.  Everything needs to be paused.  If an all-party committee is unanimous in saying "pause", among nine recommendations in its report, then we have to listen.</p></speech>

The Minister, unfortunately, has had to leave, but she was in attendance, as Deputies would acknowledge, for the vast majority of the debate.  She spoke comprehensively on the Government's approach to the expansion of employment service provision and the extensive engagement with the sector.  I commend the quality of the employment services the Department of Social Protection currently contracts.  All these services are important in assisting people from all walks of life to progress towards employment.  They offer the necessary support and direction to persons requiring assistance to gain and sustain employment.  Each success, where a person gains employment, is not only important to that person, through enhanced self-esteem and financial independence, but it also benefits his or her family and the wider community.  For some, the journey to employment is longer than it is for others.  It is important that we have the right services in place at the right time, irrespective of the county in which people live.</p>  <p>  It has been heartening in recent weeks and months to see the continued fall in PUP recipient and jobseeker numbers as more people returned to work.  We recognise the important role local employment schemes and job club services play in our communities.  I want to make the next point clear for certain Deputies who, in effect, were close to misrepresenting our position.  The Government is not opposing this motion, only the spirit in which it was brought forward.  The fact remains, of course, that we cannot ignore the legal advice from the Attorney General.  Indeed, a number of Deputies who know very well what the legal situation is in respect of the Attorney General's advice chose to muddy that fact in their contributions.  They know the restrictions on the Minister in terms of what she can say on the Attorney General's advice.  As she outlined, the Government has no option on this matter.  The clear, unambiguous legal advice is that these contracts must be subject to a competitive procurement process.  The simple truth of the matter is that the State cannot bury its head in the sand and ignore its legal obligations.  It must, therefore, procure these employment services in an open and competitive manner.  However, we are doing so in a sensitive way that reflects the inherent strengths of the current providers.</p>  <p>  Several speakers talked about the need for engagement on this issue.  In fact, there has been very extensive engagement, including with SIPTU on up to six occasions since 2019.  In total, there have been 140-plus engagements.  The Government is working with people and engaging on the issue.  In that context, I welcome that the new regional employment service has as its heart the delivery of social value through the harnessing of community linkages.  The two-phase procurement process currently under way will deliver an expanded employment provision across the State that better supports the customer journey, sets real and achievable performance targets and ensures all contracts are placed on a sound legal basis.</p>  <p>  The motion cited the substance of the recommendations from the Indecon reports.  It is important to note that those reports also recommended the open and competitive procurement of services.  Surprisingly, or perhaps not surprisingly at all, that aspect was ignored by Sinn F&eacute;in in its motion.  Indeed, it was sad to hear one Deputy having a personal go at the Minister, slagging her off and comparing her to political figures in other countries.  As a credit union manager before she entered politics, she knows a lot about dealing with people and has a very good ethos to the way in which she does her job and helps people in need.  Some of the contributions were very disappointing in that regard.</p>  <p>  Local employment services and job club services have always, from a legal perspective, been contracted services.  As such, they are subject to public procurement rules.  I have read what the motion says concerning the new procurement directive and - I suspect, again, that it is wilful - there is a misunderstanding, as in some of the contributions, of what the directive requires.  On the basis of the legal advice received, there is no escaping the obligation to contract out the delivery of services in the context of services that have already been contracted out.</p></speech>

The Minister spoke earlier about the extensive engagement with the sector, as I mentioned, including visits to every provider and engagement with representatives from the sector.  Those engagements have been critical in the approach taken to expand an integrated, high-quality employment service model, while meeting the need to procure services in line with procurement law.</p>  <p>  Several </p> <p>The design of the regional employment service, which arose from stakeholder engagement, in particular with the ILDN, has been extensive and detailed and has been under way since 2018.  Its views, concerns and suggestions have been incorporated into the design of the regional employment service model.  </p> <p> The strong focus on quality of service provision, the social value element and the minimum pricing component all arise from engaging with the sector.  We must not forget it was ILDN delegates who repeatedly identified that they alone were uniquely placed to help those most distant from the labour market.</p> <p> Any reasonable person taking the time to consider what the Minister and Department have done in terms of the design of the regional employment service model and phase 1 procurement can see that it has been designed to enable community providers to compete fairly and ensure that the service is not focused on cost but rather on quality of provision.  The key features of the model include a banded pricing structure with a high minimum price, reflecting the actual cost of providing a high-quality service, while preventing uncompetitive predatory pricing.  The lot sizes are comparatively small, and I have already mentioned a very heavily weighted focus on social value and community linkages.  These are the facts.  I reflect what the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, is striving to deliver and how accommodating she has been to existing providers.  We know from phase 1 that the community and voluntary sector was successful in two of three lots where it submitted tenders.  This proves beyond doubt that it can compete successfully under this procurement model.  Indeed, where it submits high-quality bids it can and will win.  The Department is committed to taking on board the learnings from the first procurement and will seek to amend the phase 2 procurement process. </p> <p> We have heard many contributions regarding staff in local employment services and job clubs, with which I fully agree.  The motion refers to the number of staff in those services, with selective out-takes from the Indecon report.  We have also heard the condemnation of the JobPath service as poorly performing, with no mention of the over 480 staff employed in the JobPath service and their dedication to the people they are assisting, despite the Comptroller and Auditor General finding no issue with the JobPath service.  In an econometric review, the OECD found it compared to other services.  It supported more people into better paid employment, which lasted for longer.  </p> <p> Staying with the staff of existing services, I recognise that there is concern among staff about their employment.  However, from phase 1 we know that the community and voluntary sector competed successfully and I have no doubt this will be replicated in phase 2.  In the lots where the preferred bidder was from another sector, they have offered employment to the existing job club staff on the same terms and conditions, thereby removing the spectre of unemployment for those individuals.  This is a welcome development and ensures that staff can continue to work to provide employment assistance and advice to their communities.</p> <p> We all agree that employment services are delivered with professionalism by hard-working and committed staff across all of the different services that provide public employment services.  The Government is, through the two-phase procurement process, expanding the employment service provision across the State in a manner that seeks to retain its community ethos and procures these services in line with good governance requirements and on a sound legal basis.</p></speech>

I also want to put on the record the commitment and hard work of local job clubs and employment services.  In my constituency, they are located in Lucan, Clondalkin, Rowlagh and Bawnogue .  I have seen at first hand the dedicated work and valuable service they provide to my community.</p>  <p>  I spoke to stakeholders this week and I share some of their concerns.  They are concerned about the new for-profit employment service that is planned and the move away from a not for profit model.  This has Fine Gael fingerprints all over it, again resorting to the private market to provide public services.  This has failed miserably in respect of housing, water charges and bin collections, and will fail miserably with job activation models.  The Minister of State mentioned JobPath.  Some 400,000 people engaged with JobPath between 2015 and 2021, and only 26,000 found employment lasting over a year, at a cost of &euro;275 million to the Exchequer.  </p>  <p>  The new model will also exclude people with low-paid jobs in activation training that allows them to upskill and a better life for themselves, something which has not been mentioned.  We value the importance of not-for-profit community-based job activation programmes but because of the changes proposed, 40 job clubs could close their doors at the end of this month and 81 people could lose their jobs.  That is not job activation.</p>  <p>  My constituency office is based in an unemployment and training service on the Neilstown Road.  I see the daily benefits of people accessing not for profit training and job activation supports.  This is not a personal attack on anybody; rather, it is more of an ideological point.  Fine Gael is deploying Margaret Thatcher's Tory politics of attacking our communities.  Successive Government have deliberately eroded community development and attacked community resilience.  This is yet another attempt to disempower our community.</p></speech>

The Minister of State is making a mistake.  He is making the same mistake that was made when the home help services were destroyed through a similar type of model to that now being proposed.  Hours were cut.  The same happened to community development projects.  There are long-term consequences.  The Government swiped them away and we can now see the consequences in many inner city and rural areas.</p>  <p>  The Government is hiding behind legal advice.  I do not believe that the Department of Social Protection is under an obligation to offer services out to tender.  Services have been performed since before the European directive ever came into practice.  That is a fact.  Contracts of indefinite period entered into prior to the enactment of the procurement directive can fall outside of it.  The Minister of State is making a choice.  I would have more respect if the Minister of State, Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il stood up and said this is our decision, we are making it and this is why we are doing it.  They should stop hiding behind legal argument because it has been established in case law that there is precedence in terms of contracts that fall outside of the directive.  The Minister of State is doing this knowing how it will destroy communities.  He needs to own this decision.</p></speech>

I have listened to the workers, spokespersons for the ILDN and LES managers.  I sat in a committee on many a morning and listened to them clearly outline why this will be a disaster for communities, in particular those most at risk and those who are vulnerable.  There is no doubt about it.  People on the ground have said they will be left behind.</p>  <p>  I call on the Minister of State to protect the not-for-profit and community-based ethos of community employment services and to suspend all of the plans to issue tenders for employment services.  It is important to hear the words of people who have been working in the area and have run these services for 20 years or more.  </p>  <p>  New models of employment services are being rolled out without any forum having been established that researches and scopes out the best model of employment services for those outside of the labour market.  This removes any element of choice from citizens of the service.  Everyone, regardless of whether they are on the live register, will be required to access public employment services only through the Department of Social Protection in the first instance.  </p>  <p>  The model proposed by the Department is unsuitable and for-profit and has not been proven to work anywhere in the world for those who are distant from the labour market.  It is not evidence based.  It has not been tested or piloted.  It has not received the endorsement of any academic researchers, the Labour Market Advisory Council, the Labour Employer Economic Forum, LEEF, or the Oireachtas committee that I sit on.  </p>  <p>  Those who have commented have rejected the approach.  The proposed model transfers risks from the fund to the contract holder, thus jeopardising not-for-profit community organisations, not just at the bid stage but in its implementation.  It transfers the potential future risk of substantial redundancy costs if future contracts are not secured after the initial term.  I urge the Minister of State, at this late stage, to listen not just to us but to those who have decades of experience in this area.</p></speech>

The Government is getting rid of the current services that exist in the local employment services and the job clubs.  The Minister said my reference to the Indecon report was selective.  Yes, the Indecon report put forward open procurement, but where did it refer to the change in model?  That is the problem.  If the legal advice and the EU procurement laws are correct and the Minister is right, that does not suggest a change in the model.  The problem is that the Minister is moving from a not-for-profit to a for-profit model and taking these employment services out of the community.  That is a fact.  It is ridiculous to come here and commend them while taking the services away, with people set to lose their jobs.</p>  <p>  The Minister also pushed forward the legal advice.  She spoke about it for ages in her contribution.  Again, so what if that is the legal advice.  I do not take or accept that, but if it was, it does not say that the model should be changed.  Why is the Minister changing the model?  We have we not been told why the model is being changed.  Surely that would be the first thing she would say.  It is a joke that the Government will support this motion, which calls for suspending the tendering, when it knows it is not going to do that.  Why support it?  I must add that it is a disgrace there is no Fianna F&aacute;il Deputy here this evening.  The Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies have gone to these people in their communities and given them their support, then they come up to Dublin and do not even have the manners, or the respect for those services and staff, to show up here in the first place.  It is incredible.</p>  <p>  Local employment services and job clubs are not against procurement.  We know that.  We see it in the social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP, and the tendering process there.  The Minister referred to JobPath.  Two or three years ago, a motion was passed in the previous D&aacute;il to end JobPath.  It was not just Sinn F&eacute;in talking about it.  After almost six years, the programme has a 7% success rate.  How is 7% a success, with &euro;275 million of taxpayers' money?  The Minister said phase 1 was not based on cost.  If one did not have an annual turnover of between &euro;1.2 million and &euro;1.9 million, one was failed.  It was a pass or fail, and that was game over.  Can the Minister of State tell me how it was not based on cost?  He cannot do so.</p>  <p>  As regards social value and community linkages, what social value and community linkages did Seetec and Turas Nua put forward?  They have none.  How did they pass that part of the procurement process?  Again, the Minister of State has not been able to answer those questions.  Not one stakeholder supports what is being proposed.  The Minister can talk repeatedly about all the consultations and engagements she has had.  She should have been involved directly in many more of them rather than her departmental officials.</p>  <p>  I will conclude by saying that the cross-party committee, including Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and Green Party members of the committee, put forward the report, with no objection, stating that the job clubs and local employment services should remain as they are.  They could have been expanded.  If there were issues with job clubs not reaching targets, they could have been identified, highlighted and resolved.  The model as is could have been procured with no problem under the current model.  That was not the decision the Minister chose.  She talked rubbish both about legal advice and in commending and complimenting the staff.  That is no good to the more than 388 staff.  The Minister talked about disservice to JobPath staff, but the staff in job clubs and local employment services have been treated disgracefully.  It is a huge disappointment.  I am disappointed that the Minister is supporting the motion, but is willing to do nothing.  That is even worse.</p></speech>

Between fees, rent and transport, students are finding it very hard to make ends meet.  Many of them have been in contact with my office after hearing announcements or reading headlines stating that more funding is being made available.  Can the Minister clearly set out the increases in expenditure from the last academic year to this one in the areas of Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, the student assistance fund and mental health supports?</p></reply>

Obviously, the support and well-being of students are a major priority for me and my Department.  They are a major priority for all Members of the House and we have endeavoured to reflect that in the significant steps to increase funding for this purpose.</p>  <p>  Like the Deputy, I am very conscious of the pressures on students, including those arising from the pandemic as well as from increased costs of living.  As I will outline, I have secured significant funding to support the student population this year, for students in financial difficulty as well as for students who require mental health supports, disability supports or assistance for items such as laptops.  In fact, my Department will spend over &euro;400 million on student supports in 2021, including the student grant scheme which assists approximately 74,000 students annually to access third level education.  This includes the implementation of measures I introduced in last year's budget to provide greater support to postgraduates in the SUSI scheme from the current academic year onwards.</p>  <p>  I have also secured a comprehensive package of financial supports for the higher education and further education and training sectors to mitigate the impact of Covid in the current academic year.  Funding of &euro;3 million to underpin well-being and mental health and student services in our higher education institutions was secured.  This was in addition to the &euro;2 million that had been allocated in the budget.  An additional &euro;20 million was provided for the SUSI student grant scheme to mitigate the impact of Covid-19 through increased levels of demand.  I have doubled the student assistance fund over the last two years to ensure students have support if they fall on hard times.  This will provide &euro;17.2 million for financial assistance to students experiencing financial difficulties while attending higher education.  That figure was &euro;8 million when I took office less than two years ago.  A specific provision has also been made in the student assistance fund for part-time students who are lone parents or members of other priority access groups under the national plan for equity of access to higher education.</p>  <p>  The student assistance fund is available to assist students who are unable to meet costs associated with day-to-day participation in higher education, including books, class materials, food, essential travel, childcare costs, medical costs and family difficulties such as bereavements.  I believe these critical measures will assist many students.</p></speech>

In October 2020 he announced an additional &euro;20 million for SUSI which was very welcome.  The Department spent the same amount on SUSI in 2020 as it had in 2019.  We are on track for a slight increase in 2021, but nowhere near the &euro;20 million announced in his first budget.  Last month, he announced an additional &euro;35 million for SUSI but only in response to my question did he clarify that this would in fact be an increase of &euro;15 million next year because it would not kick in until September.  I urge him to bring forward the measures he announced for SUSI to take immediate effect, particularly increases to the SUSI maintenance grant.  Expecting students to wait until next September does nothing to address the cost-of-living issues they are facing now.</p></speech>

I can set the criteria and I can improve the criteria, but ultimately it is a demand-led scheme.  Money can only be drawn down from that scheme where applicants qualify for that scheme.  As of 21 November, just a few days ago, SUSI had received almost 97,000 applications.  Almost 94,000 of them have been assessed of which 74,600 have been assessed as eligible for support for this year.  This is SUSI's tenth year in operation.  I share the Deputy's view that the SUSI scheme needs an overhaul.  I expect to receive the report of the SUSI review group probably by Christmas.  That group contains student representatives, Department of Social Protection representatives, and representatives of the universities and institutions.</p>  <p>  I notice the Deputy's reference to headlines.  This is real money.  Some 17,000 additional laptops were provided free of charge to students in higher education.  There is extra badly needed funding for mental health services with a doubling of the student assistance fund now in place.  It was &euro;8 million when I took office and is over &euro;17 million this year.</p></speech>

It is important that it is published immediately so that things can come into effect for next year.  The Minister can see how people get lost in the millions and millions, double counting of figures and all that.  People feel they are left behind in all of the millions.  In July, as part of the package for the safe return to campus, the Minister announced an extra &euro;10 million in financial supports for students and &euro;3 million for mental health services on campus.  A similar announcement was made in the same week as the budget last month.  I welcomed these commitments at the time because I know the difficulty many students are facing.  It now seems that instead of the &euro;10 million extra that was announced there will be &euro;1 million less than last year in the student assistance fund for this year.  Instead of the &euro;3 million in additional funding on mental health services, there will be no increase at all.  Six colleges, Technical University Dublin, Munster Technical University, Waterford Institute of Technology, Dundalk Institute of Technology, Letterkenny Institute of Technology and Institute of Technology Carlow, will receive less this year for mental health services than last year.  Students need clarity on this.</p></speech>

Tomorrow I will meet all student union presidents throughout the country in a meeting convened by the Union of Students in Ireland, USI.  We regularly and I personally engage with student unions.  I take the point about the millions.  It is peculiar for the Deputy to suggest that because we are providing such a large amount of funding, it is difficult to navigate.  I am saying to student unions on the ground and to college presidents that when we allocate money here in Dublin it is important that a conversation about how that is spent on the college campus involves students.  Taking the mental health funding as an example, we have allocated an additional &euro;3 million.  This is real hard-earned taxpayers' money announced in the budget.</p>  <p>  We are asking the college presidents to engage with the students' union to decide how best to spend that money in their college campus because that will vary from college to college.  While I do not suggest there is not more that we need to do, by any fair metric more than &euro;400 million being spent this year on student supports is a very large sum of money and represents a significant increase.  Since this new Department has been established, students have been able to draw down from many more funding streams.  I look forward to the SUSI review which will be instrumental in addressing the reforms required.</p></speech>

Students being able to demonstrate in a socially distanced and Covid-appropriate way is an important part of students highlighting issues of concern to them.  I thank the Deputy for her question.</p>  <p>  I have engaged closely with student representatives on issues concerning the costs of higher education.  USI will concur on that point.  We have agreed to a schedule of monthly meetings.  Tomorrow, I have a meeting with student union presidents from throughout the country.  We are in regular and ongoing dialogue with the USI and with student unions around the country.  In advance of the current campaign and protest, I met USI officers in my Department to discuss issues, including funding options for the higher education sector and how students most in need are supported.</p>  <p>  It is not often highlighted that at present State supports mean that an estimated 45% of students are eligible for free tuition fees.  In other words, not every student in this country pays the registration fee and a very significant proportion do not.  As I said in response to the previous question, in 2021, we will spend more than &euro;400 million on student supports, including supporting 74,000 students through the student grant scheme.</p>  <p>  I am extremely aware of the rising cost of living and of the student accommodation crisis.  I am often expected to stand up here as a Minister and explain away the challenge, but I have no interest in doing that.  The model for student accommodation is broken.  We have been too reliant on the private market.  In politics it is important to put up one's hand when a policy is not working and concede that point.  The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage and I are working and will work with student unions to put in place college-owned affordable accommodation.</p>  <p>  Until Housing for All was published, a technological university or an institute of technology could not borrow a cent to build student accommodation.  I recently went to DCU.  It has an opportunity to build many more student accommodation places, but it needs a model that works.  The Minister of State, Deputy Niall Collins, was there with me.  I would like to see a cost-rental model put in place for students and for colleges.  In the new year, I expect to bring forward proposals on this.  A working group, chaired by my Department, is working on it.  I will come back with more details in a moment.</p></speech>

I have seen the figures for students' eligibility for free fees and I very much welcome the increase in the SUSI maintenance grant and the Minister's commitment to having that review completed by Christmas as well as his acknowledgement that the SUSI scheme needs overhaul.</p>  <p>  As the Minister said, the issue of student accommodation is not new.  For far too long, we have had an over-reliance on the private rented sector which clearly does not have the capacity to deliver accommodation for students.  It costs between &euro;7,000 and &euro;11,000 per year for accommodation on campus in UCD and in Trinity.  These are exorbitant costs for students.  At the protest last week, we heard stories of students who are commuting several hours to college each day, students who are sharing unsuitable cramped spaces due to unaffordable rent and competing with young professionals for scarce beds in Irish cities.  Developments designated as so-called student accommodation are out of reach for them.  We should not forget the plight of PhD and other postgraduate students who are suffering as a result of cost-of-living increases.</p></speech>

We have seen the first increase in the postgraduate SUSI grant.  We have seen the first general rise in the student support scheme that the Minister of State, Deputy Niall Collins, and I introduced in the budget.  We have seen the threshold increase so that more families qualify and the adjacency requirements reduced so that more families will qualify.  I am not suggesting that is everything we need to do, but those are four concrete measures that will ensure more families qualify for a student support and will increase the amount that every student in receipt of student support is receiving for the first time in over a decade.</p>  <p>  The broader issue of registration fees and having sustainable funding model has been kicked around this House for far too long.  In the last Oireachtas an all-party committee asked for an economic evaluation.  My predecessor asked DG REFORM in the European Commission and Indecon to carry that out.  I have now received that report and it is my intention to brief the Cabinet committee next month.</p> <p>I expect to be able to bring forward proposals shortly thereafter.<br/><br/>On the cost of student accommodation, the Deputy is correct that any conversation about access to cheap money or borrowing must be matched by a commitment to ensuring that is an affordable rate of rent.  I have no interest in providing access to State borrowing if it is not affordable for students.</p></speech>

As he said, the matter has been kicked around for too long.  The Cassells report is now five years old and it was supposed to be the blueprint for reform.  Labour certainly wants to see the State taking up the challenge in one of those three options in the report; we want to see that option rather the option of fees or loans.  It is welcome to hear there will be progress and the Cabinet will be briefed on this in December.  Will the Minister say what option from the Cassells report is likely to be taken up by the Government and how will this have an impact on students who are already paying &euro;3,000 as a student contribution charge, which is, in effect, the highest fee in the EU?  We can contrast that with &euro;170 in France and no fee in Germany or Denmark.  I am conscious the Union of Students in Ireland called for a reduction in the budget but it was not included in the overall package.  The Minister has outlined welcome measures with the likes of increases in the SUSI grant and so forth but there is still the lack of clarity over what the funding model for third level will be and the future of the student contribution charge or student fees more generally.</p></speech>

We certainly will not implement the system that the UK and Northern Ireland has for student loans.  I do not believe in them or that they work.  I have yet to see a country that has implemented this successfully.  I also do not like the concept because it could have an adverse impact on people from socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds, who tend to be more risk-averse in taking on debt.  I do not support that.  I cannot go further only to say we should settle the question.  We have had enough all-party committees and we must move forward on this.</p>  <p>  The Union of Students in Ireland, USI,  and others have called for a reduction in the student registration fee and it would probably have been a politically popular act.  I had to make the decision and I made the point to the USI very publicly and clearly.  I thought in the first instance we should look at some things that had not been done in a long number of years that directly affect the most disadvantaged students in our country.  I am sure the Deputy as a social democrat would agree with the increasing of access of those most in need, whether they are students from the Travelling or Roma communities, students with disabilities or students from socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds.  These are the measures we have taken in the very first instance but we want to do more and build on this.  We want to ensure cost is never a barrier for anyone entering third level.</p></speech>

Higher education and research and further education and training, including apprenticeship have been confirmed and reconfirmed by the Government as an essential service in the course of the pandemic.  They continue, therefore, to take place on-site, consistent with the safe return plan published by my Department last June and endorsed by the Chief Medical Officer.  There is no medical or public health advice from the National Public Health Emergency Team or the Chief Medical Office to suggest any level of on-site activity planned, including exams, should now be moved online.  Since the start of the pandemic and whether I was Minister for Health or in this role, I have always believed in following the public health advice.</p>  <p>  On Friday, 19 November, I met sectoral and stakeholder bodies through our Covid-19 steering committee, including the Union of Students in Ireland, and the question of end of semester examinations was discussed.  The USI emphasised the requirement for consistency in approaches and the provision of appropriate options for students and learners.  Due to the diversity of our higher education institutions and the very broad range of activities they undertake and different contexts and requirements applicable to exams, it was agreed that a "one size fits all" approach would not be appropriate across the whole of higher education or the third level sector more generally.  It was also agreed that the basic principle of risk assessment and the application of appropriate precautionary measures would also apply.</p>  <p>  Management bodies confirmed at the meeting that they are putting in place a range of approaches to ensure that end of term examinations will be safe and that the requirements of students who may have Covid-19, be a close contact or have an underlying health condition can be addressed.  It was also pointed out that there are some examinations, such as those related to external accreditation, that are very challenging to change to an online format at short notice.</p>  <p>  The outcome of the meeting was that individual higher education institutions will assess the appropriate approach to exams consistent with the outcome of their risk assessments since they returned to campus.  Timely engagement and consultation with student and staff representatives has a very important role to play and in all instances, public health must remain a priority.  To be clear, if a student is not able to attend an exam in person due to Covid-19, being a close contact or having an underlying health condition, I expect and am assured that alternative arrangements will be put in place.  That may be a deferral or, in some cases, online accommodation.</p></speech>

I spoke to a number of students from Waterford last night who were told they cannot be facilitated in doing their exams remotely.  The issue here is that students do not feel safe or comfortable entering an exam hall with hundreds of other students and students do not want to defer these exams.  Many of them depend on working through the summer to pay for college and they cannot afford the cost of deferring.</p>  <p>  Living situations, health status and many other factors vary from student to student.  Some have underlying conditions and others live with vulnerable family members so it is unfair and unjustified that students are given no option in this position when Covid-19 numbers are high.  There must be scope within examinations for alternative arrangements for students who for whatever reason do not feel comfortable attending mass indoor exams, even if they are scheduled to go ahead.  These students need the Department to demonstrate leadership on the matter and we must really send a message from here tonight that these students must be accommodated.  I will explain further why this is so as we debate the matter.</p></speech>

I said to her then what I will say now, albeit in a different context.  Everything must be done in the context of public health and the framework we have agreed with all stakeholders, including students, their union and, crucially, the Chief Medical Officer.</p>  <p>  The return to on-campus education has gone very well, although it has not been a straight road without hiccups.  I spoke with students in Maynooth last night and they want consistency and clarity about what is happening with the exams in their institution.  I believe, as a result of our stakeholder meeting on 19 November, there is now an understanding in the approach being taken.  The Deputy has made me aware of individual examples and I am very happy to follow up on them.  However, the approach we are taking is that what is safe to carry out on-site and in person will continue, with accommodation and flexibility being shown to students for whom it is not possible to partake in on-campus activity.  The Deputy is correct that different institutions will act differently in this scenario, which is okay or right because they must risk assess their own campuses, as they have done with lecture theatres etc. since the recommencement of on-campus activity in September.</p></speech>

Are we really saying it is okay to tell students who are unable to leave their home or who are a close contact that they will have to repeat an exam in August?  This will not only result in the punishing of students who follow public health guidance but incentivise some in not adhering to public health advice.  I am concerned about that.  Too often the response has been reactive rather than proactive.</p>  <p>  Students are also being asked to submit medical certificates, costing up to &euro;50.  They may be doing exams on 23 December in a hall but have vulnerable parents or other people at home.  They deserve a Christmas as well.  They may be two hours or more in a hall with many other students, putting themselves at risk.  Having windows and doors open is not conducive to doing exams.  I ask the Minister to please look at this again because it is causing heightened anxiety among students and their families.</p></speech>

I will not decide on the floor of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann that I will move exams online because I do not control the decision and institutions are autonomous.  Additionally, such a decision is not in our space, and as politicians and public representatives our role is to put in place the framework endorsed by public health.  That has been working well.</p>  <p>  It is entirely correct - I do not view it as an inconsistency or inappropriate - that different institutions must make different calls on this because they have different facilities available.</p> <p>That has been the case since the return to on-site activity.  That is where our colleges differ very much from our schools in the size of examination halls, the potential for some exams to take place online and the potential for others not to.  I am satisfied our institutions are applying public health advice to their facilities.  I fully agree with the Deputy's point that maximum flexibility, common sense and accommodation must be shown to students who, for appropriate health reasons, cannot attend an exam on-site.  I could not agree more with the Deputy on that and I will work with her if there are any examples where that is not the case.</p></speech>

I know Rome was not built overnight, but if one lived in Dublin 8 one would swear that student accommodation, built by corporate developers that charge up to &euro;1,800 to live in it for 8 months, was built overnight.  It is all over the place.  It is totally owned by corporate developers and is very expensive so that only the very wealthy or overseas students can afford it, or if they cannot be let, a change of use is sought for them.  What will the Minister do about it?  Where will we accommodate students because they are being pushed completely out of the market?</p></reply>

The first thing the Union of Students in Ireland asked us to do - I think the Deputy co-sponsored legislation on this - was to change the rule so that a student renter could not be asked to pay four, five or six months' rent up front, which was happening.  The law is now very clear.  One month's rent up front and one month's deposit is the maximum amount anyone can be charged.  The second thing the Union of Students in Ireland and the Deputy's legislation asked us to do was to make sure that students in purpose-built student accommodation only had to give 28 days' notice if they had to leave their accommodation for family or whatever reasons.  We took both of those requests on board.</p>  <p>  The Union of Students in Ireland, Opposition and Government Deputies and college authorities have told us that the next step must be a new model for student accommodation.  I will not stand here and say the model we have at present is working, because it is not.  I will be honest in that we need to put in place a new model and we need college-owned affordable accommodation.  In my answer to Deputy Bacik, I outlined how I intend to do that.  We have set up a working group with the colleges, between the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and my Department, to consider what the new model will look like.  I would like to see a cost rental model that works for students put in place.  I genuinely believe that could make a substantial difference.  What we will not do is provide cheap access to State borrowings, if we do not get an assurance from a university that there will be an affordability piece as well, because we have seen too much college-owned accommodation that is beyond affordable.</p>  <p>  I expect to bring forward a new model of student accommodation in the new year.  I have already told institutions to prepare their pipeline of projects.  I will give the Deputy one example, namely, the Technological University Dublin, which is either the first or second largest institution in the State.  It does not own one student room because until now it has not been able to borrow under various borrowing frameworks.  We are changing that through the Housing for All strategy.  I am saying that we need to change the model.  We need to build a lot more college-owned affordable accommodation.  We delivered on the two request that were asked of us by the students' unions and Opposition Deputies last year, and we will work with Deputies on this too.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-11-30a.457" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1486" speakername="Br&iacute;d Smith" time="21:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021113000053#BBB00600"><p>I am glad the Minister referred to college-owned and affordable accommodation because the Union of Students in Ireland is not the only student group protesting.  University College Dublin student groups have been protesting about a 20% to 30% increase in accommodation costs.  They are being charged &euro;1,400 for 8 months.</p>  <p>  The Minister mentioned the cost rental model and I am curious as to what he means by that.  In the Government's homes for all Bill, cost rental is defined as 25% below the market value.  If this is the Minister's vision of cost rental, all he is doing is subjecting students to the diktat of market, albeit 25% below the market value.  The market value will inevitably go up, therefore, the cost of accommodation will go up.  I look at the number of students from my area in Dublin 10, where something like 16% of all young people get to college.  The figure is 99% in Dublin 6 and Dublin 4.  There is a huge disparity.  It is reflected in the wealth and poverty of students and it is even deeper when one tries to educate people who come from economic backgrounds where they cannot afford these prices, costs and fees of books, IT equipment, travel and everything that goes with it.</p></speech>

The Deputy has asked me a very direct question in what I mean as to the cost rental model.  A number of our higher education institutions currently hold existing lands on which purpose-built, college-owned student accommodation could be developed.  In these cases, development of this would unlock land that would otherwise be unavailable for the provision of housing.  Further, the required specification of student accommodation has the potential to make it more cost-effective than other types of development.  The potential for access to affordable accommodation to become a barrier to access to education creates a social imperative to increase the supply of affordable student accommodation.  In this context there is an opportunity to utilise supports under the Housing for All strategy to enable higher education institutions to increase the provision of affordable student accommodation.  The cost rental model deployed by housing with regard to social housing considers costs associated with development of financing, management and maintenance.  It models it over 40 years to determine a one-year rental value and a scheme known as cost rental equity loans is also operated.</p></speech>

We cannot do that immediately but there are some things we can do immediately which would help to alleviate student poverty, one of which would be to scrap the registration fees.  All fees could be scrapped and the Government could cough up and make sure we get the quality training, education and skills we need for the future workforce.  We need that in every area.  It is way too expensive for people to do postgraduate courses.  It is way too expensive for most of the cohort I referred to earlier to go to college.  Apprentices have to pay fees and we are screaming out for people to move into the construction industry to retrofit homes.  These sorts of exorbitant fees on training and education could immediately be scrapped, whereas the houses will take a long period of time to build, and that could contribute to them being able to afford the accommodation they need.</p></speech>

I am genuinely excited about the prospect that this could be a new beginning for student accommodation.</p>  <p>  On the issue of cost and affordability, I made the point that I have prioritised the additional funding my Department received into targeted supports in the first instance, such as student grants that had not been increased in more than a decade and income thresholds that had not been increased.  It is now true, and is sometimes not said, that somebody with an income of more than &euro;50,000 can qualify for student grants in this country.  Around 45%, nearly half of students, access the free fees and are not subject to registration fees.</p>  <p>  We have also abolished the levy to do a post-leaving certificate course in the last budget.  We are implementing a number of measures.  I accept the Deputy will argue that we need to go further and quicker, and I take that point.  We have taken a number of significant steps to address the issue of affordability and ensure there is education for all in this country at third and, indeed, fourth level.</p></speech>

However, the glaringly absent piece of this jigsaw is the north east, and its sole higher education provider Dundalk Institute of Technology, DkIT.  Four years ago, DkIT was a leading force in the TU project.  What is the likely timeline by which the DkIT will take its rightful place in a once-in-a-generation, State-wide transformation of higher education?

I assure him that the north east will not be left behind.  I would have been delighted had I received an application from the north-east institute to become a technological university.  I am sure the Deputy and I share that real and palpable frustration as to why when a number of other institutes of technology came together with other institute of technologies to put together their bid, none came from DkIT.  That is a frustration we jointly share.  Institutions need to apply to become a technological university.</p>  <p>  At the outset, I wish to recognise sincerely the important contribution Dundalk Institute of Technology has and continues to make to Dundalk, Louth, the north east and the Border region since its establishment.  In order to achieve further progress in realising the ambitions and potential of the north east, I remain strongly committed to seeking to enable DkIT's participation within a technological university agenda.</p> <p>However, as I have said, it is very important to recognise that, consistent with the autonomy of all higher education institutions in the State and the law we passed in this House, it is a matter for the institution itself to determine its strategic direction.  This discretion must, of course, be exercised in light of the legislative options available.</p> <p> In specific terms, under section 38 of the Technological Universities Act 2018, an institute of technology and an established technological university may jointly apply to me, as Minister, for an order transferring the functions of the institute of technology to the technological university.  I understand that Dundalk Institute of Technology is pursuing such a path.  From our previous meetings, the Deputy will know that I have provided specific funding through the Higher Education Authority, HEA, under the technological university transformation fund.  I have also provided the expert advice of Dr. Ruaidhri Neavyn, who will work with the institute to get it where it needs to be in this regard.</p> <p> I assure the Deputy of my absolute commitment and determination to support Dundalk Institute of Technology on its journey and to work with the Deputy and other Oireachtas colleagues in Louth to make this happen.  As a Border region, the area has great potential.  We see that already but there is an opportunity to go much further and to harness that potential.  I encourage everybody in the institute of technology to work on this matter, knowing that they have our full support on this strategic direction.</p></speech>

There is no doubt that the technological university project is transforming higher education across the State.  With the recent announcements of the Technological University of the Shannon, the technological university for the south east and the Atlantic technological university, the national jigsaw the Minister has described is almost complete.  I will mention again that the missing piece of the jigsaw is the north east.  As the Minister knows, the sole provider of higher education in the north east is Dundalk Institute of Technology.  There are more than 6,000 students and more than 500 staff members in the institute.  Some 80% of the students who have attended it are part of the first generation of their families to attend third level education.  It creates many thousands of jobs in the north east, attracts lots of multinational companies and helps SMEs to get the qualified people they need.  Dundalk Institute of Technology is the life and soul of the north east.  Only four years ago, the institute of technology was a leading force in the technological university project.  The north east badly needs to be part of this exciting project.  The area cannot be left behind.  Will the Minister reassure me that Dundalk Institute of Technology is part of the technological university project?</p></speech>

However, I am delighted that Dundalk Institute of Technology has indicated in both its strategic plan and its engagement with the Higher Education Authority that it now has a clear intent to grasp the opportunity provided by the Technological Universities Act to further advance its contribution to the economic, social and cultural development of the north east.  To this end, all stakeholders in the institute of technology support the governing body's ambition to become a significant campus of a multi-campus regional technological university as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  The HEA, my Department and I are supportive of these ambitions.  In this regard, we have funded a special expert adviser to assist Dundalk Institute of Technology in its endeavours.  I am also delighted to say that it has made significant progress in achieving its ambitions, including through the establishment of a Dundalk Institute of Technology technological university, TU, project group, a TU project steering group of the governing authority and a technological university transformation fund operational project group.  It has also secured funding of &euro;2 million from the HEA to assist it in this regard.  We are fully committed to working with the institute on this matter.</p></speech>

It was established in 1971 and has 6,000 students and 500 staff, as I mentioned.  The institute now needs to be part of the TU project.  The Minister said there was a problem.  If there is a problem, I would appreciate it if he and the Department would sort it out because, at the end of the day, the people who are losing out are the students, their parents and the prospective students.  I really urge the Minister to get involved.  As I said, the institute was at the top of the list four years ago but, all of a sudden, it is not on the list at all.  There are three grades.  The institute seems to be at the bottom, in the third grade.  I plead with the Minister.  We are in a Border area in the north east.  It is a big thing that 80% of the students attending the college are the first generation of their family to do so.  This means that people who do not normally get an opportunity to attend college are getting an opportunity.  I appeal to the Minister to come down and talk to those in Dundalk Institute of Technology.  I know he has put projects and so on in place but we need his help to get into a TU.</p></speech>

He asked me what the problem is.  The problem is that the institute has not applied.  The truth of the matter is that it did not apply when all of the other institutes did, for whatever reason.  That was the institute's choice.  I am really pleased that people right across the institution, including staff, students, the governing authority and management, now want to be part of this agenda.  I welcome that.  I also welcome the Deputy's personal commitment and the cross-party commitment that I believe exists in Louth on this matter.  We had a very good meeting of Oireachtas Members and I would be delighted to have another.  I would be delighted to come to Dundalk to meet staff, students and representatives of Dundalk Institute of Technology.  I emphasise that but I am involved.  We have provided funding and an expert adviser but everyone needs to be involved to make this happen.  No one will be happier than me - with the possible exception of the Deputy but I will be right there with him - if and when an application comes in from Dundalk Institute of Technology.  However, there is a body of work to be done.  We have provided the funding and the expert adviser.  I will provide the political leadership, along with other Oireachtas Members.  We will work closely with the institution.  The north east will not be left behind.  I acknowledge the great and positive role the institute plays in the region.</p></speech>

Many of their part-time employment opportunities were removed as a result of Covid-19 and we now see the impact this is having on their personal finances.  It is important that we have a clear picture of where funding is being allocated under the student assistance fund to ensure it is protecting those who need it most.</p></reply>

I also thank him for talking about technological universities and for the work we have done together.  I am delighted that the technological university for the north west now has a name.  It will be the Atlantic technological university and will come into being in April.  I am also delighted to see advertisements being placed to find the leadership of that technological university.</p>  <p>  The student assistance fund is one of a suite of measures to support students participating in higher education.  It is intended for students who are experiencing financial difficulties, whether those difficulties are temporary or permanent in nature.  I am particularly aware of the impact of the pandemic on students.  That is why this Government decided to provide the pandemic unemployment payment to students for such a lengthy period of time and why the student assistance fund has been more than doubled over two years.  With that in mind, I have used Covid funding to significantly increase the student assistance fund.</p>  <p>  The core funding amounts to &euro;8.1 million, &euro;1 million of which is ring-fenced core funding for the support of part-time students who are lone parents or members of the other access target groups identified in the national plan for equity of access to higher education.  There is an additional &euro;8.1 million for this year, funded through the Covid-19 return to education package for 2021.</p>  <p>  The student assistance fund is administered by the HEA on behalf of my Department.  Allocations from the fund are calculated using figures from each institution for the total student population and the number of disadvantaged students.  In the previous academic year, 20,669 students benefited from the fund.  That represents an increase of 6,339 students on the previous year.</p>  <p>  With regard to Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology in Deputy Dillon's region, &euro;576,587 was drawn down from the student assistance fund.  Many of those living in the Deputy's region would also attend the National University of Ireland, Galway.  Some &euro;1.247 million was drawn down for this institution.  I will provide a table to the Deputy as part of the answer to this question.</p></speech>

The recent reform of the SUSI grant and the CAO process are very welcome developments.  I would appreciate some further information on the breakdown of the student assistance fund.  The Minister gave us some figures.  I understand it is being divided up and has a baseline core funding of &euro;8.1 million.  I see that was doubled as part of the Covid-19 response.  The baseline funding was doubled and &euro;1 million ring-fenced to support part-time students who are lone parents.  Will there be any further changes to how this funding is allocated to specific institutions or is further engagement taking place in that regard?  Will that be expanded in the months ahead?</p></speech>

In 2015, the HEA commissioned an independent review of the student assistance fund as part of the national plan for equity of access to higher education.  The main finding of that review was a confirmation that the student assistance fund continues to be highly valued as a source of support for students.  Demand remains strong.  What I like about the fund is the flexibility which allows it to cater for a very diverse group of students in a variety of circumstances.  The SUSI scheme is legislated for and is quite prescriptive.  The benefit of the student assistance fund is that it can be used for a student who meets a once-off financial difficulty, for example, a family bereavement or an unexpected bill.</p> <p>It is there as an additional support for students who may fall on hard times.  Those hard times may be temporary and may have been unforeseen.  A full breakdown of how the fund is divided between the institution exists, and I will provide that to the Deputy.</p></speech>

I am seeking clarity on some of the plans progressing in the Minister&rsquo;s Department.  Several technological universities already exist and, as the Minister mentioned, the new Atlantic technological university, ATU, is coming on stream, driven by the Minister&rsquo;s excellent work.  In that regard, I wish to confirm that the tools are in place to ensure that this funding can be accessed by the students attending these institutions and that there are no unintended consequences.</p>  <p>  In addition, it would be remiss of me not to ask if there are plans for similar funding to be put in place in respect of colleges in the education and training boards, ETBs.  A range of colleges has come on stream in that sector, such as the Mayo College of Further Education and Training, MCFET, which is an amalgamation of Castlebar and Westport colleges of further education.  I hope the students attending these colleges will have access to student assistance funding in a similar manner.</p></speech>

In the last budget, we abolished the post-leaving certificate, PLC, course levy.  A &euro;200 charge had been levied by the Government on people attending a PLC course and that was removed in the budget.  It will now be free for people in this State to access PLC courses, so we are putting the State's money where its mouth is in respect of ensuring that people can upskill, reskill and get the training they require to get back into employment.</p>  <p>  The second thing we have done is that we have brought in a new fund.  Being truthful, we brought it in as a once-off measure in my first year in this role.  It is called the mitigating educational disadvantage fund.  It is a fund that did not exist before and is intended for community education, ETBs and colleges of further education to draw on.  I was in a facility in Kildare yesterday, a youth development training centre, which has been able to buy laptops and to establish a sensory room.  This is a sector which has done incredible work but that has been underfunded, and this new funding stream is helping significantly in that regard.</p></speech>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-11-30a.483.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1601" speakername="Alan Dillon" time="22:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021113000055#DDD00700"><p>I am asking this question on behalf of Deputy Carroll MacNeill.  As the Minister will recall, Speak Out is an online, anonymous reporting tool for incidents of bullying, harassment, discrimination, assault, sexual harassment and sexual assault.  It is being led by the Psychological Counsellors in Higher Education Ireland, PCHEI, group.  Following the Minister&rsquo;s launch last month of Speak Out, I am hoping to get an update on its roll-out and operations to date.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-11-30a.484" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1624" speakername="Simon Harris" time="22:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021113000055#DDD00800"><p>I thank Deputy Dillon for this important and timely question.  The Speak Out tool, launched last month, as the Deputy said, is an online, anonymous reporting tool for incidents of bullying, harassment, discrimination, assault, sexual harassment and sexual assault, led by the PCHEI group, with funding provided by my Department.  Speak Out allows staff and students to report harassment across all equality grounds, including sexual misconduct and racial discrimination.</p>  <p>  The platform is currently available in the higher education sector and is being rolled out across 18 higher education institutions to support staff, students and visitors in speaking out against misconduct.  So far, 14 higher education institutions have begun using the tool, while University College Dublin, UCD, already has a similar reporting tool in place.  It is important to note that not everyone is ready to speak out through formal avenues, such as an official report, and this anonymous reporting tool will allow victims to detail their experiences through a safe, trauma-informed platform.  This tool will raise awareness of the supports available to students and staff and encourage them to seek help, if they need it, and will provide them with access to the required information in that regard.  It is hoped that engagement with this tool will encourage individuals to make formal complaints if and when they feel comfortable and ready to do so.</p>  <p>  The tool enables institutions to track incidents across campuses.  That will be important, in addition to enabling individuals to submit reports.  The tool will provide data, and this facility will enable institutions to first track incidents and then to inform their review of policies and procedures and to develop targeted approaches.  This includes tackling misconduct and also creating formal reporting routes for affected staff and students.  As part of the framework for consent, institutions must report incidents of bullying, harassment, sexual harassment and sexual assault to the Higher Education Authority, HEA, and this tool will allow them to do so in a timely and standardised fashion.  I welcome, in particular, that institutions will report next year on statistics gathered through this tool and an assessment of its impact and usage will be carried out at the end of this academic year. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-11-30a.485" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1601" speakername="Alan Dillon" time="22:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021113000055#DDD00900"><p>It is a great initiative and it is fantastic to see a national roll-out of this tool.  That is certainly aligned with the ethos of cross-institutional collaboration in response to misconduct in the higher education institutions.  This aspect is very welcome.  Depending on the impact of the initiative, and its success in combating this behaviour, I hope that we will see the number of institutions using the tool grow beyond the current total of 18 that have signed up so far during this roll-out.  I am conscious that the development of the tool was initially funded by the then Department of Education and Skills in late 2019 and early 2020 to the tune of &euro;80,000.  That development was supplemented with funding from the HEA in 2020 to the amount of &euro;96,000.  Prevention is also of paramount importance, and I note that additional funding of &euro;400,000 has been allocated to several initiatives around the subject of consent.  I would appreciate any further information that the Minister might be able to provide regarding this initiative.</p></speech>

I thank the staff and student leaders in the sector for all the work that is taking place on the issue of consent and sexual harassment and ensuring that good reporting tools are in place in this regard.  Good work had been done in respect of developing a national framework, but national frameworks are not enough.  Institutions must own the framework and they must determine what they are going to do on their campuses to keep their staff and students safe.</p>  <p>  For the first time, all institutions in Ireland must have an action plan on tackling sexual harassment, specific to each institution, published on their websites, and they must also report to the HEA on delivery.  Some good work is underway in the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's city of Galway on the Active* Consent programme.  Dr. P&aacute;draig MacNeela is leading that initiative.  It is a really good information resource for staff and students, and these are tools that simply did not exist until recent years.  The University College Cork, UCC, Bystander Intervention programme is similar.  This issue is not confined to higher education, but I want the sector to lead in this area and we have many leaders working tirelessly to ensure that happens.</p></speech>

We must ensure that the Speak Out tool will be therapeutically beneficial to those speaking out.  The hope is that engagement with the tool will encourage those using it to seek support.  Support and intervention in this regard are crucially important.  Most important of all, however, support services must be provided to those speaking out, once they have submitted a report, to assure them that we believe them and that we stand with and support them.  I understand that these support services are based on the answers given throughout the online tool reporting process and that it provides a bespoke and tailored list of support services.  I wish to confirm that is a key priority.  We must ensure that the required services are there and in place to coincide with the roll-out of the tool.</p></speech>

It is based on similar tools used in higher education institutions in the United Kingdom.  As a result of anonymity, the tool uses affirmative language, such as &ldquo;perpetrator&rdquo;, to assure those speaking out that we believe them, and that we stand with them.  Through this trauma-informed lens, it has been ensured that the tool will be therapeutically beneficial to those speaking out through those affirmations.  The hope is that engagement with the tool will assist victims in seeking support and also, in due course, in making a formal report.</p>  <p>  Support services are provided to those speaking out once they have submitted a report.  Those support services are based on the answers given throughout the online form and, as the Deputy suggested, this provides a bespoke and tailored list of support services.  A list of all support services is also available prior to filling out the online form.  The support services, therefore, are available at the start, but at the end, once the form has been submitted online, a tailored range of bespoke victim-centred approaches are provided in respect of supports as well.</p></speech>

I am happy to give him an update on the review of the SUSI student grant scheme.  This was a  very important commitment in the programme for Government, which will help shape decision-making on how we support students over the years to come.  I thank the Deputy for acknowledging that there have been some changes since our three-party Government came into office, including the first increase in the SUSI grant in a decade, the first increase in thresholds in probably the same period, the first reduction in the adjacency rate, which may impact the Deputy's own constituents in terms of ensuring more students can avail of the higher rate of the grant, and the first increase in postgraduate supports.  In the relatively short lifetime of this Government, four concrete measures have been put in place.  There is a need to do more and the programme for Government commits to an overhaul of the student support system, not just additional measures in the current system.</p>  <p>  Following a procurement process, the review of the SUSI student grant scheme has been undertaken by Indecon, under the guidance of a steering group which has included student and sectoral representatives and representatives from other relevant Departments.  I am pleased to say there was significant public interest in the review.  Approximately 280 written submissions were received.  A very welcome feature of the process of engagement was that students were involved.  I understand that over 9,000 survey responses were received from students across the country.  This very strong element of public engagement, in addition to the economic work undertaken by Indecon, should provide a solid evidence basis for the recommendations of the review.</p>  <p>  I am currently awaiting the final report of the review of the student grant system.  I understand as recently as today that the work is at a very advanced stage, and is at the point of finalisation by Indecon and the steering committee.  My expectation is that I will receive the final report before Christmas.  My intention then is to submit the report to Government, and then to publish it.  The Deputy will understand that implementation of the report's recommendations will be a matter for consideration by Government and these Houses.</p></speech>

As the Minister mentioned, the non-adjacent rate is very significant for people around mid-Cork from Enniskean and Newcestown up around to Macroom and Millstreet and right across the top of the Boggeraghs as far as Millstreet, who would now be eligible for the higher rate of grant.  The cost of rental accommodation for students is very much higher than what is available in the grant.  Many students will be working during term time and throughout the summer as well.  Only about &euro;4,500 of that is allowed.  They are ending up working against themselves with the fee on it.  Is that going to be taken into account for the new review?  People who are working should not be penalised for the grant.</p></speech>

I am pleased to hear that the changes we made in the last budget will have such a positive impact for many of his constituents.  We would like to do more and build on that in future budgets as well.  I am at a slight disadvantage because I have not yet received the outcome of the review.  However, the terms of reference are quite instructive in terms of what we would like to see happen as a Government.  The terms of reference have asked that the review: examine the maintenance grant values and their income thresholds; look at the definition of "approved course" because we do not currently provide grants for part-time provision, which, I think, is a weakness in the system; look at the adjacent and non-adjacent rates, and we have begun to move on that; look at postgraduate grant support; and benchmark student supports in Ireland against other jurisdictions because it is important to see how we are holding.  In the context of the Deputy's question, the key point is probably the last term of reference, to identify the real cost of attending further education and higher education in Ireland, and to identify the current supports in place.  The real cost has changed over the ten years of the SUSI scheme.</p></speech>

They are excluded under the current model where applicants have to show progression.  It is very important that a lifelong learning opportunity would be available with any funding model.</p>  <p>  If there is a change of circumstances in somebody's household, the current system makes them have to go through a whole review and then take into account an appeal.  That is very difficult in a household where they have seen a sudden drop in income over the last year.  There should be some way of circumventing that when someone is making an application so they can identify a change in circumstances up front and not be delayed until November or maybe even January or February to do an appeal.  These matters need to be looked at in any review.  I would be pleased if the Minister could clarify the situation.</p></speech>

The profile of a learner or student is going to change in Ireland.  Not every student will be 18 straight out of school and packing the bags to go to college for four years.  More and more we are going to see people in their 40s, 50s and 60s with full-time jobs, mortgages and some dependants, needing to access to education.  There is a challenge for us on two fronts.  One is to make the current student support scheme more flexible.  That is why I have alluded to the issue of the definition of an approved course, including part-time provisions.  That is in the terms of reference.  Then there is the more broad point beyond the SUSI support scheme regarding lifelong learning and the model we have in place.  As recently as last week I met with the head of the OECD in Paris.  We have commissioned them to examine what policy levers we should pull as a Government in respect of supporting people to access lifelong learning.  How do we help employers that want to upskill their staff but do not know how they can viably or economically do that?  How do we help the citizen who might not qualify for a State support today to be able to access it in an affordable way?  The OECD review alongside the SUSI review will answer these questions in the course of 2022.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-11-30a.500" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1624" speakername="Simon Harris" time="22:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021113000056#EEE00900"><p>I thank the Deputy for the question and the important issue he is raising.  It is important to say at the outset that the SUSI scheme does take account of the circumstances of people in receipt of the working family payment.  First, as the Deputy knows, the working family payment is treated as an income disregard.  This means that it is not included in the reckonable income for the student grant means test.  Furthermore, unlike other social protection payments which are paid to individuals, the working family payment is a payment deemed to be paid to a family.  In recognition of this, the SUSI scheme contains provisions which allow this payment to be recognised for the purposes of meeting the eligibility criteria for the special rate of grant, which is the highest maintenance grant support available.  This ensures that those students most in need receive supports which are commensurate with their needs.</p>  <p>  More widely, as the Deputy will be aware and as I have been outlining in the House this evening, as part of this year&rsquo;s budget I and the Minister of State, Deputy Niall Collins, made the first substantial changes to the rates and thresholds for the SUSI scheme in a decade.  We intend to do more in this regard.  We will also be informed in terms of a more significant overhaul of the student grant scheme when we receive that finalised report of the student grant scheme review next month.  This will be critical in informing decision-making in future Estimates processes about changes to the rates and thresholds, as well as informing policy priorities and future considerations.  I will certainly ensure that any of the issues the Deputy illustrates in this House are considered in that context.</p></speech>

I understand the exclusion of the working family payment from reckonable income and that is appropriate.  The fact remains that there are families who are in receipt of this payment and in order to survive, raise their families and educate them, they do that in spite of the fact that they are denied a maintenance grant due to the income thresholds.  These income thresholds exacerbate the problem because they are banded.  For example, a family that I know that has seven children, four of whom were in college, is assessed to be in the same band as a family with four children.  The Minister is aware of the amount of college fees and the maintenance that is required.  The cost of educating and raising each additional child is not considered at all in the SUSI calculation.  This affects families in Kerry particularly because they have to travel to go to college.  I have heard of children who have had to leave college because of the financial pressures.</p></speech>

I approached the answer to the question in that spirit.</p> <p> We are slightly at risk of talking at cross purposes.  Regarding the relevance of SUSI, I want to be clear again that the working family payment is an income disregard so there is no student who is not receiving the grant today because payment tipped him or her over an income level.  The payment is disregarded; it is not included in the calculation of reckonable income as part of the student grant means test.  While is it not included in calculating someone&rsquo;s income, we do include it as an eligible payment to qualify for the special rate of grant to try to make sure the higher rate of grant is targeted at those most in need of the grant support.</p> <p> I have some figures for the Deputy.  SUSI has confirmed that the number of students awarded the special rate of maintenance by virtue of the working family payment in 2021 was 5,299.  However, I will be happy to address the broader issue the Deputy is raiding.</p></speech>

The former Minister responsible for higher education, Deputy Bruton, promised to correct what he called this &ldquo;anomaly&rdquo; four years ago in response to a question by a Deputy from another party.  A family in need of social protection with one assessment is denied the right to educate children with another assessment.  Families I know have children who have dropped out because of the financial stress.  This was presented to me a number of times.  It can be sorted out with a little collaboration to correct what the Minister&rsquo;s colleague described as an &ldquo;anomaly&rdquo;.  It is denying affected families the opportunity to educate their children.  I ask the Minister to deal with this.</p></speech>

I am pleased to say that, when it comes to the SUSI review, we specifically included the Department of Social Protection in the steering group.  What we all want is to ensure no poverty traps exist regarding any State support.  I am cognisant that the working family payment is not a barrier to any family receiving the SUSI grant, but I am also cognisant of the broader point Deputy Daly is making.  I will certainly ensure the transcript of this discussion is shared with my colleague, the Minister for Social Protection, and considered in the context of the SUSI review.</p></speech>

I suggest that I provide him with some of the information in tabular form to assist with the discussion this evening.</p>  <p>  As part of budget 2022, a budget of the three-party Government, we announced the first major changes to the student grant scheme rates and eligibility.  These include an increase to the standard and special rates of maintenance, which have not increased in over a decade.  These changes will take effect in the 2022&ndash;23 academic year.  This has allowed us to make what I believe is early progress in addressing what we expect will be some of the themes emerging from the review of the student grant scheme due next month.  This includes trying to ensure that the scheme keeps pace with changes in the economy, people&rsquo;s earnings and changes in the cost of living. </p>  <p>  The package we announced is provided for in the budget.  It will include an additional &euro;15 million for expenditure next year and around &euro;33 million in full-year costs to enhance the financial supports under the student grant scheme.  For the academic year 2022&ndash;23, this will mean an increase in all student grant maintenance payments, including the special rate of grant, of &euro;200 per year.  This will benefit approximately 62,000 students.</p>  <p>  Importantly, the income threshold to qualify for the standard rate of student grant has been increased by &euro;1,000.  This is important because income thresholds have not been touched in a decade.  The qualifying distance criterion for students to qualify for the non-adjacency rate of grant, which affects the Deputy&rsquo;s constituents, has been reduced from 45 km to 30 km, effective from the start of the 2022&ndash;23 academic year.  We have prioritised these changes for the 2022&ndash;23 academic year and they will benefit thousands of students, building on the improvements we made last year in respect of the postgraduate student supports.  In this regard, we increased the postgraduate fee grant from &euro;2,000 to &euro;3,500 and the income threshold for postgraduate students from &euro;31,500 to &euro;54,240.  We had not increased the rates before that.  If I were to read out the rates, we would note they were static for a decade until we made these changes.</p></speech>

There has been a dramatic regression since 2008 but the Minister very cleverly glossed over all that.  This is despite my having asked a very specific question as to where we were in 2008 and where we are today, even allowing for the miserly increases that were given in the budget for 2022&ndash;23.  We have gone back again to the great ploy that has been employed for ten years: the review.  This means the poor students in college in 2021&ndash;22 get nothing.  Under the current Government, students in 2022&ndash;23 will see a little bit of redressing, back to the rates of 2008.  If the Minister checks the cost of going to college, he will see there was a significant difference between 2008 and today.  Can he outline for me in detail the regression since 2008, as I asked for?</p></speech>

We are not going to debate on the floor of the D&aacute;il why they were made, I am quite sure.  When our two parties came together along with the Green Party in this Government, we made a commitment, in the programme for Government, to improve student grants.  Consider what occurred after I was appointed by the Taoiseach to my Department.  In the first budget we delivered as a Government &mdash; ours is a Government of three parties &mdash; we increased student grants for postgraduates in addition to income thresholds and rates.  In the second budget of this Government, we increased income thresholds and made increases in respect of the adjacency and non-adjacency rates.  We also increased the overall rate.  Have we reached the destination?  No.  Does everybody from the Taoiseach down in this Government intend to do more?  Yes.  Were student grants reduced, as the Deputy wishes me to say on the record of the House? Yes, they absolutely were.  Why were they reduced?  The Deputy is well aware of the reason, as am I.  However, we are making progress, not just to get back to where we were but also to go further.</p></speech>

I thank him also for the time we spent yesterday in Celbridge and Maynooth viewing further education and higher education facilities.  I very much enjoyed it, though he still has not given us the winning lotto numbers.</p>  <p>  Ireland has developed a national skills system across further and higher education and apprenticeships, lifelong learning and human capital development under the framework of the national skills strategy and underpinned by strong partnership with key stakeholders.  It is firmly focused on responding in an agile and flexible way to priority skills needs and to changes in the world of work driven by technology to ensure that Ireland has a skilled and productive workforce.  This skills system, which includes the National Skills Council, the regional skills forums and the skills analysis and forecasting bodies, fosters engagement, dialogue and collaboration with key stakeholders on skills issues.  This skills infrastructure informs and drives responsive and flexible forecasting, planning and provision to meet the skills required in the workplace across all sectors of the economy.</p>  <p>  My Department's statement of strategy identifies a number of areas for special attention and on which significant work has been undertaken, including, for example, inclusion, alignment of our tertiary education system between further and higher education, apprenticeships and digital literacy.  Additionally, our skills policies continue to observe and take into account major trends impacting the labour market, including population ageing, automation, and digitisation and climate action.</p>  <p>  As for the requirement for graduates equipped for technical roles in our workforce, I am pleased to say that enrolment on STEM-related higher education courses has increased by 14% since 2014, from 59,000 students to 67,400 students.  Importantly, the number of students graduating from these STEM-related courses has gone up by 29%, from 16,500 in 2014 to 21,300 in 2020.</p>  <p>  In addition, two key initiatives now in place in higher education, the Springboard+ programme and the human capital initiative, are designed to meet identified technical skills needs across all sectors of our economy.  These initiatives provide subsidised places on a broad range of courses in engineering, ICT and science.</p></speech>

Will he comment on the difficulty now experienced by the workplace in general of filling the posts that are becoming available?  Does he feel it will be possible to produce the number of qualified graduates to fill those positions in academia and in the technical areas, knowing that we will face extra competition from across the globe?</p></speech>

We talk a lot about housing.  The Deputy will have heard me talk about this yesterday in Kildare.  We need about 27,000 more people to work in the construction sector.  The Deputy and I are not going to build the houses.  That is why we are putting a concerted focus on apprenticeships.  At the moment we take on about 6,000 construction apprentices a year.  That will rise to 9,000 next year, a 50% increase.  From January we will bring in a subsidy whereby we will pay employers about &euro;2,000 per year per new apprentice they take on to make it easier for employers.  We are changing the CAO website such that the young students I was speaking to in Kildare yesterday see not just the university options but also the technical options, the colleges of further education and the apprenticeships and that they are not hidden away as fallback options but seen as real, viable, important careers, which they are.  That attention and focus we are providing on apprenticeships will really improve the technical skills needs of our country, coupled with the answer I gave the Deputy regarding the focus on STEM, engineering, ICT and science in our universities.</p></speech>

Arising from that, does he continue to be convinced of the ability to draw on more of those students when they qualify and to help them to qualify by various means and incentives between now and the next three or four years, given the urgent and pressing necessity to be able to fill the positions that are available in this country at both levels?</p></speech>

I am really encouraged by what I saw yesterday and what I saw of the research ecosystem in Maynooth and the real focus there on doing more in research and collaborating.  I am encouraged by the meeting I had with the new president of NUI Maynooth yesterday, her management team and the discussions we had on collaboration with further education.  I really want to see the education ecosystem in Kildare - the colleges of further education, the secondary schools and the university - working together and pulling together to meet the skills needs of the county and the region.  The students I am most thinking of, after my visit yesterday with the Deputy, are the students of Leixlip Youthreach.  We cannot leave anybody behind.  School does not work for everybody for a whole variety of reasons, and we have a duty of care and an obligation to make sure that those students, learners and citizens can reach their full potential.  I am more determined than ever after our visit yesterday to work with the Deputy to get a proper, purpose-built facility for the students of Leixlip Youthreach.</p></speech>

We also know, however, that we cannot be complacent.  No one owes this country a living.  No one owes any of us a living.  We can never stand still.  A phrase we like to use when talking about skills is that we can be confident but not complacent.</p>  <p>  Last week I travelled to the OECD headquarters and met the head of the OECD to commission a body of work to be done by the OECD on our skills infrastructure.  I want the OECD to look at what we are doing in this country, what we are doing well and what we need to do better.  Crucially, I want to ask it to come up with policy proposals and evidence-based advice on lifelong learning.  We do a very good job of educating our children, getting them through school, getting more and more of them into third level and out the other side and on they go.  There is more work to be done there but that is going relatively well.  Looking at lifelong learning, however, we are not where we need to be.  As I said in answer to an earlier question, more and more the learners of today and the learner of the future will be not just 18 or 19; they will be 45, 55 or 65.  They will have a job, a house and a mortgage.  They could have children and dependants.  They will need to access skills and upskilling and reskilling in a much more flexible way.  They might need to be provided online, after the working day, remotely or in microcredential form.  That is where the benefit of this still relatively new Department can be, in terms of developing the policy proposal on creating a lifelong learning model that works for Ireland.  I am really pleased that we have now commissioned the OECD to do that body of work.  It will engage with all stakeholders throughout the course of 2022.  Indeed, it has already started.  I want to be in a position to be able to advise the Government of policy proposals we should consider to improve lifelong learning rates in our country.</p></speech>

The jobs are here now and we need to fill them to a greater degree in the future.</p></speech>

One of the decisions taken by Government and by my colleague, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage in recent weeks and months - providing certainty of funding for construction and public investment in construction for the years ahead - can provide an assurance to people looking to work in construction that there will be work, jobs and well-paid jobs in this sector not just this year or next year, but right through for the next number of years.  Anybody involved in the housing debate, an honest one, will know two things: first, that the State is going to spend a lot of money on investment in housing in the coming years; and second, that there is going to be a requirement for many more people to work in the sector.  I hope that sends out a message to our young - and not so young - talented people abroad that they can come back to this country and work in this sector, which is a sector, let us be honest, that was decimated during the bad years.  Second, I hope it sends a message to the young 16-year-olds, 17-year-olds and 18-year-olds sitting in a classroom today or tomorrow, that all of a sudden housing, construction, retrofitting are real areas where there are well-paid jobs available now and into the future.  </p></speech>

He said that nobody should be left behind and that each student is an investment in the future, in the economy and in the quality of life.  It is important to recognise that and encourage the people who may feel, for one reason or another, a lack of confidence or whatever, or that they cannot compete.  They can, and with continued support, they will.  Is the Minister satisfied that sufficient support is made available for them and will be available in the future?</p></speech>

We need Youthreach to be much more prominent as an option for young people who have difficulty with school for a whole variety of reasons.  We need to help them get to Youthreach, be made aware of it and have a better understanding of it.</p>  <p>  We need to get real about adult literacy.  We live in a knowledge-based economy of well-educated people, but nearly one in five of us cannot read, nearly one in four of us cannot understand numbers, for example, on our ESB bill, and almost one in two of us lacks basic digital skills.  We cannot leave people locked out.  That is why we have launched our new adult literacy plan, the first ever ten-year adult literacy, numeracy and digital skills plan.  We have not just launched a plan; we now have money to hire a literacy co-ordinator in every ETB in Ireland in 2022.  </p>  <p>  We must move beyond the narrow view of education that it is age-bound or that it is just for some people.  It must be for everybody and it must be provided in a way that works for everyone.  There are still too many people who are at risk of being locked of full economic or societal participation if we do not get this right.  </p></speech>

The first thing this Government must and will do is to be honest that we need a new and better model for student accommodation.  Yes, we have seen the supply - and I can ream off statistics - of purpose-built private student accommodation significantly increase, but that is not the point.  We have not seen a pipeline of significant scale of college-owned affordable accommodation.</p>  <p>  I have engaged directly in the Deputy's own county, with University College Cork and Munster Technological University.  I have engaged with the Irish Universities Association, IUA, the Technological Higher Education Association, THEA, the representative bodies, and the Union of Students in Ireland, USI.  Crucially, I have also engaged with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage on the issue.  We have established a working group, chaired by my Department, working with housing and university and college stakeholders to try to devise a new model to build college-owned affordable student accommodation.  I hope to be in a position to outline that model early in 2022.  We have asked the universities and the institutes of technology to prepare a pipeline of projects on the understanding that a new model that will address some of their concerns is forthcoming.</p>  <p>  As I indicated earlier, if at all possible, we should look at some of the cost-rental models the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage is bringing forward, and see if there could be a tailor-made or a version of that that would work for the third level sector.  I am very happy to hear the Deputy's feedback.  I should also say that tomorrow I will meet with student union presidents from across the country online - all of them are invited - to talk about the issue of student accommodation and get their feedback and views, too.  </p></speech>

While some colleges do provide accommodation, others do not.  Is the Minister focused on all colleges, or just on those already providing accommodation?  There are places where we need to make a start.</p>  <p>  There are many private property owners involved, whether they are large apartment block owners or individuals who let houses.  Has the Minister had an opportunity to engage with them on the issue?  They are a very significant component in all of this.  It is hugely important that there is reasonably priced accommodation available.</p>  <p>  In respect of rent a room options, previously, these would have been more in the line of digs, but very little is available at this stage.  Has the Minister looked across the board at all the different options to reduce the stress on students?</p></speech>

All colleges need to see the provision of accommodation as a core component of what they need to do, because otherwise, a lack of it will become an issue in terms of participation in education.  In fairness to them, institutes of technology and technological universities, until the publication of Housing for All in recent weeks, were not allowed or enabled to borrow to build accommodation.  In the Deputy's own neck of the woods, I think there is huge potential for the technological universities, for example, Munster Technological University in Kerry and Cork, to name just two in the south-west region.  There will be focus on all institutions, but a particular focus will be placed on the former institutes of technology and new technological universities.  There could be some potential low-hanging fruit there if we can get the model right.</p>  <p>  On private operators, I do not believe, from memory, that I have directly engaged with them, but I certainly will.  On the rent a room scheme, more can be done in that regard in terms of a short-term fix or assistance.  I think the Covid pandemic impacted that.  I am already engaging with student unions and others about how we can look at rebooting that or perhaps even remodelling it for the next academic year.</p></speech>

They are looking at paying at least of a third or a quarter of it in one go.  We are now moving towards the end of the first term and that massive demand for money is reaching many households around the country at this stage.  Are steps being taken to prevent that and to provide a more realistic option so that people who are renting will be able to pay it and spread out the load, instead of having to respond to one big demand or the two or three big demands?  It is hugely important that there is realistic accommodation available at a reasonable price for students.  Those kind of issues need to be dealt with.</p></speech>

We came together on an Oireachtas cross-party basis on legislation passed by the Minister of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to ban that practice, so that no renter, student or otherwise, can now be asked to pay more than one month's rent plus a deposit.  It was a huge issue that USI and others were highlighting last year.  Students were wrongly being asked to pay, four, five or six months' rent in one go.  I am pleased to say that we have made legislative provision to outlaw that.  No more than one month's rent and one month's deposit will be required now.</p></speech>

I raised a similar issue some weeks ago and the Minister did not show up then either.</p>  <p>  I am in receipt of an independently commissioned report and analysis of recent details and figures pertaining to the wholesale electricity market in Ireland known as the integrated single electricity market, I-SEM.  The I-SEM was created to integrate the Irish-only market with European power markets, including Britain.  Within that is the day-ahead market, DAM, accounting for 84% of all electricity.  This is the benchmark price for Irish electricity and utilities and ultimately sets the price for residential, commercial and industrial consumers.</p>  <p>  The report clearly shows that there has been a &euro;250 million increase in the price of electricity for consumers in three months until the end of September because the ESB has orchestrated and extracted super-normal profits.  I have no doubt that the ESB has used the shortage of generation capacity and its dominant place in the marketplace to increase tenfold the wholesale price of power, which has resulted in higher prices for consumers over and above the escalating costs applying to the rest of Europe.  The time has come for the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, to carry out an investigation into how consumers in Ireland have been so severely impacted by the global rise in energy costs.</p>  <p>  A number of factors are at play.  Global gas prices have risen significantly causing energy price inflation.  Ireland also has a generation supply crisis caused by the failure to plan for adequate new generation capacity.  By virtue of its dominant role as a generator, the ESB has been selling into the wholesale market where all power utilities purchase their energy at ten times the normal levels applicable in 2019 and 2020.  These energy utilities include Bord G&aacute;is Energy, Electric Ireland, Energia, Flogas, Panda Power, Prepay Power and SSE Airtricity.  The ESB has been using the shortage in generation capacity to extract super-normal profits causing further electricity price inflation.</p>  <p>  As a power generator the ESB has a right to set the price it pitches to the wholesale market.  However, in the absence of large-scale alternative energy generators and when, for example, wind power is not playing a significant role, the ESB demand price becomes the wholesale price and energy supply companies have no choice but to pay.  The ESB has been demanding prices of up to &euro;490 per megawatt hour when the cost of production was under &euro;150 per megawatt hour.  This has never happened before in the Irish electricity market and is only possible because of the shortage of generation and the ESB's dominant market share.</p>  <p>  In the report, which was submitted to the CRU some weeks ago, shows that this has led to a &euro;250 million increase in wholesale power costs in the three months to September.  The cost is being passed on to all homes and businesses.  Based on these three months alone, households will pay an extra &euro;150 in this year's bills.  I call on the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, to order the ESB to cease price gouging in the market and instruct the regulator to commission new generation from other suppliers to ensure adequate supply and competition in the marketplace.</p>  <p>  I had previously questioned the Minister, through a Minister of State representing him in the D&aacute;il, about whether the ESB was using its dominance to orchestrate the current energy capacity shortage and whether a &euro;10 million payment was made by EirGrid to ESB generation in relation to emergency generation at the ESB North Wall facility, despite the process for such provision being withdrawn following High Court proceedings against the said process.  Since I raised this issue, other Deputies have also questioned who authorised this payment and where the taxpayers' &euro;10 million is now?  What has the Minister done since to get to the bottom of this matter?  He stated he did not sanction the payment.  Will he indicate whether he knew about it before it was made?  Will he instruct EirGrid and the ESB to respond to this charge that a &euro;10 million payment was made, which, to say the least, was way out of order?  Unfortunately, it brings the whole system into disrepute.</p></speech>

It was my fault as I understood I was due to respond to the second Topical Issue matter.</p>  <p>  I thank Deputy Cowen for raising this important topic, which has informed a lot of discussion lately.   I will take this matter on behalf of the Minister who is unable to attend tonight and sends his apologies.  Some of the issues the Deputy raised go beyond the brief I received but I will bring back the Deputy's questions and try to get the answers he seeks.</p>  <p>  The integrated single electricity market, I-SEM, is the wholesale electricity market on the island of Ireland and is jointly administered and regulated by a statutory single electricity market committee, comprising the two energy regulators and independent members.  The original single electricity market was established in 2007 and is underpinned by legislation enacted in Ireland and the UK and Northern Ireland, with the original legislation enacted in 2006 with an underpinning memorandum of understanding between the Irish and UK Governments.</p>  <p>  Operating within an overall EU framework, responsibility for the regulation of the electricity market is solely a matter for the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, the independent energy regulator.  The CRU was assigned responsibility for this function following the enactment of the Electricity Regulation Act 1999, which states that the CRU shall account for the performance of its functions to a joint committee of the Oireachtas, and not to the line Minister.  In 2018, the new I-SEM went live demonstrating Ireland's strong commitment to the integration of European electricity markets.  The I-SEM promotes the interests of consumers by enabling greater competition through cost-reflective prices, while also securing a diverse, viable and environmentally sustainable long-term energy supply.</p>  <p>  The most immediate factor affecting electricity prices in Ireland is the continuing upward trend in international gas prices where we are a price-taker.  In Europe, wholesale natural gas prices have been on an upward curve since the second half of 2020.  This feeds directly through to wholesale electricity prices as it strongly correlates with the price of gas.  This increase was cited by many suppliers as one of the main reasons they increased their prices recently.  The wholesale cost of generating electricity makes up approximately 40% of the final retail price.</p>  <p>  The Government believes that competition is a critical means of exerting downward pressure on electricity prices and also towards ensuring diversity of energy supply to reduce our exposure to high and volatile external energy prices.  Additionally, our heavy dependence on gas in the electricity mix underlines the need to maintain the focus on the limited controllable cost factors.  Among the actions being taken are to increase the penetration of indigenous secure renewables in the Irish electricity system and to promote energy efficiency.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will note that the CRU is accountable to a joint committee of the Oireachtas and not necessarily to the Government or the Minister for the performance of its functions.</p> <p>The CRU met the Oireachtas committee most recently on 5 October and there are channels where these issues can be raised directly with it.  </p> <p> On security of supply, the CRU has statutory responsibility, under SI 60 of 2005, to monitor and take measures necessary to ensure the security of electricity supply in Ireland, which I believe is the concern of the Deputy.  The CRU is assisted in its statutory role by EirGrid, the electricity transmission system operator.  EirGrid monitors security of supply and reports to the CRU on future projections of electricity supply and demand.  This is set out in EirGrid&rsquo;s annual generation capacity statement, the most recent version of which was published in September.  The capacity remuneration mechanism, CRM, is a measure designed to complement energy-only payments in wholesale electricity markets.  The purpose of a CRM is to ensure long-term security of supply by ensuring that investors can recover their long-run marginal costs.  This is particularly important in isolated island systems with high volumes of intermittent generation such as Ireland&rsquo;s all-island single electricity market, SEM.  The running of the CRM is solely a matter for EirGrid and the SEM committee as auctions were conducted by the transmission system operator, TSO, which is EirGrid in this case, according to the auction design and overall regulatory supervision of the SEM committee.  There is no ministerial function regarding the auctions apart from securing state aid approval for the capacity mechanism which was obtained in 2017.</p></speech>

I do not, nor does anybody else, expect the Minister, Deputy Ryan, to be able to change international gas prices.  We have a right to expect, however, a competitive, efficient and well-served wholesale market.  I contend that successive failures by the Department, EirGrid and the CRU have resulted in the present situation where we have too little generation capacity to meet our needs.  The ESB, because of that failure, is now the dominant entity and market power which has shown itself only too willing to use that power to extract super-normal profits from Irish consumers.</p>  <p>  We heard ten, 12 or 14 years ago a Financial Regulator tell the Government and State that the banks were well-capitalised and that there was nothing to fear or worry about and that it was removed from the workings of Government in its duty to enact Government policy.  Here we have a Minister within a Government which sees this crisis for what it is head-on, knows the impact and the effect it is having, knows the failures that there have been to date to allow a situation to evolve, and then says that it absolves itself from any remedies that may be necessary.  I have highlighted issues which are serious, worrying and need to be addressed.  I would expect that the Minister with responsibility in this Government on behalf of us all would ensure that the ESB, EirGrid and the CRU live up to the expectations and policy commitments that are contained in the programme for Government on one side, and the responsibilities of the Department on the other, to ensure that the best interests of the public are adhered to.</p></speech>

The Minister, Deputy Ryan, is looking closely at and is following this and I will certainly bring back to the Minister the Deputy&rsquo;s concerns.  It is right that we interrogate the data and try to get behind what these high prices are about as well as focusing on the importance of the security of supply.</p>  <p>  One of the issues in respect of the ESB is that a new T-4 capacity auction was held in April 2009 with successful new projects required to be delivered in the 2022-23 capacity year.  New projects that are awarded capacity contracts are required under the rules of the capacity markets to report on and demonstrate the progress of their projects between contract award and project delivery with specific milestones that must be reached within specific timeframes.  Five of the new projects that the ESB won contracts for in that 2009 T-4 auction, consisting of 461 MW of new capacity, failed to demonstrate progression in line with the required timeframes and, as a result, these contracts were terminated.  This was announced on 11 January this year.  It is understood that the ESB considered that it could not deliver projects that had secured capacity contracts within the requirements and timeframe of the market period 2022-23 and therefore had to withdraw.  As this contract for ESB generation was for the period 2022-23, its absence is not the reason for the current tightness in the electricity security of supply which is due to the unavailability of existing conventional generating power plants due to a mix of planned outages, maintenance and forced outages, as well as a growing electricity demand.  </p>  <p>  On the penalty, the ESB was required to pay a charge following termination of its capacity contracts for 2022-23.  The associated notices were published at notice 1 and notice 2.  The total amount of the termination charges was &euro;4.1 million and the amount of capacity that was terminated was 461 MW.  The application of termination charges is required under the capacity market code and the schedule of termination charges to apply in any given auction is set by the single electricity market committee.  However, the charges were invoiced and collected by EirGrid and the System Operator for Northern Ireland, SONI, in their role as administrators of the capacity market code.</p>  <p>  On the issue of Moneypoint, the termination of the 461 MW of new capacity that was awarded to the ESB was not due to the 2021-23-----</p></speech>

On behalf of the Minister of State, I thank Deputy Griffin for raising this issue.  The Minister of State welcomes this opportunity to update Members on work currently under way within the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage on this important issue.  First, I want to outline the context and policy framework that underpin this work.  The ongoing implementation of the language planning process has a statutory footing under the Gaeltacht Act 2012, which is the primary driver in support of the commitment to the achievement of the objectives set out in the 20-Year Strategy for the Irish Language 2010 to 2030.  The national planning framework, NPF, reflects this commitment.  In particular, national policy objective No. 29 "supports the implementation of language plans in Gaeltacht Language Planning Areas, Gaeltacht Service Towns and Irish Language Networks".</p>  <p>  Separately, the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, sets out mandatory objectives for local authorities, which must be addressed in the drafting of their development plans governing local development policies.  Section 10(2) of the Act, as amended, includes a requirement that, where there is a Gaeltacht area within the planning authority's territory, the development plan must include provisions and objectives for the protection of the linguistic and cultural heritage of the Gaeltacht, including the promotion of Irish as the community language.  To provide further guidance in preparing appropriate policies, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage published a document, Development Plans Guidelines and Development Management Guidelines for Planning Authorities, in 2007, which addresses this mandatory objective under the Planning and Development Act.  The guidelines refer to linguistic and cultural heritage and the needs of the community in land use terms for housing, community facilities, employment, tourism and design, including advertising and signage.  Individual development plans may also oblige applicants for planning permission to submit certain particulars or information to accompany development proposals in Gaeltacht areas, such as assessments of the linguistic impact of the proposed development, in order for it to be assessed against relevant policies of the development plan.</p>  <p>  In August this year, the Department published revised and updated draft development plan guidelines, which reconfirm the obligations of planning authorities to the development of the Gaeltacht.  Since April 2019, the assessment of all local authority development plans and local area plans is undertaken by the Office of the Planning Regulator, OPR.  The oversight role of the office includes ensuring consistency with relevant national or regional policies, including those set out in the NPF, and addressing all relevant mandatory objectives for county development plans.  It is important to note that the decision to grant or refuse planning permission or assign conditions to the granting of permission, including conditions relating to language where appropriate, is ultimately a matter for the relevant planning authority or An Bord Plean&aacute;la, as appropriate.</p>  <p>  Officials from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage have been engaging with the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media in regard to planning in Gaeltacht areas.  In addition, several Irish language groups, including Conradh na Gaeilge, raised a number of matters with a view to improving the practical implementation of the Irish language provisions in Gaeltacht areas.  On foot of this engagement between the Departments and the proposals put forward by Conradh na Gaeilge, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage convened a working group during the summer to examine various aspects of the planning process in the Gaeltacht.</p></speech>

Membership of the working group established by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage is made up of representatives from the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and the relevant local authorities.  The Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, is committed to working with the relevant stakeholders in the coming months with a view to agreeing practical improvements and best practice processes that will support and enhance the important policy and legislative provisions that are in place.</p>  <p>  Separately, and to support and accelerate the work in train, earlier this month, Department officials met with the relevant officials in the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, and both Departments will continue to engage closely in this regard.  The Deputy may be assured that the Department is committed to ensuring that procedures and systems will be tailored as appropriate, in co-operation with the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts Gaeltacht, Sport and Media and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, to facilitate an effective and consistent approach by the relevant local authorities.  Given the work that is currently under way, the ongoing engagement with the relevant stakeholders, the unique spatial and linguistic circumstances relating to each of our Gaeltacht areas, with local variations between communities, and the context in which the Irish language is spoken, the Minister is of the view that the relevant planning authorities are best placed to implement the planning framework of legislation, policy and guidance that has been outlined.  He is satisfied there are appropriate planning oversight mechanisms and safeguards in place, which include the OPR and An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</p></speech>

I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this Topical Issue for debate.  The optional protocol to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, CRPD, allows individuals and groups to hold states to account for failures to uphold their rights.  Ms Sin&eacute;ad Gibney, chief commissioner of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, has stated:</p> <blockquote> 	'Optional Protocol' is a technical term that unfortunately does a disservice to its meaning and significance, and which masks the urgent need for action for people with disabilities and our society.  The Protocol is about empowering people with disabilities. </blockquote>  <p>Far from being optional, it is a crucial tool for the convention's implementation, which provides more local remedies and removes discriminatory laws and practices.</p> <p>While the language is technical and it can seem divorced from everyday life, this is incredibly important to help strengthen the rights of people with disabilities.</p> <p> Disability services, or the inadequacy of them, is an issue I am contacted about practically daily from people across Cork South-West and beyond.  I know that other Deputies and the Minister of State have a similar experience.  We hear accounts of children who cannot access vital therapies or the children disability network teams waiting lists, of families unable to get suitable housing and of older people forced into nursing homes due to a lack of home supports.</p> <p> At the Joint Committee on Disability Matters, our current module is dealing directly with the lived experiences of people with disabilities and their carers.  What one hears each week is more disgraceful and enraging than what one heard the previous week, as individuals and families tell us about having to fight for access to and then maintain basic services.  I regret to say that I have come to the conclusion that we do not have a rights-based approach to disability; rather, we have a budget-based model.  Services, supports, and opportunities are decided on the basis of Government budgets, not human rights.  It is worth noting that we can afford to address these matters.  In a rights-based system, when people are entitled to a service, they receive it, from SNAs to carers respite to accessible transport.  What is happening in Ireland is so very far from this.</p> <p> In dealing with all of this week after week, I keep coming back to the importance of the protocol in holding the State accountable for the deficiencies in services and for the barriers individuals face.  The programme for Government includes ratifying the protocol, and the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth reiterates his commitment every time I ask him about the process.  However, there is no sense of priority.</p> <p> Disgracefully, it took Ireland more than ten years to ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  Individuals, communities and advocacy organisations are all deeply concerned that ratification of the optional protocol is also years away.  People with disabilities cannot wait that long in order to be able to guarantee their rights.  In June, the Chief Commissioner of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission wrote to the Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, to emphasise the need to adopt the optional protocol as a matter of urgency.</p> <p> We have discussed this extensively at meetings of the Joint Committee on Disability Matters.  It is clear that this is a political decision.  We have heard from different experts, including the UN special rapporteur, who have clearly said that the optional protocol can be ratified immediately.  I am sure the Minister of State will mention issues such the commencement of the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act 2015 and the establishment of the decision support services, which are very welcome.  However, these are the latest delays presented by Departments.  Ratification can and should happen immediately.  Will the Minister of State please push for this?</p></speech>

It is also great to have the opportunity to discuss the matter this week and keep a focus on the agenda.  I appreciate the Deputy's commitment and that of the entire House for the progression and ratification of the optional protocol.</p><p>Ratifying the optional protocol to the UN Convention on the Right of Persons with Disabilities is a matter of significant importance to me and the Minister.  Ratification is a commitment in the programme for Government and the Minister and I have stated that we wish to see the protocol ratified as soon as possible.  Work has begun to identify the steps that need to be put in place to enable early ratification of the protocol.  However, the Government and I have always been mindful of the need to be able to meet and honour our obligations arising from international commitments.  Ireland has a reputation as a good faith actor on the international stage and as a leader on human rights issues.  It is a hard-won reputation based on a long-standing policy whereby we do not enter into binding international obligations without first being sure that we can meet and honour the commitments we take on.</p><p>The Minister and I are working to ensure that Ireland will be a position to honour the obligations in the optional protocol upon ratification.  To this end, ratification of the optional protocol requires progress being made in key areas of legislation so that Ireland can move closer to full compliance with the UN Convention on the Right of Persons with Disabilities.  Fully commencing the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 is a priority for us in this regard.  We are working intensively on an assisted decision-making capacity (amendment) Bill which will streamline processes and improve safeguards for everyone who will rely on the Act and the decision support services that it established.  This is a fundamental change in how people with disability are supported in their decision making and is a key measure in progressing the realisation of Ireland's compliance with the UN Convention on the Right of Persons with Disabilities, especially Article 12.</p><p>It is important to put on the record of the D&aacute;il that today I wrote to the Chair of the , Deputy Funchion, regarding the heads of a decision-making capacity (amendment) Bill.  I have progressed it, and I now ask the committee to give it priority so that I can ensure a full commitment.  I have always said that decision support services should be in place by June of next year.</p><p>In addition, a comprehensive review process is needed to ensure that Ireland's other systems and processes for personal persons with disabilities, particularly complaint and redress mechanisms, will meet the obligations in the optional protocol.  The Office of the Attorney General will play an essential role in the review and officials in the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth will conduct work over the period ahead.</p><p>In terms of time, the programme for Government contains a firm commitment to ratify the optional protocol after the first UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities reporting cycle has concluded.  Although Ireland has already submitted its initial state report under the convention, it is possible that the report may not be reviewed as quickly as originally anticipated.  As a consequence, the completion of the reporting cycle may take longer than planned.  However, the Minister and I are keen to ensure that Ireland's ratification of the optional protocol is not delayed for this reason and we will prepare for ratification once the review of domestic procedures, complaints and the redress mechanism has been completed and any action that may arise from that process has been undertaken.  </p><p>In the immediate term, we know we need the commencement of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 and the full operation of decision support services.  I would like to underline the commitment of the Government to implementing the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-11-30a.595" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1525" speakername="Holly Cairns" time="23:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021113000063#MMM00300"><p>I thank Minister of State.  Of anyone in government, I do not doubt her commitment in this area.  However, I am concerned at the conditionalities Departments keep putting up that supposedly block ratification.  In 2015, it was the intention to ratify the convention and the optional protocol together.  By 2018, however, it was just the convention.  We then had to wait until after the first reporting cycle under the convention, which, at the current pace, is still years off.  In response to pressure on that hurdle, the emphasis has now fallen on the commencement of the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act 2015, which I welcome.  It will come before the , and I will push for it to be prioritised.  The review of the current legislation for decision support service gets an occasional mention.</p><p>The goal posts keep shifting, and all the time people with disabilities are denied access to housing, cannot get suitable transport for work or socialising and are disproportionately at risk of poverty and social exclusion.  Exhausted parents have to fight for therapies from under-staffed children's disability network teams and carers are left without respite</p><p>In this week, with International Day of Persons with Disabilities imminent, what will the Government do?  The Minister spoke about identifying the steps it needs to take.  One one hand, we have independent experts, including the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and Professor Gerard Quinn, the UN special rapporteur on the rights of persons with disabilities, stating that the protocol can be ratified immediately, without the need for all of the steps and compliance with the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act 2015.  There is no need for legislative or structural changes.  Other countries have done that and they have come before the committee and explained that to us.  On the other hand, we have Departments continually shifting their position, with barrier after barrier being put up, as well as a process which is at odds with the approach taken by countries that have done this successfully and that ratified the optional protocol years ago.  The Government has a very clear choice.  Surely, it would choose to follow the advice and more quickly protects the rights of people with disabilities.</p></speech>

The Government is committed to full ratification of the optional protocol.  There is a process I have not veered away from since I became Minister of State which relates to two matters I referred to in my reply.  The first is the general scheme of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) (Amendment) Bill 2021 that has gone to the Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  I ask the joint committee to prioritise its consideration of that.  I allocated funding in last year's and this year's budget for decision support services so that staff will be in place when the proposed legislation is passed, and decision support services will be operational.  I am working with the disability stakeholder group and I am working on the national disability inclusion strategy.  Interdepartmental groups meet on a quarterly basis.</p>  <p>Out of that, they meet every month where disability is a focus within their Department.  I am asking them, parallel with what I am doing legislatively with the Members of the House, to ensure their Departments are doing the same.  Before the end of this year, I will lay before the House the National Disability Authority, NDA, revision in respect of the Irish Sign Language Act, to see where it looked at every Department.  What the NDA has done with regard to the Irish Sign Language Act is a really good barometer because it shows where disabilities within all Departments are open and that the Departments understand what it means about disability inclusion and participation and how the Departments can work to ensure that the mechanism is there.</p> <p> I am not changing any goalposts.  I have been very clear that if we cannot be before the UN convention because of the timing cycle, we have sent forward our papers.  We have our decision support services in place.  Those mechanisms are then in place for myself and the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, to ensure that the optional protocol is ratified.</p></speech>

In addition, the trolley count is particularly high.  In fact, it is the highest of any part of the country.  Last week alone, and despite the fact that there were widespread cancellations of elective surgeries in all the hospitals in the Saolta group, there were 614 patients on trolleys.  There were 226 in Letterkenny, 169 in Galway and 104 in Sligo.  I have very little time, but there are particular problems in this region and in this group.  The question we are asking, and I have raised this directly with the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, is: what can be done to ensure that whatever resources need to be put into all those hospitals to reduce the waiting times and take people off trolleys is done?</p></speech>

Mayo University Hospital is in a deep crisis at present, both in terms of the 15,000 people who are waiting for treatment there and in terms of access to the emergency department.  People are waiting for hours without treatment.  It is not good enough in this day and age.  It is not good enough to say that we spend X amount of money.  There must be accountability within the system.  We also need the resources to be targeted.  We have built enormous primary care centres, even in parts of Mayo, yet people cannot have access to a general practitioner, GP, or to proper healthcare.  Something has gone badly wrong.  There must be capital investment in Mayo University Hospital.  There is no point in telling us it will happen in 2024 or 2025.  There has not been capital investment in Belmullet hospital as well and that is obviously having a knock-on effect on step-down services for Mayo University Hospital.</p></speech>

Sadly, this is not the case at present.  Galway University Hospital has long had an issue with capacity, which means that, as the Minister of State knows, most families in Galway have had a loved one stay on a trolley rather than in a hospital bed.  Indeed, it was this capacity issue that left us on the back foot at the onset of the pandemic and it still impacts on our fight against Covid-19 now.  It was horrifying to see that once again this month there were hundreds of people lying on hospital trolleys in Galway and across the west.  These are not just numbers, but real people.  We have to finally deal with the capacity issue and support the tremendous work that is being done by staff who are dealing with overcrowded conditions daily as they try to do their best for the patients who are admitted to Galway University Hospital.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-11-30a.602" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1607" speakername="Martin Kenny" time="23:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021113000064#NNN00600"><p>The issue across the entire hospital group is capacity more than anything else.  We hit it all the time and the number of people on trolleys and on waiting lists comes up in the Chamber regularly.  The staffing issues in Sligo University Hospital, particularly in the emergency department, have been at crisis point for the past number of months.  We met the management of the hospital who told us that new nurses were being recruited and that 14 were to be in place before the end of November.  The hospital has got some of them, but not all of them.  The staff had organised a lunchtime protest today because of the staffing levels in Sligo University Hospital.  They postponed it because negotiations are taking place to try to do something about it.  However, it is a crisis situation.  There are issues with bed capacity, diagnostic capacity and theatre space.  There is a range of problems, and not just in Sligo.  It is in Letterkenny and in all the hospitals in the region.  It is a very poor reflection of how the west is being looked after when one considers that the Saolta hospital group is in such a crisis.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the Saolta group as I am a resident who accesses the Saolta group.  It is important to put that on the record.</p><p>I thank the Deputies for raising this important issue.  The Saolta group serves a relatively older and dispersed rural population in Connacht and Ulster and is of vital importance to those communities.  I should have said at the outset that I am replying on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly.  The group has six hospitals across seven sites.  Emergency department congestion, waiting times and other challenges vary across the group over time.  There is significant capital investment in Saolta under way or in planning, which I will outline shortly.  However, I acknowledge the scale of the challenge facing our emergency departments as we head into what is expected to be a difficult winter.  I agree with Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell.  I acknowledge and thank emergency department staff for their ongoing commitment to delivering a high standard of care to emergency department patients while acknowledging the distress that overcrowding causes to patients, their families and to front-line staff.</p><p>The Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, published the HSE winter preparedness plan for 2021-22 on 15 November.  The plan centres on three core objectives - emergency department avoidance, patient flow and hospital egress - to mitigate the expected challenges in providing emergency care this winter while also continuing to respond to Covid-19.  We are investing &euro;77 million in this year's winter plan in addition to the 2021 funding, which has been retained.  This year's winter plan recognises that a whole-system response is required and outlines how the HSE proposes to manage winter challenges across primary, community and acute care, including measures to allow the public system to access private healthcare capacity.  The acute hospital capacity review identified the need for significant additional bed capacity.</p><p>Since January 2020 we have added approximately 800 new acute beds.  Projects of note in Saolta hospitals include ten new beds in Mayo and 26 in Letterkenny, with a further 23 due before the end of the year.  Portiuncula has two projects under way to provide 62 beds.  In Sligo, there is the building oftwo additional 21-bed wards and in University Hospital Galway, 12 cardiothoracic beds are currently being built, as well as the new radiation oncology unit.  The handover of the temporary emergency department in Galway is expected in early 2022, and Merlin Park's two new orthopaedic theatres will be operational shortly.  Roscommon's specialist rehabilitation unit has been delayed due to Covid-19, but work continues to progress this project.  These projects will provide the bed capacity to improve patient flow through the hospitals and improve emergency department performance.</p><p>I accept that our waiting lists are far too big.  Many patients are waiting an unacceptably long period of time.  The waiting lists were too long before the pandemic but have worsened due to Covid-19 and the cyberattack.  We are taking action to address this.  For 2022, an additional allocation of &euro;250 million will be used to fund additional activity in both the public and private sectors to reduce hospital and community waiting lists.  The additional funding means there will be a budget of &euro;350 million available to support vital initiatives to improve access to acute hospitals and community health services.</p><p>There is an acknowledgement in the response, and I echo it, that there is tremendous pressure in all the hospitals across the Saolta group.</p> <p>The staff are working incredibly hard, but my reading out tonight what beds have arrived and what beds are coming on stream does not provide the care to the families who need it and does not give the hospitals the staff they need.  Funding is not the issue at the moment.  It is really hard to recruit staff into clinical posts.  That is a major problem being faced in Sligo.</p></speech>

In her speech, she mentioned 800 new acute beds and she went on to detail some of them.  She did not say that many of these beds are actually replacement beds.  A few days ago, I was in Portiuncula hospital and met the hospital manager.  The Minister of State spoke about 62 beds, but 50 of those are replacement beds and only 12 are new.  They are single isolation room beds which are replacing wards that are being repurposed for other uses.  These are not new beds and do not bring additional capacity.  It is unfair to suggest to people they are new beds when they are not new beds.</p></speech>

The Minister of State has spoken about staff and looking after them, and I acknowledge the Trojan work they do.  Why do we not do exit interviews with all the nurses who are leaving?  Why do we not offer contracts that are flexible to meet the family needs of nurses?  Why are we going around the world recruiting nurses when only 4% of students who do pre-nursing PLC courses go on to be nurses?  The pathways are not there for our own people.</p></speech>

This really is a capacity issue.  While budget after budget outlined the additional capacity that would be added to our hospitals, the reality is people in Galway having to leave their granny overnight on a trolley in Galway University Hospital as so many families have had to do in recent weeks.  That is just not good enough.  They need to see the impact on the ground.</p></speech>

We need to drill down on the reasons for that.  The reason is that the HSE is trying to recruit staff into a chaotic situation where they are required to work in an understaffed ward with one person having to take on all the responsibilities which should be shared among three or four people.  As a result of that people do not want to stay in the HSE system and are therefore emigrating to other countries where they can at least make progress in trying to qualify.  Those problems exist across all HSE areas and not just in the west because of the chaotic system that has arisen over years of underinvestment.</p></speech>

Approximately 800 beds have been provided on a permanent basis over the number available at the end of 2019.  We have hired more than 6,000 staff - doctors, nurses, midwives and therapists - since last summer.</p>  <p>  On 7 October the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, published an acute waiting list action plan, aimed at mitigating the impact of the pandemic and the cyberattack on scheduled care activity this year.  He is also establishing a ministerial task force to oversee a long-term multi-annual plan to address this enormous challenge.  He has said that reducing waiting lists will be a priority for us throughout 2022.  The Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund are focusing on improving access to elective care in order to reduce waiting times for patients.  These plans include increased use of private hospitals; funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals; funding "see and treat" services for minor procedures while providing at the same time an outpatient consultation; providing virtual clinics; and increasing capacity in the public hospital system.</p>  <p>  He has accepted that a key part of the solution for the Saolta group is additional beds and the expansion of facilities.  I earlier outlined many of the recent and current developments under way at each of the hospitals across the group.  All these are significant steps in addressing the needs and will provide additional capacity and staff to meet the needs of the population.  The Department of Health and the HSE will continue to work with the local group management to further improve the patient experience in the Saolta University Hospital Care Group.</p>  <p>  The 50 beds in Portiuncula hospital have been out of operation for some time and the additional 12 beds relate to where the hospital could not have the old Victorian-style units.</p></speech>
