We need to significantly upscale it.  What are the Minister's plans in that regard for the next school year?</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-06-30a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1582" speakername="Norma Foley" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022063000003#A00500"><p>As the Deputy will be aware, school transport is a significant operation managed by Bus &Eacute;ireann on behalf of the Department of Education.  In the current year, more than 121,400 children, including more than 15,500 children with special educational needs, are transported daily to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country.  The cost in 2021 was &euro;289 million.  It is worth noting that in the last number of years, the number of children using the scheme has increased by more than 8,000.  In the most recent academic year, capacity was increased to cater for more than 1,500 additional pupils arriving from Ukraine.</p>  <p>  Under the terms of the school transport scheme, children are eligible for transport at primary level where they reside not less than 3.2 km from the school they are attending and it is their nearest national school.  At post-primary level, they are eligible where they reside not less than 4.8 km from the post-primary school or education centre they are attending and it is the nearest post-primary school or education centre.  Distance is determined by the Department and Bus &Eacute;ireann and rules have regard to ethos and language.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Department commenced a review of the school transport scheme in February 2021.  The review is being conducted with a view to examining the current scheme and how it currently operates, its broader effectiveness and sustainability and that it is adequately supportive of the provision of service to students and their families.  The review encompasses the school transport scheme for children with special educational needs.  The review of the primary and post-primary school transport schemes examines how the schemes currently operate, including eligibility criteria, trends, costs, cost drivers and overall effectiveness in meeting the objectives of the scheme.  The review also examines the potential for integration of different strands of the scheme in a more co-ordinated approach with other Departments that use transport services.</p>  <p>  Following commencement of this review, the steering group presented me with an initial interim report.  Following consideration of this report, I approved the extension of temporary alleviation measures for the 2021-22 school year for transport for post-primary students who were otherwise eligible for school transport but were attending their second nearest school.  Wider considerations regarding the operation of the scheme are now taking place in the next phase of the review, which is under way.  A number of meetings have been convened and a number of discussions have taken place.  Decisions with regard to measures for the 2022-23 school year will be made shortly.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-06-30a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1460" speakername="Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022063000003#A00600"><p>I believe that with adequate vision, we can deliver transformative change in school transport that will take a large number of cars off the road and save parents a significant amount of money.  It is at this time of year that parents' attention turns to whether their children will qualify for the scheme and the attention of school communities turns to the issue of eligibility and concessionary places, which have always existed, attempts to establish new routes and so forth.</p>  <p>  I urge the Minister to ensure that the school transport section in her Department is adequately resourced to ensure it is in a position to meet all the requests it receives.  The Minister alluded to the review and its interim report, which led to the welcome proposal regarding second nearest schools.  My understanding is that this review was due to be completed earlier this year.  What is the timeline for the publication and implementation of the review?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-06-30a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1582" speakername="Norma Foley" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022063000003#A00700"><p>I agree with the Deputy.  I believe there is an opportunity - it is one that we are taking via the review - to carry out a complete root and branch of the school transport service as regards how it meets the needs of students and families.  The Deputy referred to how we can integrate the service, ensure best value for everybody concerned and so forth.  He is correct that the interim review results led to me making the decision to accommodate those who are attending their second nearest school.</p>  <p>  Decisions regarding measures for the 2022-23 school year will be made and announced shortly.  The completion of the review will take place before the end of this year.  It is likely to be the third quarter or start of the fourth quarter but most likely the former.  I am very conscious of the need to advance this matter and the enormous benefit the school transport scheme provides for families the length and breadth of the country.  It is important that we have a system that works effectively for all involved.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-06-30a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1460" speakername="Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022063000003#A00800"><p>While it is somewhat later than perhaps might have been anticipated, it is good to at least have a timeline for the review.  The other element is that there is scope to reduce the costs for those who are already travelling on the school transport scheme.  Has the Department considered that?  I urge the Minister to consider that in the context of the forthcoming budget to encourage even more people to take part in the scheme.</p>  <p>  Another element is that in large parts of the State, school transport routes are operated by private contractors outside of the scheme.  Obviously, that is entirely the prerogative of the school communities.  Has the Department considered any incentives to encourage additional capacity in the system by encouraging some of those organisations operating those routes to be funded through the school transport scheme?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-06-30a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1582" speakername="Norma Foley" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022063000003#A00900"><p>In the first instance, I acknowledge that measures have already been introduced in the area of school transport costs and the cost of living.  The Deputy will be aware that the Government announced there would be a reduced cap for fees for multiple children at post-primary level.  It has now been reduced from &euro;650 to &euro;500 and from &euro;220 to &euro;150 at primary level.</p>  <p>  I am very conscious of the importance of the scheme and measures of this nature.  Obviously, we must look at everything in a budgetary context going forward.  I wish to highlight that proactive steps have already been taken, however.  It is the purpose of the review to look at all aspects in terms of accessibility, value for money and meeting the needs of families and students.  It is all-encompassing.  We have thus far had incredible engagement from all sectors, stakeholders, students, parents, families and the wider general public.</p></speech>

It is particularly failing those children who do not have an appropriate place for September when it is now the end of June.  The original response from Government to that failure was the awful scheme for special education centres, which has thankfully been dropped.  There has now been an attempt to distract from the Government's failings by putting the blame on four particular schools, which were at wrongly named.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-06-30a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1472" speakername="Josepha Madigan" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022063000003#A01300"><p>I spoke already about the Ombudsman for Children's report.  I very much welcome the fact that he has now published his report.  The Department had a significant level of engagement with the Office of the Ombudsman for Children to make sure he had the full facts in order that he could reflect that in his recommendations.  It is important to point out that while the State may have failed in its obligations over many decades, the Ombudsman for Children acknowledged the progress that has been made by this Government in the last two years.  It is important to say that.</p> <p>He acknowledged the investment of &euro;2 billion, which is over 25% of the Department's budget, on special education.  That amount is the same as the entire amount for the Department of Justice and is a recognition and acknowledgement of the importance of special education.<br/><br/>Yesterday, we published new emergency legislation which will assist in the section 37A process.  We have outlined a number of different measures over the last two years.  The Department's geographical information system will continue to support a strategic and co-ordinated approach to the planning and delivery of special educational needs, SEN, provision, which is the main point the Ombudsman for Children was making in terms of forward planning.  That forward planning probably was not up to standard in the sense that we were in a difficulty in trying to find appropriate placements for a small but important minority for this September.  I expect the emergency legislation will assist with that.<br/><br/>The Ombudsman for Children also made some points about National Council for Special Education, NCSE, training.  Those targeted and bespoke supports will continue as well.  Last year, for the first time, we secured a commitment from the planning and building unit that all new schools in the future will automatically provide a SEN base, which is four classrooms in a post-primary school of 1,000 pupils and <i>pro rata</i>after that.</p></speech>

She said that the decision to name the schools had been made because they were "not engaging at all" with the Department and were "just ignoring correspondence".  When the schools produced correspondence to prove that was not the case, the Minister of State's story changed.  She said they were ignoring the import of the correspondence, a very different story from what she had made public.  Will she apologise for naming these schools in the way she did?  Will she apologise for using the four schools as a scapegoat for the failure of the Government to deal with the situation and to prioritise children with special needs?  Will she commit to providing not only the places in the schools but also the resources, particularly staffing, to enable schools to provide the necessary education to children with additional or special needs?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-06-30a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1472" speakername="Josepha Madigan" time="09:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022063000004#B00300"><p>I note that this was not part of the Deputy's question.  Nonetheless, I have no difficulty in responding to it.  First, all supports and resources will be given to all schools that we are requesting under the section 37A process to open a special class.  It is important to point out that in the section 37A process, which is a transparent process, all schools are publicly named on the Department's website.  That is the nature of it.  It has already been used twice in the past.  Recently, we initiated the process for the third time when the National Council for Special Education wrote to inform me that there were insufficient placements for children in Dublin.  The council is satisfied that every other placement around the country will be provided for.  Therefore, we felt there was no other option in circumstances where schools that we had targeted informed us that they were not going to be in a position to open a special class.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-06-30a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1628" speakername="Paul Murphy" time="09:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022063000004#B00400"><p>I will ask again.  Will the Minister of State apologise to the four schools?  She attempted to name and shame them to distract from her and the Department's failures.  She put wrong information into the public domain by saying that they were not engaging at all and "just ignoring correspondence" when it has been proven that this is not the case.  Will she apologise to the principals, teachers and the schools?  Then we can put this distraction behind us and move on in dealing with this crisis.  In Dublin 24, for example, there are 17 primary schools with special education classes but in September there will be only two post-primary schools with them.  In general, the ratio is two point something to one, but in Dublin 24 it is substantially worse.  It is a real failure.  It is good that we are dealing with the legislation on Friday, but why did the Department wait until the D&aacute;il is about to go on holidays and it is a few months from September?  Why has the Government not been proactively planning for this, which is both directing schools and providing the resources for the schools to do it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-06-30a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1472" speakername="Josepha Madigan" time="09:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022063000004#B00500"><p>Again, it is important to point out that the majority of special classes that are opened in Ireland are opened without having recourse to the section 37A process.  The section 37A process has to be utilised and the mechanism has to be triggered in circumstances where the National Council for Special Education and the Department are of the firm view that a school has spare capacity to open a special class.  If it transpires that a school is compelled to open a special class, it will be fully resourced and the staff will be given to the school.  It is important to point out that there are 435 special classes in the county in which the Deputy lives, 310 at primary level and 125 at post-primary level.  There are also 38 special schools.  The majority of those special classes would have been opened outside the section 37A process.  The Government wants schools to volunteer in the first instance, but where they do not volunteer and where we know they are in a position to open a special class or, indeed, a second special class, we will trigger the section 37A process.</p></speech>

However, I will take the opportunity to ask the Minister of State another question.  What is the current state of play with regard to children without places in a special class or a special school in the Dublin area and in the State generally?</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-06-30a.26" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1472" speakername="Josepha Madigan" time="09:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022063000004#B00900"><p>The Deputy's question was about the emergency legislation which was published yesterday and will be before the D&aacute;il tomorrow.  Regarding Dublin at present, I answered that question at a press conference with the Minister, Deputy Foley, the other day.  Currently, there are 56 children who do not have a special class place in Dublin and there are 49 children who do not have a special school place.  By virtue of the fact that we will have the emergency legislation in place, we expect and hope to be in a position to have placements for those children for September.  Obviously, however, I cannot guarantee that.  We hope the schools will volunteer.  We prefer schools to volunteer rather than do it on the back of an order or a direction from me.  In circumstances where that does not happen, we would have no option but to use section 37A.  That is now truncated and streamlined through the new emergency legislation.</p>  <p>  However, schools will still have two opportunities to make representations to the National Council for Special Education.  That is important because they will get a say and be able to make representations as to why they think they should not open one.  A direction can be issued within six to eight weeks of the NCSE sending me a detailed report advising of a lack of provision in a certain area.  Also, the Education (Provision in Respect of Children with Special Educational Needs) Bill provides for amendment of section 67 of the Education Act 1998.  That section had never been commenced.  It means the NCSE can designate a school place for a child.  That would be of great benefit to parents seeking a placement for their child.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-06-30a.27" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1460" speakername="Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire" time="09:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022063000004#B01000"><p>The Minister of State was absolutely right in acknowledging that there was a lack of forward planning.  It appears to me that we have not moved beyond that and that we are still in that situation.  She is also right that most schools open classes of their own volition.  It has been my experience that any school that has opened such a class has never regretted it.  However, that is not the point.  The point is that for those schools that refuse, we are allowing this to creep into the eleventh hour.  That is the problem.  The experience of parents is that every September they get the message from the NCSE and the Department that there are adequate places in their locality, but it turns out by the following April that this is not the case.</p> <p>I urge the Minister and the Minister of State to convene the NCSE this coming school year, ensure a decision is made early in the year to analyse where the shortfall is for September 2023 and begin the section 37 process then.</p></speech>

That will reduce the burden on parents.  What happened on occasion was children who were in a mainstream school were then going into a special class but the NCSE was not being informed about that.  The NCSE was under the impression there would be six vacant places in a special class, for example, when in fact there may only have been three.  That anomaly has now been addressed.  There is an obligation on all schools to notify the NCSE regarding who exactly is attending a special class.  The special educational needs organisers, SENOs, who are on the ground will collaborate and make sure there is a very tight engagement between the schools and the NCSE so we can make sure that every child has a placement.</p>  <p>  In Cork at present we have 414 special classes and a number of special schools, as the Deputy knows.  We are endeavouring to make sure that every child has a placement in September.</p></speech>

Finding solutions for those children who require places in a special school in September could be more complex.  What is happening regarding that?  The section 37 orders in play relate to the opening of classes in mainstream schools.  What is the proposal for special schools?  Is the Minister of State confident places will be available in such schools?  Will she ensure all resources required are in place?  This is crucial.  I am sure the Minister of State understands it is not just about four walls.  It is about ensuring there are adequate resources - we will debate this further tomorrow - and staff in place in a timely way for any special places that are open.</p></speech>

At post-primary level, it is 1.5 teachers and two SNAs for six children.  Primary schools also receive a mainstream capitation rate of &euro;183 per student.  There is also an enhanced capitation rate of &euro;720 per student enrolled in a special class giving a total capitation rate per student of &euro;903.  Where a school is making the arrangements for the opening of a special class, the school can, while progressing the recruitment of additional staff sanctioned for that class, reassign an existing mainstream teacher who has experience or an interest in special education provision as the special class teacher.  That may present a more practical arrangement for a school to facilitate the opening of a special class in a timely manner.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is also aware, grants are available, including a starter grant of &euro;6,500 to open a special class, a &euro;2,500 grant for furniture and a &euro;5,000 ICT grant.  The support of the NCSE is ongoing on all occasions.  Training is also available for teachers.</p></speech>

This programme uses a professional external project manager to co-ordinate and drive the design team to achieve the best possible timeframe for the project through the stages of architectural planning to tender and, ultimately, construction.  This is the third ADAPT delivery programme undertaken by my Department since 2016 and involves major building projects for 30 schools, including, as the Deputy referenced, the new school for Gaelchol&aacute;iste Phort L&aacute;irge.</p>  <p>  The tender process to appoint the project manager commenced in December and is now complete.  The appointed project manager carried out a site visit to Gaelchol&aacute;iste Phort L&aacute;irge on 24 June.  The Department recently contacted the school authority with an update regarding the completion of the project manager appointment and the upcoming tender process for the appointment of a design team.  The role of the design team is to design the project in accordance with the Department's design team procedures.  This involves various stages, including preliminary design, detailed design, planning permissions and then onwards to tender and constriction.</p>  <p>  Until the design team has a preferred design option agreed and fully costed, and until all statutory applications have been granted in stage 2(b) of architectural planning, it will not be possible to provide timelines regarding the progression of the project to tender and construction stages.  The anticipated timelines for projects in the ADAPT programme to complete the pre-tender stage of architectural planning is within 24 months of the design team appointment.  As I noted, this does not include the time that could be involved if there are delays in the planning application process, or an appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la is encountered, but it will be the timetable to which the project manager and the design team are guided to work towards.</p></speech>

We have an adjacent Gaelscoil as a feeder school to Gaelchol&aacute;iste Phort L&aacute;irge, which will take in almost 180 students this year and has had two junior cycle classes for the past three years.  As the Minister knows, the school is going from strength to strength but it is still operating out of prefabs so the construction of a new school is badly needed.</p>  <p>  I hope we can find a way to try to reduce the procurement timelines as much as possible.  I envisage no planning difficulties in the area.  The school will be most welcome.  It is very badly needed for a burgeoning area of Waterford city.  It is very important for the development and retention of our teanga and cult&uacute;r in Contae Phort L&aacute;irge.</p></speech>

I sincerely acknowledge the excellent work that goes on in the school, including its delivery of education to its students, its role in the community and the excellence of the entire school community.  This school is a priority for delivery but there is a process.  On the procurement process, in the first instance, the appointment of the project manager involved a detailed commercial process that had to be completed.  It is very positive that the process has been completed.  It is particularly positive that a site visit has taken place and was done as a priority.  That means we can advance to the next stage.</p>  <p>  The appointment of a design team is a significant body of work in that we are talking about the architect, quantity surveyor, civil construction engineer, mechanical and electrical engineer, fire safety consultant, project supervisor for the design process and all of that.  It will be given every opportunity to progress apace.  I am mindful of what the Deputy said about the planning process, which will obviously be helpful.</p></speech>

This school is of great importance as it is a natural pivot to An Rinn in Dungarvan.  It means we will now have a very comprehensive school ecosystem as Gaeilge and oideachas tr&iacute; Ghaeilge, which is very important for Waterford.

The deal was subsequently endorsed by 95% of school secretaries throughout the country.  What is the status of agreement as regards implementation?  When will that take place?  The summer holidays, when people will be paid off, are rapidly approaching.  What is the situation?  School secretaries need to know.</p></reply>

I am fully aware of the vitally important role played by them in the running of our schools.  I fully support, as does everyone, this important agreement which will improve their terms and conditions, and rightly so.  The majority of primary and post-primary schools receive assistance to provide for secretarial services under grant schemes.  Where a school employs a staff member to support those functions, that staff member is an employee of the school and responsibility for terms of employment rests with the school.</p>  <p>  F&oacute;rsa tabled a claim in 2019 seeking parity of these staff with education and training board, ETB, public service staff.  Extensive engagement has taken place since then between the Department, school management bodies and F&oacute;rsa to work towards a resolution, with the support of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  On 24 February this year, following a series of engagements at the WRC, a suite of measures designed to improve the working conditions of school secretaries was proposed, which F&oacute;rsa agreed to recommend to its members.  As the Deputy indicated, a ballot was undertaken, the result of which was 95% agreement in favour of the deal.  I was very pleased with this overwhelmingly positive result on this long-running issue, the resolution of which has been a priority for me since my appointment.</p>  <p>  The work to implement this agreement has now commenced in conjunction with F&oacute;rsa.  It requires a complex process of assimilating information to capture accurate data in respect of each individual secretary.  Additional resources are in place to provide capacity to manage this process to ensure both individual and school data are captured and correctly applied.  This will also require the development of an IT system to collect the data and action the payroll obligations.  As this work is currently ongoing, it is not possible to commit to an exact timeline, but the Department has expedited the process and will communicate further as the work progresses.</p>  <p>  The Department has issued a circular to schools to outline how the agreement will be implemented.  The circular outlines that as a first phase of implementation of the agreement, schools must, before the end of September, calculate the initial assimilation rate of pay and annual leave entitlement for secretaries and offer it to them.  Should the secretary choose to move to the new terms, the new pay rate should be applied by the school from 1 September 2022.  The verification of this first phase, the calculation of back pay and the option to have the value of jobseeker's benefit included in pay will be addressed in the second phase of the assimilation process.</p></speech>

At the earliest, they might be included by the Christmas holidays but it will more than likely be Easter or summer of next year.  That is disappointing.  While I know significant work is required, surely it is possible to start moving people to the scheme, even at this early stage.  The Department has known about this for some time and the secretaries are in place.  The information should be readily available.  Given that 95% of school secretaries endorsed this decision and there is strong support for it among the workforce, it must be very disappointing for them to see it will be next year at the earliest before they can qualify.  I ask that the Department expedite the work to ensure this happens quicker.  Based on the dates the Minister has given, according to which the initial stage is to be undertaken by the end of September, nothing will happen before then.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

I was very pleased with the endorsement of the proposal in a ballot in which 95% of school secretaries voted in favour of the deal.  However, I will be upfront and honest that there is a considerable body of work involved here.  Each secretary is employed by the relevant school board of management.  The work has commenced in conjunction with F&oacute;rsa.  It is a complex process of assimilation of information in order that accurate data with regard to each individual secretary are captured.  The additional resources that have been required have been put in place by the Department.  The work also involves setting up an entirely new IT system to collect the data and that is ongoing.  Circulars have issued to schools.  Before the end of September, schools must calculate the initial assimilation rate of pay and annual leave entitlement for secretaries and offer those to them.  My point is that there is a considerable body of work involved.</p></speech>

That is the reality.  It is disappointing for the school secretaries who have been waiting so long for this to happen.  I know that each secretary is employed by the individual school but I also know the Department was probably aware of which schools had or did not have secretaries.  Much of that information is within the Department.  While it may have been available on an <i>ad hoc</i>basis or may not have been in a format that would have allowed this to proceed, much of the necessary work could have been done.  I hope the matter continues to receive priority because it would be very disappointing if the timescale were to slip any further.  I hope the Minister will ensure it is made a priority over the coming year to ensure it is implemented by next summer at the latest.</p></speech>

As I outlined, the individual case for each of the secretaries is not just a matter of acknowledging that there are secretaries in each of the schools.  It is also a matter of gathering the individual data for each of the secretaries in terms of his or her service.  That is a body of work and we are giving absolute priority to it.  The complex process has already begun.  The resources that are required from my Department have been put in place.  The new IT system that will be needed to manage the process is being put in place.  I acknowledge the work schools will do before the end of September in calculating the initial assimilation rate of pay and the annual leave entitlement for secretaries.  They will then offer it to secretaries and secretaries will respond.  I do not, for one minute, underestimate the value or importance of this work.  We will expedite it as much as we possibly can.</p></speech>

The initial teacher training includes modules on special education, which means qualified teachers are already able to support children with special education needs who are in a special class setting.  Recognising that teachers in these classes may also wish to access additional training and supports, a range of departmental continuing professional development, CPD, and National Council for Special Education, NCSE, supports are also made available to those who wish to avail of them.</p>  <p>  Prior to the opening of a class there is a programme of professional support for schools with newly established special classes, and that is being developed by the NCSE.  That programme will be available to schools as soon as practicable upon the completion of the recruitment process.  Some of the supports available include a seminar for principals, a four-day intensive training course for teachers, a two-day training course for new teachers, whole-staff CPD, and a school being linked with an NCSE adviser, which is critical for having a two-way communication channel.  There are also further modules available.</p>  <p>  After opening the special class, the NCSE provides a comprehensive programme of teacher professional learning seminars each school year, which cover a variety of special education needs topics.  In-school support forms part of a suite of teacher professional learning provided by the NCSE in addition to a programme of seminars and online resources for teachers.  Schools may apply directly to the NCSE for in-school support for the whole staff group and for individual teachers, and that support is tailored to the specific teacher professional learning needs within a school.  I will come back to some of the resources that are available to teachers on topics in a minute.</p></speech>

Deputy Carroll MacNeill maintains that access to psychological training is necessary to help understand and better manage behaviours, especially overstimulation behaviours that might reflect the child's anxiety, and she is interested in what kind of training is made available to teachers in this area.</p><p>The Deputy asks if teachers will be given better training on special education, which the Minister of State has probably addressed already.  Deputy Carroll MacNeill maintains it appears that teacher training involves a two-week placement in a special school.  Will the Minister of State clarify the amount of time teachers spend <i>in situ</i>in special schools as part of their training?  Is there a requirement to provide lesson plans, as is the case in other places?  She maintains there is no such requirement and she is concerned about how the special classes will be staffed without proper training and a deep understanding of real inclusion.  We often have children integrated in mainstream classes.  What encouragement and supports are in place to enable teachers to get training in those circumstances?</p></speech>

Subsequent to a class being opened, resources are provided on behaviour management, language and literacy, numeracy, metacognition, school self-evaluation, CPD audit tools, teaching methods and organisation, assessment, individualised planning, and co-teaching, and other seminars on inclusion are provided.</p>  <p>  The Deputy specifically asked me, on behalf of Deputy Carroll MacNeill, about psychological support and particularly about autism training when we know that the main driver of special classes is autism.  In March 2022, the Department published an interactive guidance document, Autism Good Practice Guidance for Schools, as a resource for schools and their teachers.  That guidance document has been developed as a resource for schools to support the needs of students with autism and it aims to assist teachers and SNAs.</p></speech>

Is it mandatory for teachers who work with children with additional needs such as autism to have a specific level of training and qualification before they work with these children?  If so, what is the extent of those qualifications and that training, certification and oversight?</p></speech>

As the Minister of State knows, a proportion of our autistic children attend DEIS schools and they need these supports.  Yesterday a lot of schools in Carlow got letters back from the Department to say they were not being changed from a DEIS band 2 to a DEIS band 1, and yet there are schools right beside them that have DEIS band 1 status that have the same families attending them.  It is unacceptable that we are looking at schools that have put in an appeal that will not get the DEIS band 1 status.  This is unfair for everyone involved.</p></speech>

The Deputy was talking about the mandatory training and I mentioned that there are modules of special education in place already for qualified teachers, and that is part of the process of becoming a teacher.  We are looking at all of this through the Teaching Council as well and we are making sure we have up-to-date CPD assistance.  Both the professional development service for teachers and the national induction programme for teachers provide ongoing training from a postgraduate perspective in the postgraduate diploma programme, and there is another graduate certificate for the education of pupils on the autism spectrum for newly qualified teachers.</p></speech>

That issue is the need to establish a special school in east Cork.  We have children travelling long distances out of the area into Cork city, Dungarvan and so on and going on 100 km round trips every day.  What plans are there to establish a special school in this large and highly populated area?</p></reply>

I have made representations to the NCSE on the Deputy's behalf and it is aware of the fact we have spoken about this on numerous occasions.  It has said it will compile a report on the need for a special school in Midleton and in the east Cork area.  It will undertake a feasibility study for the area and establish if there is the need for additional provision in the area.  The NCSE was of the view there was no need for such provision but it will undertake a feasibility study, based on the Deputy&rsquo;s contributions in the D&aacute;il and in the committee.</p>  <p>  I know there has been a significant increase in special school places in the past year and we have 941 children in special schools in Cork.  Having said that, I appreciate a lot of this is concentrated on the south of the city in Carrigaline and Rochestown.  There is also provision for a new school in Glanmire that has recently been announced.  I understand parents want to find a placement in a special school as near to where they are living as possible, and I know the Deputy has championed the need for a special school in east Cork.</p>  <p>  I have instructed the NCSE and the Department to look further into this matter.  Whatever about trying to get an appropriate placement for a child, which is the first thing we have to do, the second thing we have to consider is trying to get an appropriate placement in the locality.  I can visit east Cork with the Deputy at any stage if that would be of assistance.  Now that the NCSE is doing the feasibility study, it is to be hoped that will progress the matter further.</p></speech>

I want to encourage her to keep battling to try to get this done.  Is she aware there was agreement a number of years ago to establish a special school and a premises was identified?  Then, for other reasons outside of everyone's control, that premises was no longer available and the plan was dropped.  There was an acknowledgement at that stage by the Department and the NCSE that there was a need for a special school in the area.</p> <p>That need has not gone away; in fact, it has increased if anything.</p> <p> I welcome the extra places in Glanmire and Carrigaline but they are a long distance from Aghada, Youghal and so on.  People travel to Dungarvan from east Cork, which is almost a 100 km round trip.  Does the Minister of State agree it is unfair that children with additional needs have to travel long distances out of their area and away from their locality while their brothers and sisters can go to a school down the road?  A site is available in Midleton that I can tell the Minister of State about.  It can be leased long term and they can put a school up there with planning in a short period of time.  Will the Minister of State engage with us on this?  The need is huge, has been there for quite some time and has not gone away.</p></speech>

The NCSE is only looking at an interim site for Rochestown.  In that context, it will be looking for special school provision on the eastern side of Cork city also.  I will make sure the NCSE is aware of the Deputy's comments on the absolute need for it.</p>  <p>  He is right that there are children in that situation and we do not dispute the figures in the Ombudsman for Children's report in relation to children with special educational needs who have to travel to schools.  We want that to be in the past and that is why we are publishing the special needs provision legislation, so we can compel schools to open special classes.  We are doing much work with the Spiritan Education Trust as well around fee-charging schools in relation to special schools.</p></speech>

I agree on integration but am aware that some special schools in Cork city, where these children have to go, have waiting lists, so we have children with no place.  I appeal to the Minister of State to talk to the NCSE to get this work done quickly.  I know what happens in Departments.  They set up a study and another study, it goes on forever and nothing happens.  We want a deadline on this.</p>  <p>  There is a site available at the moment.  The Minister of State could have a school up there in September 2023 if the decision was taken to do it.  There are waiting lists in some of the schools, there is pressure on these parents and they already have so much stress dealing with children with intense additional needs.  They need support and it is wrong, as the Minister of State agrees, that these children have to travel long distances away from their areas every day to get the support they need.</p></speech>

I have listened to the Minister of State's replies.  I welcome anything positive but, as Deputy Stanton said, Glanmire to Rochestown is a long way with traffic, the tunnel and the whole lot for families to travel.  We have massive population growth in east Cork, predominantly on the Midleton side towards Youghal.  On top of that, I have often discussed the constituency database here and a fresh one will come out shortly from the latest census.  From the last constituency database information, I can tell the Minister of State that over 14,500 people had a disability in the east Cork area.</p>  <p>  I appeal to the Minister of State.  We will work together.  We do not have to play party politics all the time to get local representation for local people.  I would support the Minister of State's suggestion of coming to Midleton, looking at the area and trying to resolve the issue as fast as possible.</p></speech>

The NCSE has committed to undertaking a feasibility study and is aware of the identified need for additional special education placements for students, particularly with autism, in Cork.  I understand the Deputy's points that Rochestown and Carrigaline are a bit further away.  There are other special schools like Mayfield, which is getting an additional 18 places, Carrigaline, Bishopstown and St. Gabriel's Special School.  There are a number of special schools in Cork.  We do not want children travelling if possible.  We want to try to have a school in the location.  I have no doubt that if the NCSE is satisfied there is an immediate need for this, it will take that seriously.  We can talk to the planning and building unit once we get the outcome of the feasibility study, which I will ask to be expedited.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the Minister visited east Cork recently.  It was a welcome and successful visit.  She met with the principals, visited two schools and they are still talking about it.  There is a need for forward planning beginning now.  Notwithstanding the excellent work done to date with extensions, new schools and so on, we need to do more.  I am interested to hear what the Minister has to say.</p></reply>

Information from a range of sources, including school enrolment data and information on residential development activity, is used for this purpose.  Additionally, Project Ireland 2040 population and housing targets inform the Department's projections of school place requirements.</p>  <p>  Having considered the projected requirements in each school planning area, the Department makes an assessment of existing capacity in that area and its ability to meet any increased demand.  Where data indicates that additional provision is required at primary or post-primary level, the delivery of such is dependent on the circumstances of each case and may be provided through one or a combination of the following: utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools, extending the capacity of a school or schools and provision of a new school or schools.</p>  <p>  The Department's projections of post-primary school place requirements in east Cork show continued growth in enrolments in the short to medium term across most areas, with most growth anticipated in the Midleton-Carrigtwohill school planning area.  In response to projected future need and to enrolment pressures in the area, there has been significant capital investment by the Department in post-primary schools in east Cork.</p>  <p>  While the Department is aware of increasing pressures and demand for additional school places in east Cork, it is important to note that where enrolment pressures arise, it may be the consequence of a number of issues, for example, duplication of applications; school of choice; where some towns or areas have single sex schools and while places are available in the school they are not available to all pupils; or there may be an external draw of pupils coming from outside the local area.</p>  <p>  The Department is working to establish the true extent of capacity issues through ongoing discussions with the relevant school authorities.  In that context, similar to the process adopted in advance of the current academic year, the Department is engaging with patron bodies, including patrons of schools in east Cork, to identify capacity requirements for the forthcoming years which may necessitate further action.</p></speech>

I know she is aware of the unrelenting pressure on principals all this year and in previous years with respect to waiting lists.  At the start of this year, some schools had 300 children on the waiting list.  I know there has been duplication of enrolment with many parents applying to more than one school because they were concerned about not getting a place.  I understand there are children who still have not got a place.  Taking into account the huge projected growth in housing in the area, there is a need for further planning.</p>  <p>  Carrigtwohill community school has finally started.  I congratulate the Minister and her team for that.  It is fantastic.  I wrote to the Minister on this last week.  The educate together school in east Cork is looking for a secondary school and there is an opportunity to use the old secondary school in Carrigtwohill to establish a secondary school for educate together.  I know the Minister is familiar with this.  It is in temporary accommodation.  Will the Minister ask her officials to examine this possibility?  It could happen as early as 2023 but we need to start planning ahead for it now.</p></speech>

It is important to point out there has been significant development in the east Cork area.  The Deputy referenced Carrigtwohill Community College.  That will be a new school building which will cater for 1,000 pupils plus 3 SEN classes and it is being delivered under the Department's design and build programme.  It is currently at stage 4.  The letter of acceptance issued to the preferred tender on 1 June, commencing the school building contract for the school, as the Deputy has acknowledged.</p><p><i>10 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p>The Department has approved a grant to St. Aloysius' College, Carrigtwohill, to facilitate its expansion to cater for 1,000 pupils and two special educational needs, SEN, classes.  The project has been devolved to the school authority for delivery and is at stage 1.  The Department has approved a grant to Pobalscoil na Tr&iacute;on&oacute;ide in Youghal to facilitate its expansion to cater for 1,200 pupils and two SEN classes.  The project has been devolved to the school authority for delivery.  There is to be an extension to Col&aacute;iste an Phiarsaigh in Glanmire to cater for 1,000 pupils and two SEN classes.  There is a building project to expand the capacity of Carrignafoy Community College to cater for 600 pupils and three SEN classes.  This is being delivered by the patron, Cork Education and Training Board.  The project is at stage 1.  A devolved grant has been approved to facilitate the expansion of Col&aacute;iste Muire, Cobh, to include two SEN classes.  Considerable progress is being made in this area.</p></speech>

Many of these schools are already bursting at the seams and are almost oversubscribed with students, so we are running fast to stand still.  The work is very welcome and I am not decrying it in any way but we need to be proactive in our forward planning.</p>  <p>  I again ask the Minister whether she will ask her officials to examine the possibility of using this now empty premises, which is of very high quality and well appointed, as a place for an Educate Together secondary school in east Cork.  That could start as soon as September 2023.  Many of the projects the Minister is talking about will not be in place for quite a bit of time.  We know how long it takes to get building off the ground from our experience of Carrigtwohill.  This proposal could take a lot of the pressure off in the short term while providing parents with the second level Educate Together school they are asking for and want.  A report, which I know the Minister has on her desk, was issued by the parents and board of management of the Educate Together primary school in March 2021 regarding the secondary school crisis in east Cork.  This shows the great need, which will only grow in light of the thousands of houses that are earmarked for building in east Cork and which are about to be started.</p></speech>

I welcome everything the Minister has said.  The development of the campus in Carrigtwohill is very positive.  She mentioned Youghal, Cobh and a couple of other areas.  Doing some maths quickly, I see there are to be approximately 3,000 extra places.  At least the Department has acknowledged that the area is growing rapidly.</p>  <p>  I echo Deputy Stanton's sentiment with regard to Educate Together.  It has a very solid plan and is very driven.  There also seems to be demand for a secondary school.  As Deputy Stanton has said, we must be proactive rather than reactive on this issue.  I have already mentioned that, with the constituency database, we will have more statistics on age demographics and so on.  The stress on parents and families at the moment is immense.  I would welcome any improvement with regard to additional secondary school places.  Deputy Stanton and I are very aware that some secondary schools in Midleton cannot build up or out.  Additional places are not on the cards this year.  I appeal to the Minister for us to work together on this.</p></speech>

I also acknowledge the ongoing commitment of, and ongoing discussions with, Deputy O'Connor with regard to east Cork.  As I have said, I am very familiar with the area and am very conscious of its growth and development.  I appreciate the Deputies' acknowledgment of the significant investment the Department is making in the east Cork area.  It speaks for itself.  When I list the schools, it is very obvious we are committed to delivering the resources required in the area.</p>  <p>  As I said to the Deputies previously, it is also important to acknowledge we keep everything under review within the Department.  We constantly seek to reach out where there are issues.  I acknowledge the co-operation of the schools with regard to the sharing of information, which has been very positive and helpful.  We will continue to engage on the ground and to keep under review the information that is coming our way under the geographic information system, GIS.  We are committed to ensure anything required in any school area, including the east Cork area, is provided.</p></speech>

As I am sure the Minister knows, this will create a crisis for students seeking accommodation and will present real difficulties for those studying abroad and real problems for those with disabilities who are to go through an access programme, these programmes normally starting a week earlier than the regular college year.</p></reply>

The State Examinations Commission and the Department of Education are acutely aware of the needs of candidates and other stakeholders in regard to the provision of leaving certificate results, and the State Examinations Commission has being doing everything it can to ensure results are delivered as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  The intended date of Friday, 2 September, is in line with the date leaving certificate results issued to students in both 2020 and 2021.  Some 131,000 candidates are undertaking State examinations this year, which represents an increase of 6% on the last time a full set of junior cycle and leaving certificate examinations were run, in 2019.</p>  <p>  There are significant factors which, when taken together, meant it was not previously possible for the SEC to give a planned date for the issuing of leaving certificate results.  These factors included the holding of a deferred sitting of leaving certificate examinations for students who experienced close family bereavement, suffered serious injury or illness, or were unable to present for an examination on public health grounds due to Covid-19; the commitment that the overall set of results in 2022 would be no lower, in the aggregate, than the 2021 results; and the availability of sufficient numbers of examiners to mark written examinations.  In addition, as with other years, sufficient time must be allowed for an extensive range of checks and quality assurance procedures in advance of the issue of the results.  These are required to ensure the highest standards possible are maintained.  The State Examinations Commission has an absolute responsibility to examination candidates to ensure their work is marked to the highest standards of quality and integrity, and the commission must be able to stand over the results it issues each year.</p>  <p>  In March of this year, officials from my Department and the SEC briefed the further and higher education sector on challenges that could arise this summer.  Over the past two years, by working collectively with education stakeholders, it was possible for the further and higher education system to respond to the needs of students wishing to continue their education and training.  I am confident this will be the case again in 2022.  In similar fashion to the past two years, contacts with international counterparts are taking place and will continue over the summer to ensure Irish students continue to have all options available to them.</p></speech>

Is this going to be the norm now?  The Covid situation this year is quite different from the situation last year or the year before.  The norm previously was for results to be out in the middle of August.  This still left students in a difficult situation with regard to getting accommodation but it was more doable.  It is now left extremely late in the context of the existing accommodation crisis, which includes a crisis in student accommodation.  It is putting people under very substantial pressure.</p>  <p>  I do not really believe the reasons given by the SEC and the Minister stand up.  The provision of a deferred sitting for those who experienced a close family bereavement was mentioned.  That accounts for a relatively small number of cases.  I do not see why it would have to delay the results.  The Minister also mentioned giving effect to her commitment that the results would be no lower, in the aggregate, than last year's.  That commitment was made last February.  It seems the issue is again fundamentally one of planning.  We knew all of these things were happening.  Why were plans not put in place to avoid this situation?</p></speech>

For that reason, appropriate provision had to be made for students, taking that environment into account.  That is exactly what students, their families and the school communities wanted.  That is equally true with regard to our achievement in previous years.  It is remarkable that, throughout the Covid pandemic, we have found opportunities for students through the calculated grades process in 2020, the accredited grades process with the offer of a seated examination for students last year, which was almost unique in the world, and the full sitting of the examination this year with accommodation for a second sitting.  It is also important the commitment was given to students that the overall results in 2022 would be no lower, in the aggregate, than the 2021 results.  It is important the State Examinations Commission can stand over the integrity of the examinations.  It is not possible for the work to be done to ensure the grade profile for 2022 matches the 2021 profile until all examinations are completed.</p> <p>It is important from the students' point of view and the school communities' point of view that the <i>imprimatur </i>of the State Examinations Commission is provided for these exams.</p></speech>

I often find I am the one pointing that out.  It is the Government that is getting rid of long Covid leave.  It is the Department of Education that is telling very high-risk individuals they have to go back to the workplace.  Clearly, we are in a different situation than we were last year or the year before.</p>  <p>  Regardless of the reasons, will the Minister in her response focus on what the Department is going to do to mitigate and minimise the bad effects as a consequence?  What is the plan to assist students with getting accommodation?  What is the plan for those with disabilities who are accessing education through the higher education access route, HEAR, or the disability access route to education, DARE?  What will happen with the orientation weeks?  What action is the Department going to take to assist students who are planning to study abroad?  Has there been contact with UCAS in the UK and the equivalent bodies internationally to explain that the results will be delayed, in order to protect the places of those waiting for their leaving certificate results?</p></speech>

A family have contacted me as a young woman has been offered a course in the Netherlands that must be accepted on 26 August.  She has also been offered a course in Coleraine that has to be accepted on 1 September.  The first round of CAO offers will not happen until 8 September.  We can all see the logistical difficulties in that.  The Minister must communicate with international partners, UCAS and individual colleges in the North to ensure the likes of this student are not put out and do not end up in bad circumstances when that can be avoided.</p></speech>

In March of this year, officials from the Department of Education and the State Examinations Commission briefed the further and higher education sector on challenges that could arise this summer, particularly with regard to the release of results.  The further and higher education sector made provision in this regard last year and I have every confidence it will do likewise this year.  Those discussions took place in March so notification was provided as to the challenges there.  It is my understanding the results date is within the UCAS timeframe.</p><p>Regarding international students, in a similar fashion to the past two years, we have taken a very proactive approach.  I have written personally to my European counterparts on the matter.  That worked very successfully in previous years and I have every confidence it will work again this year.  Where there are specific issues, students can raise them directly with the college but there is also an email address they can write to if there is a particular difficulty.  That is available on <i>gov.ie</i>.</p></speech>

The school and trustees have indicated their willingness to support the Department in meeting educational needs in the area.  This is very positive and welcome.  The school has committed to making both mainstream places and places for pupils with special educational needs available.  This proactive and positive approach to providing for pupils with special educational needs must be commended and it is very welcomed.  In support of this provision for pupils with special educational needs, the Department has approved capital funding to provide the necessary accommodation under the additional school accommodation scheme.  As part of this project, the Department has also approved the provision of specialist rooms to support the school in its delivery of the curriculum to all of its students.</p>  <p>  As Deputy Carroll MacNeill will be aware, the school is located in an area that is undergoing significant growth, especially within the nearby Cherrywood strategic development zone.  Such development is considered as part of the Department&rsquo;s strategic planning for school accommodation needs.  The Department&rsquo;s strategic planning utilises a geographical information system and uses data from a range of sources, including enrolment data, school transfer patterns, census statistics, information on current and planned residential development and Project Ireland 2040 housing and population targets.  Analysis of capacity at existing schools also forms part of the Department&rsquo;s planning process, as well as the potential for expansion of schools in each area.</p>  <p>  The Department also works closely with local authorities in respect of their statutory planning processes, including with D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, where it has incorporated appropriate schools provision as part of the Cherrywood planning scheme.  This scheme includes four primary school sites and two post-primary school sites, intended to meet the education needs of the new population in Cherrywood.  The first school, a primary school, Cherrywood Educate Together National School, opened in September 2020.  The establishment of two further schools has been announced and planning in that regard is advancing in tandem with the pace of residential development.  However, my Department continues to keep school accommodation requirements under review in all areas, in consideration of primary, post-primary and special educational needs.  Additionally, under Project Ireland 2040 there will be an increasing focus on the upgrade and refurbishment of existing school stock, including an energy retrofit programme.</p></speech>

In the current school year, more than 121,400 children, including in excess of 15,500 children with special educational needs, were transported daily to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country.  The cost in 2021 was more than &euro;289 million.  It is worth noting that in recent years the number of children using the scheme has increased by in excess of 8,000.  During the previous academic year, there was an increase in capacity to cater for more than 1,700 additional pupils arriving from Ukraine.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Department commenced a review of the school transport scheme in February 2021.  The review is being conducted with a view to examining the current scheme and how it operates, its broader effectiveness and sustainability, and whether it adequately supports the provision of services to students and their families.  The review will also consider the objectives of the school transport scheme in the context of other Government policies as they relate to school transport and, in particular, the potential of the school transport scheme to promote sustainability in transport, reduce car journeys and support rural development.</p>  <p>  The review encompasses the school transport scheme for children with special educational needs.  The review of the primary and post-primary school transport schemes will examine each element of the schemes and include eligibility criteria, trends, costs, cost drivers, and overall effectiveness in meeting the objectives of the schemes.  The review will also examine the potential for integration of different strands of the scheme and a more co-ordinated approach with other Departments.  Following commencement of this review, the steering group presented me with an initial interim report.  Following consideration of this report, I approved the extension of temporary alleviation measures for the 2021-22 school year for transport for post-primary students who were otherwise eligible for school transport but were attending their second nearest school and had applied and paid on time.</p>  <p>  Wider considerations relating to operation of the scheme are now taking place in the next phase of the review, which is under way.  The technical working group has undertaken extensive consultation over recent months, including running a public survey for parents or guardians and students who use the service, as well as those who do not use the service but who would like to.  These engagements have yielded extensive data, which are now being considered.  The group has also consulted a broad array of stakeholders, including schools, special education interest groups, industry representatives and other Departments.</p></speech>

This is less about expanding school transport and more about intensifying it.</p> <p>Can the Minister get to the bottom of the occupancy rate of school buses?  Are they operating half full, three quarters full, or are they full to capacity?  I have raised specific locations around Waterford and Tramore where a school bus passes by the door of people who want to get to school.  They do not fall outside the eligibility criteria, but almost inside, since they are too close to the school.  If a school bus is passing that is not at full occupancy, can flexibility and an option for public transport be provided that addresses cost-of-living issues and our climate objectives?</p></speech>

That motivation is to ensure that we are meeting the needs of students and families, that we are providing opportunities, and that we have a clear emphasis on value for money.  We also want to ensure we are conscious of accessibility for students and of encouraging families to use buses and public transport as opposed to family cars.  The Deputy referred to the cost of living.  Just recently, conscious of the cost of living, there have been lower caps for multiple children, with a reduction in the cost of utilising the school transport system from &euro;650 to &euro;500 for secondary school children, and &euro;200 to &euro;150 for primary school children.  The reason for the review is ensuring that we have a service to meet the needs.</p></speech>

Could the Department come back to me with the occupancy figures for the buses and whether they are full, three quarters or half full?  If we are trying to get value for money for the taxpayer, the closer to full occupancy we can get, notwithstanding public health guidelines etc. the better.  A fuller bus is more cost efficient to run.</p>  <p>  Another matter I want to raise is tangential to what I raised in my initial question.  It arises from discussions I have had with Bus &Eacute;ireann and applies to many users, including me.  My first experience of public transport was when I was aged six, seven or eight, going to Butlerstown national school.  I am not sure it was an extremely positive experience of public transport.  Can there be investment in the public transport fleet so that the first experience of public transport is positive, with a good quality bus that operates to the highest standards?</p></speech>

I am under no illusions about it and appreciate that the Deputy is not either.  A significant service is being provided.  More than 121,400 students avail of it.  We intend to maximise use of the service.  In recent years, more than 8,000 more students have availed of the service.  Our objective is to ensure the maximum number of students are facilitated to avail of the school transport system.  We can see benefits all round for families, the environment and so much more.  The review engages all stakeholders, the general public, school communities, providers of the service and others.  All aspects and the point the Deputy raised are being looked at.</p></speech>

RACE was originally established to support students with a complex variety of special educational needs in accessing the examinations each year.  As well as providing accommodations for candidates with permanent or enduring special needs, the RACE scheme also provides for emergency situations that occur during the examinations each year.</p>  <p>  Until 2019, candidates who missed their leaving certificate examinations due to bereavement, or for any other reason, had no option but to sit their examinations the following year.  Deferred examinations were first held in 2019 for candidates who experienced bereavement of a close family member.  Prior to the pandemic, the SEC had been considering the broader issue of how best to support candidates experiencing different forms of trauma and adversity at examination time.  This included consultation with stakeholders, as well as research into practices in other jurisdictions.</p>  <p>  For the 2022 leaving certificate, the commission has considerably extended the eligibility for the deferred examinations to candidates unable to sit their examinations in the main sitting due to serious accident, injury or illness.  Candidates who are absent from examinations on public health grounds due to Covid-19 also have access to deferred examinations.  The overarching principles in providing deferred examinations to those who need them include safeguarding integrity and maintaining confidence in the leaving certificate to ensure equity and fairness for all candidates.</p>  <p>  Every effort will continue to be made by the SEC and by schools to accommodate candidates who suffer bereavement, illness, or other trauma either immediately before or during the examinations.  In addition, the longstanding arrangements under the RACE scheme to support candidates in taking their examinations as scheduled include sitting the examinations in special centres or in hospital, provision of rest breaks, and timetable alterations.  These arrangements are available to candidates ineligible for deferred examinations.</p></speech>

It stated, "A seizure is a seizure, whether it happens an hour before the exam or during the exam, it has the same impact on you."  My question is specifically about people who have to leave examinations during the examination.  I wrote to the Minister about an issue last week where a young man had to leave his history examination after experiencing acute appendicitis.  That young man was initially told that he would not be able to repeat the leaving certificate examination, which he had to leave in agony.  Following a sustained campaign by his family on social media and politicians getting involved, he was then allowed to sit the deferred examination.  We are asking for a simple change of policy that lets people who experience these extreme situations during an examination know that they do not have to go on social media to relive that pain and agony just to be able to resit an examination.  Can we offer a change of policy?</p></speech>

I am cognisant of the unique circumstances we find ourselves in this year, particularly due to Covid.  I have been an advocate from the beginning that there should be a second sitting of the examination.  I am mindful that students should have the maximum opportunity to showcase their talents.  The second sitting of the examination allows for that, particularly if there is a case of Covid, a significant medical emergency, a family bereavement or something of that nature.  In light of all that we have experienced this year, it is important to have a review of how the scheme operates and how this particular sitting of deferred examinations has operated.  There should be a review that engages all stakeholders.  The SEC is committed to that.</p></speech>

There are some issues with its deployment but we can talk about that on a different day.  The question I am asking today is about what happens when a person experiences a medical emergency during the examination.  The SEC previously stated that people would not be able to resit the examination.  There was a welcome change last week during an individual case.  Epilepsy Ireland has highlighted this issue for many years.  We are asking for a policy change to reflect that and this individual case.  I understand the Minister says it is the SEC's responsibility, but she is the leader in education.  Can we have a full review and a change of the policy to ensure that people know that if they go into an examination fearful of experiencing an issue such as an epileptic fit, they can resit the exam without having to take to social media or lobby politicians and finally get an outcome that they should have had anyway?</p></speech>

Again, I want to be clear.  I have never been ambiguous around the fact that I am an advocate of students getting the maximum opportunity to showcase their talents and present themselves in the best possible light at every step in education, including in the leaving certificate exam.  I have said very clearly that there will be a review of the operation of the scheme.  This is right and proper.  There has been great learning, this year and previously, and I believe we need to look at these learnings going forward.  At the centre of it must be the opportunity for students to perform to their best capacity.  This review, which will take place under the auspices of the SEC, will be very helpful and will provide direction going forward.</p></speech>

This followed the privatisation of three particular routes: Nos. 45A, 184 and 185.  At a time where we are supposed to be encouraging people and enticing them to use more public transport, a poor service is being provided by Go-Ahead Ireland in my constituency.  This has resulted in many people being left abandoned at bus stops because of services being cancelled at late notice.  This has developed into a situation where people will not use those routes because they cannot rely on them.  People are now resorting back to using their cars.  To say that privatisation has been a fiasco is an understatement at this stage.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State will be aware that Go-Ahead Ireland is receiving substantial State funding to provide this service, which is completely failing.  I have consistently raised this issue with the Minister for Transport and I have repeatedly met with the National Transport Authority, NTA.  The Minister has said that it is not his responsibility and that is up to the NTA.  I have also met with Go-Ahead Ireland.  The NTA and Go-Ahead Ireland are hiding behind a false narrative that it is down to staffing issues as a direct result of Covid.  Before Covid the excuse was that there was a bedding-in period but over the past two years, right up to this moment in time, the excuse for staff being missing is down to Covid, or whatever.  Clearly, there are staffing issues within Go-Ahead Ireland that is resulting in the poor service being provided.  This is fundamentally down to the pay and conditions offered to drivers.  Drivers are being trained and then quickly leaving Go-Ahead Ireland, which has resulted in a continuous recruitment campaign by Go-Ahead Ireland to recruit new drivers and train them in, only for them to subsequently move on.</p>  <p>  It seems there is this perpetual failure to provide a public service for bus users and potential bus users, certainly in my constituency. It has now got to a point where it is unsustainable.  People are now refusing to use public transport.  People are being left, at very short notice, standing waiting on a bus that does not show.  Last week, there were a couple of incidents where children and teenagers were left after the final two buses on the No. 185 route never showed up.  Those young people had to walk from Bray and to Enniskerry, along the 21 Bends, which is a very dangerous stretch of road.  The situation is now putting at risk the safety of members of the public.  The situation is counterproductive to the stated policy of the Government to encourage more people to use public transport. </p>  <p>  Will the Minister of State indicate what action is being taken to ensure that a better service is being provided?  As far as I can see, the time for Go-Ahead Ireland is well past.  We now need to take these routes back into public control to ensure a better and more reliable service is provided.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-06-30a.120" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1578" speakername="Hildegarde Naughton" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022063000012#K00500"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising this important topic.  I will take this matter on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan.  I understand that the Deputy's matter relates to the provision of bus services on routes operated by Go-Ahead Ireland, and whether any measures can or have been taken to improve these services.</p><p>My Department has responsibility for policy and overall funding in respect of public transport.  However, the Department is not involved in the day-to-day operation of public transport services nationally, including those public service obligation, PSO, routes currently operated by Go-Ahead Ireland.  The NTA has statutory responsibility for securing the provision of public passenger transport services nationally by way of public transport services contracts, and for the allocation of associated funding to the relevant transport operators.</p><p>PSO services are socially necessary but financially unviable services and the PSO programme represents a significant expenditure of taxpayers' money.  Funding support has increased in recent years.  Currently, the vast majority of PSO bus services are provided by either Dublin Bus or Bus &Eacute;ireann through what are known as direct award contracts.  The remaining routes are operated by Go-Ahead Ireland, which entered the market in September 2018 as part of Government's commitment to open up the bus market through a programme of tendering known as &quot;bus market opening&quot;.  A key Government objective is to provide all citizens with reliable and realistic sustainable mobility options.  Public transport plays a key role in the delivery of this goal.</p><p>To support this objective, in budget 2022, the Department secured &euro;538 million of funding for PSO and Local Link services provided by State operators and under contract by the NTA this year.  This includes more than &euro;200 million of Covid-19 emergency funding in 2022 to counter the continuing impacts of the pandemic on fare revenue across transport operators.</p><p>In the context of the Deputy's specific question regarding the PSO services currently operated by Go-Ahead Ireland, as the Deputy will be aware and as he alluded to, the Covid-19 health emergency has had a profound impact on the public transport sector due to the fall in passenger numbers, and the associated drop in fare revenues.  To date, passenger numbers remain below pre-Covid levels and demand is currently at 80% of that experienced in 2019.  This is expected to improve further in the coming months..</p><p>It is important to note that the pandemic has also had a significant impact on the staff of the various public transport operators that continued to operate throughout the crisis, with absences fluctuating throughout the pandemic as each new wave of the virus spread across the population.Unfortunately, Go-Ahead Ireland, in addition to a number of other public transport providers, is experiencing higher than normal levels of Covid-related staff absences at present.  As a result of these higher levels of staff absenteeism across the transport network, there has been a knock-on effect on service delivery, resulting in some services not operating as scheduled.  The NTA has advised that all public transport operators experiencing this issue are endeavouring to ensure that the first and last scheduled services operate as planned, and that consecutive bus services are not curtailed or cancelled, whenever possible.</p><p>The NTA has further advised that all public transport operators have for some months been working hard to recruit additional staff and, as a result, staff levels are beginning to improve gradually.  I will continue to engage with the authority to ensure that all operators in the bus market provide a satisfactory level of service to meet the demands of customers in line with their contracts.  I will also raise this directly with the Minister.</p></speech>

I could have predicted the response before I came in here.  It wastes my time and that of the Minister of State.  That is the response I have heard consistently over the past two years, namely that the impact of Covid on Go-Ahead is resulting in the poor service that is being delivered.  The poor service was there before Covid and it continues now.  The same response does not wash because I do not see the same volume of cancellations from Dublin Bus, which provides an excellent service in Wicklow.  There is not the same volume of cancellations.  The Minister of State said the operators are being advised not to cancel first or last bus services but that is happening.  It happened only last week in Wicklow on the 185 route.  It is having a direct, negative impact on the people who rely on the public transport service in Wicklow.</p>  <p>  The 45 route out of Wicklow is the only route out of the county that serves the National Rehabilitation Centre in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  People are missing appointments because the bus is not showing up.  One constituent told me last week that the 45 was cancelled at late notice and he had to use two other bus routes to get to the National Rehabilitation Centre.  It is having a direct negative impact.  It is no longer sustainable to hide behind Covid. The service has clearly failed.  </p>  <p>  I have two specific questions.  How long is left on the contract?  We need to seriously look at reversing the contract and giving it back to Dublin Bus, which can and will provide a far superior service.  What measures have been taken by the NTA?  What penalties have been imposed on Go-Ahead for its clear failure to meet its obligations under the contract to provide a fit-for-purpose service?</p></speech>

Go-Ahead Ireland is actively taking steps to reduce the impact of the increased level of staff absences on service provision through an extensive campaign to recruit new bus drivers.  The NTA and Go-Ahead Ireland are currently reviewing the existing service timetables and schedules to determine whether a modified timetable could be implemented over summer months when passenger demand is reduced, thereby reducing service disruption.  It is hoped that a combination of these measures will help to significantly reduce the service provision issues that have occurred recently.  I will raise the issues and the questions that the Deputy put directly to me with the Minister for him to come back to the Deputy with a response.</p></speech>

The Minister of State will be aware that as she drives around the country that the price of fuel in the forecourts has rocketed in recent months.  It could be between &euro;2.10 or &euro;2.20 for a litre of diesel or petrol in most places.  This is hitting people hard in the pocket.  I very much welcome the intervention to date on the cost of fuel.  Without that excise reduction delivered some months ago, we would probably be looking at prices hovering around &euro;2.40 per litre for diesel and petrol.  That has helped however most people filling a tank of diesel or petrol weekly will notice a significant increase in the cost of getting from A to B.  In most cases people are travelling to and from work, dropping children to or from childcare and doing the necessary journeys that people have to make every day in the course of their lives.  There is very little recreational driving going on at the moment because people simply cannot afford to do that.  I am asking that the Government to intervene further as soon as possible.  I understand this could be done through statutory instrument.  The Government could give a waiver for a year on renewing their motor tax.  This was something that we were able to do very easily during the Covid emergency when motor tax and NCTs were about to expire.  It was possible to extend the term over coverage with the stroke of a pen.  Rather than asking people to pay yet another bill to cover their cars with motor tax for 12 months that they be given further time free of charge to give them a break.</p>  <p>  The Government is getting the tax back through increased VAT on fuel and everything else in the economy.  It is only fair that we give a break here.  I have been told we can do no more on excise on fuel.  I welcome the measures that have been put in place to date but this is something that could very easily be done to target the motorist in a very positive way and give them a bit of a break in recognition of the extraordinarily high prices that are being charged for fuel at the moment.  It is something that would constitute an emergency measure but this is an emergency.  People are really suffering.  They cannot afford to pay their bills.  I welcome reports this morning that the budget is due to be brought forward to September.  This is something I raised at our parliamentary party budget meeting on Tuesday.  It gives adequate time to prepare a comprehensive package of measures to address the cost-of-living crisis and all the other challenges we have in the country but the budget will be earlier than normal.  The sooner these interventions can be made the better.  I am asking that before that, consideration would be given on motor tax that would give motorists a break and one less bill to pay for 12 months at least.  It is the least we could do in the circumstances.  It would make sense and the benefits would be felt throughout the economy because the cost of delivery and transportation impacts on all the products and services we use.  It would also be felt by the wider community and immediately by the motorists themselves. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-06-30a.125" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1578" speakername="Hildegarde Naughton" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022063000013#L00500"><p>Motor tax receipts in 2021 were &euro;908 million.  Motor tax receipts accrue to the Exchequer.  Changes to motor tax rates, including the potential abolition of motor tax, require primary legislation.  These changes are made at budget time and are  given permanent effect as part of the finance Bill.</p>  <p>  A number of issues need to be considered in any proposal to abolish motor tax.  The driver and computer services division of my Department is  responsible for the maintenance of the national vehicle and driver file, NVDF, the central vehicle database, as well as supporting systems in local motor tax offices.  The annual cost of running the NVDF is currently &euro;22.9 million.  However, the NVDF also supports road traffic enforcement, vehicle testing and the road transport operator licensing system and there would be a continuing requirement for it to remain in operation.  Abolishing motor tax would require a legal framework to be put  in place to ensure regular notification of vehicle and driver details to the NVDF, and compliance with that framework, to maintain an up-to-date vehicle database.  Abolition of motor tax would result in savings on the paper cost of discs, and on printing and postage, as well as some savings on staff costs.  However, it is estimated that would amount to total savings of just under &euro;4 million in the Department.</p>  <p>  The Department of Housing, Heritage and Local Government publishes the amalgamated audited annual financial statement for all the local authorities on an annual basis.  The most recently published statement is for 2019 and gives the total cost of running the local authority motor tax service at &euro;29.41 million for the year.  Total savings, therefore, would be in the order of &euro;33.5 million for the Department and local motor offices combined.   </p>  <p>  Motor tax rates are not a contributor to the recent increases in the cost of living.  The last general increases in motor tax, affecting all vehicle categories, took  effect from 1 January 2013.  There were significant reductions in motor tax for goods vehicles in budget 2016, which took effect from 1 January 2016, with the top rate of tax being reduced from &euro;5,195 to &euro;900 annually.  There were also some increases to rates from 1 January 2021 for some private vehicles based on carbon dioxide emissions and registered between 2008 and 2020.  The rates applied only to the higher emitting bands C to G with rates increasing by between &euro;10 and &euro;50 annually.  These  changes applied to some 187,000 cars or approximately 8.5% of the total car fleet. </p> <p>Of those affected, 120,000 owners saw their annual tax increase by &euro;10 with the upper increase of &euro;50 applying to 7,000 vehicles.  Motor tax is payable for three, six or 12 months.  Any proposal to abolish motor tax would also need to consider the position of vehicles under current taxation at the time of abolition.  It is likely that the owners of such vehicles would look for refunds of the proportion of motor tax paid for the time remaining on the disc.  This would add significantly to the first-year cost of abolition as 2.9 million vehicles are under current taxation at any given time.</p> <p> Another aspect to be factored in are the provisions of the Eurovignette directive, which provides a legal framework for charging heavy goods vehicles for the use of certain roads.  While the directive largely concentrates on the provision of mechanisms for infrastructure charging, it also sets minimum rates for vehicle taxes applied by member states to heavy goods vehicles.  The minimum rate for the heaviest band is &euro;929.  Since the reduction in motor tax from January 2016 to a top rate of &euro;900, Ireland has been in technical breach of the directive.</p> <p> Last but not least, motor tax is an important environmental policy lever.  Motor tax based on CO2 emissions is on a graduated banding structure differentiating in favour of the most environmentally-friendly vehicles.  Abolishing motor tax would reduce the incentive for owners to move to less polluting vehicles, potentially impacting the transport emissions target for 2030 set out in the Climate Action Plan 2021.  In addition, the Commission on Taxation and Welfare may have considered this area as part of its deliberations on how the taxation system can be used to help Ireland move to a low-carbon economy.  Any proposals to review or change motor tax should also be mindful of the commission's recommendations once published.</p></speech>

I emphasise that I am clearly not talking about motor tax abolition; I am talking about giving a break to motorists at the moment in respect of a Government charge on an activity that is already heavily taxed and is already extremely expensive because of a number of factors, many of which are outside the control of the Government.  While I am not talking about abolition, I am talking about giving people a bit of breathing space for a limited period because motorists are already paying more than anyone ever anticipated to get from A to B.</p>  <p>  Because of the structuring of our motor taxation system, doing that would give owners of older vehicles, people who are typically less well off, more of a break than owners of newer vehicles because the ridiculous system we have taxes older cars much more.  Someone can drive a newer car with a value of multiples of that of an older car and pay a fraction of what the owner of the older car pays.  This would be a very fair measure.</p>  <p>  I very much welcome some of the positive interventions, including reducing the prices of public transport.  However, those interventions do not affect rural dwellers for whom public transport is not an option.  It is either non-existent or not responsive to their needs in getting from A to B, getting to work, or dropping children to school, childcare or elsewhere.  This would be a targeted measure to give those people a bit of help with their transport costs because they cannot avail of the Government interventions in reducing public transport prices.</p>  <p>  In conjunction with the Department of Finance, the Department of Transport needs to give this further consideration.  This measure could be introduced pre-budget through a statutory instrument.  I ask the Minister of State to reconsider the matter to give the hard-pressed motorists of the country a bit of a break because we know things will not get easier any time soon.  The Government needs to reduce any charges it is putting on motorists as much as we can.  We can control some things and we need to intervene where we can do so.</p></speech>

Before I get into it, I would like to say that for anyone who needs an abortion, the HSE's MyOptions service will help them find their nearest provider.  People can phone 1800-828010 or go to <i>myoptions.ie</i>.</p><p>Last week, the news broke that the US Supreme Court had overturned Roe <i>v</i>. Wade, the case permitting termination of pregnancies across that jurisdiction.  It was a shocking reminder that rights established for decades can quickly be removed.  Equally worrying was the scale of celebration and pace at which lawmakers, primarily men, moved to restrict healthcare for girls and women.  These events are a sobering warning.  Some people in Ireland, including politicians, joyfully welcomed the news that the lives of girls and women were being put at risk, and we know this is especially the case in disadvantaged and minority communities.</p><p>While the right to bodily autonomy and healthcare, including termination - because abortion is healthcare - has been established by popular vote here, we know nothing is guaranteed.  Some groups are still actively working to deny the will of the Irish people and threaten hard-won rights.  However, we also know that the work is not completed to ensure that all people who need it have access to free, safe, and legal abortions in Ireland.</p><p>Recent UK Department of Health and Social Care figures show that 367 people from the island of Ireland were forced to travel to Britain for an abortion in 2021 - 206 from the Republic and 161 from the North.  These are just the UK figures of people giving Irish addresses.  In reality, there are many more.</p><p>For those travelling from the Republic, the vast majority were more than 12 weeks pregnant, with fatal foetal anomaly cases being the leading reason.  This is an indictment of our current abortion laws.  These are not abstract numbers; each one is a person being forced to leave the State for healthcare.  In many cases, it is women and their partners enduring the pain of complicated pregnancies and foetal anomalies.  These are heart-breaking and clinically complex situations.  It is beyond disgraceful that our laws after repeal are still forcing hundreds of girls and women to travel for healthcare.</p><p>They are in the midst of the most difficult and emotional decisions they will ever have to make.  They then need to navigate travelling to another jurisdiction, going through the chaos of Dublin Airport, or being fearful if they can afford it in a cost-of-living crisis.  People living in rural areas, working-class people, disabled people, migrants and people living in direct provision all face additional barriers.  It is important to note that the Abortion Support Network is a UK charity which provides financial assistance, accommodation and consultation to people from Ireland and other jurisdictions to access care in Britain.</p><p>Our laws are forcing suffering onto people already going through one of the worst events of their lives.  The incredible work of Termination for Medical Reasons and all the courageous women and families who told their stories reveal the lived reality of this oppressive legislation.  The current review of the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018 must remove these cruel restrictions.  Other restrictions need to also be addressed, such as the three-day waiting period, which has no basis in medical science, and the absence of abortion services in large parts of the country.</p><p>Recent events in the US have brought this situation back into the headlines, but it has been the lived experience for many since repeal.  It is now up to the Government to help them.</p></speech>

The Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, sends his apologies.  I am taking the matter on his behalf and I will read out his exact script if that is okay.</p>  <p>  It is important that we acknowledge the very upsetting situations faced and difficult decisions made by the people behind these statistics, and the very sad circumstances that surround these terminations of pregnancy.  As the Deputy will be aware, the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act permits terminations to be carried out in cases where there is a risk to the life, or of serious harm to the health, of a pregnant woman; where there is a condition present likely to lead to the death of the foetus either before or within 28 days of birth; and without restriction up to 12 weeks of pregnancy. </p>  <p>  Expanded termination of pregnancy services commenced on 1 January 2019 and are provided through participating doctors and hospitals throughout the country.  However, I am aware that statistics reported by the Department of Health and Social Care in the UK showed that women with Irish addresses continued to access termination of pregnancy services in that jurisdiction in 2021.</p> <p><i>11 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p>I assure the Deputy that it is a priority for my Department that the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018 is fully implemented and is performing as it should be to enable all women in Ireland to access services quickly and easily without bias or judgment.  There has been a substantial reduction in the number of people with Irish resident addresses availing of termination of pregnancy services in the UK since the enactment of the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018 and the commencement of services.  There is regular ongoing engagement between the Department of Health and the HSE to facilitate the operation of the service and to resolve any issues that may arise.  We will continue to ensure the positive rolling out and enhancement of these healthcare services.</p> <p> Four years ago, the Irish people voted decisively to change the Constitution and give the Legislature responsibility to regulate termination of pregnancy services.  The people voted in the knowledge of the legislative proposals that would be progressed to deliver on this outcome.  In line with the statutory and Government commitments, the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, has commenced this review of the operation of Act.  The review will assess the effectiveness of the operation of the legislation and will be conducted in a fair and transparent manner.</p> <p> The review is being led by an independent chair and comprises two main phases.  As part of the first phase of the review, information and evidence on the operation of the Act is being collected from women who use the service and from health professionals who provide the service, along with the views of the public through a public consultation, which closed on 1 April.  In the second phase of the review, the chair will assess the extent to which the objectives have and have not been achieved and will make recommendations to address any barriers identified.  The chair is expected to conclude her report and provide a report to the Minister at the end of the year.  This process will provide an important examination of how our termination services are operating and will give us a chance, where necessary, to identify improvements to the operation of the Act.</p></speech>

There were 367 women who travelled to the UK that we know of but clearly there are many more, and they did not have access to that healthcare in Ireland.  It is deeply disappointing and concerning that the Government is determined to review only the operation of the Act rather than providing the changes necessary to prevent further suffering.  Could we honestly say we are happy with the fact that women and families who received the worst possible news are being forced to travel to another country for healthcare?</p>  <p>  The review of the legislation is a missed opportunity to update our laws in line with best medical practice and the lived experience of families.  Regrettably, the lack of action and resolve on this and related issues is clear.  The Government has failed to bring forward promised legislation on safe access zones around GP surgeries and hospitals.  Instead, the Together for Safety group has, in co-ordination with Senators, sought to progress a Bill where the Government has failed to do so.</p>  <p>  There is also the larger context of maternal healthcare in Ireland.  We are years, if not decades, away from a patient-centred system in which midwives have a leading role.  We have shockingly low rates of home births in Ireland, with an institutional culture of forcing women into maternity hospitals.  The Community Midwives Association and the Midwives Association of Ireland have called the HSE ban on water births "non-evidence based, unethical and inequitable".  More than 3,000 women annually are hospitalised because of severe pregnancy sickness when a medication that could assist in many cases is unavailable on the drugs payment scheme or medical card.  There is also a vastly disproportionate over-representation of ethnic minority women among maternal deaths in Ireland.</p>  <p>  All of these matters are connected to how maternal and abortion healthcare are treated in Ireland.  An unwillingness to provide the full range of abortion care needed by girls and women is the same unwillingness to provide the full range of properly resourced maternal healthcare.  We need change.</p></speech>

I will bring back her comments to the Minister, Deputy Donnelly.  The Deputy mentioned medication that might stop women being hospitalised because of sickness and I will bring it up again.  My understanding is that it was to progress.  I believe it is called Cariban and I will get the Deputy an update on its availability in the drugs scheme.  We all believe it should be included.</p></speech>

I ask for a progress update on the ongoing house building targets for 2022.  We have seen some reports in the media during the week and there seems to be a discrepancy between details provided by the Department and what will realistically be produced.  I would appreciate the Minister providing an update in that regard.</p>  <p>  I am in my mid-20s and the youngest Member in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, so I am acutely aware of the significant challenges facing a new generation of people without assets who want to be able to purchase their own homes but simply cannot because of the current level of pricing.  It is an enormous concern and this Government more than any other in recent memory has given it the priority it deserves.  I have plenty of confidence in the current plan being put forward, although I have some concerns around who will end up owning the homes we build on completion.  These are valid concerns that must be put forward and I will take this opportunity to make that particular point.</p>  <p>  In the construction of new housing it is great to see a significant ramping up of social and affordable housing.  I want to put the case for tens of thousands of young, educated working professionals who are the life of the Irish economy but who are unable to purchase their own homes.  I am a Cork Deputy but I will speak about Dublin because it is important to recognise it as a primary city that is a huge part of the ecosystem of developing young working professionals who may be educated in Cork, Galway and Dublin.  People travel from all over the country to work in Dublin in many of our companies across a range of different sectors at a young age before eventually transferring back to their home.  That seems to be the pattern for so many young Irish working people.</p>  <p>  Somebody who wants to rent a two-bedroom apartment in this city with the simple luxury of an en suite bathroom could expect to pay well in excess of &euro;2,000 per month.  With parking, that could go to &euro;2,600 or &euro;2,800 in many parts of the city.  This shows the system is utterly broken.</p>  <p>  I respect the Central Bank of Ireland's independence but we are elected by the people.  It must be acknowledged that for so many people who are fortunate or in a good position to earn a high wage, it is unrealistic to expect them to get a 10% deposit if they have been paying extremely high rents over five, six or seven years, which in itself proves they are more than capable of meeting mortgage repayment obligations.  As a Government we must go to the Central Bank to outline our specific concerns in that regard.</p>  <p>  There are so many people who could buy a house tomorrow, with mortgage repayments significantly lower than rent.  Although a mortgage is a major burden on every family in this country and any individual who is repaying a mortgage, at the end of the term he or she owns the asset.  It would not be a cuckoo fund in Singapore, Shanghai or Tokyo owning it.  It is deeply frustrating to know this when I listen to many of the esteemed economists advising there is a requirement for them to be involved with the market to push the building of new premises in this country.</p>  <p>  The simple reality is those who are in a position to be able to purchase houses in Ireland and repay mortgages are being restricted because they are paying high rents and there is a requirement for a deposit when buying.  It is perhaps something we could look at.  I look forward to the information the Minister of State will provide to the House on housing provision for 2022.</p></speech>

I am taking this on behalf of the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, who sends his apologies but who has provided me with the reply to the Deputy's question.</p>  <p>  Housing for All is the Government's plan to increase the supply of housing to an average of 33,000 per year over the next decade.  This includes the delivery of 90,000 social homes, 36,000 affordable purchase homes and 18,000 cost rental homes out to 2030.  The focus of the social housing programme will be to increase the number of new builds with a target to reach delivery of more than 9,500 new-build homes on average every year for the next five years to 2026.</p> <p>In September 2021, the Minister issued targets for new-build social housing to all local authorities for the period 2022 to 2026.  Delivery of affordable new housing is also a key objective across the affordable housing delivery streams.  In March of this year, five-year affordable purchase and cost rental delivery targets were issued to those local authorities with an identified and significant need for affordable housing provision.  </p> <p> One of the actions in Housing for All requires local authorities to develop and submit housing delivery action plans to include details of their social and affordable housing delivery.  In the action plans, local authorities provide information on the location where housing will be delivered and the planned number of homes to be delivered in each year.  The plans also include information on other delivery streams, including delivery by local authorities, approved housing bodies and the Land Development Agency, LDA.  All local authorities submitted initial housing delivery action plans to the Minister in December and there has been further engagement between local authorities and the Department to ensure all plans are consistent with social and affordable targets, in addition to the range of policies set out in Housing for All.  </p> <p> This year sees the beginning of delivery under the range of affordable housing programmes, representing the first State-supported affordable housing and delivery in a decade.  Households are already enjoying the benefits of the new cost rental tenancies, with over 200 homes already tenanted and more schemes opening between now and the end of the year.  </p> <p> The first local authority affordable purchase homes in south Dublin will have their new owners next month and in Cork city, we will be advertising shortly affordable homes for purchase in two schemes.  In addition, the first home shared equity schemes will launch next week and will be funded to support 8,000 home purchases by 2026 by affordability constrained first-time buyers and some households starting again under a fresh start principle.  I hope that addresses some of the questions the Deputy asked.  I do not believe the Minister would have been able to address the issue raised regarding the Central Bank in his statement.</p></speech>

That is a little frustrating and I wish to underline it.  I am sure my constituents in Cork East and every Deputy's constituents want those figures and want certainty.  I know the Minister of State shares that view.  I thank her for the response and I appreciate it but I ask her to bring back to the Minister the message that I want this year's figures, which I asked for but did not get this morning.</p>  <p>  We have done Trojan work.  The sole focus of much of the discussion in Fianna F&aacute;il was that we would take the broken housing system when we entered Government in 2020 and try to put in proactive measures to increase the supply of housing, despite having to deal with a pandemic.  That cannot be disputed and I fundamentally disagree with what many Opposition parties wanted to do to fix the problem.  By tearing up the rule book, we will push the process back by a number of years.</p>  <p>  When these houses come on stream, whether it is the houses for which planning permission has been granted or new private housing developments, I am concerned about who is going to buy them.  I want domestic residents and first-time buyers in this country to be prioritised over the next two to three years.  I make no apology for saying that.  We need to tackle the argument that there is a necessity to have vulture and cuckoo funds and other institutional investors involved in financing the construction and purchase of new apartment developments and housing developments in this country in order for them to be built.  We must remove that argument and reallocate that demand by looking at the tens of thousands of people who in recent years have clearly demonstrated that they can afford to pay the price of a mortgage because many are paying rents that are double what they would pay in a mortgage.  I ask that the Minister champion this matter on behalf of the House with the Central Bank.  While I recognise the Central Bank's independence, it is failing and that has to be acknowledged.  The social and economic consequence of what is happening when it comes to who is purchasing residential property is absolutely shocking and we need to put a stop to it.  That is my view and the view of tens of thousands of young working professionals, many of whom feel they have been forgotten about.</p></speech>

We are committed to delivering on targets across all pathways of the plan.  The delivery of social and affordable homes is central to the plan and these homes are expected to comprise approximately half of the housing delivery over the next decade.  The provision of individual local authority targets and the development of housing delivery action plans addressing delivery over the next five years has introduced a more strategic approach to housing delivery.  Local authorities are working closely with the approved housing bodies, delivery partners and the LDA to develop a pipeline to ensure we meet these targets.</p>  <p>  A central element of Housing for All is to build institutional capacity.  As part of the measures to support institutional capacity, Housing for All commits to strengthening the capacity of the local authorities to initiate, design, plan, develop and manage housing projects and to recognise that this requires the resourcing of the housing services of local authorities.</p>  <p>  Funding has been approved for 250 new posts for local authorities to support the delivery of social housing and work is nearing completion to identify additional resources required to support the delivery of affordable housing.  The Government, the Minister and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage will continue to work closely with local authorities and all the key stakeholders to support the delivery of social and affordable housing.</p>  <p>  That addresses the content of the Topical Issue matter the Deputy raised.  He also raised the need to recognise the capacity of young professionals to earn more and how they could be accommodated in the purchasing of new homes.  That is the message I heard and it is one I will bring back to the Minister.</p></speech>

T&aacute; siad ag streachailt cheana f&eacute;in agus ag tabhairt aghaidh anois ar chostais fhilleadh na scoile agus muid ag bogadh isteach sa samhradh.  Anuraidh, chuaigh go leor teaghlach isteach i bhfiach leis na costais seo a &iacute;oc, agus i mbliana, beidh na costais seo ag br&uacute; go leor teaghlach thar an imeall.  T&aacute; taca&iacute;ocht de dh&iacute;th ar na teaghlaigh seo anois.</p>  <p>  Throughout the State, families are in the midst of a cost-of-living crisis.  Many parents find themselves under serious financial pressure.  Times are very tough for parents whose number one priority is their children.  I have said before that the cost-of-living crisis is happening right here, right now.  Workers and families cannot afford to wait any longer.  There is a serious concern that, faced with a cost-of-living crisis, families will face real difficulty in meeting back-to-school costs.  Many parents are viewing their child returning to school in August with a sense of dread.  They are sensing that because of high costs at a time when they are already being put to the pins of their collars.  Schoolbook lists began to arrive last week and this week in many households across the State.  No parent should dread their child's return to school but that is what is happening in so many households.</p>  <p>  My party's education spokesperson, Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire, spoke to a mother from Cork who faces back-to-school costs of &euro;1,700.  She is, in her own words, terrified as to how she can make ends meet.  Last year, a back-to-school survey was carried out by the Irish League of Credit Unions, which found that parents were spending &euro;1,500 per child returning to secondary school and &euro;1,200 per child returning to primary school.  One quarter of these families were going into debt to cover these costs.  That means using their credit cards, taking out loans and even going to the local moneylender just to send their kids to school.  This year, in a cost-of-living crisis where bills and prices have continued to spiral, many parents are stressed and really anxious.  A child's education should be a cherished right, but for so many, the price of education is a cause of concern and anxiety.  That is simply wrong.</p>  <p>  This week, we heard from staff at Barnardos who described families buying their children pyjamas to wear in the daytime because it was the cheapest option.  It was the only option they could afford.  For a Republic that was meant to be established on the basis of cherishing all the children of the nation equally, this is the grim reality of Ireland today.</p>  <p>  Last night, the Government voted against Sinn F&eacute;in's motion to introduce an emergency budget that would lift the pressures off families in the here and now, including measures to support them in meeting back-to-school costs.  Given the Government's vote against Sinn F&eacute;in's motion last night, the T&aacute;naiste's message to struggling workers and families is clear: the Government will not provide further support to them now or over the summer months.   The message is simply clear that they are on their own during this time.</p>  <p>  What will the T&aacute;naiste say to that terrified mother in Cork who faces school costs of &euro;1,700 and does not know how she will make ends meet?  What will he say to her given the Government's stance that it will have no further interventions until budget time?  What will he say to the tens of thousands of other mothers and fathers in exactly the same position, worried about how they will meet the costs of their children going back to education as the school bills roll in this week like they did last week?</p></speech>

Indeed, this is the case all around the world.  Governments are doing their best to deal with that but there is only so much any government can do.  Obviously, people have seen big increases in the cost of petrol and diesel, utility bills, grocery bills and other bills as well.  Everyone is feeling the squeeze, of course, but some people, particularly those on the lowest incomes, those with large families and those in rural areas, are feeling the pinch of that all the tighter.  Sometimes, they have to make very difficult decisions on what to spend money.</p>  <p>  The Government has acted already.  If the Deputy compares what we have done in Ireland relative to what has been done in similar countries, we have done just as much if not more.  As the Deputy knows, we had a budget package that kicked in in January with an increase in the minimum wage, reductions in income tax and increases in pension and welfare payments, including targeted payments such as the living alone allowance and fuel allowance.  We effectively had a mini-budget or emergency budget already, with &euro;1.4 billion in measures since the budget, including reducing excise on petrol and diesel, reducing VAT on electricity and gas, the &euro;200 discount on people's electricity bill and a further fuel allowance payment.  That is just to give a few examples of what has being done since the budget.</p>  <p>  Of course, other measures will take effect before the budget in the autumn.  As the Deputy knows, the school clothing and footwear allowance will be available for those who are eligible for it.  We increased the funding for that significantly in recent years.  For those attending third level institutions, the increase in the SUSI grant will take effect alongside the fact more people will become eligible for it.  Those measures were announced in the budget but they will actually take effect over the course of the summer in terms of people going back to school and college.</p>  <p>  Obviously, facing a big bill can often be the toughest thing for people.  People might be getting by week by week, but obviously, a big bill arriving can be a big difficulty for a family.  They might be getting by week to week but that big bill, whether it is for car repairs or back-to-school costs, can hit people very hard.  As I said, much has been done already with &euro;2.4 billion for families to help them with the cost of living.  There is more planned in the autumn in and around the budget.  We want a set of actions that will take effect almost immediately in the days and weeks after budget day to help people through the winter in particular.  A series of more regular moves will take effect then in January.  That is the plan on which we are doing much work at the moment.  As I said, the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance will become available over the course of the summer as well as the improvements in the SUSI grant for those attending third level institutions.</p></speech>

As the T&aacute;naiste acknowledged, they are already dealing with petrol, diesel, home heating oil, energy, food and clothing costs skyrocketing and going in the wrong direction.  Now, as kids finish up their school year, the bills are starting to roll in.  It is &euro;1,500 per child going to secondary school and &euro;1,200 per child going to primary school.  There are no additional interventions from Government.</p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste spoke about what the Government might do in the budget.  These bills need to be met in the here and now.  These school bills need to be dealt with.  The kids are going back to school at the end of August.  The T&aacute;naiste, along with his Government colleagues, decided that he will make no further interventions over the next number of months for these families and tens of thousands of families like them who are struggling right here, right now.  They do not know where they will get the money to pay for basic things like schoolbooks for their children or a school uniform to put on their kid's back come August.  I plead to the T&aacute;naiste on behalf of these individuals and many more like them that the Government needs to change tack and bring forward an emergency budget.  It needs to reverse the decision it made and see that the cost-of-living crisis is happening right here, right now.  The T&aacute;naiste has an obligation and a moral responsibility to support these families at this time.</p></speech>

It will happen all the way through to the budget and continue after the budget.  That is the truth of it.  We are facing a global inflation crisis and it will not end because of any budget, whether that is an emergency budget before the autumn or one in autumn.  This is something with which we will be grappling for months if not years ahead.  It is caused by number of factors, of which the Deputy is very aware, that are very much internationally driven.</p> <p>There is no doubt that if we bring forward an emergency budget a few weeks time or a regular budget in the autumn, the first thing the Deputy will say is that it is inadequate and within weeks or months he will be calling for another emergency budget.  This is what we will see for the next year or two from Sinn F&eacute;in, and that is fine.  However, the Government has acted already.  We have acted since the budget and over the summer other measures will take effect, including pay increases for some people and in the public service, the back to school footwear allowance and the improvements in the Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, grant for third level.  Then we will have another package in autumn in the budget.</p></speech>

That is because over 200 children still do not have a school place on the last day in June for the coming September term.  It was a privilege yesterday to be joined by parents, advocates, SNAs, teachers and young people for the debate on the Labour Party's Autism Bill 2022, which seeks to address the serious shortfall in provision for autistic people, both adults and children, who are simply without services.  We heard words such as "hellish" and "a nightmare" used by parents when describing their experiences in securing services for their children.  We have asked the Government to take urgent action on this.</p>  <p>  We were glad the Bill was not opposed yesterday on Second Stage.  What we want is what children and adults in other jurisdictions have as a matter of right, which is a national autism strategy to address provision in education, healthcare, employment and training.  We see it in Northern Ireland under the Autism Act 2011, in England under the Autism Act 2009 and in Malta which has a national autism empowerment strategy.  My colleague, Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, has been calling for this for some time.  Indeed, over a year ago, Labour Party Deputies put forward a motion to introduce a national autism empowerment strategy.  We were promised action on that within a year by the Government and we accepted that response.  We waited for longer than a year but, regrettably, over a year on we are still hearing the same experiences and frustrations.  We saw this frustration expressed in the report of the Ombudsman for Children, a damning report of Government failures in regard to children.</p>  <p>  We do not believe that anybody in the Government thinks that a 36-month waiting list for an assessment or intervention is acceptable or that it is acceptable that over 15,000 children are being bussed out of their local communities to access an appropriate or acceptable education.  We do not think it is acceptable that so many schools are lacking the wraparound additional supports that are needed to ensure a proper and adequate education for children with autism.  In recent weeks we see news headlines still being dominated by a lack of provision and lack of school places.  Worst of all, we see children who are still without a guarantee of a place in the autumn.  I know the Government's legislation is to be debated tomorrow, but it is too little, too late for those children and their families.  What we heard from the groups, advocates and parents who were with us yesterday in the Visitors Gallery was an urgent desire for the Government to take steps today to ensure that we are not back in the same place next year.</p>  <p>  What timeline does the Government have to ensure we are not back in this position next year?  What timeline does it have for addressing the serious shortfalls in provision for children and adults who are lacking the basic human rights they should have just because they are autistic?  Why are we still failing those children and adults?</p></speech>

I emphasise that the Government is committed to ensuring that every child with special educational needs has access to an education.  One child who does not have a school place is one child too many.  We fundamentally believe that our most vulnerable children in society should be prioritised.  That is why the Government is introducing new legislation this week.</p>  <p>  The new Bill was approved by the Cabinet on Tuesday and it will ensure that adequate provision of special educational needs placements is available for the coming year.  We have school placements for probably over 1 million children - those who have special needs and those who do not - this year in September, but there is a particular issue with approximately 100 children in the Dublin area for whom we do not have a place.  We are determined to make sure that a place is made available, and not at the last moment in late August or September.  We want to make sure that parents know they have a place for their child in the coming weeks.  That is the timeline we are working towards.  The new process will allow a ministerial direction to be served on a school within six to eight weeks of receiving a report from the NCSE setting out its opinion that there are insufficient schools in a certain area.  Of course, we will endeavour to make sure that happens far more quickly.</p>  <p>  With regard to Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in's Bill, we very much welcome it as an important contribution to the debate on these issues.  I welcome the fact that the Labour Party is putting forward solutions.  It was discussed in the Cabinet during the week and the Government decided not to oppose it.  However, we are essentially doing what is proposed in it by developing our autism innovation strategy.  Work on that is very much advanced.</p></speech>

It is simply not good enough that there are 100 children in Dublin alone who do not have a school place for this coming September.  This is 30 June, the end of the school year.  As I said, we heard yesterday from parents who are very frustrated.  In some cases they have had to approach 18 or 25 schools simply to try to get a place for their child and were still unable to do so.  Many parents in my constituency, Dublin Bay South, are at the end of their tether trying to secure places.  There is a pinch point at every stage - transition to primary school, transition into secondary school and leaving secondary school and going to college or training.  At all these points parents have to fight so hard that it becomes a consuming exercise in activism for many of them.  They should not have to fight for what should be basic rights for their children and young adults who are simply not getting the recognition and support they require in the State.</p>  <p>  We heard yesterday from the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, about the strategy she is developing, but it is not to be underpinned by legislation.  That is simply not good enough.  Will the T&aacute;naiste commit to supporting our Bill and to ensuring there is a legislative basis for the strategy?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-06-30a.152" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="11:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022063000018#U00500"><p>We can certainly give that some consideration, but different jurisdictions do things differently.  It would not be the norm in Ireland, and it would not have been the norm when we were in government together, for a strategy to be underpinned by legislation.  Different jurisdictions do things differently, but I certainly will not rule it out.</p>  <p>  I absolutely agree with the Deputy on one point.  It is wrong that parents have to fight and struggle for a place in school for their children.  I met parents in Dublin 15 in my constituency who are in this position.  We managed to resolve it in our constituency in the vast majority of cases and I think we will resolve it very shortly.  There are things parents may have to fight for in life, but a place in a school should not be one of them.  I totally agree with the Deputy in that regard.</p>  <p>  In terms of the current position, I am told there are 80 children waiting for a place in a special class in Dublin who are not already in a mainstream setting.  Recent weeks have resulted in eight primary schools saying they will open special classes in the new school year.  This will reduce the number down to 56.  Further engagement is happening with schools at present.  That will continue intensively in the coming weeks with the intention of further reducing the number of children requiring a class placement.  The NCSE advice is that there is an adequate supply of special classes and special school places outside Dublin at this time.</p></speech>

Last Monday, a young man came to my office.  He is 27 years old and is married with two children.  He has been working, his wife is working and they have a mortgage.  Unfortunately, he had an accident and he is waiting for treatment.  He tried to continue to work but he had to give up the work five weeks ago.  He was getting some painkillers for the pain.  He was told when he was getting the injections that they would last up to six months.  The pain left him for five and a half weeks.  The prospect before him is 18 months waiting for an assessment.  Then he will have to wait another four years for surgery.  That is what he has been told by the hospital.  This young man cannot lift his children, he cannot drive and he can hardly walk.  That is his current position.  He is relying on his mother to bring him to the doctor and relies on his father to help around the house.  He has a mortgage to pay, which he is struggling to do.  This is not somebody who is looking for a handout or for something soft.</p>  <p>  This is what is happening with the services in the orthopaedic unit in Galway.  There are massive delays.  When Covid-19 started, I remember the T&aacute;naiste coming down the steps from Government Buildings to address the nation and setting aside all rules and regulations to make sure we dealt with it.  Today, the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, need to come down those steps again and tell us how we are going to address our fractured health system.</p> <p>The system was creaking before Covid but it has been further scarred by the effects of the pandemic.  It is important that we get the health service right.  We need infrastructure, additional beds, additional staff - when I say "staff" I mean nurses - and functioning accident and emergency units.  We also need to put in place the necessary services our people deserve.  We need to dispense with these codes for public procurement and appraisals for every project we have to undertake.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, is in the Chamber.  He has to take on board the fact that we cannot continue with the same processes, while the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, who is sitting beside him, is trying to improve services.  We need to take immediate, emergency, essential actions to make sure that whatever projects we have in place to improve our infrastructure and capacity are done rather than spending years looking at them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-06-30a.155" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="11:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022063000019#V00200"><p>I am afraid I do not have a specific note on orthopaedic waiting lists in Galway but I will make sure we get one and that we give the Deputy a fuller reply later.  I acknowledge there are far too many people waiting far too long for the operations they need in Galway and in all parts of the country.  Notwithstanding the fact we probably have 1,000 more beds than we had two years ago, more staff in our health service than ever before, a bigger budget than ever before, and more doctors than ever before working in our health service, we are, essentially, running up an escalator that is coming down at us.  That is because of an increasing and ageing population with increased needs, a pandemic and a cyberattack.  That has put us in a position that is not where we wanted or expected to be at this stage.</p>  <p>  We have an ambitious plan to reduce waiting lists that has been published.  The Minister for Health and I have been down the steps already with that plan.  It is a &euro;350 million plan to improve waiting times in 2022.  It is the biggest waiting list plan I have seen in my time in politics by quite a distance.  If it works, and a lot will depend on whether we get hit by serious waves of Covid, we should have fewer people on active waiting lists by the end of this year than at any point in the past five years.  I am not saying we will get there but it will be a huge achievement if we can get to the point, by the end of the year, where waiting lists will be at a five-year low.</p>  <p>  Every patient waiting more than six months for a high-volume procedure, which includes the vast majority of orthopaedic procedures, will be offered treatment through the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, this year.  The waiting list action plan identifies 15 high-volume procedures.  The commitment is made that anybody who is waiting more than six months and is clinically suitable can receive his or her care through the NTPF.  That fund has confirmed it has authorised offers of treatment to almost 7,000 people and has sufficient capacity to increase what it is doing by approximately 100% by September 2022, thereby offering treatment to all 75,000 patients who are waiting for these procedures by the end of the year.</p></speech>

I have a concern about all this money going in on the basis that, at the end of the day, it is not getting to the end user or patient.  There is significant problem with staff morale.  Nurses are leaving the public health service because they are completely disillusioned with what is happening.  We have fewer staff available to deal with patients on the wards.</p>  <p>  There is a daft idea relating to primary care centres that have been built.  For example, we have one in Tuam where there is no X-ray facility so everybody has to go to Galway to get their X-rays done.  I have talked previously about this with the Minister for Health.  His predecessor, Deputy Harris, allocated &euro;700,000 to put an X-ray facility in that primary care centre approximately four years ago.  Today, it still has not happened.  The equipment has been bought, is being stored in Germany and is probably out of date at this stage.  We just cannot build a room for it.  That is just a typical example of the challenges we have and how we get around them.  We need to look at this from a completely different perspective and get to the nub of the issue.</p></speech>

Waiting lists in Galway are comparatively worse than in other parts of the country, but there has been a lot of investment in recent years.  There is now more than 4,000 staff between University Hospital Galway and Merlin Park University Hospital; that is a 12% increase since this Government was formed.  The budget for both hospitals is now more than &euro;400 million, which is a 10% increase since this Government was formed.  Construction of a temporary emergency department is under way, which should be completed later this year.  The building of a new radiation oncology unit is also under way.  We are very keen to get the new emergency department, and the new maternity and paediatric units, into planning as soon as possible.  I have spoken directly to the CEO of the HSE about this in the past couple of weeks.  I share the enormous frustration that the project is progressing so slowly.  I will take a personal interest in it.</p></speech>

To come to this conclusion, all we have to do is listen to any interview with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, or the Taoiseach.</p>  <p>  A recent EUROSTAT report from the European Commission revealed that Ireland was the most expensive EU country when it comes to the cost of living.  Prices in Ireland were found to be a staggering 40% higher than the EU average in 2021 and matters have worsened significantly since then, as we all know.  The report also revealed that, astonishingly, the cost of housing in Ireland was 88.5% higher than the EU average and a staggering 88% higher for utility bills such as electricity and gas.  The average cost of food here was 17% higher than in the EU27 countries.  These are the figures we are talking about.  Milk, cheese and eggs were found to be an average of 25% higher in cost, fats and oils were 22% higher, while breads and cereals were typically 20% higher.</p>  <p>  Despite Ireland's crippling cost of living, the Government has failed to act in any meaningful way, although EU governments have taken many measures to cut back on excise duties.  The Rural Independent Group has tabled motions on this matter, as have other groups.  Last night, there was another vote on a Sinn F&eacute;in motion.  We also tabled a Private Members' motion last April asking the Government to axe the carbon tax, which would have the impact of putting approximately &euro;8,000 directly into every person's pocket and knocking ten cents off the price of a litre of fuel by 2030, but that was rejected.</p>  <p>  The Government has remained tone deaf on many issues, despite the people suffering.  As I said, the current cost-of-living crisis is financially crippling lower income earners, including pensioners, struggling mortgage holders and, of course, the unemployed.  It is also having a disproportionate impact on all residents and farmers throughout the country.  Research has shown the impact of the crisis on rural dwellers has been much higher.  We all know that from listening to people every day of the week.  Rural communities and farmers face crippling costs for feed, fertilisers and fuel, which has the potential to wipe out many viable farms.  That is the fact of it. </p>  <p>  The Government brought in what I call an inept package.  It is trying to play a three-card trick on the people by bringing in these little measures while taking so much excise duty from every litre of fuel.  The public has copped on to this.  The Government is glowing because of the tax receipts it is getting on the back of people's misery.  As I said, not since the British landlords, who turned their eyes the other way at the time of the Famine, has any Government been so harsh, so inept in dealing with the problems and so uncaring about the people of Ireland.  It is shocking.</p></speech>

It tells us the cost of living in Ireland is high and much higher than the European average.  That will not come as a surprise to anybody as it was well known already, but when we drill into the detail, the report tells a slightly more complex story.  There are countries where the cost of living is higher than Ireland's, including Norway, Switzerland and Iceland.  There are countries that are similar to us, for example, Sweden, Denmark and Luxembourg, and there are countries where the cost of living is much lower than Ireland's, including Turkey, Bulgaria and Romania.</p> <p>What is sometimes missing from the analysis and commentary around the report is the acknowledgement that salaries and wages in Ireland are much higher than the European average.  They are 35% or 36% higher than the European average.  There is a correlation between high-pay, high-income countries with a high standard of living and higher costs and countries where there is low pay, low standards of living and costs are lower.  I would certainly prefer to aspire to be in that group of high-income northern European countries, even if it comes with higher prices, than to be a low-income, low-cost country.  That is being missed from the analysis around that report.  There is a clear correlation between higher salaries, prices and standards of living on the one hand and low prices, pay and standards of living on the other.</p> <p> The Deputy is absolutely correct in terms of the impact that high energy prices have had on people throughout the country but his suggestion that we have done nothing is totally incorrect.  We have reduced excise on diesel to the lowest allowed under European rules.  We have reduced excise on petrol by 20 cent.  If one looks at the price of petrol and diesel north of the Border and in Britain, France, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the rest of western Europe, it is roughly the same or higher.  We have reduced VAT on electricity and gas to 9%, which is the lowest ever rate we have had on electricity and gas since VAT was invented, and taken &euro;200 off people's bills.  As we make plans for the budget, we particularly want to focus on those areas where costs are out of line with comparable countries in northern Europe, in areas such as childcare, public transport, education and rent, and see what we can do about those.</p></speech>

No place took any less action than we took here.  The Government can take action on fuel.  The price of fuel in some countries is down to &euro;1.39 per litre.  The Government wants its greedy paws on VAT and excise duties, which it has failed to remove because of the money coming in to keep higher wages and give an increase of &euro;60 million or &euro;70 million annually to higher civil servants, as it did last week.  The T&aacute;naiste did not call it a pay increase but a pay return.</p>  <p>  To hell with na daoine beaga.  To hell with the little people.  Those are the people who are suffering.  They are not evaluating the EUROSTAT report the way the T&aacute;naiste is and trying to find and cherry-pick the good bits.  They know the pain and suffering they are going through.  They know how uncaring the Government of the T&aacute;naiste, Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party, supported by a selection of Independents, is and how little it cares about them.  T&aacute; siad ag fanacht leo.  They are waiting for them.  The Government refuses to act.  It will not and seems to be unable to act.  That is the sad situation.  We cannot wait for a budget in October because, as we and the public know, any measures that would help the public will not come into effect until the following January or April.  "Live, horse, and you will get grass" will not cut it anymore.  The T&aacute;naiste should do something for the people he is supposed to represent and was elected to represent.</p></speech>

What I am saying is that it is half the story.  Incomes, salaries and wages in Ireland are 30% to 40% higher than the European average.  Of course, there is a correlation between that and higher prices.  Countries with a very low cost of living in that report are Bulgaria, Romania, Turkey and other countries where there is very low pay.  Of course, the price of something in a restaurant or a shop will be lower if people there are paid &euro;1.50 or &euro;2 per hour.  We need to look at these things in the round when looking at these reports and we need to analyse them properly, not simplistically as has been done in recent times.</p>  <p>  We have acted.  We acted in January with an increase in the minimum wage, reductions in income tax, increases in pension and welfare.  We have acted effectively since then, with our emergency budget.  We made cuts in excise on petrol and diesel, taken &euro;200 off people's electricity bills, increased the fuel allowance and cut VAT on electricity and gas to 9%.  Other measures will kick in throughout the summer, including the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance and the increase in the SUSI grant.  We will come back in the autumn with more measures, of which some will take effect within weeks and others in January.  This will be an ongoing cost-of-living crisis.  It will not end quickly, unfortunately.  That is why we need planned actions in the way that we propose.</p></speech>

There is clear evidence that independent private mental health service providers are providing care in superior standard premises than those within the public system.  Treatment should not be based on ability to pay.  It should be based on need.  The report also shows an increase in the number of children being admitted to adult psychiatric facilities.  The recent closure of 11 CAMHS beds in the Linn Dara unit probably means that this practice will continue.  We need to get rid of this draconian practice.  We need to ensure that our most vulnerable children are not being admitted to adult psychiatric hospitals.  Will the T&aacute;naiste give an assurance that the Minister for Health will engage with the HSE to ensure this practice is ended and adequate investment is provided to address the many deficiencies highlighted in the commission's report?</p></speech>

That is very much what is happening at present.  For the information of the House, if we go back to 2009, 55% of child admissions were to adult units.  Last year, that figure was 6.3%.  The job is not done yet but there has been a massive improvement, with those admissions going down from 55% to approximately 6% last year.  Of course, we want to get to zero.  While the Deputy's description of the report from the Mental Health Commission is correct, it is also incomplete.  It is worth recording that the report shows that we are going the right direction, there has been a significant improvement in recent years and more than 80% of public units are now compliant.  That needs to be 100%.</p></speech>

We know that costs of childcare for parents are far too high, wages for early years professionals are too low and there is an abject shortage of places for children.  Across my constituency, I hear all the time from parents who are worn out from trying to find a cr&egrave;che or early years education place or who have been told there is no preschool facility available for their child until 2024.  We need a guarantee - a Donogh O'Malley moment - to ensure that every child will have a preschool and early years place available to him or her.  I know the new core funding model was published this week but we need the Government to take meaningful steps to achieve a universal public childcare system.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, to indicate what steps are being taken to guarantee every child will have an early years place when he or she needs it, every early years educator will get decent pay and parents will have affordable childcare available to them.</p></speech>

Two EROs are in negotiation.  The first is for an entry rate of &euro;13 per hour, which guarantees the living wage for childcare professionals for the first time in this State.  The second is to look at higher levels of pay.  All of that is backed up by core funding.  We have been very clear that the payment of core funding is contingent on the ERO.  If the State is to step up with &euro;221 million of investment, it has to be guaranteed that childcare professionals who have worked so hard and demonstrated the huge value they gave to the State during Covid, we have to be assured they will get that additional investment and will see it in their pay packets.  We are about to achieve that.</p></speech>

Both he and the T&aacute;naiste will be aware that hyperemesis is an excruciating and debilitating condition experienced by 1% of women and people experiencing pregnancy.  In a response to a parliamentary question I submitted, it was revealed this week that 3,304 hospitalisations occurred last year through women experiencing this condition.  Cariban is one step in the treatment plan for this condition that alleviates some of the excruciating suffering.  It is not available on the drugs treatment plan or through the medical card.  This matter has been raised on numerous occasions.  I ask for an update on when Cariban will be made available free of charge, I hope, on the drugs treatment plan and, if not, through the medical card scheme.  This could alleviate the suffering of thousands of women each year.</p></speech>

This issue has been raised with me previously and we are working with the Department of Health on it.  We do not have exact dates but it is being looked at very closely for the reasons the Deputy has quite rightly raised.  I will ask the Department to revert to him with a note on it shortly.</p></speech>

He lost his wife, Susan, to bowel cancer.  He is campaigning for improved bowel cancer screening programmes.  I support his campaign.</p> <p>Around 2,800 people are diagnosed with bowel cancer in Ireland every year and about 1,000 people die from it here each year.  Early screening can prevent cancer from forming in the first place.  In France and Germany testing begins at the age of 50 and in the US the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recently changed its recommended age for beginning screening from 50 to 45.  In this State, screening starts at 60.  Does the Minister agree with me that this State is way behind the curve on this issue and investment is needed to sharply reduce the age for screening to begin in this country?</p></speech>

There have been similar, reasonable and well-intentioned calls on BreastCheck and CervicalCheck.  The current ages across the various screening programmes are based on the current best clinical opinion of the HSE.  The Deputy has raised an important question and I am more than happy to raise it again with the clinical teams in the HSE to ensure the age we have set provides the best possible outcomes.  I am sure the Deputy will agree that regardless of what the age is, we should acknowledge how important the screening programmes are and encourage everyone to use them when they come to the eligible age.</p></speech>

I can find no reference to his data.  What I can find shows national IDA Ireland jobs growth of 6% but lacklustre growth in the south-east region of just 1.6%.  Despite having 9% of the population, the south east has just 5% of IDA Ireland jobs and a mere 4.5% of IDA Ireland-supported companies in the region.  That amounts to over 9,500 missing jobs.  This deficit has more than doubled in the past decade, indicating a regional payroll loss of over &euro;650 million annually.  I have asked the Taoiseach before and I am asking the T&aacute;naiste now if the Government will consider setting up and funding a structure akin to the Western Development Commission for the south-east region.  This would allow the region to develop significant applied economic and demographic research to support cohesive regional strategic planning and development.  This strategy has proven itself in the north west.  Surely it is time the south east, the most underperforming region in the country, is similarly supported.</p></speech>

If the Deputy wants to look at statistics, he should look at the labour force survey statistics from the Central Statistics Office, CSO, which show that jobs growth in Ireland last year was at its highest in the south east and south west, not in Dublin or the west, which is a good sign of the south-east region catching up.  There has been significant IDA Ireland investment, such as by State Street in Kilkenny and the announcement by IDA Ireland firms of about 600 jobs in and around Waterford city in the past year or so.  On the Enterprise Ireland side, there was a positive development in the Port of Waterford, where the new Royal A-ware Glanbia Kilkenny cheese plant will be built.  It will never be the case that because 9% of the population lives in a particular area, it will have 9% of FDI.  That is not how it works.  All over the world, FDI tends to gravitate towards cities for obvious reasons.  Dublin has 25% of the population but it does not have 25% of the agricultural or tourism jobs.  Different regions have different strengths and in every country in the entire world FDI tends to gravitate towards cities, while other things gravitate towards other regions.</p></speech>

All of the national schools in Cahir and Carrick-on-Suir have DEIS status so what is the difference?  There is no clarity or reason given for their exclusion.  They were refused, they appealed and the appeals have been unsuccessful for both schools.  Siblings are coming in from national schools that have DEIS status and then they go to a secondary school that does not have that status.  It is grossly unfair and unjust and we must get an explanation from the Department of how it makes these decisions.  I welcome that Newtown Upper National School in Drangan got DEIS status, as did St. John the Baptist Boys' National School in Cashel.  These secondary schools need DEIS status also.  The feeder schools have DEIS status but they do not.</p></speech>

My understanding is that there has been a substantial increase in the number of schools eligible for DEIS status and the number of DEIS schools is almost double what it was previously.  An appeal mechanism is available to schools that believe they should have DEIS status.  If the Deputy gives me the details of the case, I will pass them on to the Department which may be able to revisit it.</p></speech>

As the Minister will be aware, the lab is closing its doors today and we now have no service north of a line extending from Dublin to Galway.  I wrote to the Minister almost two weeks ago asking for an emergency meeting with all four Deputies in the constituency and I am still awaiting a response to confirm that meeting will take place.  The current service is a private one and it closes its doors today.  What temporary service can be put in place?  Can Sligo University Hospital be included in the national review of cardiac services?  It is my understanding that it may not be included and we must have a commitment that it will be included.  There has been a failure until now to provide a proper cath lab service in Sligo.  I am asking that heart patients in the north west be able to access those life-saving treatments.</p></speech>

The Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, and I met on this yesterday to see what could be done.  We are aware that the mobile unit, which I am advised is not for interventional cardiology but for angiograms, is now gone.  I was speaking with hospital management just yesterday on this exact issue and it has proposals in place for a cath lab, be it for diagnostics, intervention or both.  Clinical views are required on that and we are waiting on the national review.  The whole country is included in the review in terms of diagnostics and intervention.  I would be more than happy to meet the Deputy and other Oireachtas Members to discuss what can be done.</p></speech>

Will the T&aacute;naiste consider introducing a programme of emergency measures for businesses and households to make them more resilient in the face of rising fuel prices?  I have in mind switching to shallow refits; heat controls, which could cut energy by 25%; smart meters, which 750,000 households have not exploited; initiating measures on food waste and refurbishment; better sharing platforms to allow more efficient use; and better use of our stock of homes by addressing vacancy and right-sizing.  I know the Opposition will pour scorn on such measures and say we are out of touch but the reality is we need structural changes to respond quickly to this challenge, which is unlikely to go out of sight in the near future.  There is huge community interest in implementing and supporting such measures.</p></speech>

The probability is that energy prices will fall back and ease, and I hope they do, but there will be an upward trend in the cost of energy over the next five or ten years.  As a result, the solution cannot always be subsidies and tax cuts.  We have to help businesses and householders reduce the costs of energy, make their homes and businesses more efficient and embrace solar and microgeneration to bring down their costs.  On the business side, I had a look at this the other day and there are 20 different schemes available to businesses to help them reduce their energy costs.  These range from advice to audits and helping with cattle costs and those investments.  There are almost too many schemes.  There are 20 schemes and in the round they are inadequate, which is something we need to work on, both for householders and businesses.</p></speech>

I have been approached by residents of Carrickmines Green, an estate in Carrickmines owned by the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA.</p> <p>Construction at Carrickmines commenced in 2005, with many residents moving in shortly afterwards.  However, the developer went under in mid 2009 and the residents were left living in a so-called ghost estate for many years until the receiver McStay Luby and NAMA began to complete the project.  In 2015, there was a fire in an unfinished block.  A subsequent fire safety report raised issues and recommended extensive repairs to fire-stopping materials across the estate.  I understand some of these works have taken place but many remain outstanding.  The issue is now urgent as residents have been advised they cannot renew their insurance.  Will the T&aacute;naiste raise this matter with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, asking NAMA to engage with the residents to find a solution?</p></speech>

The information I have is that Carrickmines is not owned or controlled by NAMA but there are units under the control of a NAMA-appointed receiver, John McStay of McStay Luby.  The receiver has advised NAMA of his understanding of the current position regarding block insurance.  I appreciate it is an important issue in the Deputy's constituency and perhaps the best thing I can do is give him the written note later.</p></speech>

Will the Government support the extension of the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, to include psychology, occupational therapy, speech and language therapy and physiotherapy?  At present, with the dire shortage of services, particularly in my county of Wexford, as well as the cost of living and long waiting lists, family carers have to take on these professional roles, which is causing carers to be run down, deeply distressed and financially drained.</p></speech>

Among the things the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, is focusing on at the moment is extending eligibility for the carer's allowance, so more people qualify for it, which is welcome.  She is working on proposals to ensure people who act as family carers for a prolonged period qualify for a State contributory pension.  Those are the two big reforms under way on her side.  I do not know if consideration is being given to using the NTPF.  It might be a model that could work but I would have to check on that and come back to the Deputy.</p></speech>

Conditions there were appalling, inhuman, catastrophic and destitute of any compassion.  The RCSI hospital group took over the operational control of that house.  Since then, the families have been looking for truth, accountability and closure and believe only an inquiry will give them that truth, that closure and that accountability.  They have met with the Minister for Health and with senior executives, including Mr. Reid, in the HSE but have had no contact, they tell me, since November with the Minister for Health to further this issue.  We need this Government, which I support, to vindicate the human rights of the residents concerned.  They cannot be ignored.  If the Minister can give &euro;135 million to meet the financial needs of 445 nursing homes, can he not find it in his heart to meet them and to have that inquiry to give them the truth and peace they need?</p></speech>

As he said, I have met the families involved.  I have stated publicly at committee and am happy to restate that families whose loved ones passed away in nursing homes in some cases, including Dealgan House, have very legitimate questions and they must be given answers to those questions.  We are trying to find a process whereby we can give them the answers they want without having to create a mechanism like a statutory tribunal or inquiry.  In many cases, the only people who come out of those on top are the legal representatives.  We are working to find a mechanism whereby the families can get the answers they need in a way that does not leave them bogged down in a legal process for many years.

One query I have had, for example, concerns a lady who signed on on 20 May.  To this day, she has not received one penny.  That is unsustainable, considering everything happening in the world today, particularly with the cost of living through the roof.  The response I got from the Department is that there is a huge backlog of applications waiting to be processed and a decision will be made shortly.

She has been to Crumlin until Easter of this year and now is in shared maintenance care between Mercy University Hospital in Cork and University Hospital Kerry.  She gets bloods in Kerry.  She has to have her Hickman port dressed quickly and her mother, Lorraine, administers chemo three times per week.  It is four chemos, plus bloods and dressings, which is physically and mentally very draining for her family.

It sounds awful and truly heartbreaking.  Will the Deputy revert to me directly with the details?  I will talk to the Department and the HSE and anything that can be done will be done.

People in south Kildare and Laois drive to Sallins, north Kildare, to avail of the short hop zone.

It is quite anomalous at the moment.  Kilcoole in County Wicklow is in the short hop zone but Drogheda and areas in mid Kildare that are the same distance away from Dublin are not.  We think that should be regularised but that work really has to be done through the National Transport Authority and the Minister.</p></speech>

Some passengers have told their stories in the media over recent days.  They have said that they will not receive refunds because they were offered alternative flights two or three days later.  Some of these families have saved for these holidays over the last two years and have not been on holiday since 2019.  They have paid heavily for accommodation in sun destinations.  Has the Department of Transport or the Minister been in contact with Aer Lingus on this issue to ensure that all passengers will receive full refunds swiftly?  It is astonishing that other companies have not cancelled nearly as many flights as Aer Lingus.  I understand that Ryanair is running at near full capacity.</p></speech>

I am advised that, due to the spike in the number of Covid-19 cases, Aer Lingus has been forced to cancel three return flights and one direct flight today.  I am also advised that, due to a mandate from the London Heathrow Airport authority, one return flight to Dublin from Heathrow has also been cancelled today.  Aer Lingus has apologised to those impacted and the team at the airline is working to accommodate impacted passengers on the next available service as efficiently as possible.  According to Aer Lingus, it anticipated the return of demand for travel once Covid restrictions were removed and included buffers in its plans to deal with reasonable levels of disruption.  As the Deputy will know, European Community Regulation No. 261/2004 sets out the rights of air passengers and the resulting obligations on airlines in the event of cancellations, denied boarding and flight delays.  In Ireland, the Commission for Aviation Regulation is the designated national enforcement body.  The Minister, Deputy Ryan, and I will be meeting with airlines with regard to what is happening at Dublin Airport and will raise these issues.</p></speech>

There will an exclusion for luxury accommodation because we do not particularly want to control the rents of multimillionaires who are renting penthouses or luxury suites.</p><p>The need to control rents should be self-evident, as is the total failure of the Government to do so.  Rent pressure zones have failed spectacularly in controlling rents.  In the last decade, average rents have increased by more than 100%.  In the last year alone, they have gone up by 12%.  They have now reached truly obscene levels.  While they are going up literally every week, at the last count, the average rent in my area was &euro;2,200 and you would be lucky to find somewhere for that these days.  We should think about that.  That is impossible for the vast majority of working people.  Somebody on an average income would have to fork out approximately 70% of income to meet that rent.  Needless to say, great numbers of people simply cannot do that and are therefore being driven into homelessness.  The income of working people who go out, work hard and do all the right things is, at the end of the week, not even close to enough to pay these absolutely extortionate rents.  We have to do something about it.</p><p>By the way, this is also costing the State money.  We have no choice but to support people on lower incomes and to give them the housing assistance payment, lease arrangements and rental accommodation scheme payments but that is costing the State approximately &euro;1 billion a year, a figure that is also rising.  It is insanity.  The public, the taxpayer and the State are being absolutely crucified by these corporate landlords that are charging extortionate rents.  Ordinary people simply cannot afford them and many are driven into homelessness and absolutely desperate situations.</p><p>Yesterday, I raised the case of Anthony and Niamh, who are still homeless.  They have two children but the only thing they have been offered since they were made homelessness having been unable to find anywhere to rent after being evicted on the grounds of sale is one bedroom for them and their two children in a hostel in town when the two kids go to school in the Sallynoggin area.  One of the couple works in Bray and the other in Sallynoggin.  The only offer they got was one room for four people in a hostel in Gardiner Street.  It is shocking.  I am not exaggerating when I say I am dealing with approximately 12 cases of households, the vast majority of which comprise people who have kids and who are working, who are going to be in the same situation in the coming weeks.  It is absolutely shameful.  The high rents are directly contributing to this problem.</p><p>The Government will say that eventually supply will reduce rents.  That is absolute nonsense.  There is no evidence at all to suggest that.  Even when we had record levels of supply during the Celtic tiger period, rents did not go down but continued to rise, as did house prices.  When you look at what developers are building at the moment, you will see that extortionate rents are being charged for what is being supplied.  We have to do something about this.  It is obvious that we have to deliver public and affordable housing but another key part of addressing this crisis is to control and set rents, as is done in many other countries.  I very much doubt that the Government will agree with this but we will fight hard and campaign for the introduction of a proper rent control regime.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-06-30a.211" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1561" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="12:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022063000024#EE00200"><p>I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>  <p> The defective concrete block disaster has haunted lives in Donegal, Mayo and beyond for too long.  People who built and bought family homes to make a life in saw their dreams crumble around them.  Instead of a shelter from the storms of life, their homes became prisons.  With no help available, they turned to the State for support.  When that support was found wanting, they took their message directly to the Government through all routes available.  We have listened and heard it loud and clear.  The scheme that today&rsquo;s legislation underpins is a dramatic leap forward towards a 100% grant scheme.  I believe it goes a long way to address the fundamental concerns and needs of homeowners.</p>  <p>  I recognise homeowners' concerns and fears around the proposed enhanced scheme.  They feel their trust has been let down before.  I want to assure them here today that we are committed to making this scheme work and will continually strive to ensure it is improved where that is needed.  I said in August 2020 on my visit to Buncrana in Donegal that every scheme evolves, and I have no doubt this one will continue to do so.</p>  <p>  The intense engagement with homeowner representatives over the past year has fundamentally reshaped this scheme for the better.  It is a scheme of State support that is unprecedented anywhere in the world.  It is the State stepping up, and rightly so, to help those who have found no other way forward.  It is a light at the end of a long tunnel for families trapped in crumbling homes.  Let us give this scheme a fair chance.  Let us put in place a solid framework that we can build on and get people&rsquo;s lives back on track.</p>  <p>  I want to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the homeowners and their representatives who have engaged with this process through the working group, Oireachtas hearings, submissions to the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland, SCSI, and the expert group as well as frequent meetings of the homeowners' forum.  That work has shaped this scheme, and where agreement could not be reached, it always shone a bright light on issues.  I know they will continue to press their case and work for a scheme that delivers.</p>  <p>  I also want to acknowledge and thank John O&rsquo;Connor whom I appointed as the homeowners' liaison for his hard work and commitment to improving this scheme.  The immense progress we have made to date would not have been possible without his diligence.  I also thank in particular my Department officials who have worked so hard on this very complex and difficult issue.  In addition, I acknowledge my Government colleagues, particularly the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, who is here beside me, Deputy Calleary and others, as well as Opposition representatives who have engaged with us through this process.  They have been tireless advocates publicly and more often behind the scenes to press the case for impacted homeowners, not just over the past year but over several years.  I note Deputy McHugh is here as well who has been of great assistance to us in this process also.</p>  <p>  The administration of the current defective concrete blocks grant scheme has proven to be challenging for all involved: homeowners, engineers, local authorities and the Department.  Difficulties with the consistent and appropriate application of the IS 465 standard, the financial barrier to scheme entry, the negotiated nature of the methodology by which the grant amount is determined, the significant number of judgment calls required of local authorities in what is a challenging local operating environment, and the adequacy of the grant amounts available were raised as significant issues.  It was clear there was a need to make changes to the administration of the scheme to ensure it is as simple as possible for all stakeholders while ensuring adequate cost control, good governance and, most importantly, good outcomes for homeowners.</p>  <p>  The draft Bill today follows on from the general scheme and reflects the decisions made by Government in November 2021 effectively to overhaul the previous grant scheme that was launched in January 2020.  I take this opportunity to draw attention to the key decisions and differences from the old scheme and highlight the major steps forward.</p>  <p>  In the new scheme, there is provision for 100% grants subject to an overall maximum grant of &euro;420,000 per dwelling.  This eliminates the mandatory 10% homeowner contribution under the old scheme and increases the cap from &euro;247,500 to &euro;420,000.  Grant rates are in keeping with the construction cost report prepared by the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland such that no homeowner will receive less funding than the construction costs recommended by SCSI in its cost report.  This links the rates to an independent cost source to ensure they keep up to date with real construction costs, unlike the old scheme.</p><p><i>2 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p>The scheme includes a Government guarantee in respect of remediation works other than full demolition or rebuild, that is, options 2 to 5, through eligibility for a second grant, if required, for a period of 40 years.  That is a 40-year guarantee.  Neither of those measures existed in the old scheme.</p> <p> A revised application process will remove the financial barrier to scheme entry.  It will only require of the homeowner to submit an initial building condition assessment at minimal cost that is recoupable on entry to the scheme.  This removes the &euro;5,000 to &euro;7,000 entry costs in the old scheme.</p> <p> An independent appeals process for applicants is being introduced, with all key decisions under the scheme appealable by homeowners.  Again, this did not exist under the old scheme.</p> <p> The scheme will cover alternative accommodation and storage costs and immediate repair works to a maximum value of &euro;25,000 within the overall grant cap.  Again, this did not exist under the old scheme.</p> <p> Importantly, the Housing Agency is playing a key role under this enhanced scheme by taking on the financial cost of testing and assessing homes and determining on behalf of the local authorities the appropriate remediation option and the grant rate of each dwelling.  Again, this did not exist under the old scheme.</p> <p> There will be a damage threshold to ensure the worst-affected homes are remediated first.  I assure homeowners that this threshold will be set by regulations and kept under continuous review.</p> <p> The enhanced scheme will be extended beyond the current scope of principal private residences only to also cover rented dwellings registered with the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, on or before 1 November 2021.  The old scheme was principal private residences only.</p> <p> The counties of Clare and Limerick will be included in the enhanced scheme upon commencement.  As all present are aware, the old scheme applied to Donegal and Mayo only.</p> <p> There will be a review as required of the overall grant cap and the grant rates, and adjustment, if necessary, by Government order, each year.  The old scheme had no review mechanisms or criteria in place.  There will be a review of the operation of the Act three years after its commencement.  There was no review built into the old scheme.</p> <p> Legislative provision is being made for Exchequer funding of local authority- and approved housing body-owned social homes that are affected.  This was not covered under the old scheme.</p> <p> Exempt development status under planning legislation will apply to remediation works carried out under the defective concrete blocks grant scheme on a like-for-like basis.  This was not covered under the old scheme.</p> <p> I wish to address legitimate concerns and some of the criticisms in respect of the Bill to try to dispel any uncertainty.  The Government decision on 30 November 2021 called for a number of reviews to be completed to ensure this disaster does not occur again and the core problems are addressed.  These included a review of the IS 465:2018 protocol, including consideration of the impact of other potential material such as pyrrhotite.  It called for a review of the adequacy or otherwise of the existing foundations in homes impacted by defective concrete blocks and a review of the potential impact, if any, of full cavity wall insulation on homes susceptible to damage or damaged by defective concrete blocks.  I wish to clarify that the Bill allows for the Minister to adjust, through regulations, any issues that arise from these scientific investigations.  I assure the House that if a problem is found with foundations or other issues through the National Standards Authority of Ireland, NSAI, that will be dealt with.</p> <p> Existing applicants under the current scheme will not be disadvantaged from being early movers and will benefit retrospectively from the increased grant amounts and allowances that will be available under the enhanced scheme.  Appropriate transitional provisions will be included in the new legislation to provide a mechanism to move applications to the revised scheme once it commences.</p> <p> I can confirm that the counties of Clare and Limerick have now been included in the enhanced scheme.  Given the possibility that the spread of impacted homes could be wider than the four counties currently accepted into the enhanced scheme, the extension of the scheme to other local authority areas was considered as part of the wider deliberations on the scheme by the Government.  I, as Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, may, with Government approval, extend the scheme to additional counties where the evidence supports such an extension.  Importantly, a pathway for the admittance of other local authority areas onto the scheme is now in place and it has worked for Clare and Limerick, as evidenced by their inclusion in the Bill.  I assure Deputies that my Department and I will deal promptly with any submissions received from other local authority areas that seek admittance to the scheme.  The Bill provides for me, as Minister, to introduce a scheme of grant assistance for local authorities and approved housing bodies to remediate social homes in their ownership that have been impacted by defective concrete blocks.</p> <p> The estimated overall cost of the enhancements to the scheme and the new scheme is &euro;2.7 billion, which includes some 7,500 homes across the State.  The additional costs reflect the construction costs, as set out by the SCSI, and inflation.  I reiterate that, each year, I or another Minister will be able to vary that rate on review without having to amend the legislation.</p> <p> The devastating impact of the crisis and scale of the State intervention demands that we ensure this never happens again.  In October, I ordered an audit of all active quarries in Donegal by the National Building Control Office arising from concerns over compliance.  On Tuesday, I received a copy of the report.  I am now reviewing it with a view to publication and ensuring its recommendations are carried out.  I will update the House on this matter as soon as I have concluded that review.  In addition, the NSAI has been tasked with undertaking a review of the Irish standard for concrete blocks, including aggregates, to ensure it is fit for purpose.  That work is now ongoing.  I will appoint a senior counsel to review the causes of the mica and pyrite disaster and make recommendations on the matter.  I expect to finalise terms of reference and appoint an experienced senior counsel in the coming months.  I will inform the House of progress in that regard.</p> <p> The clear goal of these measures is to draw a red line under this scandal and ensure no other properties are impacted in future.  I appreciate concerns in respect of the need to pass the Bill before the summer recess and I thank the Oireachtas joint committee for granting a pre-legislative waiver.  There has been extensive and intensive engagement with homeowner representatives and other key stakeholders on the defective concrete blocks issue through the past 12 months, including the working group on the defective concrete blocks grant scheme, which was established last June and reported in September 2021, following which the Government approved significant enhancements to the scheme.  The expert group on the enhanced scheme was chaired by Mr. Paul Forde, whom I thank for his work and for lending his extensive expertise, knowledge and experience to this process.  The expert group reported on a significant number of technical issues that needed to be considered and advised upon.  The Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland prepared a construction cost report for remediation works under the scheme, the findings of which have been accepted in full by the Government and incorporated in the grant rates under the enhanced scheme, as I committed to do last year.  Account was taken of submissions from Engineers Ireland to my Department on the issue, as well as submissions by homeowners to my Department.  There was considerable ongoing engagement with homeowners through Mr. John O&rsquo;Connor, former chief executive of the Housing Agency, whom I appointed as homeowner liaison officer.  The National Standards Authority of Ireland engaged with a number of reviews relevant to the defective concrete blocks issue, and the Oireachtas joint committee held a special series of hearings on the legislation.</p> <p> The remediation scheme needs a legislative basis and, more important, it needs to get going.  We need to move forward with real progress and implement the scheme.  The Bill is a real step forward.  Every Deputy is keenly aware of the scale of the crisis that confronts us.  The scheme is the State stepping up to the mark as we have a moral obligation to put in place practical solutions for impacted homeowners.  We cannot let the perfect be the enemy of the good and we need to get a practical scheme moving.  I reiterate that the scheme will evolve in future and we will continually keep it under review.  We will continue to work closely with all Oireachtas Members and listen carefully to their views in this legislative process and in the operation of the scheme.</p> <p>I think we can all agree it is essential the Bill passes through all Stages in the D&aacute;il and the Seanad in a timely fashion and that the enhanced scheme can open for applications as soon as possible.  Homeowners have been on a long, hard and often lonely journey since cracks first appeared in their homes.  Today&rsquo;s Bill may not be the end of that journey but I believe it is the beginning of the end.  This Bill provides a clear pathway forward out of the nightmare that has haunted them for far too long.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-06-30a.214" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1468" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="12:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022063000026#GG00200"><p>I welcome homeowners from Clare, Limerick, Mayo, Sligo and Donegal, who are in the Gallery today.  I commend all of them, and all affected homeowners, many of whom have been campaigning for a decade.  In particular, I commend them on the incredibly intense level of campaigning over the past 12 months, on the streets and on social media, and their engagement with the Minister and his officials, as well as the Opposition.</p><p>Having listened very carefully to the Minister, it is clear there is a growing gap between what he says he is doing and what is in the Bill and on offer to affected homeowners.  Many of us have been talking to those homeowners since the publication of the legislation over a week ago.  The emotions they are expressing to us are anger, frustration and a sense of being very badly let down.  They, and we, are deeply unhappy about the rushed nature of the legislation.  It has also been greatly delayed.  When I raised this point with the Minister last week on the floor of this House, he said it had not been delayed.  On 10 February, in the Select Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage, I asked him for an update on the legislation and he said, &quot;I hope to publish the general scheme in March.&quot;  He went on to say, &quot;If we need amendments on Committee Stage, we can do that too.&quot;  When I raised the March deadline with some of his officials, they were surprised because they were working to a deadline of the end of April.  April then turned into May and May into the start of June.</p><p>Here we are with very important legislation, which every Member of this House wants to get right in the best interests of the homeowners, and we are being given an inadequate amount of time to ensure it is correct.  The accelerated pre-legislative scrutiny at committee was not ideal but that was a gesture of good faith on behalf of many of us to show we did not want to delay the process.  A Bill of this size and complexity getting just two hours of consideration on Committee Stage next week is a scandal.  The price tag for this Bill could go up to or maybe even exceed &euro;3 billion.  Two hours of debate is negligent, if not reckless.  In my considered view, and in the view of many others, this Bill is not right.</p><p>It would be very easy for the Minister to dismiss my views and those of my colleagues, or others in opposition.  What I want the Minister to do is listen very carefully to the words, not of other politicians but of the homeowners themselves.  First thing this morning, a joint statement was issued by the Donegal Mica Action Group, the Mayo Pyrite Action Group, the Clare Pyrite Action Group, the Limerick Pyrite Action Group and the Sligo Pyrite Action Group.  I urge the Minister and his Government colleagues to listen to what they had to say.  The statement reads:</p> <blockquote> 	We, the representatives of the homeowners, across Donegal, Mayo, Clare, Limerick and Sligo, would like to issue the following joint statement regarding the Defective Block bill scheduled to be debated in the Dail today.<br /><br />It is imperative that the voice of the Homeowners, the victims of Defective materials, is heard and that [in particular] the Government TD&rsquo;s, those individuals that we have voted into office, listen before it is too late.<br /><br />Listen, because to date, you have not listened.  We are angry, frustrated and the endless torture will not be tolerated to go on a minute further.<br /><br />Over the past ten years, we have engaged endlessly with different government officials and government parties.  We have entered talks bringing with us our lived experience of this nightmare.  Arming each official with the practical solutions of what is needed on the ground to deliver a scheme that will rebuild our homes.<br /><br />At each stage we have encountered obstacles.  We had been delivered a scheme that was so flawed it proved financially unviable, and practically unworkable to be of any use for impacted homeowners.<br /><br />Last summer talks were entered into again with homeowner representatives from Mayo and Donegal (other impacted counties [including Clare, Limerick etc.] were excluded from this process), under Government pretense of forming a joint working committee, which would take on board homeowner input. The aim: a joint working effort that would design a Scheme that truly provided the 100% Redress, that the full Government supported on June 15th 2021.<br /><br />Sadly, this was not to be the case.  Not because we homeowners did not engage but because the Dept of Housing Officials and Govt officials wasted 3 months defending their already debunked 90/10 scheme.  When the Minister of Housing announced the scheme in November it showed &quot;Lessons had not been Learned&quot;.<br /><br />Presented to the press was a trojan horse, that brought with it all the media spin the Department of Housing could throw at the public.  Spin that said it was indeed 100%, when it is not.  Spin around a figure of &euro;420,00 which very few will ever get.  Spin about the burden to taxpayers, when we are the very taxpayers who have been left to suffer in rotting homes, built with unregulated blocks.  Portraying us homeowners as greedy, as chancers.  Their indifference for the people in homes built with defective blocks quite evident through the schemes many clauses and trappings.<br /><br />Not to be deterred or walk away, representatives again agreed to enter discussions with government representatives.  Our aim &ndash; to try and improve the new Scheme for a third time.  All areas were reviewed, and solutions provided to the additional problems created by the Department.  Solutions were presented for rental property and holiday home inclusion, an increase on the max grant available, inclusion of foundations, the controversial Damage Threshold assessment, to name a few.  Multiple weekly meetings over 6 months were held on the pretense of designing a Scheme that would work.<br /><br />This bill was due to be different.  This engagement would be different from past experience.  We would work together to design a Scheme that truly provided the 100% Redress, that the full Government supported on June 15th 2021.<br /><br />Last week we were due to see the fruits of our labor delivered.  A workable scheme that would enable the thousands of homeowners across 13 counties to move forward with their lives.  Instead, what was delivered over 60 pages was contempt for us homeowners, in the same week the Housing Committee heard quarries are still producing defective materials.  How can we [be expected to] trust a system which is not fit for purpose failing in its responsibility to protect victims, citizens, and taxpayers?  Threats of fines and imprisonment for innocent homeowners.  Minister nowhere mentioned were the equivalent fines or threats of imprisonment for the true perpetrators in this.  The producers of these defective blocks, including giants of the Irish ... [construction] Industry.<br /><br />We have scaled every obstacle put in our way.  But it appears the government has strung us along for months.  Practically every suggestion and solution presented ignored by the Department of Housing and Housing Agency officials.  The voices and plight of the ordinary homeowners treated with cynical contempt by those with the power to do better by us.<br /><br />Over the past week, and pressed to the wall we have worked around the clock to put forward 80 amendments to make this scheme work.  80 amendments because that are the number of failures in this bill.  We the homeowners are calling on you the elected TDs to listen carefully to the amendments [when they are put forward].  They have come from the insight and suffering over long years of those who know what it means to live in these homes.  The new Scheme will not work without these amendments.  By ignoring us again today, you are wasting more money, destroying more lives.<br /><br />While we wait on the I[ndustry] S[tandard] 465 review which we need to include all deleterious materials scientifically proven to be problematic, along with foundations, you [Minister] must ensure for us, your electorate these amendments are made.  You must forget party politics and focus on what is best for your constituents no matter what their political allegiance and show the flexibility to be the change required to finally make this scheme work.<br /><br />To date this government has broken all parliamentary process when trying to rush this scheme through the statutory legislative stages.  You have given us no time to review the bill, no time to debate the bill, no time to even communicate and discuss the consequences of the long-term aspects of the bill to the thousands of homeowners whose lives will be destroyed by not only defective blocks, but your failure to provide true redress for the problem. <br /><br />Minister let us be [very] clear, so our words are not misunderstood.  If this bill is not amended, we the homeowners will not support it.  We will continue our campaign and protests until it is amended, until it is fit for purpose.  Fit for the citizens of this country who need to avail of it to fix their homes. It is not just our houses that this is destroying, but our daily lives, our working lives, our family lives, our physical and mental wellbeing, the very fabric of our communities.<br /><br />Minister we will not give up. The time for engagement is over.  Amendments are needed.  It&rsquo;s time that your Government and its Dept of Housing listen and deliver what has been promised. </blockquote>  <p>That was signed by representatives of the homeowners across the affected counties.</p> <p>Those are not the words of a politician or words that can be dismissed as political opportunism; they are the words of individuals and families who are living in homes that are crumbling around them.  I urge the Minister to listen carefully to what the Opposition has to say to ensure we get this Bill correct.  Homeowners are telling us that the legislation is not fit for purpose and that it is defective.  They have drafted more than 80 amendments and asked Deputies to table them.  Many of us have done that and more.  The Minister needs to listen to what they are saying, to consider their amendments and to improve this Bill.</p> <p> I want to highlight a couple of key concerns, without prejudice to the others, that we will address next week.  This Bill does not provide 100% redress for the vast majority of homeowners.  Martina Hegarty from Mayo made an incredibly compelling case at the committee.  Many Members present heard her.  She lives in a modest family home in Mayo.  It is approximately 90 sq. m.  She estimates, on the basis of the information available today, that she may get a grant of &euro;169,000.  On the basis of the quotation that she has been given today, before factoring in inflation, the actual cost of full remediation and replacement, as per the grant scheme, could be as high as &euro;200,000.  She does not have the difference.  There is real fear in counties Mayo and Clare that if the damage threshold is based on the recommendations of the expert group, it will be particularly disadvantageous for those with pyrite, because the nature of cracking and damage manifestation is different.  If there is damage to a property, it should be on the scheme.  The damage threshold should only be about prioritising when those homes are worked on.  I urge the Minister to consider that point carefully.</p> <p> The formula for calculating the cost is deeply flawed.  Not only do we need updated figures from the SCSI in advance of the opening of the schemes, specific to the counties and regions affected, the terms of reference, which the SCSI had no hand or part in producing, need to be reviewed so that we get a 100% like for like replacement, not what is currently on offer.  While the 12-month review is welcome, the proposal for addressing cost inflation is capped at 10%.  What happens if inflation is above that?  Who picks up the tab under the scheme?  The homeowner.</p> <p> The exclusion of foundations is contrary to the science.  I welcome what the Minister said about the NSAI's work, but it has to be accelerated.  We cannot have a long gap between the opening of the scheme and that outcome.  The same has to be said of the more substantive review by NSAI of IS 465.  We were informed by officials that it will be delayed until the latter end of next year.  That could be nine to 12 months after the scheme is opened, which is not acceptable.</p> <p> One of the greatest admissions in the Bill is the fact that the downsizing option includes a penalty.  Going back to Martina Hegarty's case, if she cannot afford the extra &euro;40,000 or &euro;50,000 to remediate and replace her home, surely she should be allowed to take the grant of &euro;160,000 or &euro;170,000 and, within the footprint of her existing home, build a home that is up to 20% smaller than the current one without any reduction in the grant?  That was an incredibly generous compromise by the homeowners.  We all expected something like that to be in the Bill.  Unfortunately, it is not here.  There are also concerns that homeowners will be denied demolition and rebuilding, even when that is the right option.  That is a function of the mistrust that has developed between homeowners and the State.  I urge the Minister to do everything possible to ensure that does not happen.</p> <p> The definition of "relevant dwelling" in the legislation is far too restrictive.  Apartments, group homes, nursing homes and other properties are excluded.  Nobody in this House dispute that homes with families living in them, as owners or tenants, have to be the first priority, but I do not see why some pathway for the remediation of other forms of properties could not have been included under the scheme.</p> <p> I welcome the inclusion of social homes and the two pilots that we were told about, where the Minister's officials are working with AHBs and Donegal County Council.  Please do not allow these pilots to be slow and the subsequent roll-out of remediation for all affected public homes to be delayed.  Social housing tenants should not be left living in unsafe or crumbling buildings.</p> <p> The process involving the council and the Housing Agency, as outlined in the Bill, runs the risk of being slow and overly bureaucratic.  All Members know about the long delays in local authorities because of understaffing.  On a number of occasions, the timelines given for applicants and homeowners to respond are short compared with the more generous timelines for statutory agencies.  That balance has to be struck.  Even I was surprised by the large number of regulations that will be required by the Minister's officials.  They have much work to do between now and the end of the year.  I have the greatest respect for the efforts they make in this regard, but knowing how busy they are, I do not see how all those regulations will be drafted, approved by Government and laid before the House by the end of this year.  It is important for the Government to be as honest as it can with people about the timelines.  Given the delays we have had to date, anticipating further delays is not unreasonable.  Homeowners need to be told when the scheme will be open.</p> <p> There is much work to do on this Bill between now and the end of the D&aacute;il term.  We are committed to giving the Minister as much time as he needs and to making ourselves available as often as required to meet that deadline.  The select committee can meet as often as he needs next week.  We have discussed it and have made ourselves available.  That will not in any way delay the passage of the legislation by the recess.  I urge him to work with us on this; the homeowners urge him to work with them too.  They have made clear in their statement that if the Bill is not amended, they will not support it.  Of all the lines in their statement, the profundity of what they have said to us as legislators cannot go unrespected.</p> <p> I urge the Minister not to make the same mistakes as his predecessors.  Please do not put in place a defective scheme that does not work.  Do not prolong the misery and heartache for owners and tenants living in defective buildings.  Let us get it right this time.  The Business Committee met today.  The Government Chief Whip undertook to take back to the Government a sincere request from many of us to give us more than two or three hours next week.  There is no reason our committee could not meet for six to eight hours on Wednesday.  We will do that.  That will still allow the Minister to complete Report and Final Stages on Wednesday evening or Thursday morning and to then proceed to the Seanad.</p> <p> Going back to what I said earlier, given the impact this legislation will have on thousands of families, on all taxpayers, and the huge sum the Government will have to commit to undo the mistakes of industry and light-touch regulation in the past, the right thing to do is to give us the time on Wednesday to go through the 80 homeowners' amendments, to adequately consider them and to listen to the Minister's response and indication of willingness to take them away to be introduced in the Seanad.  Let us get this legislation right.  It would be a travesty of the highest order, having left families with two bad schemes, for a third scheme to repeat all of those mistakes.</p> <p>None of us is playing politics or trying to create any difficulties.  We want what the homeowners want, which is legislation and a remediation scheme that is right.  The ball is in the Minister's hands.  I ask that him to work with us, fix the Bill, pass the amendments, and give all of these homeowners and their neighbours the redress scheme they rightly deserve and so desperately need.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-06-30a.217" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1599" speakername="Gerald Nash" time="13:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022063000028#JJ00200"><p>I will pick up from where Deputy &Oacute; Broin finished.  I absolutely agree that this is not about kicking it into next month, and certainly not next year because this issue is far too urgent for that.  It is about getting it right and we believe that we can get it right.  While I am not a member of the committee, I speak as someone who attends the Oireachtas Select Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  The amendments the Labour Party will bring forward will be tabled in my name, and those in the Seanad will be in the name of my colleague Senator Rebecca Moynihan, the Labour Party housing spokesperson.  This is about getting it right.</p>  <p>  The families I speak to, including members of the Donegal diaspora who are resident and politically active in County Louth tell me that they want to get this right.  I speak on a daily basis to the affected residents in Donegal.  All the people I speak to frequently with my colleague, Councillor Martin Farren in Donegal, say that the residents of Donegal and Mayo, and the residents representing those affected in other counties including Clare, Limerick, Sligo and elsewhere, want to get this right and they have waited long enough.  There is now an urgency about getting this done and getting it right.  I certainly will provide my time to allow this to be done correctly and for adequate time to be given to consideration of important amendments.</p>  <p>  To be fair, the Minister does not want to make any excessive claims in respect of 100% redress.  The Labour Party wants to put on the record that it has always supported the campaigners' demands for 100% redress.  I will feed back to the Minister his opening lines when he said: "The scheme that today&rsquo;s legislation underpins is a dramatic leap forward towards a 100% grant scheme."  While he did not make any excessive claims, he said that he believes "it goes a long way to address the fundamental concerns and needs of homeowners".  Undoubtedly, it is a better scheme than those originally proposed.  He has done some work with the campaigners, and we all have made proposals on how the schemes could be improved but it appears from correspondence that Members have received, and from the views expressed by different groups, that there is still some way to go.</p>  <p>  Ireland is a very small country, and we all know somebody who knows somebody affected by this disaster.  The Minister quite correctly pointed it out and described it as a disaster.  That is exactly what it has been.  The counties with the largest preponderance of mica-affected homes are Mayo and Donegal.  We are aware that homes are affected in Clare, Limerick, Sligo and elsewhere.  At the moment there is also a small number of homes that may be affected in County Louth, the precise extent of which has yet to be established.  The Minister said the scheme may evolve in time and will have the capacity to include other counties if the need arises because the full extent of this is not fully known.</p>  <p>  When it is concluded and it is improved, the scheme needs to be agile enough to be able to respond to issues as they arise.  This crisis has touched people throughout the State.  Even if one is not an affected homeowner, one's heart breaks for those who are affected.  Building or buying a home is the biggest investment a person makes in his or her life.  It is a place that one calls home and, as many have done, it may also be the place that one took pride in building oneself.  A home may also be the place where people raise their kids.  It may have been found to be dangerously unsafe, crumbling before the family's eyes, and parts of it may have already fallen away.  It is a daily nightmare, and the stress and the insecurity must, frankly, be unimaginable.</p>  <p>  Today is not the day for history lessons.  It is a day for looking forward and doing our best for the people we all seek to represent.  It is about getting on with the job for the people who desperately need our help but it is about getting it right too.  There is still, however, a noisy bunch of ideologues and ideologically-driven commentators, who believe there should be less regulation of business and industry, fewer standards and less enforcement.  They say: "Let us get rid of the red tape and all of that nonsense."  I put it to them that they should sit down with the affected families in Inishowen, or anywhere else in the State, who have been affected and who are now paying the price for poor regulation and the absence of laws and enforcement.  This is not an abstract issue.  If a person believes that because they are not living in mica-affected home and it does not affect them, then he or she is thinking incorrectly.  We all pay in the end for a lack of regulation.  The taxpayers and citizens across the country need to know that the bill for a lack of regulation or poor enforcement, be it in construction or in the banks, always falls on them.</p>  <p>  It is not just about mica; there is a pattern.  For example, we have seen thousands of lives fall apart due to structural defaults and fire defects in apartments.  This is another legacy of the Wild West era of "Whatever you're having yourself, sure it'll be grand."  As with many other Members in this House, I have worked closely with the Construction Defects Alliance.  I do not wish in any way to confuse the two issues, but we do need to see action in budget 2023 with practical supports given to the owners of between 60,000 and 100,000 affected apartments who are covered by the Construction Defects Alliance campaign.  The longer this goes on unresolved and the longer that people put off doing the remediation work that needs to be done to make these homes safer, the more unsafe they will be and the more uncertainty prevails.  It would be useful if the Minister in his closing remarks, if he feels it is appropriate in the context of the debate will tell us what we can expect to see with regard to the Construction Defects Alliance campaign in the budget in the autumn.</p>  <p>  There is an onus on the Oireachtas to atone for the grievous mistakes of the recent past and to put our words into real action.  The Bill and the scheme will need to be right this time for all affected homeowners, now and into the future.  I discussed this with my Labour Party comrade, Councillor Martin Farren in County Donegal, earlier today.  he pointed out some issues with the Bill and the scheme as it is currently presented, and some amendments that could be made to improve the operation of the scheme.  There are many amendments that we will all table for discussion next week and we need time to be able to do that.  First and foremost, we need to get this right and when we do, we need to move on this as soon as possible, especially for owner-occupiers.  They need to be at the front of our minds.  As Deputy &Oacute; Broin correctly articulated, there is an absence of trust and a lack of confidence in the process, which is understandable, given the experience of families and campaign groups to date.  Those families need certainty and people need to be confident that the State will not just support them to the end but listen to the genuine concerns at the moment.  Currently, there is a lack of confidence arising from the direct experience.</p>  <p>  As I said earlier, while I am not a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage, I take an interest in the conduct of the affairs of the committee.  I am aware of the concerns of the joint committee members that have been expressed, which were articulated by Deputy &Oacute; Broin earlier.  It is important that these concerns are understood and appreciated by the Minister and his officials because I believe these will form the bulk of many of the amendments we expect to deal with next week.  Under head 14, for example, it must be the case that updated SCSI reports on costs should be obtained with regard to the inflation factor.  We simply do not know where construction inflation will settle.  Under head 15, the issue of foundations simply must also be addressed, and they have to be included.  On the matter of whether there might be unsafe levels of mica in the foundations, it is surely as plain as the nose on one's face that this must be established before any work commences.  It must be covered by the scheme in its entirety.  It is not too much to ask that heads could be put together to have a robust testing and certification scheme in place before any remediation work, which could cost up to &euro;400,000, would commence.  Under head 21, it should be self-evident that any appeals process would be independent of all the statutory actors.  That makes sense.  Natural justice insists that this would be the case, and public confidence demands it.</p>  <p>  I am also attracted to the argument from a Mayo mica campaigner that a homeowner may be prepared to downsize to rebuild a smaller home within the full amount of the mica redress grant rather than having to build the exact same larger and costlier home.  This proposal has merit and should be permitted, with the necessary checks and balances put in place.  This makes environmental sense too with regard to the life cycle and it makes sense on every level that people should be permitted to downsize where it is appropriate, with checks and balances in place.  There should be no downsizing penalty.</p>  <p>  Some consideration could also be given to a fair grant scheme to allow for an award to be paid retrospectively where a homeowner may have had to carry our remediation work well in advance of the prospect of any remediation scheme being put in place.</p> <p>It is reasonable and fair to request such an approach.  There are genuinely grave concerns on the grant amounts for house size.  As it stands, it seems that many of the affected families and homeowners may not be able to avail of the scheme to remediate their home and this as to be addressed in the end. Likewise, there are legitimate concerns that the cost of rebuilding mica homes under the proposed scheme would leave many homeowners tens of thousands of euro out of pocket.     </p> <p> These arguments have been made in good faith by the people who presented to the committee and who have been in contact with all of us as Deputies and they should not be misconstrued as an attempt to unduly benefit from the scheme as some, though not the Minister, may have put it.  The Government report undertaken by the SCSI did note these concerns, yet one witness at the committee noted that we still have some affected homeowners, victims who have had their lives put on hold, being treated as &ldquo;chancers&rdquo; when making claims.  That sort of experience should be informative for us.  The committee also heard the case of Martina Hegarty from Mayo, as Deputy &Oacute; Broin alluded to.  Although hers is one of the smallest houses eligible under the scheme, she said she will still be left with a minimum of &euro;50,000 shortfall under the proposed framework.  </p> <p> Residents in County Donegal tell us all the time that they want to get this right but they want to make sure that owner-occupiers are prioritised.  These are people who are paying their mortgages, who live there and have no other interests anywhere else; that is their family home.  Some, not all, have a sense that they are being held to ransom by others who may be investors in properties in the county looking for the best possible deal.  That is something I have picked up on but I am not saying that is the general view.  It is understandable that owner-occupiers want the right scheme in place as soon as possible, so they can proceed and they should not be held back by what they might describe as ephemeral concerns that are being expressed under the radar by others.  The Minister may be aware of those concerns but I want to put that on the record because the ordinary homeowner is the priority here.  To be fair, the landlord who is on the RTB register, who is doing things legitimately and where someone is living in that house, should also be prioritised.  That is why the scheme needs to be up and running as soon as possible with owner-occupiers prioritised. </p> <p> The Minister set out the financial cost to the State of the scheme  His analysis is that it would cost approximately &euro;2.7 billion, which is not an insignificant amount by any stretch of the imagination.  The State has no choice other than to step in and address the issues in this Republic for taxpayers and for citizens because of the absence of regulation under the watch of the Oireachtas over recent times.  This is not a long history; it happened in the recent past.  Recently, I outlined how a reformed bank levy could assist in providing the resources that we need to address the cost demands in the context of this scheme and other schemes that may arise.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin mentioned accountability and holding those who are ultimately responsible for this to account.  We need to hear more about that.  Legal proceedings are being launched by some of the affected homeowners against those they deem responsible for this disaster.  Some form of assistance should be provided to them by the State.  The NSAI, and county councils may well be joined in those actions.  Ultimately, they are agencies of the State and they are accountable and responsible, and in the case of State agencies, they are responsible to the Minister who, in turn, is responsible to the House.  </p> <p> We need to make sure that this never happens again.  That is why this House needs to make a determined effort and the Government needs to learn from this and ensure that regulation is key and regulation and enforcement is implemented properly and to the standard that would be expected in a developed wealthy Republic.  </p> <p> Let us take the builders' register.  Industry interests are essentially policing themselves again.  Do we ever learn?   If we cannot learn from the mica scandal, something that has come at huge expense to many thousands of families across the country, not only financially but also emotionally, psychologically and materially, then when will we ever learn?  I cannot say that these mistakes or issues will never arise again.  Legislation is going through these Houses and there is a proposal that will soon find its way into law where we will have a builders' register that will effectively still be regulated by the representative body for builders in this country.  That is bizarre and does not stand up to scrutiny.  The Minister knows my view on this and that of many Opposition Members.  That is not a sustainable position.</p> <p> The suppliers of defective blocks must be held to account.  What committee members heard last week regarding the operation of quarries needs to be investigated and properly interrogated.  Higher standards need to be put at the centre of our approach to this in the future.  Lessons must be learned. </p> <p> I appeal to the Minister again to work with us to give more time to take amendments next week and, indeed, the week after.  I have said many times in the House and in the media that such is the challenge around the cost of living that we cannot wait until October, or it seems now late September, for a budget we need it now.  Myself and my Labour Party colleagues are prepared for the House to sit longer.  I cannot speak for other Members of the Opposition but I know that we are all determined to get this right.  We are prepared to sit ain committee and I know the Seanad would also be prepared to sit longer if it meant getting this right and concluding this difficult journey in the right way.  We all know what we need to do and the Minister needs to enable us to get there.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-06-30a.219" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1546" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="13:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022063000029#KK00200"><p>I welcome an important step in this legislation coming before the House.  It is a crucial step in ensuring that homeowners in my own county and many other counties can get their lives back on track and try to remove themselves from the nightmare that they have been living for well over a decade.</p>  <p>  Like every other person in Donegal, I have neighbours, family and friends affected.  If someone is not affected, he or she has a brother or sister, mother or father, or a son or daughter affected.  That is how pervasive, unfortunately, this disaster is in my home county, particularly in the northern half.  Unfortunately, it has affected every family in the county.  It has impacted their mental and physical health, the lives of children as they have grown up and marriages.  It has put an immense strain on family life and on people being able to live a normal life.  That is why it is so crucial that we get a scheme in place that will work for families and deliver the support they need to get their homes fixed.  </p>  <p>  I first visited a home impacted by this in late 2013 and I campaigned in opposition to get a scheme in place in as timely a manner as possible.  Since gaining the privilege to work as a Cabinet Minister, following my appointment to Government, I have worked with the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, the Taoiseach and party leaders, Government colleagues and constituency colleagues from all parties to progress a Bill and to try to bring it forward as quickly as possible.  I want to recognise the work of everyone who has contributed to that.  I recognise the support of the Taoiseach who visited the county and put in place a working group following on from that to fully examine the issues at play and the tremendous role of the Minister in leading out on this and bringing the legislation together working with his team, including John O'Connor, Kevin Dillon, all his officials and the Office of the Attorney General.  I want to particularly recognise the role of homeowners and the work that they have done while living what should have been a normal life in trying to get this issue addressed and fixed.  I thank those involved in the working group.</p> <p>I welcome those who are here today.  It is far from the first day that many people have been outside the House, in the D&aacute;il or in this city on this issue.  I commend the work put in by Michael Doherty, Paddy Diver, Eileen Doherty and Ann Owens in the working group that was established.  I commend the work and leadership of the Mica Action Group under the chairmanship of Eamon Jackson in Donegal and Martina Hegarty in Mayo.  That is what it has got to get us to this stage.</p> <p> There are 50 pages of legislation here and the Bill was published over a week ago.  I have done all I can working within Government to try to get to the stage where it delivers an entirely different scheme, with an entirely different level of support, from the scheme that was there previously.  The work the committee did last week was important and the examination and the consideration of the D&aacute;il and Seanad will be important.  I recognise and welcome the support across the D&aacute;il to get this legislation passed by the summer recess.  I note the unanimous support of the housing committee last week.  I welcome that the committee structured its examination to ensure that would be possible.  It will be important to have further engagement with the Business Committee to try to provide as much time as we can for this before the recess.  I know several Bills are coming through the D&aacute;il over the next two weeks and we have a very heavy schedule.  However, as much time as possible should be provided to this Bill.  It is important that the amendments being submitted today are given consideration and reflected upon.</p> <p> This is an entirely different scheme from what was in place previously.  It is based on independent assessments and costings provided by the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland based on up-to-date building costs as recently as March.  It has a cap of &euro;420,000 versus the previous cap of &euro;275,000.  Unlike the pyrite scheme on the east coast, it facilitates rental properties - one rental property per owner.  Unlike the previous scheme, the new scheme provides &euro;15,000 for accommodation and &euro;5,000 for storage.  When the scheme is enacted, an application will cost &euro;500 as opposed to the &euro;6,000 or &euro;7,000 that homeowners had to find upfront previously.</p> <p> More work remains to be done.  The regulations will be important.  I look forward to working with the Minister and colleagues to ensure those are brought forward as quickly as possible.  We need to consider the outstanding issues to be addressed in the legislation or regulations, for example, flexibility on downsizing.  Also important is the National Standards Authority of Ireland's work on the new deleterious materials that have emerged such as pyrrhotite and other sulphurs.  Information needs to be provided as quickly as possible so that scientific advice is available to the Government to ensure the scheme can be updated and the science follows.</p> <p> In the interim period, we need enhanced engagement between the Department, Donegal County Council and other local authorities to ensure as many as possible of the applications in train can move on and that as many houses as possible can be fixed as quickly as possible.</p> <p> I again thank everyone involved in getting us to this stage.  More work remains to be done, but we are in a strong place now and that is thanks to the engagement of homeowners and everyone coming together to do this.  It is important now to step it out and take on board the views of all in the House who recognise the importance of ensuring this Bill, providing for the scheme, is passed before the summer recess.</p></speech>

We have made choices to make political decisions.  The people in the Gallery, those with houses affected by pyrite, did not make choices to be political.  However, they have been forced into this by the consequence of what has happened to them.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately, the Bill the Minister has brought before us today does not deal with the matter sufficiently.  He heard the testimony from the people in Donegal, Mayo, Sligo, Limerick and Clare.  They have been left with a shortfall of between 20% and 30% to rebuild their homes which are falling in pieces around them.</p>  <p>  It is disappointing for them and it is disappointing for the country that we are in this predicament.  All of us pay taxes.  The Government is about having a safety net for people.  When they are in trouble and their backs are to the wall, they need to have somebody to back them up and that is the Government they elect.  That should be there as a last port of call.  The Minister is letting them down here.  That is very clear from the testimonies that have been read out today.</p>  <p>  Some 80 amendments to the Bill have been tabled.  We often have many amendments to Bills before the House, but to have 80 is a reflection of how deficient this legislation is in delivering for the people across all these areas and indeed other counties that may yet be affected.</p>  <p>  An abundance of houses in my constituency in County Sligo have the same problem.  Homeowners have applied to the local authority and to date they have not been approved for the scheme.  We need a process to ensure they are accommodated quickly.  It is not just in these counties because, as we know, county boundaries do not have some kind of limits that materials cannot cross.  There are no checkpoints at county boundaries to see if deficient materials are crossing into other counties.  It is quite clear that many counties around the country will have the same problem with deficient materials.</p>  <p>  We need to ensure this scheme works for everyone everywhere who finds themselves in this situation.  We need to ensure priority is given to people who are owner occupiers, people who are renting houses in this situation, but also others as has been said.  Nursing homes and various other public buildings will have the same problem and this scheme does not address those.  It is very clear that this scheme is deficient and the Minister needs to accept that.  He needs to make the space to accept all the amendments that have been tabled by various Deputies.  He needs to ensure time is given to get the legislation to work.</p>  <p>  What we have is simply wrong.  We have left and right in this Chamber but we also have right and wrong in it.  It is wrong that people would be wronged in this way and left with homes crumbling around them.  The Government is not stepping up to the mark adequately to provide for their needs.</p></speech>

My understanding from the discussion at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage is that the members of the committee are more than happy to meet next week for six, seven, eight or nine hours, or however long it takes to go through these amendments in detail and scrutinise them to ensure we can get the best Bill possible.  Members of the committee will make themselves available to do that.</p><p>That proposal was discussed at this morning's meeting of the Business Committee.  No one present made any objection to it.  There was a very strong view from many of the groups and parties represented there that enough time should be allowed next week to go through the amendments.  The Government Chief Whip committed to check with the Department and the Minister to see if that would be acceptable.  We can meet next week for six, seven, eight or nine hours, or however long it takes to discuss the amendments properly to ensure we get the best Bill possible.</p><p>All we need is for the Minister to okay that proposal.  I urge him to do so because if he approves it, we will give the six, seven, eight or nine hours needed next week at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage to go through the Bill in detail and discuss all the amendments.  I urge the Minister to give the green light so that we can do this Bill justice.  Considerable work has gone into it.  It is important that we get it right and do not fall short because of time at this stage.  It is entirely down to the Minister to give it the okay.  There are no objections from any other quarters that I am aware of.</p><p>In discussing this Bill, I want to recall the recent words of our President, Michael D. Higgins, who stated:</p> <blockquote> 	There is a powerful word.  Home.  Home.  Home is about the about the outpouring of intimacies and emotions.  Sometimes it is only a very simple thing but it is where personalities are developed, where relationships with others are developed.  It is a place to come back to, a place to depart from. </blockquote>  <p>When we talk about this Bill and defective blocks and we talk about crumbling buildings, we are talking about the place where families seek shelter and refuge.</p><p><i>3 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p>They invest their lives and emotions to create a home.  It is more than a building.  When the place people call their home and their refuge becomes unsafe, and they have no place to return to to escape that stress, it creates huge pressure and puts people under immense pressure.  We have all the fallout from that, including mental health problems and everything else that other Deputies and Ministers have spoken about.<br/><br/>The Government is bringing forward a Bill for a remediation scheme that in its estimation will cost &euro;2.75 billion.  There are four things we should expect from it at the very least.  They are that there would be proper scrutiny of the Bill and every effort would be made to recover costs and go after those who are responsible.  We should expect that not a single quarry would continue to operate that is producing substandard materials that lead to people's homes crumbling.  We should also expect that every measure necessary is put in place to ensure this never ever happens again.  That is not too much for anyone to expect.<br/><br/>The Minister can change the way we are scrutinising the Bill.  As we speak, only two hours is being allotted next week for Committee and Remaining Stages, which means we will not be able to give it the scrutiny and put forward proposals to improve and change the Bill if needed, or to hear the Minister's response.  The deadline for amendments was 11 a.m. today, before we even began Second Stage, which is not following proper process.  There is the use of the guillotine and the legislation is being rammed through in a way that is utterly unacceptable.<br/><br/>There is a pattern developing with this Minister.  When legislation is not contentious, such as the first parts of the electoral reform legislation, where we saw much consensus, we are given ample time to discuss it on Committee Stage and go through different amendments.  When it comes to complex and contentious legislation, or legislation that needs proper and detailed scrutiny, we see the time allowed for discussion shoehorned into an impossible slot to give it proper attention.  We know from previous experience that rushed legislation is bad legislation.  I appeal to the Minister again on this.  Only one person can remove the obstacles to the housing committee having nine hours or whatever amount of time it takes next week to go through the Bill on Committee Stage, and that is the Minister.  I appeal to him to agree to that proposal because nobody else has objected to it.<br/><br/>The timelines imposed mean affected homeowners have not had a chance to study the Bill in detail, make suggestions and give the feedback they would like.  We heard the statements before from affected homeowners, who engaged over the past year or number of months in good faith, working in detail through different issues.  They are deeply concerned, disappointed and very frustrated that the work they have done is not reflected in this Bill.  In fairness, they put their hearts and souls into the process.<br/><br/>We should expect the Government, if the Bill looks to do everything possible, to hold those responsible for this problem to account.  The Government must hold big industry that is responsible for this disaster to account.  The full cost of the remediation must be recovered.  The Minister has been vocal on the issue of recovering costs and made plenty of statements about it but we still have not seen anything done.  Some large Irish construction companies are currently contributing to the UK redress schemes arising out of the issues relating to cladding at Grenfell Tower and the disaster there.  The equivalent company is not being held to account in Ireland at this point.<br/><br/>It is very important measures do not punish the entire sector because that would punish people who have complied with all the standards.  This must be about holding to account those who are responsible.  That is really important if we are to have accountability built into this process.<br/><br/>We learned at last Thursday's meeting of the housing committee - and the Minister repeated it in his opening comments - that the Government &quot;intends&quot; to do something about this and there is an intention to appoint a senior counsel to look into cost recovery.  Incredibly, terms of reference for this work have still not been drawn up and nobody has, as of now, been appointed.  There is an urgency in this because the Statute of Limitations will kick in and prevent action being taken after a certain period.  There is a ten-year window and it will start to kick in with some aspects quite soon.  That tells us everything we need to know about the level of urgency the Government is showing to recovering costs from those who are responsible.<br/><br/>The Government has been negligent with respect to rogue quarries that are still operating.  We were told in last Thursday's meeting of the housing committee by Mr. Aidan O'Connell, an experienced and qualified engineer, about such quarries.  He stated:</p><blockquote>	We have experience of 12 counties where we have seen damage.  As of last week, we are now on county 13.  That was a substantial amount of properties to be inspecting, reviewing and so forth.  One of the difficulties we are having, and I understand this is a public forum, is that the quarry owners recognise they have a problem and are suppressing some of the information and some of the damage and doing side deals with homeowners to try to suppress it within the counties.  Ultimately, I believe where all these locations are will come out.<br /><br />I encourage people and Deputies who have knowledge of affected quarries, because I am aware of some areas in the southern part of Ireland and on the south-east coast where there are affected properties and they probably are well aware of where that material has come from, to come forward and give that information to the National Standards Authority of Ireland or Engineers Ireland. </blockquote> <p>He continued:</p><blockquote>	I do know certain quarries that are still producing concrete blocks and material that is wholly unsatisfactory and they continue to do it knowing that material is still wholly unsatisfactory.  I believe that some TDs and other public personnel do know that themselves and I would encourage them to try to use any of their authority to get it stopped. </blockquote> <p>That is an incredible statement and, to be frank, I am very disappointed the Minister did not address the matter in his opening remarks.  He said he had ordered an audit of all active quarries in Donegal but what about the other quarries that we know, as of last Thursday, are operating around the country?  I have been in touch, as I know others have, with the National Building Control Office about this, urging it to act.  Why is the Minister not acting on this and why did he not address the question in his opening remarks?  Why are quarries still operating and producing substandard material leading to crumbling houses, putting families and communities through all that stress?  What is the Minister doing about this and why are we not hearing from him about action?  Everybody in Ireland deserves to hear from the Minister about what is being done about these quarries, which are still operating.  It is utterly unacceptable that the Minister with responsibility for this had nothing to say about it in his opening comments today.  I urge him to address the question in his closing statement.<br/><br/>If this is not to happen again, there are four actions the Government should take as a matter of urgency.  We need a national building control authority along the lines of the National Food Safety Authority of Ireland and we must make the inspection and certification of building and development properly independent to completely break the self-certification model that has been an absolute disaster.  We must introduce latent defects insurance, although the Government opposed my recent amendments in legislation to do this.  We need an independent regulator of the building industry rather than one run by the building industry, which is what is being done.  Given the huge costs, stress and trauma caused by building defects and defective blocks, it is inexcusable that these measures have not been taken already.<br/><br/>I will touch on the assignment and subrogation of claims to the Minister, dealt with in section 29.  This means homeowners will not be able to take legal actions if they sign up to the State's redress scheme.  We know that so far, 34 High Court writs have been issued and hundreds more could be expected.  Would it not be in the State's interest to allow homeowners to recover costs against third parties, especially for non-grantable losses or any of the costs of construction or remediation not covered by this scheme?  It appears this section of the Bill will prevent homeowners from recovering those costs through legal action.</p>  <p>We need to know on what basis the State purports to inherit a plaintiff's rights to recover sums that are not covered by the grants for which third parties could otherwise be liable.  I asked officials from the Department about this at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage last Thursday.  We were promised an answer but I have not received one.  This is one of the problems with rushing this legislation through in that we raise legitimate questions, as we are meant to do as part of the democratic process, and we do not get answers.  That is a deficit in this process.</p> <p> Does blocking these legal actions mean that people who are not covered under the scheme could end up taking a legal case and get financial recourse for thousands of other homeowners?  Last week, representatives of the affected homeowners informed the committee that they felt this part of the legislation was designed to put the frighteners on them and stop people pursuing a claim against anyone.  While there were measures in the Bill to prevent affected homeowners from taking from legal action, there are no such measures with respect to taking on those who are responsible for this disaster.</p> <p> Previous speakers mentioned the option of penalty-free downsizing.  This is a very good proposal, which has been put forward as a compromise by affected homeowners.  Again, we have not heard a good explanation of the reason it is not being provided for.  This option makes sense given the environmental benefits it would have in terms of reduced building materials and less energy to heat homes.  As such, it is in line with Government policy to tackle climate change.  I ask the Government to consider allowing penalty-free downsizing and flexibility.  It makes eminent sense to do so.</p> <p> On the damage threshold, there is a concern that this will potentially exclude and delay thousands of homeowners in pyrite-impacted counties.  The reliance on visual inspections and assessment of photographs will mean some homeowners will be excluded and core testing will only apply if owners pass the damage threshold.  Concerns were articulated last week that this could mean that homeowners who have understandably taken some small measures to prevent additional water egress and the damage that causes may not meet the damage threshold as a result of the very small measures they have taken.</p> <p> A scientific and evidence-based approach should be taken and should rely on core testing.  This a line that is worth repeating.  I do not think there is anything controversial about taking that approach.  Why then is that approach not being taken and why are we not relying on core testing for assessing the damage threshold?</p> <p> There are a number of other issues with this Bill and I and other Deputies have submitted a large number of amendments to it.  I have concerns that the revised rates and caps are not in line with forecast inflation and that the proposals on cost inflation in the Bill are inadequate.  I also have concerns that the approach taken is not following the science and does not ensure all deleterious materials are assessed and the foundations are tested.</p> <p> We were told last Thursday at the housing committee that the Housing Agency, for example, has not done any testing of foundations in Donegal.  Why is it that the case?  Why is there an aversion to taking a scientific and evidence-based approach to that?  Why are we not taking an approach that would mean that no defective concrete block homeowner is left behind?</p> <p> I am concerned that the approval process is complex and has so many stages that it will not be user-friendly.  We have to think of this in terms of the stress and trauma that homeowners have already gone through.  Making those processes more difficult for them does not help.</p> <p> There are also concerns about the power and discretion being placed in the hands of the Minister in setting regulations without scrutiny.  There are concerns that the 18-month time limit may cause issues with accessing contractors and builders, especially in areas of high demand.  </p> <p> It is very important that we get this legislation right.  Rushing it does not help at all in that regard.  There must be accountability and recovery of costs from those who are responsible.  The lack of action on that to date is utterly unforgivable.  The rogue quarries producing substandard materials which are damaging homes and lives to this day need to be shut down and dealt with.  It is completely unacceptable that the Government is not acting on that.  There needs to be action now to ensure the construction sector is independently and robustly regulated to ensure issues like this never arise again.  The passage through the Houses of the Regulation of Providers of Building Works and Building Control (Amendment) Bill 2022 means the sector will not be independently regulated but will regulate itself.  It is incredible, after everything that has happened in this country, that the Government would do that.</p> <p> I agree with the comments of Deputy Nash on the proposal from the Construction Defects Alliance.  We need to see action on that in this year&rsquo;s budget and I hope that the Minister will address the matter in his concluding remarks.</p> <p> I reiterate that the House could give this Bill the justice and scrutiny it deserves and the time needed for the amendments if one person, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, were to facilitate and agree to that.  Nobody else has objected to the suggestion.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-06-30a.225" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1517" speakername="Joe Carey" time="13:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022063000032#NN00200"><p>I welcome this opportunity to contribute to the Second Stage debate on this important legislation.  The life-changing discovery by so many householders in County Clare of the presence of pyrite in their homes in recent years has exposed the fundamental flaw in the previous scheme, namely, that households in County Clare were simply excluded and had no access to grant aid and nowhere to turn for redress.  The establishment of the Clare Pyrite Action Group by Dr. Martina Cleary in September 2020 has led to the welcome Government decision of 14 June 2022 to include County Clare in the new scheme we are debating today.  </p><p>Affected householders in County Clare have travelled a long road to get to this point.  I pay tribute to the sustained campaign of the Clare Pyrite Action Group led by its chairperson, Dr. Martina Cleary, and the vice-chairperson, Mary Hanley, working together with the director of services of Clare County Council, Anne Haugh, and her team of Siobh&aacute;n McNulty and Tony Neville, together with expert engineer, Simon Beale.  I also want to mention the great work of the <i>The Clare Champion</i>journalist, Fiona McGarry, who has covered this issue extensively over the past number of years.  </p><p>The Clare Pyrite Action Group has identified 1,025 potentially impacted private homes, 17 private housing estates, five local authority housing estates and 11 large-scale public and private dwellings.  I strongly believe this is a conservative estimate and many more affected homeowners will come forward given that County Clare is now eligible for this scheme.</p> <p>The headline aspects of the new Bill are welcome and include the increase in the maximum grant available going from &euro;275,000 up to &euro;420,00 per dwelling; grant rates in keeping with the construction cost report prepared by the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland; a Government guarantee regarding remediation works other than full demolition and rebuild, that is, options 2 to 5, through eligibility for a second grant, if required, for a period of 40 years; the introduction of an independent appeals process for applicants, with all key decisions under the scheme appealable by homeowners; alternative accommodation, storage costs and immediate repair works to a maximum value of &euro;25,000; the Housing Agency playing a key role under the enhanced scheme by taking on the financial cost of testing and assessing homes and determining on behalf of the local authorities the appropriate remediation option and grant rate for each dwelling; the extension of the enhanced scheme beyond the current scope of the principal private residence only to cover rented dwellings registered with the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB; and exempted development status under the planning legislation for remediation works carried out under the defective concrete block scheme on a like-for-like basis.</p> <p> A number of concerns were expressed to me regarding the proposed new scheme and, as with everything, the devil is in detail.  Many of these matters were discussed by the working group, which was set up in June 2021 and includes affected householders from counties Donegal and Mayo.  This working group did not involve County Clare homeowners.  While I acknowledge that the Clare Pyrite Action Group was given a briefing on the general scheme of the Bill by officials literally days after its publication, and got the opportunity last week to appear before the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage, that is the sum total of the group's involvement in this scheme, which is really disappointing.</p> <p> The principal issues that have emerged and which were raised with me by the Clare Pyrite Action Group principally include the damage threshold.  The concern from a County Clare perspective is that the proposed visual inspection of a 1.5 mm crack may leave Clare homes behind.  I say this because access to core testing has enabled County Clare homeowners to make an undisputable case for inclusion in this scheme.  The reality is that houses in County Clare might look visually fine, principally because homeowners have maintained the render on their homes.  If a proper assessment were to take place as part of the assessment process, however, these houses will most certainly be found to be structurally unsound and dangerous.  It is important that regulations that will accompany this Bill recognise this critical point and facilitate homeowners to have the right to appoint their own engineer who will work on their behalf and have access to results.</p> <p> In terms of the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland, I believe that any new reports commissioned for calculation of the rates must include County Clare in order that there is no delay in Clare homeowners entering the scheme and beginning the remediation process as soon as the scheme opens.</p> <p> With regard to the appeals process, the time limitations for this must be extended to at least 90 days to afford homeowners the opportunity to prepare any additional materials, as required, to prove their case.  They must also be allowed to submit additional materials rather than prohibiting them from doing so.  This could, for example, be additional independent evaluations of the property or testing.  Remediation options must be appropriate for the damage caused by pyrite attack, which also includes the issue of foundations.  Essentially, householders cannot rebuild their homes without scientific testing and its assurance that their house foundations are sound.  There is also the option with regard to downsizing, which I think needs serious consideration.  We also need to pursue with vigour the quarries responsible for this scandal and hold them to account at every opportunity.</p> <p> Will the Minister in his concluding remarks respond to the matters I raised today and, where necessary, will he bring forward the required amendments to this Bill and the accompanying regulations?  I also believe additional time is clearly required for the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage and its members to consider fully this legislation and the amendments that will be put forward.  It is important that householders who, through no fault of their own, find themselves with crumbling homes can turn to a fit-for-purpose scheme that enables them to rebuild their homes and lives.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-06-30a.227" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1613" speakername="Martin Browne" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022063000033#OO00200"><p>Homeowners in counties Donegal, Mayo, Clare, Sligo, Limerick, Tipperary and up to seven other counties are living in buildings that were built with defective blocks, foundations and other damaging materials like mica and pyrite.  They are feeling the impact of light-touch regulation of building product surveillance that was introduced by Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael in the 1990s.  This has left many, like the families in the Gallery, to live in crumbling homes for more than a decade.</p>  <p>  For those in County Tipperary, there is still uncertainty about the future and this is something that needs to be addressed.  Indeed, the Minister said last week that further local authority areas can be added as the necessary evidence supports inclusion.  This is no way to treat homeowners who are dealing with such disruption to their lives.  We need to end the uncertainty.</p>  <p>  The Bill we have seen falls far short on a number of counts, however, which is another failure on the Minister's watch.  An effective scheme is one that addresses the needs of each household that is affected, and being fully encompassing is key.  I will mention as an example how homeowners who opt to build a smaller home because the grant will not cover the full cost of replacement are being punished with a further reduction in the grant.  The damage threshold, as designed in the Bill, will exclude many homeowners.  This cannot be allowed to happen.  It must be amended to allow for prioritisation of the worst-affected homes and not the exclusion of affected homes.  The exclusion of large numbers of buildings such as holiday homes, community buildings and small business premises is another hole in this legislation.</p>  <p>  I will go back to the need to scrutinise properly a Bill that will have such profound consequences for households.  The Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage was practically railroaded into having to engage in what can only be described as an accelerated scrutiny of this Bill.  As one homeowner said, it has been under a week since the publication of the heads and the draft text of the Bill, so there has been very little time to engage with the proposals and to format this information.  To allow an extremely limited amount of time to scrutinise a Bill of this importance is a masterclass by the Government in shirking accountability.  The affected mica and pyrite homeowners have submitted a significant number of amendments and are urging all Deputies on both sides of this Chamber to support these to fix the defects in the Minister's Bill.  The Minister must accept these proposed changes and ensure no guillotine is imposed.  It is high time to do the right thing by homeowners, listen to their concerns, get this right and help them get through the hell they are dealing with daily.</p></speech>

When faced with a situation where they discover the house they bought whatever number of years ago is basically crumbling around them, people could be forgiven for collapsing into despair and thinking there is nothing they can do.  We are still not where we need to be but we are at the point we are now because the campaigners did not just take that approach.  Their backs were to the walls and they campaigned extremely valiantly and eloquently like, for example, those who appeared before the joint committee yesterday and those who campaign persistently in massive numbers.</p>  <p>  I had the privilege of speaking at a massive protest numbering thousands of people outside the Custom House in Dublin last October.  The determination and resilience of the people there was absolutely clear.  I really want to say fair play to all of them.  They have also helped to raise the plight of other people who are affected by other construction defects, which I will mention later, and have shown that if people campaign, they can actually force change on the Government.  They have had an enormously positive impact in this country.</p>  <p>  The message from the campaigners, which is part of the reason the campaign has been so effective, has always been extremely clear: 100% redress and nothing less.  The profoundly strong moral argument behind it, which everybody could understand, is that this is not their fault.  This is not the fault of homeowners.  They had no hand, act or part to blame in terms of this situation.  The responsibility lies with the quarry owners, builders, developers and successive Governments that have built a Republic of developers, quarry owners and so on as opposed to one that serves the interests of ordinary working people.  I will summarise the problem and then go into some more details.  The problem we have at the moment is that the Bill, as presented, is in reality really quite far from 100% redress and nothing less.</p> <p>In reality, there is a nice big asterisk beside the redress.  It is a road to 100% redress and then a bunch of small print which has the effect of reducing the amount of redress to significantly less than 100%, meaning that homeowners will continue to be in a crisis situation.<br/><br/>I will read a crucial part of the statement issued by the different campaigns from across the counties that came together.  It addresses the Minister:</p><blockquote>	Minister let us be clear, so our words are not misunderstood.  If this bill is not amended, we the homeowners will not support it.  We will continue our campaign and protests until it is amended, until it is fit for purpose. </blockquote> <p>It does not get any clearer than that.  The Minister knows these people are not joking or making empty promises.  They are capable of running extremely effective campaigns.  At this point, we are coming to the business end of things here.  This is Second Stage and the deadline for amendments has already passed.  The window for the Government and the Minister to make the right decision is quickly closing and I strongly urge the Minister, primarily for the benefit of the homeowners but also in his own interest, to do the right thing, to make sure the amount of time for Committee Stage is expanded to give the Bill appropriate consideration and to agree to the amendments that will turn this into a 100% redress, nothing less scheme, which is what is required.  We can recall 2017 when the then Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government was discussing the pyrite scheme at the time.  The committee recommended: &quot;The mission statement of the Redress Scheme should be: 'Ordinary owners who purchased in good faith should not be liable for the costs of remediation caused by the incompetence, negligence or deliberate non-compliance of others'.&quot;  It is very simple in terms of what should happen.  There is nothing complicated about it.<br/><br/>Before I go into things in a little more detail, I will first make a point for anybody who is watching this debate.  When Members on this side of the House call for more time for debate on Committee Stage, there is something people should be aware of regarding what happens in the D&aacute;il.  It is not just that there will not be enough time and therefore not enough exhaustion of the issues and a chance for everybody to contribute, but that we only get as far as the Committee gets with the amendments.  If it has not reached one's amendments, they just fall and are gone if they are not Government's amendments.  The Government's amendments automatically pass.  However, I understand we do not have Government amendments.  If they are Opposition amendments, they automatically disappear in a very undemocratic way.  They are just defeated.  We do not even get to have a vote on them, never mind having the type of exhaustive, comprehensive discussion that is clearly necessary as a result of, first, the situation the homeowners are facing and, second, the amount of money the State is, rightly, talking about spending.  That is one point.<br/><br/>The second point in terms of going into the details, we agree with the amendments that have been tabled by Deputy Pringle and others.  I believe there are 80 in total because, as the homeowners brought forward, there are 80 different mistakes and flaws in the Bill.  I will highlight a few.  One is the limitation in section 5 to a small number of counties.  I do not see the logic of doing that.  It does not make sense to do it as we do not yet have a full assessment of where the defective blocks have been used.  Section 8 of the Bill limits the scheme to homes built before 2020.  Again, it does not make sense, particularly in the context of the extremely worrying evidence heard by the committee last week that there may well be defective blocks still being produced as we speak.  Obviously, we have to act to ensure that this is not continuing, but it means putting a time limit for when the homes would have been bought is completely inappropriate.  Similarly, limiting the scheme only to owners who bought their home before 2020 is an unfair and arbitrary line.<br/><br/>The issue that has been highlighted and which appears to be a vital question in respect of section 12 is leaving out the cost of replacing foundations when they are affected.  Again, it does not make any sense, neither from the point of view of the homeowners who are affected by mica nor from the point of view of the State.  It will not make any sense for the State to spend billions of euro and to have whatever proportion it is of those euro going into building on defective foundations which will not last and the house will have to come down and it will have to be done all over again.  It would be a crime for us to go through that process.<br/><br/>Regarding the point about garages and walls being included, these in reality will constitute a significant reduction in the amount of money that homeowners are able to get.  There is a cap on the total amount of money a homeowner could get.  We have the cap, but we already have had massive amounts of inflation and there will be more by the time the scheme comes into operation, so clearly it is completely inadequate.<br/><br/>The point regarding no penalty for downsizing has been extremely well made by the campaigners.  The idea that we should disincentivise people from downsizing their house makes no sense either from a justice point of view or from an environmental point of view.  We should not be putting pressure on people.  If they want to rebuild the same house they currently have, they should be facilitated with 100% redress, but if they want to downsize for whatever reason, the State should fully support them in that.  It means using fewer materials and having a smaller carbon footprint.  That is a good thing and in no way should they be penalised for it.  There are a number of other flaws, and they are being addressed in the Opposition amendments.  They include arbitrary limits in grant timings and flawed methods for calculating the redress.<br/><br/>The features in these debates are the fundamental points.  We are in a crisis situation.  We have been through the pyrite issue, now we are dealing with mica and we are going to be dealing with very significant other construction defects and problems, particularly in apartments.  It is all a microcosm of the failings of the Irish political system and its Government.  It is a crumbling monument to all that is wrong and has been wrong with both the Irish construction sector and the political influence of that sector.  It was the predecessors of the Minister and of the Government, which also include both Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael down through the years and decades, who presided over a system of self-certification and extremely low levels of regulation and who just allowed shoddy work and inadequate practices to happen all over the place with, at different levels, quarry owners, builders and so forth all operating simply with the aim of maximising their profit and cutting corners at the expense of ordinary householders in the first instance and now, necessarily, the public as a whole in terms of having to pay for a redress scheme.<br/><br/>I draw two conclusions from that.  One is that what is necessary now is 100% redress, nothing less, paid for by the State.  Then the State should mercilessly pursue those who are responsible and who created this mess, with a view to maximising the amount of return to the State.  If we can prove that there has been, and the homeowners certainly believe there has been, conscious awareness and knowledge of what was happening on the part of the quarry owners, for example, the quarries should be taken out of private ownership with no compensation and into public ownership, including assets and so forth.  All those assets should be used to right the wrong for which they are responsible.<br/><br/>The second conclusion is that we would be in a much better place to deal with this situation if we had a State construction company.  We need to create a State construction company both to address the housing crisis and also to be able to address rapidly the construction defects that have been discovered and will be discovered in the future.  We would be able to deal with it rapidly, as opposed to being reliant on the private market and so forth.</p> <p> The final point I will make is that at different phases of this campaign the tactic of divide and rule has been used by the Government or its outriders through asking people in Dublin why they should pay for people in Donegal, Clare or wherever.  Various articles in newspapers and so on have suggested some injustice is being done in that regard.  I say to all the people in the counties affected that the people I represent in Dublin South-West, and the vast majority of people in Dublin and throughout the country, do not share any of those attitudes.  What there is from ordinary people in Dublin and everywhere else is a sentiment of solidarity, fair play and outrage at the injustice that has been perpetrated on people who have experienced the mica issue.  There is also, of course, a sense of why should these people be punished for things that are no fault of theirs but are the responsibility of quarry owners, construction companies and so on?  That divide and rule tactic did not work at all.  There was a major upswell of support and solidarity.  The extremely effective campaigning, including the stickers and posters throughout the entire country raising awareness of this issue, played a very important role in that support.  The divide and rule tactic was completely ineffective.</p> <p> This makes me return to the point I referenced at the start, which is that this issue has given people confidence elsewhere.  I will give an example I raised last week with the Minister.  In my constituency, I am now in touch with a significant group of apartment and duplex owners.  These are people in a major apartment complex where significant defects have been discovered.  When I spoke in the Chamber last week, I said to the Minister they were being told they needed to pay &euro;15,000 to deal with fire defects.  Since then, they have received a quantity surveyor's report that states it could cost up to &euro;45,000 for each apartment.  These people are not able to pay that.  They do not have that kind of money.  There is no way that will work.  It simply does not work for them, yet they were presented with the threat that fire officers would shut down access to the building.  However, because of the mica campaigners, they have a sense that this is not on and this is not right.  Just like the people affected by mica, this is not any responsibility of theirs, they could not possibly have known this when they bought their apartments, and they should not be left with the bill.  They and others, and I am aware of another apartment block in Carrickmines, for example, are coming together to say they need redress.</p> <p> I support the call that has been mentioned for tax credits in respect of these schemes, but I will make the point that such credits imply people can pay upfront.  Most people do not have &euro;15,000, never mind &euro;45,000, in the bank.  That does not work.  We are now seeing a situation where we are talking about tens of thousands, if not more than 100,000, apartments in particular that were built during the Celtic tiger period, whose owners are victims of self-certification, poor regulation and shoddy building practices, exactly like those issues experienced by homeowners affected by mica.  The idea these people will be able to pay upfront to deal with this is not going to work.  Simply put, we will need a redress scheme, as we had for those affected by pyrite, and we absolutely had to have for those similarly affected by mica, for apartment and duplex owners affected by the shoddy construction that happened during the Celtic tiger, in particular the fire defects.</p> <p> I understand the working group was due to report by the end of June, which is today.  I suspect it will be another couple of weeks before it completes its report.  If a tax credit is included in the budget, it is much better than nothing but it will not be enough.  We are now seeing a major problem, partly as a consequence of mica and people becoming aware of it, but also due to fire inspections and so on that are being done.  The same basic principle applies: it is no fault whatsoever of the homeowners.  They were victims of the construction industry, the Government and the State, which poorly regulated that industry, and the State, therefore, needs to step in.  We need to have redress schemes.  We then need to pursue those responsible for the situation we are currently in.</p> <p> I am putting the Minister on notice that, unfortunately, this will not be the last redress scheme that will be needed.  I strongly encourage him to take on board the points being made and the position of the mica campaigners.  I ask him to agree to the extension of the debate on Committee Stage to make sure we get to hear all the amendments and, most important, that he accepts the amendments and agrees to a genuine, 100% redress scheme and nothing less because it is what is necessary for the homeowners.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the significant work put in by so many people to get to this point, including the Minister, his team and his officials, but especially homeowners from Mayo, members of Mayo Pyrite Action Group, North Mayo Pyrite Group, Mica Action Group in Donegal, and similar groups from Clare, Limerick and Sligo.  Last week, one of their representatives said they were ordinary homeowners put in an extraordinary situation.  They led an extraordinary response, which should be acknowledged, but those that put them in that situation have to be pursued.</p>  <p>  At last week's hearings of the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage, I was struck by the lack of urgency around the appointment of a senior counsel to pursue the avenues into why this happened and into those who caused it.  Far greater urgency needs to be invested in pursuing those matters and that investigation.  When we consider that in the UK &pound;2 billion has been put on the table by the industry in respect of the cladding situation, that is the kind of response we need to see here.  We need to see a contribution, not a levy because that will be passed back, out of profits from some of the most profitable companies in the country to pay towards this and other issues, such as the apartment defects issue.</p>  <p>  There is also a lack of response and a lack of engagement from the banks, which are among the ultimate winners in this because they have the mortgages.  The owners are paying banks for their homes.  The banks own those assets and they are very slow in co-operating with and assisting homeowners who are in a situation of having pyrite or mica in blocks.  The banks have made it very difficult for homeowners, as have insurance companies, which are welching on contracts throughout the country because of the suspicion of the presence of pyrite, mica or pyrrhotite.  Insurance companies and banks need to be brought to heel and told they have to serve the people regarding this.  The Government is putting its cards on the table here and, equally, we need to see a far greater engagement with companies such as these.</p>  <p>  I will briefly refer to a number of areas in the Bill.  I have made a detailed submission to the Minister's office from Ms Martina Hegarty and Ms Josephine Murphy on behalf of the two Mayo mica groups regarding the Bill, which his officials have received and are considering.  On section 5, while I welcome the inclusion of Limerick and Clare, the inclusion process is quite cumbersome.  The people of County Sligo, in particular, who began the process at the same time as County Clare, have been left waiting and wondering why they have been left aside.  There needs to be some sort of assistance provided from the Department to the relevant local authorities because there is a reluctance on the part of those authorities to get involved in this matter.  There is also a complete lack of skills in many local authorities to engage in it.</p>  <p>  On section 8 and the whole area of the definition of "relevant dwellings", it is important all parts of the house be included.  There is a concern that some extensions may be excluded.  There is also an issue around garages.  There is rather fancy word for garages and things like that in the Bill.  They will equally have defective blocks, which are dangerous to those in the house, and they need to be included in the scheme.  It is a similar situation with boundary walls.  The Minister has given me a commitment they will be included, but boundary walls in public areas of housing estates also need to be included in the scheme.  They offer a serious threat.</p>  <p> On sections 10 and 11 and the core area of grants, the SCSI process was detailed and published last March.  That would assume the process is working on the basis of construction costs in November and January.  That needs to be updated before the scheme goes live.  Smaller homes will cost more per square metre than larger homes.  We need to look again at the hearings last week and, for example, the case of Ms Martina Hegarty, who is in a smaller house in a terrace where the costs will be greater, even though the house is smaller.  Just because someone has a smaller house, he or she should not be left out of pocket.  The downsizing option is a very real one that needs to be given consideration.</p> <p>One frustrating thing is that the computer generally says no when it comes to many ideas.  We need to think outside the box within the local authorities and Departments and give the downsizing option some sort of consideration within the limitations.<br/><br/>The Minister is introducing provision in this Bill to fund local authority and AHB homes.  There are houses that are primary residences for vulnerable adults and people with disabilities that are owned by charities which do not have the resources to remediate their houses.  A similar funding option should be made available to those charities, either by the Minister or the Department of Health, in order that those people do not lose their homes in the same way that other homeowners will not lose their homes.<br/><br/>There is a major blockage in the scheme.  People are progressing, awaiting the conclusion of this process, but the SEAI process in terms of giving people funding to upgrade heating requirements has come to a complete halt.  I have been in contact with the Minister's office.  We need an urgent update on that because there are people who have had their houses demolished and are awaiting SEAI approval to proceed.  They cannot proceed because the SEAI is saying that it cannot get clearance from its parent Department, which is apparently talking to the Minister's Department.  This is it again - Departments working in silos and not talking to each other.  Meanwhile, the homeowner suffers.<br/><br/>With regard to section 12 about remediation options and building conditions assessments, the committee hearings last week were deeply confusing.  There was definite science and very definite people on both sides of this argument.  I know it is being reviewed but there needs to be an urgency to the review of foundations.  I welcome section 51 which triggers a review of the Bill following the review of IS 465.  We need to give certainty with regard to foundations as soon as is possible.  A presentation was made by Mr. Thomas Campbell, a qualified engineer in this space, with regard to a potential solution for the foundation issue.  I forwarded it to the Minister's office.  There are homeowners who want to proceed and get this over with.  If they have to pay for their own foundations, some sort of commitment should be given to funding that if the science stands up.<br/><br/>The homeowner's professional, engineer and architect needs to be part of the process too, because that is the only element of trust in all of this.  That needs to be stronger in the Bill.  I have often spoken to the Minister about the damage threshold.  I have serious concerns about it.  We had a nightmare in Mayo last summer around a damage threshold, even though it did not exist.  Being excluded from the scheme was more stressful to homeowners than being told they had pyrite in the first place.  The 1.5 mm with regard to the expert group is not based on any science.  I need to ensure that there will be robust engagement with people on the damage threshold and that it is not used as an exclusionary measure.<br/><br/>Why are all the timelines in the Bill on the homeowners?  There is no timeline on the local authority.  There is no timeline on the Housing Agency.  I put the questions to Mr. Bob Jordan last week and, in fairness, he is committed to putting timelines and service level agreements, SLAs, in place.  Timelines are needed on every side of this.  Provision is also needed for <i>force majeure </i>cases.  There are cases that will not fit into any of the definitions.  There are older people, in particular, who proceeded ahead of the scheme to remediate their houses for family safety reasons.  They need to be given some sort of recognition.<br/><br/>I acknowledge the huge changes.  It is important to acknowledge them because it is getting lost in the argument today.  This is a very different scheme to what it was this time last year.  However, to make it the kind of scheme that works, we need to engage strongly in the regulations.  Those regulations made it inaccessible on the last occasion and we need to engage strongly around some of the amendments being put forward.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-06-30a.233" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1588" speakername="Patricia Ryan" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022063000036#RR00200"><p>This is not just a Donegal, Sligo, Clare or Mayo issue.  It is a basic issue of fairness.  These families are living in homes that are crumbling.  They deserve our support and anything less than 100% redress is not acceptable.  The State was asleep at the wheel.  It was too busy squandering money in the Celtic tiger era and neglecting its responsibilities to ensure that building materials were fit for purpose.</p>  <p>  I listened to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage last week.  It is clear from the various contributors that self-regulation of manufacturers, together with inadequate local authority enforcement of standards, allowed unfit concrete blocks to enter the Irish market for years.  Quarry owners, insurance companies and bond providers all washed their hands while the State looked on.  All these homeowners want is their homes back on a like-for-like basis with what they have already paid.  It is not unreasonable to request that and if it is done for pyrite, it can certainly be done for mica.</p>  <p>  I struggle to understand the Government's approach.  Why would it exclude foundations, which are made of the same materials as the blocks?  Why exclude boundary walls, sheds and garages which have the same potential to kill a family member when they fall down?  Real costs versus allowable costs at current rates represent more than an 80% grant.  This leaves homeowners out tens of thousands of euro which is a shortfall the Minister knows they simply cannot afford.  There must be true like-for-like replacement, including house finishes, end-to-end contract management by the State and a zero cost to the homeowner.</p>  <p>  Instead, homeowners are offered a grant to carry out repairs, leaving them to find contractors who will work to the inadequate grants provided and at the mercy of inflation, while being choked up by red tape.  The Government must provide a penalty-free downsizing option that would allow the grant based on their current home size to be redirected to building themselves a smaller one if they so wish.</p>  <p>  I commend the work of the Mica Action Group which has been tireless in its campaign to achieve a just solution for homeowners.  It has identified 35 issues in the general scheme, about which the Minister has been told, all of which render the scheme unworkable to a greater or lesser extent.  This legislation is an opportunity for the Minister to do the right thing by these families and not be tone deaf.  The families and their concerns have to be listened to.  It is very simple.  It has to be 100% redress and nothing less.</p></speech>

I acknowledge that he has done a lot of hard work.  Instead of everything being negative, it should be very positive going forward.  These are family homes.  Families want to get this situation sorted out and I believe the Minister will get this sorted out.  Let us stop playing a political game of football.  The most important thing is getting the houses built, getting the families back in and starting to move on.</p>  <p>  It is very important that all people who are adversely affected by the defective material in their properties get redress.  Everybody has to get redress.  We do not know the full impact and the lack of the regulation of construction material in Ireland is not helping the situation.  I believe all counties in Ireland are having problems and all should, automatically, be allowed the allocation of funding.  I spoke to the Minister a few months ago with the county manager, Ms Joan Martin, in Dundalk.  We believe there are at least ten to 15 people in the county who have this problem.  The Minister told us that we had to put in a submission.  I spoke to the county manager again today and I know that submission has not gone in yet.  However, as I said to the Minister, it is about the families and the people.  It is very important.  Nobody is saying that only ten or 12 counties are affected.  We all know that every county has a problem.  Every county should be given an opportunity to get their family home back up and running.</p>  <p>  I talk to people on the ground, like most Deputies here.  People are very sceptical and worried because a house is a house.  That includes the garage and patio.  People are being told to leave the foundations or the patio.  One cannot do that because, naturally, much of the material in these buildings is also part of the house.  It is very important that these are all part of the compensation.  I spoke to many people over the past number of years who have invested in private houses and have gotten involved in the rental market.  As far as I am concerned, they have the same right as other people.  If one looks at these houses, they are playing a big part in the market.  Most of these houses are leased out to people or the council.  It is very important that these people are looked after as well.</p>  <p>  I used the words "nervous" and "worried".  People are nervous and very worried.  I ask the Minister to try to make it simple.  In fairness, he does not complicate things.  He just tries to say them as they are and that will be very important going forward.  The biggest problem I hear in my constituency office is that when it comes to application forms, people are afraid of filling them in.  They are afraid to look for grants because they do not understand the system.</p><p><i>4 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p>It is important that when people fill in the application form for the grant and put in whatever information they need, they be given a bit of scope in that.  The last thing we want is for people to be refused because they did not fill the application form in correctly.  It is important that the proper staff are working on this.  They should talk to people and let them know what the situation is.  People are panicking about getting the application in as quickly as possible and the timeframes.  It was mentioned earlier that it all seems to be on the householder.  It is important that the local authorities work closely with the person involved in the house.</p> <p> Another big problem is that a lot of people are going together to look for engineering reports.  It is very hard to get someone to put it down with paper and pen and people come looking for everything else.  It is important that it is all done right.  When people go into local authorities, the staff do not seem to know how much money they have to pay and they want to know how quickly they will get a response back on their applications.  It is the same in politics - communication.  Once people are communicated with and once they know what is happening, I do not see a serious problem.  Many families are worried that someone might just knock on the door, come in and inspect the house.  That is the last thing we want to do.  I am not trying to be smart but these people are looking at their houses and seeing cracks in the walls and holes in the ceiling.  People are house-proud and the last thing they want is someone coming to the house and knocking on the door with the family in the house and everything else.  Kids are inquisitive and the last thing you want is for them to realise what is going on.  I guarantee the Minister that a lot of people have not told their children exactly what is happening.  They might tell them there is a new house coming.  It is important that we try to get this done as soon as possible.</p> <p> On the issue of foundations, the foundation of a house is like someone's life or body to them.  The foundations have to go, end of story.  You cannot just go in and build a house on top of deleterious material; it makes no sense whatsoever.  It is very important that the foundations go.</p> <p> We are talking about money, and it is important that we have the money in place so that when people start, they can get finished.  The Minister is saying it is capped at &euro;420,000 or &euro;430,000 and it is important that money is available so that when people start doing the work, there will be a completion date coming up.  There is no point in starting in January and finishing in January two years later.  It is important that the money is there to finish the job.  I know contractors will not be too happy to do the work unless they know the money is there.</p> <p> We are having serious issues around the country with labour.  I was trying to get an extension done on my house recently and I was told it would take four or five months for a simple job.  Worst of all, when you go into a hardware shop to look for building material, it is nearly impossible to get it.  They do not want to carry the stock because it is too expensive to carry it.  There is an uncertainty about materials, labour and everything else and that is important going forward.</p> <p> I mentioned Louth earlier but I ask the Minister to let the Twenty-six Counties in.  The Louth county manager is active.  It might not seem like a lot to include ten or 15 people but when you have your own home you should be treated the exact same as everybody else, and that is important going forward.  I was in my home town of Dundalk during the week and I met a fellow who had to leave his home back in 2018.  He had been living in that home with his wife since 1991 and they had a lot of great memories there.  All of a sudden he saw cracks appearing from nowhere.  He did not know what it was and all of a sudden the ceiling, walls and everything else were affected.  In 2018, he had to physically take his wife and children out of the house.  There was a problem and it was too dangerous to stay in the house but that poor wife spent 12 weeks in a centre suffering from depression.  She had to leave the home that she spent the guts of 20 years building it up.  People want to stay in their own homes, especially among the older generation.  It is important going forward that we have a wee bit of sympathy for these people.  These are their homes</p> <p> I have dealt with the Minister on a number of different issues in recent weeks and he is approachable and he listens to people.  I ask people to have a bit of trust in the Minister.  This should not be made into a political football; it is serious.  I heard another Deputy mention today that this would not be the first redress scheme and that more and more would be coming down the road.  That is not fair.  I know the Minister fought very hard to get the money together.  The sooner we start, the better.  I ask him to get it right and communicate with the people.  These are family homes and if people want to downsize or upsize, they should have that option.  It is important that people get their old homes into their new homes and try to get memories back as soon as possible.  People just need to get their lives back together again.  As an Independent Deputy, I trust him and when he says things, he does so passionately.  I might get a bit of flak for supporting him but the reason I want to support him is that I know these people want to get their homes back and get their lives up and running.  We have to show trust in the Minister.  If he leads from the front, the people will get behind him.  I look forward to working with him.</p></speech>

I hope the Bill brings an end to their wait for much-needed support.  Last week our Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage held a special eight-hour session where we heard from industry experts, including the SCSI; the Institution of Engineers Ireland; departmental officials; the Housing Agency; and the chair of the expert working group.  Most importantly, we heard from the representatives of the families affected by defective blocks, many of whom are with us today.  We heard from the Mica Action Group in Donegal, the Clare Pyrite Action Group and the Mayo Pyrite Action Group.</p>  <p>  I have seen first-hand in homes in my constituency walls bloating and cracks that often appeared overnight but that become gaping constant reminders of how insecure someone's home is.  Imagine living in a home you do not feel safe in, a home where you know the creaks and the cracks are not just a house settling but a house starting to crumble.  Imagine going to bed every night knowing that the structure of your home is unstable.  That is the reality for many families whose homes were built by blocks that have turned out to be defective.  Imagine the anger you would feel knowing the quarries are not being held to account and from having to campaign for years to access funding to remedy things.  Families impacted by mica and pyrite have waited long enough.  They need this legislation passed and this funding provided and they need it yesterday.</p>  <p>  This Bill contains many welcome changes to the original scheme.  It is important to acknowledge that these changes were made in response to feedback from affected homeowners and that the changes were recommended by the expert working group, chaired by Paul Forde.  Those changes include the likes of retrospective inclusion; an appeals process; a legal footing for the certificate of remediation; and the Housing Agency taking on the cost of the testing.  This Bill has at its core an ambition to provide a fair and equitable solution to all homeowners affected by defective blocks and that includes homeowners in Clare and Limerick now too.</p>  <p>  I know the Minister has a wider ambition to make sure that this never happens again.  That is why it was so concerning to hear from a chartered engineer in the joint committee that a quarry in the south-east is still operating at fault.  This cannot be let continue.  Our committee has written to the building condition assessment office to escalate this accusation because if that is still going on then there is no excusing it.  I know the Minister is doing a lot of work on the regulation of providers of building works Bill and that work is crucial because if there is one thing we have learned from the nightmares that these families have been living through, it is that we cannot allow this to ever happen again.  The same is true of construction companies that have left thousands of apartment owners in similar positions, including some of my constituents in apartments in Lucan, many of whom were already in debt due to remediation costs.</p> <p>They need to be treated fairly too.</p> <p> In terms of the fair and equitable package for homeowners we are discussing, we need to face up to the reality of inflation.  The funding model for this scheme was based on a comprehensive body of work carried out by the Society of Chartered Surveyors of Ireland and I thank that society's volunteers who gave so much time and expertise to help these families.  However, there is no denying that Ireland is in a different space from where we were in February.  Inflation is a reality and those costs cannot be let spiral.  Given how much construction costs have increased since the funding model was drawn up, it is critical we ensure payments are adequate, fair and equitable, even now, because these families need to access the right amount of money to build safe homes, the homes they deserve and should have got in the first place.</p></speech>

I appreciate it.  I welcome this overdue legislation.  It has been a difficult time for a huge amount of families.  Unfortunately, pyrite and mica do not stop in Donegal, Clare or Mayo.  On Monday last, I visited a house in my constituency of Wexford where it was visible to me that there is either mica or pyrite.  I understand this scheme will be expanded beyond the counties I mentioned through local authorities.</p>  <p>  Families in Donegal, Clare and Mayo have gone through a horrid time in recent years.  I praise my colleague, former Minister and Teachta D&aacute;la for Donegal, Deputy McHugh, who has done a huge amount of work in the area in recent years.  In conversations with him, I found out exactly the extent of the problem in Donegal.  When I visited the house in my constituency on Monday, it brought back some of the conversations I had with Deputy McHugh.</p>  <p>  Deputies have raised a number of issues but we are talking about families, real people who have pride in their homes.  Their homes are their castles.  Those of us lucky enough to have our own home appreciate how much we love it, how much investment we put into it and the memories we have in it.  The lives of these families have been turned upside-down in recent years.</p>  <p>  I plead with the Minister of State and the Department to make this process as simple as possible for the families.  There has to be accountability, as we all appreciate, but on occasions Departments design schemes that make application so cumbersome for families and homeowners that they do not apply.  I ask that this be a simple process.  Outside of counties Donegal, Clare and Mayo, where there is a huge issue, I ask that in County Wexford the people affected by mica or pyrite can go to the local authority to be seen and their story listened to, so they can be part and parcel of this scheme.  They are afraid they are falling outside the scheme.  Wexford has been mentioned as one of the potentially affected counties.  I know of three cases in County Wexford where there is mica or pyrite.  I plead with the Minister of State and Department that in County Wexford no homeowner will be left outside this scheme but will be part of it and treated in the same way as people in Donegal, Mayo and Clare.</p></speech>

Regulation, building product surveillance: it is fair to say they were not up to scratch, far from it.  We have failed a number of people miserably.  We are talking at the minute about Donegal, Mayo, Clare, Sligo, Limerick, Tipperary and up to seven more counties.  I have heard a number of Teachta&iacute; talk about my constituency of Louth.  This is a small island and it is difficult to see how it will not be every county, on the basis that there are no customs posts, as a Deputy said earlier.  These building materials will have made their way into every county, village and town.  What does that mean?  It means we have left people with crumbling homes, through no fault of their own.  People need to think about that.  That is your home and it is suddenly falling apart.  We have all seen the pictures and videos.  Many here, including I think the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, have visited some of the homes and seen the devastation.  It is not going to get any better.  That is why we are discussing this.  The main reason is the pressure put on by the campaigners, some of whom are here today.  I commend the work they have done and the pressure they have put on.  What they need and want is a process that works and one they deserve.  It is a system.  They want a government that has their back.</p>  <p>  We all want justice.  We need to go after the quarries and block manufacturers but, first and foremost, we need to make sure we look after these people, particularly the campaigners.  I have no doubt that many of them, as committed as they are, are tired and just want to see an end to this process.  We need to facilitate them as much as possible.  They just want to get on with their lives.  We know the issues, including 100% redress and difficulties with the caps.  There will be problems with the rate of inflation and there are issues if people want to downsize.</p>  <p>  We need to make up for these gaps in this legislation.  There is talk of the difficulty around foundations.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin and many others across the House have agreed they would be willing to deal with the huge amount of amendments put in to fill these gaps and offer people a process that will deliver them the homes they need, whether that is like-for-like or otherwise.  We need to facilitate that so I expect the Government will be forthcoming and allow this.  People have stated they have no problem putting the hours in next week to make sure.  The people in the Gallery and around this country deserve it.  There is nothing else.  We have failed them miserably until now and have to have their back from here on in.</p></speech>

I am sorry for what they have had to go through.  I will simplify it for the Minister of State: I will talk about the foundations in this Bill.  If the Minister of State had a tree in his garden and there was a problem with the leaves, would he treat the leaves or the root of the problem?  In the same way, the Minister of State will stand up and walk out of here in a few minutes and, unless he has a good pair of shoes on, he will fall over.  The foundation he puts himself on is his pair of shoes.  The Government's approach to the foundations does not make any sense.  Under no circumstances should the foundations not be included in the Bill.  To test foundations, engineers will have to dig around the outside of the foundations and test to make sure they are the same density all around.  Then they will have to core-test them and do different tests on them.  The expense of doing all that would go a long way towards replacing the foundations.  If you have to do that on top of the engineer's fees, it makes it more expensive.  The real answer is to remove all foundations and put the new structure on top of new foundations.</p>  <p>  In the housing committee last week we had the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and the SEAI.</p> <p>They told us it takes three months or so to come up with figures in respect of the building of houses.  I am in the real world and I am a building contractor myself.  If it took me three months to come up with a price for a house, I would not be in business.  The first SEAI report I got related to the retrofit grant.  It came up with costings in October.  The next costings came up in February.  Anyone who knows quantity surveying will know that the quantities will not have changed.  All that needs to be done is for the figures to be updated with today's costs.  The computer system does it all by itself.  In my business, I may have to do that every week.  I use the same model the Government is using but it is saying that it takes three months to update the figures.</p> <p> I will give the Minister of State yesterday's figures.  The maximum the Government proposes to give to people is &euro;420,000.  Is it now going to tell the people of Ireland that it is not &euro;420,000 because it includes VAT at 13.5%?  It is actually giving people &euro;370,044.05.  You then subtract &euro;20,000 for storage and rent, if the recipients are lucky enough to be able to rent a house because we have a housing crisis.  That brings the figure down to &euro;350,044.05.  With today's costs, that equates to a house of 1,944 sq. ft.  However, you then have to consider today's building costs.  If it can be believed, today's building costs, including the 25% increase in the cost of insulation from Kingspan to come in on 1 July, which we can plan for, means that this &euro;350,000 will only build a house of 1,750 sq. ft.  </p> <p> We have forgotten one thing, however.  We have forgotten that we will have to replace the bathrooms, floors and kitchens throughout the house.  That is also included in the Government figures.  Not only that but, when you take down the house and do all of the retrofit, you have then destroyed the sewerage system, the pipework around the house, the footpaths, the driveways, the lawns and everything else that you have taken out.  If you take out a sum for remediation costs and the basic cost of replacing the bathrooms, kitchens and flooring throughout the house, it brings the &euro;420,000 the Government has given as the maximum figure down to &euro;300,000.  This brings me to my point.  At today's prices, the maximum sum the Government is allowing for only allows for a house of 1,500 sq. ft.  That is what is wrong.  I will return to the three months it took to update figures.  It takes my business a maximum of a week because we already have the template.  I do not accept the Government's figures.</p> <p> Let us now move to a house in Mayo.  We will use a smaller house for an example in Mayo and we will use the figures that were used earlier on.  A house of 90 sq. m, which equals 969 sq. ft, would cost &euro;197,966.70 to build.  If you add &euro;20,000 for storage and rent and a sum for the cost of finishing the house, that 90 sq. m house will cost &euro;237,966.70 to build.  I was able to come up with that using a calculator in the space of half an hour today but it takes the Government three months.</p> <p> We will now go into the issue of coring, which the Government is so against.  The Government representatives have stood up here to tell us about retrofit grants throughout the country.  If you put insulation into the cavity of a house that has pyrite but which has not shown any signs yet, you accelerate the process.  It sweats the cavity and creates a reaction, accelerating the process.  Within four or five years, the walls will be in trouble.  Houses are falling down all around us at the moment but, in this Bill, the Government is refusing to allow coring to be the main method by which people find out whether their houses contain pyrite.  It would help in the future and save the Government money if houses were core-tested first but it does not want to do that.  Why?  It is because it would provide a full census of every affected house in Ireland, including those in counties which have not yet been introduced to the scheme.  Several more counties are coming in and we will have more.  Core testing would give a full picture but the Government does not want to see that full picture.  It is common sense.  The Government wants to allow houses to be retrofitted now but it will all have to be pulled down and the houses rebuilt.  That is not common sense.  It is a waste of money.</p> <p> We must consider one more fact.  Most of the houses built in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s had slate roofs.  I am in building and, in any house I retrofit and renovate, the slates have to be tested, which comes at a cost.  In every house I have done so far, traces of asbestos have been found in the slates.  We then need a specialised unit to come out to remove the slates, bag them up and ship them to Germany and other countries, where they are dealt with.  That costs approximately &euro;10,000.  The Government has not factored that into its costings.  How do I know this?  I am building every day.  Other Independent Members, Sinn F&eacute;in, the Social Democrats and I have brought this issue to the Government through the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage but it is not listening.  Why is it so afraid that we are able to get things right while the Government, with all its expensive Departments, cannot?</p> <p> This is about real live people.  I ask the Minister of State to take a look into the Gallery above us.  I want him to look at the children, their parents, their brothers and sisters and their uncles and aunts.  They will remember the Government not listening to people who understand.  No matter what the Minister of State's expensive Department does, it cannot replace the expertise of those who are in the sector doing the work every day and bringing the facts to its door.</p></speech>

Cheap m&eacute; go raibh an Teachta Mattie McGrath ag labhairt ar dt&uacute;s.  I am disappointed to see that the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage left before the Rural Independent Group's slot was reached.  Perhaps he is reflecting on his bad behaviour last week.  I do not know but it is disappointing to see that he is not here.</p>  <p>  I have met many people from Donegal and Mayo outside the gates of Leinster House and have seen the looks of despair and anguish on their faces.  That is why I am here today.  I am a Deputy from the midlands but I believe that this is an important issue that needs to be resolved urgently because it is desperately unfair on those families.  These families have been through turmoil.  They need to see action.  Government needs to instil confidence that it is doing its best.  To date, that confidence certainly has not been instilled.  Why would the Government leave foundations out of the proposed redress scheme?  That is incredible but not surprising.  The Minister has his own ideas.</p>  <p>  I will read out parts of an email that were sent to me by a lady called Joy, an innocent homeowner.</p> <p>She writes:</p><blockquote>	How can you let the bill go through without including foundations ...?  Below our feet our homes are crumbling and unable to support the walls - what is it going to take to make the government realise that a tragedy will happen?  Sadly I have no doubt this will be a reality as families will be unable to avail of the scheme as it stands due to the shortfall between the grant and actual building costs.  Our homes are destined to crumble down around us until it takes us, I just hope and pray that children are not harmed, maimed for life or worse ... this is the stage we are getting to and many homes should be condemned.<br /><br />As our walls are weakening our ... floors are too heavy to be supported by the walls that are crumbling down around them ... where is the safest place in your opinion for me to sleep at night? ... I am sure you will agree it is a tough decision to take when going to bed at night.  Sleeping on the first floor - would I be safer as I will fall to the floor below when this eventually happens?  or maybe I would be safer on the ground floor of my home and take my chances that the ... slab will perhaps miss me as it falls down?  I am sure you will agree this is tough call as you put your children to bed [every] night haunted by the fact of what can happen in the night and [wondering] if they will be safe.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />We have done absolutely nothing wrong yet are living this nightmare daily.  We are stressed and extremely anxious to hear if we can rebuild our homes and if the science and research from world leaders in this field will be listened to.  How can this research and advice from these experts be ignored?<br /><br />Sadly the SCSI rates will not allow me to rebuild my home as the rates leave a massive shortfall (approx &euro;60,000 + foundations) but please, please put yourself in our shoes - how would you feel if you had built a home and the government did not regulate the block manufacturers and now we the innocent victims of this ... crisis are left to spend the rest of our days in fear of our safety or be in debt the rest of our lives.  How can this possibly be fair?  If you can find a builder to build at these rates please pass on my details as I have yet to find a builder who comes anywhere close [to] the SCSI rates.  </blockquote> <p>The issues around cost have been pointed out by Deputy O'Donoghue, who is an expert in this field as he is a building contractor.  Insulation from companies like Kingspan will increase by 25% by 1 July.  These costs were not factored into the current proposal.  Costs are escalating every day.  We need a bit of common sense and cop on here.  It should not take three months to revise the costs.  That is nonsense.</p></speech>

I welcome those in the Gallery, na daoine &oacute;ga agus na clanna go l&eacute;ir.  This is heart-rending.  These people came to the convention centre last year.  They came to the front of the D&aacute;il in the most dignified and profoundly professional manner.  Their homes are falling down around them.  There is talk of following the science.  We heard a lot about science during Covid and much of that science was wrong too.  Why will the Government not follow the science here?  It is trying to bring us nose first into this and dip our noses into the science.  This is an abject failure by the Minister and Department officials.  They refuse to listen to anyone else who knows better.  These people are dictating.  They are unchallenged and are getting away with it.  Anybody who has ever stood on a building site, and I must declare I am a plant contractor myself, knows the foundation is the most important part of any building, organisation or anything else.  Leaving the foundations out of the scheme is pure mockery.  There are a couple of layers of blocks that raise up the subfloors and walls and they are filled up with screed and concrete.  How could the Government leave out the foundations?  They will crack and crumble and crack every bit of the house.  That would happen even if there was no mica or pyrite, if there were bad foundations.  That has happened in many places where there poor foundations without enough steel or on bad ground.  Why will the officials in the Department not take off their shoes and go out and see the houses?</p>  <p>  This issue has been around for so long and the way this Bill is being rushed through in the final days before the summer recess is despicable.  The Select Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage has offered to deal with the amendments but the Government will not allow it to.  I salute Deputy O'Donoghue, who is on that committee and is willing to give his time, along with Deputy &Oacute; Broin and others, to deal with it.  It is being rushed through on shaky foundations.  The Government has been warned time and again that it is on shaky ground.  It has no empathy, sorrow, sympathy or respect for the ordinary people.  Thank God we do not get them here, but we see houses being wrecked by earthquakes and things like that, or even in the war that is going on now.  That is happening incrementally by the minute, hourly and daily in people's homes.  These people were brave enough to put their hands in their pockets.  They got up early in the mornings to go out to work to get a mortgage and build their own houses.  Many of them built them themselves and many got contractors.</p>  <p>  All the while the Government is turning its eyes away from the real problem, which is the big conglomerates that supplied the concrete.  To think this scheme might go ahead - it probably will go ahead - and the concrete, aggregate and blocks could come from the same sandpits or rock pits they came from already beggars belief.  That shows one thing.  It is nothing personal to the Minister or the Minister of State.  It shows this Government, and successive Governments, is and have been beholden to big business.  I have attended CRH's AGMs in fancy hotels here in Dublin to fight for people who were grievously wronged by that company in the past.  This has gone on all over the world, with challenges, court cases and settlements.  The Government is happy to use these quarries and those belonging to some more friends of Fianna F&aacute;il.  They are untouchable.  They shall not be named.  You cannot go near them because they are the Government's friends.  Those days are gone.  The people of Donegal, Mayo, Limerick and many other counties must be looked after.</p>  <p>  We have tabled a number of amendments, which I am sure we will not get time to move or discuss.  We want to extend the scheme to Tipperary as well.  The Bunratty quarry is only over the border from us in Tipperary.  I collected roof tiles from there myself when I was putting an extension on my house.  What is the Government at?  The mockery is over.  The shenanigans are over and should be over.  The Government needs to get real, get down and dirty and get the proper foundations.  If you only put a stone upon a stone there will be so much done but if you build a castle on bad foundations, you might as well have a sandcastle because when the first bit of rain comes, it will melt.  I have met families outside the gate here, taobh amuigh den gheata, who are afraid of yellow and orange weather warnings in case the house collapses around them.  Imagine living in that fear.  The walls are crumbling.  They showed me the aggregate in plastic bags.  That morning it was in solid knobs but it had burst by the time they came here.  A crusher would not crush it that well, yet the quarries are exempted.  The big businesses are gone again.  It goes back to PMPA and the insurance bailout, the meat conglomerates and the Goodman empire - bailed out again.  We are not allowed speak about it.  We have to close or eyes and not even look at the quarries.  We have to keep away from them in case we might have to pay back any of the bankrolling they did for the political parties.  People are more important.</p></speech>

What kind of a banana republic is this?  The people of 1916, 1921 and 1922 gave their lives and spilled their blood for this.  To have this kind of a charade going on here is outrageous.  This is nothing personal to the Minister of State but he is part of the Government.  He is the junior Minister.  The Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, ran away from the debate because he got good schooling from the masters in north Dublin, who did much havoc in this country.  I am talking about former Senators, Deputies and Ministers who ended up in disgrace.  This is going to end up in disgrace too.  I plead with the Minister of State to take this back and make it right.  Start from the foundations upwards.</p></speech>

My first involvement in pyrite was in getting Limerick included in the pyrite remediation scheme, which involves pyrite in the hardcore of the foundations.  Limerick City and County Council had to apply to the pyrite remediation board and we succeeded in getting it included.  I saw the devastation that caused for people in their homes.</p>  <p>  Subsequently, in June of least year it came to my notice that pyrite was in the blockwork of houses in Limerick.  I asked Limerick City and County Council to apply for this current mica scheme, as it is known.  In layman's terms, it is about pyrite and mica in the blockwork.  That is a misunderstanding for people.  Limerick City and County Council agreed to do that.  I wrote to the city manager at the time, and he agreed to write to the Department to get Limerick included.  I welcome that it has been included.  I have seen the homes.  In many cases, the gable ends are effectively falling away from the house itself.  It is devastating for these people.</p> <p>It has happened through no fault of their own.  Limerick City and County Council did great work in a short period to come up with the criteria to get Limerick included as part of this defective blocks scheme.  I have a couple of comments to make.  The criteria to qualify were really about showing the issue was from the blockwork upwards.  The blocks could be below or above ground.  However, it was not a requirement to look at pyrite in the foundations.  That has to be looked at.  I do not have experience in building; I am a layman.  If we rebuild houses based on a scheme that stated people just had to prove that there was pyrite in the defective blocks, both overground and underground, it does not to make sense to build on foundations that were not tested and may have pyrite.  We need to include the foundations in the scheme.</p> <p> We have to look at the downsizing aspect.  If people are willing to reduce the size of their homes, that is not unreasonable and they should be allowed to do that.  The threshold needs to be looked at.  We are in a phase of rising prices.  I would like those matters to be considered.</p> <p> There is a human dimension here.  There are both young families and older people with mortgages.  Through no fault of their own, their houses are effectively crumbling.  They are unsafe and need to be looked at.</p> <p> We have two schemes at Limerick at the moment.  The current scheme is for pyrite and defective blocks.  We also have a pyrite remediation scheme, which is administered by the pyrite remediation board and provides for 100% remediation for the hardcore.  It is allowed for blocks underground and overground and for hardcore, but it is not allowed for foundations.  For the scheme to be a true success, we must do due diligence and ensure we are not building houses on foundations with pyrite.</p> <p> Limerick is a bit behind compared with Donegal.  We do not fully know the number of houses that have been impacted, which worries me.  We know which quarries the materials came from.  The initial working group was established in Limerick in 2021.  Anything further would include the Limerick Pyrite Action Group.  Anne Ryan has done terrific work in the area.  Individual families come to me about it.  I am always reluctant to name people and, therefore, I will not but there are tremendous engineers and staff of the council who did phenomenal work in a short time.  Consequently, they were successful in getting the area to qualify.</p> <p> The appeal period is not sufficiently lengthy.  It should be increased to 90 days.  When the Minister is examining calculations of cost, Limerick should be factored in, because the calculated rates did not include it.</p> <p> I welcome the scheme, which has many good aspects.  If we are to have a robust scheme, we must look at the facts presented.  We must look at foundations.  We have the added benefit in Limerick of having the pyrite remediation scheme for the hardcore, which is an element of the foundations, for the layman.  We have the mica scheme and defective blocks scheme for pyrite in the blocks both overground and underground.  We need to make sure that when they build on top of the foundations, they are addressed.  The most important matter is the human dimension and helping families, as I found in Limerick.  We must get this right.</p></speech>

Their campaign for justice and their bravery in the face of an unsympathetic Government is to be commended.  The nub of the problem with the Bill is it does not provide 100% redress, which is not fair.  Families have done their homework and they do not appreciate being told it provides 100% redress when they know exactly what it will cost them and that the Government scheme will fall short.  It is unfair and disingenuous of Government to constantly seek to contradict people who are living this day and night.  They are well aware of the figures and have done their homework.  They have their figures correct.</p>  <p>  The costings underpinning the grant system, both in rates per square foot and overall cap, are out of date and not relevant to all the counties impacted.  These have to be updated before any scheme opens.  Further, the terms of reference for the costings are also too restrictive, excluding foundations, garages and boundary walls.  These must be included as they are part of the home.  Finally, the industry standard underpinning the scheme, IS 465, does not including other deleterious materials such as pyrrhotite, which has to change.  On this last point, regarding pyrrhotite, there are countless people across north County Dublin who can relate directly to the story of the families who are impacted by the mica scandal.  They sat and watched their own homes crumble before their eyes due to pyrite.  They had to campaign to secure a remediation scheme and to have that scheme be made fit for purpose.  Many still cannot sell their homes and move on with their lives.  They are stuck where they are.  The impact of this crisis on these families has been deep and will be long-lasting.</p>  <p>  Only yesterday, I heard from some families.  I hoped the Minister would be present to hear this and to join with me to collectively make an effort.  These families are living in north County Dublin where the pyrite issues were worst.  They depend on a transport system to get them into town.  The Fingal express has been withdrawn from them, which is another blow.  They are stuck where they are.  The bus service is vital.  I want it to restored and the Minister for Transport to do his work with other Deputies in my area.  When the people in my constituency look on the television and see the crumbling homes, they feel that sense of solidarity because they have had to live through it themselves.  Many of them now find themselves in a situation where they cannot sell their homes or move on with their lives.  Their families have grown and they are stuck.  The impact of not getting this right will be far-reaching and will last for decades</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-06-30a.250" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1547" speakername="Thomas Pringle" time="15:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022063000041#WW00300"><p>I reiterate my complete support for the statement from homeowners&rsquo; representatives read into the record today by Deputy &Oacute; Broin.  It is a sad indictment of us in this political system and of the Government that it has come to this.  Ordinary people who have invested so much in this process and in making the scheme work have had to put that statement on the record to show how the Government has ignored them.  That is sad.  That echoes in my mind as I speak here.  I think what we are doing today is a waste of time.  The deadline for amendments has passed.  The Minister of State is not listening to us.  He is sitting there uncomfortably.  I am sure there are many other things he would rather do.  This makes no difference because he will not take our issues on board or do anything. I am disgusted by what the Minister fervently presented to us today as the panacea to the problems faced by my constituents in Donegal and other affected counties to the problem of defective blocks in their homes.</p> <p>It clearly is not.  In his opening contribution, the Minister said:  "We cannot let the perfect be the enemy of the good and we need to get a practical scheme moving."  It would make you sick.  The reality of the situation is with this scheme the Minister is letting inadequate be the enemy of the good.</p> <p> I am disgusted at the way the Bill confirms that, despite what the Taoiseach has presented in the House, as "extensive consultations with homeowners", their concerns have not been addressed and not been listened to.  The Minister and his officials sat in meetings with people for the past six months, pretended to listen to them, and then ignored them.  It is obvious that all of us have been completely ignored.  There is no point in claiming that just hearing them is good enough, because in ignoring them, the Minister and Government are making a judgment on what they think of the people&rsquo;s concerns.  They are dismissing them, and today&rsquo;s Bill does that over and over again.  The words of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine earlier saying he recognises homeowners' work on this, ring increasingly hollow.  It is really sad and it is sickening.</p> <p> I call on Government-backing Deputies from the affected counties to finally be honest and straight with the people and admit they do not care that the party will come before the people, as they always intended.  This is what is really happening here.  There is also disgust at the process that has been followed to avoid proper legislative scrutiny and to minimise the opportunity for media scrutiny.  That is the only reasonable conclusion I can come to for all this rush after months of delay from the Government.  Let me be clear, however, that there is no surprise here.  From the very start, I have said it honestly to the homeowners in Donegal that I did not believe the Government politicians were being genuine with them when they stood on platforms and promised they would resign if the Bill did not provide 100% redress.  I told them that I did not believe the Minister or the Department had any intention of providing 100% redress, and, sadly, this has been shown today.  I had hoped that I would be wrong and that the process would show that we can be wrong but it does not happen in this political system.</p> <p> It is not just about the content of the Bill presented here; it is also about the fact that the Government is hell bent on ramming it through Committee and Remaining Stages in two hours next week.  It means this debate is a total farce.  It has no point in terms of the legislative principles of this House, as the deadline for the submission of amendments had passed prior to the start of the debate.  What will the Minister take away from the debate?  Absolutely nothing.</p> <p> I and others have worked tirelessly over the past week to draft amendments, with well in excess of 150 in total submitted for this morning's deadline.  They were drafted to address the concerns of the homeowners and deal with obvious flaws in the Bill as presented.  It was then confirmed to me earlier today by the Bills Office that no Government amendments were submitted at all.  We now know the Minister had already decided to change nothing to address the concerns of people and residents.  Such contempt for the parliamentary process is hard to take for those of us who sit in this Chamber but it is insignificant when compared to the clear message the Minister and the Minister of State are sending to those watching in the Public Gallery, my constituents in Donegal and people in other counties who are watching this in the hope that there can be a better outcome for them.  As I said earlier, Deputies are used to this and we expect it, but sadly it has now been shown for the people outside the House what it actually means.  At the moment they are left with the false hope of the Opposition amendments to cling to.  Again, I was very clear to those I spoke to that many of our amendments will be ruled out of order as being a cost on the State.  Amendments of the kind needed to fix this Bill can only be brought forward by a Member of the Government.  They are not going to do it, and the Minister of State knows this.  Once again, I believe he should drop the charade and be honest with people.  The likes of promises of a review by a senior counsel into the defective blocks saga will butter few parsnips with people in Donegal.  We are still waiting on the Mulcahy report to be published by the Government.  It was commissioned in 2015 and has been on the ministerial desk for the past five years.  The Minister of State, Deputy Burke, knows where I think he should stick his senior counsel review.  It will be just more of the same thing and will not mean anything at all.</p> <p> I will be brief regarding the Bill because I know I am wasting my breath.  It is rule by regulation and it is not good enough.  Could the Minister of State not see the return of the sliding scale through regulation?  What is to stop the Minister of State?  Is it his solemn promise?  I propose to mandate the inclusion of homeowners' representatives, their engineers and experts in geology and materials science, in the formulation of all regulations.  They should follow the science, not the whim of officials with an eye on the purse, and not aggregate the remediation and ancillary grants.  It is just unfair.</p> <p> The Bill does not deal with multiple occupancy dwellings.  Does the Minister of State not realise that these buildings are crumbling also and that families live in them too?  If a homeowner gets remediation for only one house that he or she owns, then tenants in their other homes will be forced to live in buildings that will crumble in the future.  I would seek to drop the limit of one rental property and revise the cut-off date for registration of tenancies.  An opportunity for tenancies to be legitimised with the RTB must be given.  This is not about landlords getting multiple grants; this is about the families who live in these properties and pay rent.  It is their principal private residence, whether they own it or not.</p> <p> I would also seek to extend the scheme State-wide now.  In reality, this is where it will end up.  There is no way the defective blocks saga is confined to counties Donegal, Mayo, Clare and Leitrim.  We are aware that Sligo is affected, as are numerous other counties.  The scheme must be nationwide.  Why is it not nationwide?  It must be some attempt by the Minister's officials to make it look as though they control costs by restricting the counties it will operate in.  A person living in an affected building that is over the county boundary will have to wait years and campaign to be included while their house is collapsing around them.  The scheme must include all buildings such as schools, nursing homes, hotels, shops, factory buildings and farm sheds, otherwise economic life and people&rsquo;s jobs will never get back to normal.</p> <p> The Bill should mandate the testing for all known iron sulphides, mandate the testing of foundations, and mandate the revision of IS 465 as the earliest cut-off date for inclusion, not January 2020.  The Minister should also set realistic cut-off dates.  Not many people in Inishowen are going to be able to get a builder within a year and a half when many householders are looking for builders at the same time to be included in the scheme.</p> <p> The grant cut for downsizing must also be dropped.  It is mean-minded and mean-spirited, as was said earlier.  The base rate should be index linked from the date of the Government's big announcement back in November if the Government is genuine about this scheme meeting the homeowners' actual costs.  We also call to drop the refund of third-party compensation.  That is just a sickening inclusion.  I would also seek the dropping of the assignment and subrogation of claims, which is another sickening inclusion, obviously written by departmental mandarins who just want to save money.  The threat of fees for appeals, and the offences and penalties, must also be dropped.  I ask the Government to not infantilise and criminalise the homeowners.</p> <p> Only last week we heard the Taoiseach pontificate and attempt to talk down to Opposition Members saying, stating: "Since I was elected to this House, [I have] seen it primarily as a legislative assembly."  I will never understand how he manages to get such statements out of his mouth even as we partake in this farce today.  It takes some neck but I suppose a hard neck is what one gets having been in here for years.</p> <p> I have a couple of questions for the Minister of State to address in his closing remarks - not that he will address them but I will ask them anyway.  Does he intend to consider any of the Opposition amendments, seeing as the Government failed to table any?  Is the Minister of State planning to vote them all down?  Will he sit down with Opposition spokespersons and homeowners on Monday, for one last time, to go through the amendments and decide what the Government will accept?  Will he give either of those commitments, for whatever that is worth?  I do not think so.  I have little faith left in the Government and less this week than last, and it was a low bar at that stage.  This is a mean-spirited thing being done here today with this legislation.  It is being dressed up as a &euro;2.3 billion scheme.  It will actually probably end up being a &euro;6 billion scheme because the scheme will have to come back for a third attempt at legislation to sort this out.  It will cost a hell of a lot more at that stage because the Government has arsed about and made sure that people are not listened to.  This is a sad reflection of the whole thing.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-06-30a.252" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1518" speakername="Michael McNamara" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022063000042#XX00200"><p>I welcome that the Bill is finally being brought before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  It is clearly a step in the right direction.  Very few of us can imagine what it must be like for those who have been in the situation that affects homeowners in Clare, Mayo, Donegal and other parts of the State.  These people are struggling to pay mortgages.  Everyone is struggling to pay their mortgage and it is going to get worse next winter.  Imagine having that home crumble around you and wonder whether you have any comeback.  Where and how does such a homeowner come back?  A person would need the wherewithal, the financial reserves and mental reserves to take on one of the biggest companies in the country, a company with huge tentacles around the world, including into the political elite of Ireland.  For the affected homeowners, feeling that they are very much left on their own must be truly horrendous from a mental health perspective.  I am glad that the scheme is finally being published and I welcome that.  However, facets of the scheme and the Bill concern me.</p><p><i>5 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p>It particularly concerns me that now that we finally have a Bill, we will ram it through.  That is what we are going to do next Thursday.  There is discussion of it today which, to be fair to the Minister, is quite long so we can discuss the generalities at length today.  When it comes down to the specifics, however, we will ram it through next Thursday.  That creates a suspicion in my mind.  Why allow so much time for the generalities but such little time to go through the specifics?  Is it because it does not add up or because there are inconsistencies?  Is it because we do not want to focus on those issues?  We are stuck for time at the end of the D&aacute;il session and we always are because we have statements on this, that and the other and statements on general irrelevance, with the benefit of hindsight, during the year and then we ram all the legislation through in a fortnight.  Here we are again.  Poor old Michael D. Higgins will be up at night, burning the midnight oil and his candle, trying to read the legislation and get through it in time to meet the constitutional requirement of signing it in time.  He did complain about it before.  However, like anyone's concerns about what this Government does, it fell on deaf ears.</p> <p> I raised an issue at the committee last week.  I disagree respectfully with the previous speaker, with whom I am in a technical group.  It is important to save money.  It is very important that people are bailed out and that they are put in a position they would be in, had their home not been defective and had they not been sold defective blocks.  That is hugely important and should be the first priority, which I completely accept.  I do not think this scheme will do that, unfortunately.  However, the second priority must be to do so in a manner that is as cheap as possible for the general taxpayers, given the multiple and competing demands.  Last night we had a great deal of discussion on what those demands are and will be into the future.  It is not as important as putting people back in the position they would be in had they not been sold defective concrete blocks but the next priority for me has to be saving money.  I have many concerns in that regard about this scheme.</p> <p> Downsizing is not allowed.  If the money people get from the State does not meet the cost of rebuilding their house and if instead of building, say, a 250 sq. m house, they build a 150 sq. m house because that is all the money they are being given, they will be penalised for doing that.  I do not understand that.  I understand the priority of saving money but not that.  People may not have the money or may be of an age where they cannot remortgage if they are in their 60s.  I know of people in County Clare who are retired, who had paid off their mortgage over their lives, in service to the State, and who were looking forward to their retirement.  Now they find that their home is crumbling around them and they will not get the full cost of it.  They are not in a position to raise a mortgage but now the Government is telling them they cannot downsize.  I ask the Minister to consider that.  The relevant provision is to be found in section 17(5) of the Bill, on page 23, lines 6 to 14.  </p> <p> Then there is the issue of subrogation.  That means that once the Minister pays out money, say, for example, &euro;150,000, the Minister has a call on anyone's claim.  I have no problem with that as an idea but I believe the way it is drafted will ensure that the only people who will pay for any of this is the Exchequer and that those who manufactured defective concrete blocks for large amounts of profit, big companies making large amounts of money, will be let off the hook by this and the poor Irish Exchequer with all the competing demands on it will be put wholly on the line because of the subrogation clause.  If someone's claim is for &euro;250,000 and the first &euro;150,000 will go to the Minister then why would anyone sue?  The first thing that anyone in a civil case will do is make an offer if there is any sort of reasonable case.  If someone was looking for &euro;250,000 he or she will be offered &euro;150,000 and would be well advised to take that because no matter how good a case is, there are always weaknesses.  There is absolutely no incentive after the scheme is in place for the homeowners to initiate cases.</p> <p> As for the Minister, if the Minister has a right of action which accrues to him on the payment of the money, he may exercise it.  It is a general aspiration.  I would like to beef that up in a way that does not cost the State money.  In an amendment I have drafted, I do not say that the Minister shall pursue every cause of action but that the Minister shall give a report in respect of every payment made on how many cases he took after two years and every year thereafter for ten years.  It would keep it in focus.  That report would be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas because they are ultimately responsible for public expenditure and we are talking about more than &euro;2 billion, which is generally accepted as being &euro;3 billion and with inflation going as it is, it will be an awful lot more.  I am not happy to sign a blank cheque on this without knowing that the Minister will at least seek to recover some money from those who manufactured defective concrete blocks for profit and made a huge amount of profit with directors' bonuses and the whole shebang and not have the Exchequer being the only entity paying for the huge damage that they caused.  Moreover, we will not fully pay for that damage, as has been much elucidated in this Chamber.  I would like if we were paying more and if it was 100% of the cost to the poor householders who are the victims here but we are not.  To the extent that we are paying anything, I would like to know that the expenditure for that will not have to compete with the expenditure for childcare, for the hospital in Limerick, education, health, social welfare and for all the competing demands on the Exchequer while the big companies, the CRHs of this world, the listed companies, walk away scot-free and can smile to themselves while thinking, "Jesus, that was some get-out-of-jail-free card that the D&aacute;il signed" because the Government rammed it through just because the lads were thinking about their holidays and did not really look at it.  Because that is what is going to happen, I have no doubt about that.  I ask that the Minster at least examine the amendments.  Even if he is going to ram the Bill through, will he do me and the constituents that every Deputy here represents, namely, Deputies Alan Farrell, McHugh, Pringle, Mac Lochlainn, &Oacute; Broin and Doherty, as well as my independent colleague from the mid-west, Deputy O'Donoghue, the courtesy of at least looking at our amendments?  It is not that much to expect.  </p> <p> I also propose that the Minister will notify someone if he is going to take a case based on the person's cause of action that has vested in the Minister.  The reason is that such people might take a piggy-back case on the back of it.  If they will only get 80% of the cost of it and that will go to the Minister, they might at least be in a position to take a case at the same time to reduce costs and increase their chances of success and of being able to persuade somebody to take a case.  They could take a case for the other 20%, if the Minister is going to do so.  The Minister would notify the Oireachtas of how many cases he is taking - at the moment it will be shrouded in secrecy - and give reasons for the case.  There may be cases where the Chief State Solicitor advises that we will not have a high likelihood of success and so be it, but at least we should make sure that every case is looked at and that we try to get back as much money from these companies as possible, rather than just throwing our hands up and exposing the Exchequer to a huge amount of money one more time, something we in this House do once a decade, and then shuffling around wondering how did that happen.  It happens because people rush legislation through without sufficient analysis.  </p> <p> I have also put down an amendment specifying when a cause of action accrues or when the time runs from.  I propose that in cases which have not yet been taken, that there is a cause of action once there is a report that says someone has defective concrete blocks.  It is for a report as defined in the Bill or a report from a competent engineer.  Lots of people have cracking in their houses and their houses have been cracking for five or six years.  They did not know why.  Are they to be penalised because they did not immediately think of something that nobody knew anything about and because they did not think it was pyrite and now the time is gone to take a case?  Ought they to have known then it was pyrite?  How many people knew about pyrite six years ago if there was cracking in their house?  How were they supposed to take a case then?  Are they to be met with a defence that they ought to have known their house had pyrite and that had they met a leading world expert from Switzerland down at the local, the expert would have said they had pyrite, because we in the defence had access to that level of expertise?  By "we" I mean the CRHs of this world.  My amendment proposes that the cause of action accrues from when a homeowner has a report confirming that it is pyrite.  That is not unreasonable.  There is a logic to it and that is what the Minister is looking for in order to bail people out.  He is looking for a report, a "building condition assessment report" as defined in the Bill or an engineer's report.  That is where a person's cause of action runs from.  </p> <p>Every case is limited in time and the homeowner must act quickly.  That time is frozen.  The precedent for that is the Civil Liability Act.  The time is frozen from when the right vests in the Minister until he notifies the homeowner as to whether he will take a case.  It enables people to take cases.  It gives individuals and the Exchequer a reasonable chance of recovering some of the astronomical costs so that those who caused this problem will not walk away scot-free, smirking in their rear-view mirror as the Exchequer picks up the bill one more time.</p></speech>

T&aacute;im d&oacute;chasach go bhfuilimid ag bogadh ar aghaidh chun an saol a chur le ch&eacute;ile ar&iacute;s.</p><p>In the first instance I acknowledge that the sliding scale is not mentioned in the scheme.  It came in before last Christmas.  It was a massive mistake and caused considerable consternation.  I acknowledge the work of the Minister in listening to the campaign groups and listening to the homeowners in ensuring it is not part of this scheme.</p><p>People and families are stuck.  They are in the wrong sequence of their lives and have been for the last decade.  Over the weekend, one homeowner told me she had buried her head in the sand and would continue to do that until she sees light.  The difficulty we have with this issue is that people have put their lives on hold.  Some people have never been on a family holiday.  They have put their home and family first, and put luxuries, like a first family holiday, on hold.  They were looking forward to that but now that is also on hold.  They have been stuck for too long.  It is time to get the scheme started - properly this time.  I have personally seen the damage done by the previous scheme.  Regulations drafted at the eleventh hour made the scheme unaffordable, inaccessible and unworkable.  I am not playing the blame game.  I will not blame individuals nor do I blame one individual Department.  However, I know people were trying to fight against the 90:10 scheme throughout because it was unfair and simply wrong.</p><p>Regulations for the new scheme will be worked on in the coming months.  I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Broin that it could take months.  There is an onus on all of us to try to expedite that and that includes the month of August.  It is important to get those regulations right and we need to fast-track them as efficiently as possible.</p><p>I ask the Minister and his officials to examine the following areas in more detail between now and the enactment of the scheme.  I welcome the &euro;25,000 for emergency works, storage and rental, factored into the cap.  While I acknowledge the Minister's role in fighting for an increased cap from a proposed &euro;350,000 to &euro;420,000, because of inflationary pressures and because of the increased cost of the second stage especially for engineering fees, we need to consider removing the &euro;25,000 from the cap which would give some breathing space with the overall cap.  I believe that can be addressed under the regulations.</p><p>When setting the rates, I ask the Minister to consider the issue of downsizing.  I know this has been raised by many Opposition and Government Members.  I believe the Minister can provide this in the regulations under section 12.  These are the regulations which will set out the grant rate.  I want the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, and the officials present today to give strong consideration to the downsizing argument.  Downsizing should be seen as a good thing as it clearly is from an environmental point of view.  We should be facilitating downsizing if not encouraging it.  Some people will downsize due to circumstances and some will downsize due to choice.  Some people will want to build a replica of their existing home as everybody is entitled to.</p><p>I wish to raise an issue that may have been missed in these deliberations.  If I am building the same house with the same specifications, I will try to salvage my kitchen and staircase, as many people are doing.  I know there is still a cost with that involving getting professionals to do it as well as the cost of storage.  However, if I downsize and downscale, I will have a different measurement specification and therefore the kitchen and staircase in my existing home will become redundant.  In effect the families downsizing are being penalised.  I ask the Minister of State to go back to his officials.  I believe there is an understanding within officialdom that this may be possible.  I ask for consideration to be given in this regard.</p><p>My colleague, Deputy Calleary, raised the issue of <i>force majeure</i>and exceptional circumstances.  I am concerned that the appeal board does not have sufficient powers to take into consideration exceptional circumstances.  I again raise an issue on behalf of a family in my county.  This family has eight children with different health challenges and need to stay in their own home during the construction of their replacement home.  I know the regulations and legislation will specify that people need to build their new house on the original footprint.  In an exceptional case like this, life is not black and white.  It is certainly not black and white for this family where the health challenges range from incurable blood diseases to incurable bone diseases.  They do not have an alternative house to meet their needs other than in their own home at the moment.</p><p>The appeal board needs to have more flexibility.  I believe it does not have enough powers.  I have read section 39, which is very legalistic, as I know it must be.  However, I do not believe it has the same flexibility as existed in the appeals system for the pyrite scheme.  As I said earlier, life is not black and white.  There is one line which refers to an &quot;error of law or fact&quot;.  Obviously, this section was drafted with a very legalistic framework.  All Deputies in this House will share this experience.  Every person who has contacted us over the last number of years has completely different circumstances from the other people.  It is the most complex issue I have ever worked on in my 23 years in politics.  There are so many different issues and circumstances that need to be looked at with clear vision.  For example, individuals who bought houses after 1 January 2020 did not know the house they bought had mica.  They will be able to provide proof that they did not know it had mica.</p> <p>Will the appeals mechanism be good enough for their voices to be heard?</p> <p>In section 19 there is a time limit for grant payment.  The rules are very much for the homeowner and the onus is on the homeowner with respect to the rules imposed by the legislation.  I think Deputy Calleary raised the question of needing rules on the State side, and one of the rules we need is around prompt payment.  The existing scheme, the 90:10 scheme, is being utilised by a number of families and the feedback I am getting is that people are waiting sometimes for eight to 12 weeks for payments of invoices.  That is totally unacceptable and it makes the scheme unsustainable.  In addition, it acts as a significant disincentive to building contractors who cannot reasonably be expected to wait for long periods during remediation for payment.</p> <p> In their submission to the working group last year, homeowners asked that payments be expedited in line with what normally happens with mortgage companies during a building process.  Typically, payment must be made within a matter of weeks following sign-off by engineers at each stage.  I am aware that within the public service the deadline for payment right across the board is 15 days, so it is important we clarify in this legislation whether that 15-day requirement will be met.</p> <p> I honestly believe we must go a step further.  Why should we keep it at 15 days?  If I demolish my house and it costs &euro;18,000, the house would be demolished and the material would be segregated and recycled.  The contractor would finish the work and provide the invoice, so why do we even have to wait 15 days?  It should be done within a period of five days.  Is there anything in the regulations to ensure that happens?</p> <p> It is important to point out that while I am hearing some good stories from some individual banks that they will allow people to take out a short-term loan at zero interest, these are very isolated cases.  The memo to Government indicated there would be engagement with the banks and we must define what such engagement would be.  What are the banks doing to step up to the plate?</p> <p> What provision have we in place in the case of vulture funds that own houses now because of default?  There is one example in my county and the family had no choice but to default because the house was crumbling.  They moved into a rental property and the limited income they had went towards rent.  The vulture fund now owns the property, which has no value because it has mica in the building.  What are we doing to try to facilitate the families who through no fault of their own had to leave their homes while trying to negotiate with banks?  The line in the memo to the Government specified engagement with banks but will that incorporate vulture funds as well?</p> <p> On a personal level, I acknowledge the campaigners.  Their commitment and endurance on a voluntary basis is not lost on people.  They have put in time and, in conjunction with that, they have all gone through their own anguish about their own homes and houses.  They still find the courage and determination to advocate for others, so they provide a dual role.  They are still trying to get on with family life, deal with personal crises caused by mica in their homes, all while advocating for others.  If there was ever a definition for altruism, that is it.  How they find the time and courage to do that, I do not know, but I acknowledge it.</p> <p> Paddy is outside the gates and I have met Eamon at the under-13 GAA matches.  I have met Lisa at athletics on numerous occasions and tried to speak to Michael during his lunch break at his day job.  I acknowledge all of them.  Eileen and Ann have been at the end of the phone, night and day, for the best part of a decade.  They have helped me to better understand the stress and distress caused by mica.  It is not alone about the physical invasiveness in their homes but the direct impact that this matter has on health, particularly mental health.</p> <p> I will continue to use my time to continue engaging with officials, which I was doing earlier today, and Government and party colleagues to make changes to this scheme.  This scheme will evolve and maybe all of us will be gone from here in 20 years, although some of us may still be here.  This scheme, however, will evolve and change.  We must get it started and put our best foot forward in getting it right at this early stage of the legislation.  I ask, once again, for the Minister to work on this through his offices.  He sits around a table at the ministerial management meeting with officials on a weekly basis and I would like this matter to be kept to the fore.</p> <p> We must use those regulatory mechanisms in whatever way possible to bring a bit of common sense to this and highlight once again the very important need to look at downsizing.  Downsizing is not a bad thing.  People who downsize will not be advantaged.  People who downsize will not get more than they would have gotten.  People who downsize may be disadvantaged because they will not be able to salvage as much as the people who go for the replica house.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-06-30a.257" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1562" speakername="Alan Farrell" time="16:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022063000045#AAA00200"><p>Perhaps uniquely in this House, I know what it is like to have a defective home, having gone through the pyrite crisis a number of years ago.  I know the worry and heartache that can cause.  It is a real lived experience that I know the people in the Gallery will associate with, along with thousands of people all over the country.  I do not believe this problem is unique to the three counties we are discussing on an ongoing basis, namely, Donegal, Mayo and Clare.</p>  <p>  In 2006 I got a phone call from a then neighbour, informing me that a television crew was outside her home, on my street, looking for an interview about a front-page story from that morning, and my heart sank.  That morning, a newspaper article detailed the beginnings of what became known as pyritic heave or the pyrite crisis.  My estate at the time had commenced sales in 2003 and in 2005, when I moved, the 350 homes were occupied.  Virtually all were in some way affected.  A further 700 homes in a nearby community were also affected, having been built by the same firm and having material supplied by the same quarry.</p>  <p>  As the details of the extent of the crisis emerged, my heart sank further.  The building boom and lack of regulation had struck again.  Extracting defective hardcore materials from the ground and not allowing sufficient time to pass before putting it into construction projects meant that oxidisation did not have time to occur.  Instead it occurred while in the floor slab of my home and that of thousands of others.  Petrographic analysis was not and is still not part of the process when grading hardcore materials.  Instead, the reaction happened under my floor, causing cracking in the rising walls and those of my neighbours.</p>  <p>  My home and hundreds of others were remediated privately, following the settlement of a High Court case between Menolly Homes and Lagan Asphalt, to which I and others were extremely interested parties.  The methodology for that remediation became the template for the Pyrite Resolution Board, which benefitted thousands of families on the east coast following a decision of the Government of 2011 to 2016.</p>  <p>  Perhaps uniquely in this House, I know what it is like to live in a home that through no fault of one's own has potentially major structural issues.  I could speak at great length about some of the stories from my constituents and people in Meath, Louth and beyond regarding gas pipes being at risk, among other things.</p>  <p>  This Bill is a very important step in addressing a matter that is of utmost importance to me.  Your home is your castle and having spoken to families in Donegal and Mayo in recent months, I wholeheartedly support their campaign to get homes repaired as quickly and as equitably as possible.</p> <p>The Government has engaged in good faith to improve the provisions of this Bill and to expand the scope of the support for affected homeowners.  As a result, we now have a much improved scheme to that launched by the former Minister, Eoghan Murphy, that moves us much closer to delivering on the important measures that will allow affected homeowners to begin to move on with their lives.   There has been significant engagement with local authorities in the affected areas, with housing agencies, the NSAI and others. These consultations were undertaken in order to maximise the impact of this scheme; all of which was done with the view of helping those who have found themselves in this situation, through no fault of their own.</p> <p> I repeat some of the comments made by Deputies O'Donnell and McHugh on the issue of foundations.  This does not just relate to floor slabs, because this material can also get under foundations.  There have been extensive investigations, including on a particular motorway in this country under which the foundations for the crossing bridges were supplied by the same quarry that supplied materials for my home.  This happened a good number of years previously.  Such was the extent of the lack of knowledge in the building control sections of this State that those investigations had to take place.  It is odd that if we are going to clear a site, we are not going to test the foundations.  The State will be putting hundreds of thousands of euros into each family home, and there is a potential risk that we will have to revisit the matter.  That does not make sense to me, as somebody who had a home with pyrite in the floor slab - not the foundation, which is a different thing - because this can cause swelling, cracking, issues with gas pipes and so on.  These are unintended consequences.  We know of this, so let us try to resolve the matter before the legislation is passed.</p> <p> I commend the members of the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  They put dozens, if not hundreds, of hours into this process.  A number of them have spoken already today.  The committee does some very important work.  I know that this is not a particularly easy issue to deal with.  I welcome a number of key improvements to the new scheme, namely, the development of an independent appeals mechanism for homeowners, which an important change to allow the maximum opportunity for homeowners to engage with the process.</p> <p> There is a need, as has been stated by quite a number of Deputies, to pursue the perpetrators whose actions gave rise to this situation.  I ask the Minister to outline what steps or mechanisms the State is taking or putting in place to recoup the significant outlay of public moneys this scheme will undoubtedly involve.  Major construction companies that participated in creating this crisis should not escape consequences, and the taxpayer should not bear the ultimate cost.  A plethora of companies, consultants and engineers should be on the hook for this scheme.  I require the assurance that we will not, as many previous speakers indicated, simply let this slide.</p> <p> The scheme is not perfect but, equally, I have not come across one that is. The pyrite scheme was far from perfect, but it has been successful in putting lives back on track.  The scheme we are discussing will most likely be no different.  I ask that the Minister consider some of the amendments that will be tabled on Committee Stage - I know he is expecting them - in order to potentially improve upon the significant work already undertaken by his Department and the housing committee.</p> <p>I will conclude by discussing the apprehension, pain and upset that has been visited upon families.  As I said earlier, I have experienced this.  My circumstances were different in 2006 when this occurred, in 2011, when my home was remediated, and in 2013, when the Government scheme got up and running and was used to remediate thousands of homes in Leinster.  Ten years is a long time, and the Statute of Limitations, unfortunately, has most likely kicked in for most people.  The legal minds in this House will undoubtedly dwell upon that.</p> <p> We talked about amending the Statute of Limitations in the past in respect of other legislation.  The fact of the matter is, however - and this has been touched upon by a couple of other Deputies - that it is important for us to recognise that our role is to legislate and to bring about schemes such as this.  Our role is also to ensure value for money.  Notwithstanding the very important work that has to be done to remediate these homes, because these families had absolutely nothing to do with the lack of quality in the building blocks and other materials used to build their homes, we also have a responsibility to the taxpayer.  It is for that reason that I have asked for clarity on what exactly the State is proposing to do.  Is it going to assist individuals in the pursuit of these companies or will it pursue them?  That is something we should all aspire to, particularly as our building regulation has been lacking over many decades.  Even after pyrite, there were deficiencies in the changed building regulations.</p> <p> Petrographic analysis, as I said, is still not done on hardcore material.  Grading, pressure testing and things like that are done, but petrographic analysis is not.  The argument is that it is too expensive, but there are many quarries in this country, particularly in Leinster, and it is well known that these are situated in strata of material that can cause problems if it is quarried and not left sitting for a number of months.  The biggest issue, and the reason pyrite occurred in floor slabs, related to the fact that because we were in the middle of a building boom, this material was being extracted, broken up, graded, put in trucks and delivered to sites without the passage of any time.  Our system is flawed to this day and we need to fix it.</p></speech>

He said: "... the Vatican's reaction was to parse and analyse it with the gimlet eye of a canon lawyer."  That was a famous speech.  The problem has been that the approach of too many people who worked for Government and who were elected to be in government over the years who were dealing with the victims of this disaster, which has worked its way down the west coast of Ireland, has been exactly the same.  It has been cold and callous, has always been about limiting the exposure of the State and penny-pinching but has ended up costing us a fortune because of the mistakes those involved have made again and again.</p>  <p>  That was a powerful contribution, incidentally, by Deputy Alan Farrell just now.  We are looking for all of the victims of State regulation to be treated exactly the same across this State, whether it is the people who live in apartments with defects in Dublin, the victims of the pyrite disaster in Dublin and north Leinster, the people on the west coast or those in the counties we heard about, such as Wexford, for example, where problems are emerging.  We want them all to receive 100% support, and not the gimlet eye again and again.  They want redress and to rebuild their homes.  That is all they are asking for.  They were utterly failed by the State, its building controls, the regulations, the lack of oversight, the Celtic tiger, the greed and the closeness of those who were greedy to people who have sat in this Chamber over the years.  We owe it to any homeowners and families who are the victims of this disaster and injustice to get them 100% redress.  That is the starting point in all of these matters.  If one starts from that point, one gets to justice.  If one does not, one gets injustice again and again.</p>  <p>  IS 465 is the basis for the spending billions of euros of taxpayers' money.  IS 465 does not instruct us to test for pyrrhotite or to test the foundations of people's homes.  How can that be?  When the evidence the committee produced last Thursday is looked at, there is no answer to that question.  How can that be the case?  In Donegal alone, 77 properties were tested and 66 had pyrrhotite.  Some 61 of those had appreciable amounts of pyrrhotite.  Pyrrhotite is, in fact, the chief offender here.  More tests have been done by Petrolab in Britain.</p> <p>Pyrrhotite is the chief offender, yet we are not testing or basing the expenditure of billions of euro of taxpayers' money on that.   It is not a deciding factor.  We are not testing the foundations to make sure they are safe.  We are cruelly insisting that people rebuild their homes on foundations that have not been tested.  The Government talks about the use of taxpayers' money.  It is reckless behaviour again and again because it is always about the gimlet eye.  It is always about not starting from the position of 100% redress or from a position of justice to remedy what is a profound injustice and disaster for so many people.</p> <p>  The IS 465 standard is being reviewed.  It is clear from the science that is emerging that there needs to be a complete transformation in a renewed standard.  That has to happen in tandem with this legislation and this new scheme.  How can the Government ask people to trust a system that has been shown by science, by laboratories and by internationally respected experts to be nonsense?  The Government is going to risk billions of euro of taxpayers' money on a discredited standard that was not based on any discernible level of testing at the time.  That was a mistake.</p> <p> The people who are working on that standard need to bring in new ideas and international best practice.  They need to talk to PetraLab, Dr. Andreas Leemann and other international experts in these fields in the United States and Britain.  They need to have the humility to know that the standard we are working with right now is not up to specification.  It is not worth risking billions of euro of people's money on.</p> <p> We cruelly ask people to keep their foundations.  There is a big suspicion that I share, which is about - I will say it again - the gimlet eye.  If a person replaces the foundations and goes for a full rebuild, it must be rebuilt to modern building standards.  God forbid the Government would allow people, when we talk about retrofitting and climate change, to put in triple glazing and modern energy-efficient systems when they rebuild their homes.  Is it too much to ask that we would allow them to do that?  Not even that can be allowed to happen.  We want people to use the same windows and doors they already had and build homes on old foundations that have not been tested.  This is the recklessness and mean-spiritedness that keeps breaking people&rsquo;s hearts and it has to stop.</p> <p> I will speak about penalty-free downsizing.  How on earth can the Government stop somebody who is willing to downsize their home from doing so?  It has said it will not give people 100% redress or make sure the costings are immediately updated when the scheme is launched.  It has said it cannot give that commitment just now, although that should have been done already.  Not only will the Government not do that but it will also not allow people to downsize their houses penalty-free - the cruelty of it.  People have been traumatised by years of this mental anguish and turmoil.  Lives have been destroyed.  The Government wants them to build on foundations that have not been tested.  It wants them to use windows and doors that are old.  It will give them a financial penalty if they choose to downsize.  For God's sake, get this right this time.  Do not make the mistakes - the gimlet eye - that led to the so-called 90:10 scheme, a cruel scheme that has now been discredited by all.  We have to get it right this time.</p> <p> The final issue I will focus on is the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland costing.  The Government came in again.  I use the word &ldquo;again&rdquo; because I am speaking to the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, about the words of his former party leader and former Taoiseach.  The gimlet eye comes into the way the Government approaches the costings with a sliding scale.  Where the hell did the sliding scale come from?  They were looking for a big day but - imagine the cruelty when people had their hopes raised - all of a sudden the sliding scale was slipped in.  Then, under huge pressure from homeowners across the country, the Government went back and looked at the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland and said it would not give a commitment just yet.  Maybe it will give a commitment next week that when this scheme is up and running, it will be based on real costs in the real world whereby the amount per square foot or per square metre is actually what people would have to pay in the real world.  Will the Minister of State at least give that commitment when the scheme is up and running?  That is the appeal.</p> <p> This is my final contribution.  A chartered engineer gave testimony before a committee last week that there are quarries still producing defective products and ruining people's lives.  How are we in such a situation, after all these years?  It is still being allowed to happen.  It is still going on in this country.  People are still manufacturing blocks that are destroying people's lives.  There is still not legislation to bring this to an end.  Not one quarry has been closed in this country despite people&rsquo;s lives being destroyed.  The answer was that not one quarry was closed down.</p> <p> I will wrap up with this.  I started with the speech by the former Taoiseach, Enda Kenny, that captured people's imagination about closing an ugly chapter in our history.  Please stop using the gimlet eye.  Stop the cold-heartedness.  Start from the position of natural justice, which means full redress for every family, no matter where they live in this country, who have been failed by the past.  Allow them to rebuild their lives.  Get it right this time.  Base it on science, fairness and justice.  If the Government does that, the people can go home and will not have to keep protesting or sitting in the Public Gallery anymore.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-06-30a.262" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1462" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="16:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022063000047#CC00200"><p>My colleague, Deputy Mac Lochlainn, really summed up what is needed but also the failure of this legislation.  That is why, unfortunately, we had this joint statement from the Donegal Mica Action Group, Mayo Pyrite Action Group, Clare Pyrite Action Group, Limerick Pyrite Action Group and Sligo Pyrite Action Group saying they cannot support this legislation unless there are changes to it.  They outline in their statement the frustration, engagement, false dawns and false promises and how they have been led along.</p>  <p>  Despite all of that, we have legislation that is itself defective and will not meet the needs of countless people in my county and right across the west coast and elsewhere.  If we take a person-centred approach as a D&aacute;il, we will get this right.  The demand from the campaigners and families is to get it right.  They have been waiting.  They have had false dawns and false schemes.  We need to get it right this time.  I commend the campaigners.  They have done an amazing job in raising this issue and bringing it to public prominence.  More importantly, however, they did something that went way beyond that - they opened up their own life stories to us.  They told us some secrets many families keep about people whose mental health is breaking down.  People showed us the prescriptions they have now because of cracking walls and trying to keep their families together.  People opened up about family relationships and personal relationships and the strains the cracks in the walls are having on those family ties.  I was taken by one person we met who told us that she goes off to drive down a wee lane to cry and then comes back to the family and tries to pull it all back together.</p>  <p>  Even if we get this legislation right today, there is still a long way to go for these families to get their homes rectified.  However, the problem is that this legislation is defective.  The problem is that this Government has not listened to the pleas and anguish or the solutions that have been put forward by the family campaigners over the recent period.  If the Government had listened it would not have drafted this type of legislation.  It would not have the types of flaws in it that require 80 amendments, which I am proud to sponsor along with my colleague, Deputy Mac Lochlainn, our spokesperson, Deputy &Oacute; Broin, the entire Sinn F&eacute;in Party and, indeed, the Opposition Members on behalf of the homeowners.  It is the homeowners who are telling us that we have to get this right.</p>  <p>  You cannot walk the length of yourself in parts of County Donegal without meeting somebody who has been affected by mica.  One cannot walk down a street without meeting somebody - the person affected or a family member - who is suffering this anguish and turmoil.  We heard from and have spoken to people who are in their twilight years.  They worked all the hours, days and years God sent them and paid into their pension.  They are depending on a social welfare pension and now they are finding that their house - their forever home - is riddled with mica.  Under this scheme, they would have to contribute tens of thousands of euro, which they simply do not have.</p> <p>Another case at the other end of the spectrum is that of a young couple who got married about a year ago.  They bought a new house, a big investment, just a couple of years before that.  They have had their first child.  It is a special time in any young couple's lives when they should be looking forward to the future with hope, but they have found that their house is also riddled with mica.  They are in complete distress.  In between those two cases of the pensioner and the young couple there is the spectrum of thousands of other families with real stories and real heartbreak.  They are hoping the Members in this Chamber do the right thing over the next week.</p> <p> We can talk about things that are tangential to this, but we have legislation here that is not fit for purpose.  We need to amend it or it must be rejected and made right.  That is what the families are asking us to do and that is what must be done.  The stress this is putting on parents and on young people across the board is absolutely ridiculous and it has to stop.  We must do the right by them.  What has to be done?  We need to listen to the homeowners and to those who have put forward those 80 amendments.  The Government must provide additional space and time so those amendments can be debated and considered with proper time and proper scrutiny.  This scheme costs a great deal of money for the taxpayer, and the taxpayers are the people who are also affected by mica in their homes, yet the Government is giving two hours for Committee and Report Stages next week.  It is approximately &euro;22 million per minute.  It is ridiculous.  In my ten or 11 years as finance spokesperson I have not seen a single legislative measure which has such a large bill being rushed through.  It needs to stop.  We must get this right on behalf of everybody.</p> <p> A number of issues must be dealt with.  One of the things that was not in the previous scheme is the damage threshold.  Now, the Government is planning to introduce a damage threshold.  It is not about prioritising when one's house will get remediated but about eligibility for the scheme.  That has to go, and go without delay.</p> <p> The other issue that needs to be dealt with is the square foot rate, as other Deputies have mentioned.  I listened to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, and to Deputy McHugh.  The reality is that if they vote for this scheme without amendment, there will be hundreds of people, their neighbours, friends and people they meet in the street, who will not be able to avail of the scheme.  Why?  The scheme will require them to put their hands in their pockets to the tune of tens of thousands of euro, which we know they simply do not have.  Ms Martina Hegarty put it well with regard to her home.  She is very familiar with the scheme and with the legislation.  She has been an activist on this for many years.  She has one of the smallest houses going into the scheme at less than 1,000 sq. ft.  Under the scheme she will have a grant of &euro;158,000.  The cost she has received from contractors is approximately &euro;40,000 more than that.</p> <p> We have heard from others, such as quantity surveyors who provided information and evidence to the committee.  For example, Mr. Aidan Houton said that the estimated shortfall for a 1,000 sq. ft. house is &euro;48,300, which is 30%.  For an average one-off house in the State, which is 2,400 sq. ft., the estimated shortfall would be &euro;69,600.  We know why that happened.  We know about the rates being set by the SCSI, but we also know that the game was rigged.  The criteria the SCSI was asked to look at excluded this and that, such as engineers' fees and foundations.  One cannot even put a carpet or a piece of tile on the floor.  All of that, including walls and gardens, is excluded.  That is why these families will still not be able to afford this scheme.  That is the reality, and that is why they are so annoyed at what is happening here.  We need to ensure it is done properly.</p> <p> The downsizing penalty has been mentioned time and again.  That is the best example of the cruelty this Government is portraying in regard to this campaign.  These are families that do not want to downsize.  Why would they?  The only reason that there is a solution, which is trying to meet the State halfway, is that this will not cost the State an extra penny.  As a result of this, the families say they will consider rebuilding a smaller home even though it had nothing to do with them and it was actually the Government's fault because of an era of no regulation.  They are saying they will build a smaller home, but what does the Government do?  It tells them that if they do that, it will cut their grant.  It is absolutely cruel.  Deputy McHugh mentioned that we can deal with that in a regulation.  He was probably setting himself up for voting for this legislation.  It is nonsense.  The legislation is very clear.  It is in section 17(5), which states that if there is a reduction of the internal floor area of the relevant dwelling that is being demolished, the local authority will reduce the amount of the grant approved by the Housing Agency.  It is in the legislation and it needs to be removed.  That is provided for in one of the amendments.  Why under God would one do this?  The reason they are saying they will consider downsizing is that under the scheme they do not have the &euro;40,000 or &euro;50,000 so they know they are locked out.  The only way they can get in under the current scheme is by building a smaller house that would cost less but then enable them to get the 100%.</p> <p> I could say much more about this.  We need to put people at the heart of it.  We need to forget about a lot of the detail that is going to be argued with regard to the standards, doing this review and that review and all the rest just for one minute.  Perhaps Members in the House have relatives who are in this situation, but I will explain how I think about this.  My mum is pushing on in life.  If that was my mum's house, I know she would not be able to afford to rebuild it, or if it was my son and daughter who were setting off in life, they would not be able to afford it.  We need to think about the people and about how they are feeling at this point.  We need to do right by them, because this State did wrong by them by having an era of no-touch or light-touch regulation during the Celtic tiger economy that allowed for these types of defective blocks to be used in the construction of their homes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-06-30a.264" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1605" speakername="Marian Harkin" time="16:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022063000048#DDD00200"><p>The legislation before us has a number of positive aspects.  Certainly, it is an improvement on what was originally proposed, which was pretty pathetic.  However, like the homes affected by mica, pyrite and pyrrhotite, there are cracks in the overall structure of this legislation, and individuals and families will fall through those cracks.  It is bad enough that it has happened once already to these families, but for those families to know that it could happen again as part of this remediation scheme would be unacceptable.  That is why I and every other Deputy I have heard speak in this debate have asked for more time to be given for Committee Stage to discuss and tease out the various amendments.  Today, the Minister has heard offers from many Deputies to have the committee sit for six, nine or whatever hours it takes to get through the amendments.  I am not saying that the Minister has to accept all the amendments put forward, but there are certainly a number of crucial amendments that must be incorporated into the legislation.</p>  <p>  I will shortly highlight what I believe are some of the crucial amendments that the Minister must incorporate into the legislation.  I believe the Minister and the Government want a robust and sustainable scheme that homeowners and families can have faith in and which they believe will deal with the nightmare that many of them are living through.  I will not go into detail about the day-to-day misery and heartache of many families, their anxieties, their fears and the incredible pressure that so many are facing, because I have spoken about this many times in the House.  However, it is important to say that many families are listening anxiously to this debate.</p><p><i>6 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p>They are waiting to see what will happen as this legislation passes through the Houses.  They need to know that this House and the Minister of State will deliver a scheme that is fit for purpose.  They need to know that whatever remediation or rebuilding is done will allow them to sleep easy in their beds.  My final comment on this aspect is that while we often use the word "houses", we are in fact talking about homes.  Every one of us who is lucky enough to have a home knows that when we walk through our front door and close it behind us, we feel we can leave behind, at least on a temporary basis, the worries of the world.  At its best, a home should be a place of refuge, but for homeowners whose homes are affected by deleterious materials there is no refuge in their homes.  There is fear and worry.  We have an opportunity to change that situation over the next few weeks.</p> <p> Many amendments to this legislation have been proposed.  I ask the Minister of State and his officials to look carefully at those amendments and consider accepting at least some of the more important and crucial ones that were raised not just by Members of the Opposition today, but by his colleagues on the Government benches.  All deleterious materials, including mica, pyrite, pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite and marcasite, or any combination of those materials, must be included in the process.  That list is not exhaustive.  I am not an expert but it is important that all deleterious material be included and all foundations must be included.  The assessment process is part and parcel of that.  I know nothing about building a house.  Some people here do; I am looking at my colleague, Deputy O'Donoghue.  He gave us some very powerful statements earlier that came from a place of knowledge and experience.  Even I know, however, that if foundations are unstable, then the building is unstable.  They must be included as part and parcel of any assessment process, which needs to be thorough and objective.  That is crucial.  It cannot be somebody's opinion, what something looks like, or what someone thinks.  It has to be objective and needs to be based on the most up-to-date science.  That will help to ensure better outcomes.</p> <p> The damage threshold needs to be re-examined.  Homeowners need 100% redress.  While it is easy to say that as a member of the Opposition, and it slips off the tongue, the question I have to ask is how can we expect families who have paid, and are paying, huge mortgages to spend more money on making their homes habitable?  We should not ask them to do that at any time but, right now, I do not need to tell the Minister of State about inflation and the major increase in the cost of living.  That casts a further shadow on all those families who are concerned that the amount of money they will get will leave them short tens of thousands of euro.  This State is accepting responsibility because it is responsible for lax or no regulation, and for lax or no implementation of the regulations on our Statute Book.  That responsibility has to be 100% and no less.</p> <p> I agree very strongly with my colleague, Deputy McNamara, and others, who called on the Minister of State to pursue those who actually caused the problem in the first place and, in certain instances, whose salaries and bonuses were paid on the backs of the misery of families whose homes are damaged and destroyed by deleterious materials.  The taxpayer, and that includes the affected homeowners, will end up footing this enormous bill unless the Minister and his successor exercise their authority, which they have.  It is partly written into the Bill but it needs to be strengthened because while the intentions of the Minister and the Minister of State may be good on this, they do not know what the intentions of their successors will be.  That is why this part of the Bill needs to be strengthened so the State is protected from an ever-increasing bill.</p> <p> Many Deputies raised the issue of downsizing because families will be penalised for this, which makes no sense from an environmental perspective and the perspective of using less building materials and engaging in less work.  It means we could get through this process quicker.  It could also allow families to insulate their homes to make them more energy efficient.  That is a win-win.  Penalising people for doing something positive is just plain wrong.  There seems to be a real miserly approach to this.  People are not gaining financially; there is no moral hazard here.  We all know what that is.  It was a phrase most of us were not familiar with before we bailed out the banks but we then all learned what moral hazard is.  There is no moral hazard here.  I want the Minister of State to look at that aspect again.  If there is moral hazard, I ask him to please tell me where it is.</p> <p> Will the National Standards Authority of Ireland, NSAI, review of IS 465 be completed before the commencement of the scheme?  If not, can it be guaranteed that the outcome of the NSAI review will be fully integrated into the scheme?  It will not be perfect but if we are guaranteed that will happen, it is something.  We need proper testing.  We need to know that what we are doing will deliver the kind of remediation families need.</p> <p> I will raise issues specific to the constituency I represent, which includes Sligo, Leitrim, north Roscommon and south Donegal.  Donegal is included in the scheme and, as I said, if the Minister accepts a number of the crucial amendments that I and others have submitted, that is a good start.  In that context, I thank all the campaigners who have ensured that very good scientific evidence has been provided to us as public representatives in order to enable us as laypersons get a better understanding of the situation they face so we could put forward amendments that will improve the Bill and deliver for all those affected.  I thank my colleagues, Deputies Pringle and &Oacute; Broin, for their assistance in also providing amendments we could sign and support.</p> <p> As far as Sligo is concerned, we are not yet officially included in this scheme.  When I raised this issue with the T&aacute;naiste approximately 12 months ago, he used the phrase "natural justice".  That may be the case but people are still worried and anxious.</p> <p>I met some campaigners from Sligo outside Leinster House today, as I have met campaigners from many counties over many months.  Their hearts are broken, but the important truth is that many of them still hope that we might get it right.  When I asked the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, about the inclusion of Sligo, I received a response from him approximately two weeks ago.  He spoke of the good co-operation with Sligo local authority and of the very good work going on.  I believe, from the perspective of natural justice, that we will be included.</p> <p> However, the Minister and I are aware that there is a heavy responsibility on local authorities.  I have asked on many occasions and written the Minister to ask that more support and resources be provided to local authorities.  Local authorities have considerable expertise, but this is a new area.  Is the Minister supporting local authorities?  Is he giving them the kinds of resources they need now and on an ongoing basis, in order that they can represent all the homeowners in their area?  Is he making it easy, or even a little bit easier, for them to present their case?</p> <p> I have also written to Leitrim County Council to ask about the situation there, because I have received one or two emails from people who have concerns about homes in certain parts of County Leitrim, especially in the north of the county.  Leitrim County Council informed me that, up to now, it has not been alerted to deleterious materials in homes in Leitrim.  I hope that is the case, but we all know that mica and pyrite does not stop at any county boundary.  Leitrim is a small county and I hope very few affected families will be affected.  However, local authorities such as those in Leitrim and Roscommon need to be resourced and supported to get the information as quickly as possible, in order that families that have concerns about their homes can be included in the scheme.</p> <p> A local authority in a small county has few resources and less expertise.  That is simply the reality and yet those local authorities will be expected to do the same work as local authorities in larger counties.  There is something inherently unfair and unjust about that.  Will the Minister assure me that will not be the case, that the resources and expertise will be provided and that the Department will work with these local authorities to ensure that the homeowners, of whom I hope there will be few, will be properly represented and will know that they can get in to this scheme?</p> <p> In the coming weeks, the Minister can get this right.  The Opposition will support him.  In respect of all those homeowners who are listening today and who will send us emails to ask what happened and what the Minister said, after listening to his speech and, it is hoped, after Committee Stage next week, I ask the Minister to make sure we can say to them that the Minister and the Government are taking those crucial amendments on board and that we believe and hope this scheme will deliver good outcomes for them and their families.</p></speech>

I know Deputies are keenly aware of the scale of the crisis that confronts us.  This scheme is the State stepping up to the mark in a voluntary capacity, in the form of a grant scheme, having accepted that there is a moral obligation on Government to put in place practical solutions for impacted homeowners.  Government fully accepts that impacted homeowners have been through a very difficult time.  The Minister, Deputy O'Brien, addressed that aspect in some detail in this opening remarks.</p>  <p>  The Government also accepts that the current scheme, while well intentioned, did not work as intended and that the difficulties and challenges which arose needed to be addressed.  We are also legislating for a much more enhanced, workable and fit-for-purpose grant scheme which will respond to the issues raised by homeowners and other stakeholders during extensive consultations over the past 12 months.  The Minister, Deputy O'Brien, has been in County Clare and other areas to meet homeowners in their homes, in connection with this issue.  I also met with many residents, along with Deputy McHugh, at the convention centre last year.  I heard first hand about the anguish they were going through, their frustrations and the considerable challenge that they faced in their daily lives. </p>  <p>  The enhanced scheme addresses the challenges and difficulties experienced with the current scheme by removing the financial barrier to the scheme entry, by having the Housing Agency carry out testing of homes and absorbing the cost; limiting homeowner outlay to between &euro;500 and &euro;700 for a building condition assessment, the cost of which is recoupable; conferring exempt development status on remediation works approved under the scheme; increasing the overall grant cap from &euro;247,500 to &euro;420,000, which is a significant increase; providing funding for alternative accommodation and storage costs and immediate repair works, up to a value of &euro;25,000; adding the counties of Clare and Limerick to the scheme and providing a pathway for addition of other counties, if required; a simplification of the application process and a significant reduction in the administration and bureaucracy associated with the scheme.</p>  <p>  Challenges will also be addressed in the enhanced scheme by the introduction of a damage threshold for entry to the grant scheme, which will not be set and used to prevent homeowners accessing the scheme, but to ensure they will enter the scheme at the appropriate time, in order to ensure that the worst-affected homes are prioritised; the establishment of an independent appeals process, with key decisions under the scheme now subject to an appeal; the addition of rented dwellings registered with the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, on or before 1 November 2021, as eligible for the scheme; a certificate of remediation grounded in primary legislation; a Government guarantee in respect of remediation works, provided through the availability of a second grant option, if required, for a period of 40 years; provision for inflation, as required; confirmation of eligibility for SEAI grants for thermal upgrades and bespoke arrangements by SEAI to manage such applications and provision for the introduction of an Exchequer-funded grant scheme for local authority owned and approved housing owned social homes.</p>  <p>  In addition to these specific enhancements, which are set out in the Bill, Government has also agreed to review the existing IS 465 standard for the assessment, testing and categorisation of homes suspected of being impacted by defective concrete blocks; review the concrete blocks standard, including the standard for aggregates; review the potential impact on foundations in homes by defective concrete blocks; review the potential impact on full cavity insulation on homes impacted by defective concrete blocks; appoint a senior counsel to consider the issue of wrongdoers and their pursuit and the expansion by the Department of Health of the MyMind service to assist vulnerable homeowners and their families with regard to mental health issues which have arisen owing to the impact of this issue.</p>  <p>  The remediation of Remediation of Dwellings Damaged By the Use of Defective Concrete Blocks Bill 2022 can address the challenges being faced by affected homeowners.  The passage of this very important legislation will mark the beginning of the end of the challenges being faced by impacted homeowners, by giving them a much enhanced and fit-for-purpose grant scheme.</p> <p>The Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, will continue to work closely with all Members of the Oireachtas and listen carefully to their views.  We can all agree that it is essential that this Bill passes through all Stages of the D&aacute;il and Seanad in a timely fashion and that the enhanced scheme can be open for applications as soon as possible.  I thank all Deputies for their engagement on the Bill and the Minister will respond to the specific questions and amendments proposed on Committee and Final Stages.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-06-30a.272" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="17:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022063000051#GGG00500"><p>I move:</p> <blockquote> 	That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann shall take note of the Report of the Standing Committee of Public Accounts, entitled &quot;Examination of the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board 2019 Financial Statements and Related Financial Matters&quot;, copies of which were laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 8th March, 2022. </blockquote>  <p>I thank the House for the opportunity to debate this report, which follows the committee's examination of the national paediatric hospital development board's 2019 financial statements.  By way of introduction, the committee's remit as delegated by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann is to examine accounts and statements audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General as well as reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General which have been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  This is the tenth report that the Committee of Public Accounts of the Thirty-third D&aacute;il has completed and laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p><p>The introduction to the report gives an overview of the board's 2019 financial statements and outlines the board's two meetings with the committee prior to the publication of this report.  The committee undertook a site visit to the hospital in July 2021 and met the board again last month to examine its 2020 financial statements.  Given the scale of public expenditure on this project, the committee will continue to closely examine expenditure on it.  We have since met the hospital board again in recent weeks so there is a high level of interest in this from all committee members.</p><p>The board&rsquo;s 2019 statements show that it received just shy of &euro;200 million in funding through State grants provided by the Health Service Executive, funded by the capital allocation it received from the Department of Health.  Total accumulated costs for the project at the end of 2019 amounted to &euro;459 million, which excludes &euro;35.5 million of capital expenditure that was written off in 2013 following the Government&rsquo;s decision to relocate the site from the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital.  There are lessons to be learned from that, apart from the project we are dealing with now.  Some &euro;35 million was spent before we even got to talk about the site or before there was any progress made on development plans for the current site of the children's hospital beside St. James's Hospital.  We cannot keep doing this kind of thing and keep just spending &euro;35 million with nothing to show for it; no bricks, mortar or anything else.  The construction costs to the Exchequer as of 2019 were expected to be approximately &euro;1.4 billion.  The total cost of the hospital, including fit-outs, is expected to exceed &euro;1.7 billion.  As of 16 December 2021, overall expenditure in the project was approximately &euro;873 million.</p><p>The report makes three major recommendations, which correspond to three of the key and significant issues identified by the committee in the first two engagements we had with the board.  All three recommendations have been accepted by the board and by the Department of Health, which is welcome, but they must also be acted on.  I will briefly go through these three issues and recommendations.</p><p>The first issue concerns the report submitted by the board to the Department of Health, which relates to the board's analysis of the national paediatric hospital development project.  The report includes the determination of the potential updates to the timeline and costs for completion of the project.  The board advised that once this report was submitted to the Minister an update could be provided to the committee.  However, each of the committee's requests to obtain a copy of the report has been refused on the basis that the information is deemed to be &quot;commercially sensitive&quot;.  This impedes the oversight of the spending of public money, which is taxpayers' money, not ours.  The committee finds it unacceptable that none of the entities with responsibility for the national paediatric hospital can give a reasonable and accurate estimate, or estimates allowing for qualifications of the expected final cost, of the completion of the project.  I mentioned the figure of &euro;1.7 billion and that includes &euro;300 million for the fit-out but that budget was made in 2014 and it would be wise not to assume that this might not have doubled.  The Secretary General could not give me a commitment that the overall costs would not exceed &euro;2 billion.  The committee recommended that a detailed report outlining the timelines and estimated costs for completion of the national paediatric hospital be published as a matter of urgency.</p><p>The second issue pertains to the project costs in addition to the guaranteed maximum price established in the tender process.  These additional costs include such items as construction inflation, design variation and a huge number of claims.  The employer representative has been notified of 1,139 claims by the end of January.  My understanding is that those claims continue to roll in.  Some 1,023 of these claims were substantiated, bringing with them a combined value of &euro;554 million.  Determinations were made on 862 of 1,023 claims, crediting &euro;14.4 million to the contractor and &euro;5.5 million to the board.  The committee is concerned about the level of claims and is also aware that claims are being disputed in the High Court.  This could bring significant legal costs and it increases the overall financial burden on the taxpayer.  The committee also notes that in total, by the end of 2022 the increase in the costs arising from construction inflation could have added another &euro;18.1 million to the overall costs.  In a subsequent engagement with the board this month the committee, in its examination of the board's 2020 financial statements, heard that the inflationary impact of the project to date from 2019 to 2022, could be as high as &euro;51 million.</p><p>I was shocked when I saw how the two-stage tendering process was structured.  It has been left wide open, leaving the taxpayer completely exposed.  That tender process does not provide an effective ceiling or limit on the overall costs and, therefore, there is huge exposure to the taxpayer and the State.  This is the most troubling aspect of this project for the committee and for me.  The committee recommends that the board include a note in its financial statements detailing costs paid and not included in the approved budget of &euro;1.4 billion.  It should include a note in the accounts indicating the overall claims received by the employer's representative and the current stage in the dispute process.  It should also attach a value to the resolved claims to show any impact on the overall costs and provide a quarterly report to the committee on the number of claims, by stage, in the dispute process and the potential costs, by category, for the settled and open claims.</p> <p> The third issue sets out the committee's position on the design and complexity of the project.  Having visited the hospital site in July 2021, spent a good bit of time there and had full attendance from the committee, we believe the scale and ambition of the project is clear and we need the children's hospital.  There is no argument about that.  However, the committee is not convinced this was the appropriate project through which to pursue a design statement of this complexity and cost.  It is an architect's showcase.   It is nice on an architect's portfolio but I am not sure about the functionality part of it.  The committee recommends that future capital projects of this scale where the primary aim is functionality should prioritise value for money for the taxpayer.  The committee also recommends a comprehensive review is carried out following completion of this project to ensure lessons are learned for future capital projects.</p> <p> This review will be particularly important as there will be learnings from it in terms of procurement process and bespoke contractual provisions.  I highlight that there has been very little information as to maintenance costs.  It is a wow project to look at but what about the maintenance costs?  The Minister of State is a Minister and I am not, but when we sign off on what is put down in front of us to sign at local or national government level, sometimes we need to be careful what we are signing.  We can be signing something, the long-term costs and functionality of which may not be the best.  I unfortunately suspect, having met the contractors on site, as well as members of the board and officials, that there will be a high maintenance cost on this project.  Window cleaners will be busy.</p> <p> One of the things that struck me on site was when I asked an official and somebody from the contractor where the solar panels were.  I was told there was no room for them.  We were on top of the building looking down on the streets around us.  I cannot remember how many, but that building covers several hectares.  The Acting Chairman, Deputy Verona Murphy, can confirm this because she played a great role in it.  They are small terraced houses and, in some streets, up to half of them have solar panels.  There we were, standing on top of the biggest project undertaken by the State and nothing is being captured there.  It puzzled me.</p> <p> I have been giving out in this Chamber for the past nine or ten years about schools not having solar panels on them when we build them.  We should put them on them and hopefully from now on will do so.  This project was started in the past three or four years.  It is a tall building up in the skyline and is ideally placed.  I am not a solar expert but I think it would tick all the boxes.  I am at a loss as to why it was not done and have never got a clear explanation.  It did not fit in with, obviously, the final design of the architects. </p> <p> The Committee of Public Accounts welcomes the board's acceptance of the recommendations put forward and is committed to ensuring the recommendations are acted upon.  It is a concise report.  I encourage Members of the House to read its recommendations in full.  The committee is not producing reports for the fun of it or just to be put on a shelf.  It is important that the Minister and officials in the Department of Health and other Departments read what is in them.  We had long engagements with the hospital board.  The Acting Chairman and every other member of the committee was active on it.  We have over the past two years had a huge exchange of correspondence with the Department, not just in the hearings.  There have been three hearings and we have had a huge exchange of correspondence back and forward.  We have sought further information and questioned it.  We really have tried to keep on top of this.  I assure the Minister of State that we will continue to so do as it is important.</p> <p> I thank everyone who contributed to the report, including members of the committee, the witnesses who engaged with the committee during its consideration of these matters, the staff of the secretariat and the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I look forward to this debate on a report that has examined one of the most significant and expensive capital projects in the history of the State.</p></speech>

I am taking the report on behalf of the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, who sends his apologies.  When I use the word "I" in this response, I am referring to the Minister.</p>  <p>  I thank the Business Committee for raising this matter.  I welcome the opportunity to address the Public Accounts Committee's report on the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board's 2019 financial statements.  As Members are aware, the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board, NPHDB, has statutory responsibility for designing, building, and equipping the new children's hospital and the two completed and operational satellite centres in Blanchardstown and Tallaght. </p>  <p>  Under the ministerial order that established the development board in 2007, the board is charged with keeping all proper and usual accounts and all special accounts as the Minister may from time to time require.  Additionally, the development board must submit an annual financial statement to the Comptroller and Auditor General for an audit report to be carried out in accordance with the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act 1993.  The board's annual financial statements for 2019 were submitted to my Department following completion of the Comptroller and Auditor General's audit in June 2020.  They were then laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on 13 August 2020, pursuant to section 11 of the 1993 Act.</p>  <p>  The board receives its capital funding for the project from the HSE, as the sanctioning body for the new children's hospital programme.  As set out in the 2019 financial statements, costs of &euro;199.6 million were incurred by the board in 2019.  On 8 March 2022, the Committee of Public Accounts published its report following the examination of the 2019 financial statements and related financial matters.  In line with Department of Finance Circular 01/2011, every Committee of Public Accounts report requires a formal response prepared by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, in consultation with relevant Departments and offices.  This response is known as the minute of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  My Department reviewed the report and its recommendations in conjunction with the development board and engaged with Department of Public Expenditure and Reform officials to draft the minute in response to the report of the Committee of Public Accounts.</p>  <p>   The report contained three recommendations which were examined, noted and responded to in the form of the minute on 3 May 2022.  Recommendation 1 was that a detailed report outlining the timeline and estimated costs for the completion of the national paediatric hospital be published as a matter of urgency.  I can advise that the development board undertook an analysis of the new children's hospital project to determine the implications of any delays and the most effective pathway to ensure the timely completion of this critical project.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform was informed by my Department that it noted the recommendation to publish this analysis but that it was not, and still is not, possible to publish or furnish the analysis to the Committee of Public Accounts as requested at this time.  The analysis relates to the best way forward on a project subject to a live contract and, as such, its contents are commercially sensitive and confidential.  The unpredictable course of the pandemic, recent geopolitical events and the consequential uncertainty make speculation and definitive forecasting of time and costs, hypothetical or otherwise, very challenging.  Discussion or publication of any likely out-turn would prejudice enforcement of the existing live contract and would be very likely to negatively impact or jeopardise the board in its ongoing confidential commercial engagement with the main contractor, including its responsibility for ensuring the timely completion of the construction works.</p>  <p>  Recommendation 2 was accepted by the development board, and this was reflected in the minute, that future financial statements will include a note that details the additional costs paid to date that are not included in the approved budget of &euro;1.4 billion.  It will also include a note that indicates the overall claims received by the employer representative and the current stage that they are at in the dispute management process.  The development board has also committed to attaching a monetary value to resolved claims to show any impact they may have on the overall cost and to providing a quarterly report to the Committee of Public Accounts on both open and settled claims.  I welcome this approach by the development board.</p> <p>My Department accepts recommendation 3 of the report of the Committee of Public Accounts that future capital projects of the scale of the new children's hospital where the primary aim is functionality should prioritise value for money for the taxpayer.  All Irish public bodies are obliged to treat public funds with care and to ensure the best possible value for money is obtained whenever public money is being spent or invested.  The public spending code sets out the rules and procedures that apply to ensure these standards are upheld across the Irish public service.  Lessons have already been learned and are now being applied in respect of capital investment projects of this scale.<br/><br/>The 2019 PwC independent review into the national children's hospital made 11 recommendations, nine of which are directly related to the national children's hospital project with the remaining two relating to the management of capital projects more generally.  A new updated public spending code with a project life cycle approach to better ensure value for money has been introduced by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  Last November, the Government noted the implementation plan for the PwC report's recommendations and the actions taken to date.  On the same day, the Government approved the revised programme management and programme oversight arrangements for the next phase of the national children's hospital project, including the new national oversight group.  All 11 recommendations of the PwC report have now been addressed.<br/><br/>The Department of Health is committed to ongoing investment in health infrastructure with a focus on improving the delivery of such projects to ensure speed of delivery and value for money.  My Department has introduced a new major capital projects function to oversee the application of the public spending code for capital projects costing over &euro;100 million and to provide the necessary challenge function to ensure future proposals represent value for money.<br/><br/>My Department is also undertaking a process to strengthen our capital investment planning and delivery process so that commitments and deliverables under the National Development Plan 2021-2030 and any emerging needs and priorities can be considered in an evidence-based manner and capital investment undertaken in a more strategic way that is better aligned to population-based needs.  Furthermore, in late 2021, the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, introduced an external assurance process that all major projects are subject to as they progress through the public spending code.  Under recommendation 3, it was also accepted that a comprehensive review should be carried out following completion of the national children's hospital project to ensure lessons are learned for future capital projects.  In line with the updated public spending code requirements, there will be a review stage process and an <i>ex post</i>evaluation process.<br/><br/>The Department and I have every faith and confidence in the development board to deliver on this project.  The building is now 70% complete.  Anyone who has been on site will know that it is truly awe-inspiring to see what has been delivered to date.<br/><br/>In November 2021, the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, opened the new outpatient and emergency care centre in Tallaght.  It will accommodate up to 42,000 outpatient and emergency care attendances each year.  Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland at Connolly opened in July 2019.  In 2021, it saw over 11,000 urgent care attendances.  More than 95% of these children were discharged home after their visit.  Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland at Connolly also saw more than 13,000 outpatients and enabled a 65% reduction in the waiting list for general paediatrics within a year of opening.  Recently, it extended services to a seven-day working model, ensuring more access to the children in the greater Dublin region. <br/><br/>Despite the unprecedented challenges and uncertainty that have not only delayed this project, but also affected the wider construction industry, broader sectors and the general economy, it is important to acknowledge the great progress that has been made on the new hospital at St. James's.  We have a building that, to all intents and purposes, looks complete from the outside.  The focus is now on the internal fit-out of the over 6,100 internal spaces.  The most advanced areas have intact floors, walls, ceilings and joinery, such as nurses' stations, installed.  The ICU pendants that hold all medical equipment, along with bathroom fittings, are being installed.  The fit-out of ceilings, walls and glazed screens within the concourse at all levels is well under way.  The fit-out of the 22 operating theatres' ceilings, walls and floors, with medical equipment already being installed.  I am informed that the first rooms will be completed this summer.  The other 4,600 clinical rooms will follow in a planned sequence to the middle of next year.  The ambition is being realised by the development board and the contractors.  The difference the new children's hospital will make to children, their families and healthcare professionals is clear to see.<br/><br/>While the delays are not welcome, it is important that they are not overstated and that the complexities of this project, combined with externalities beyond the control of the development board and contractors, are understood.  This remains a very complex project with over 40,000 activities detailed in the contractor's programme.  The development board has advised that the contractor's own schedule now suggests completion of the project could be achieved by the end of January 2024, which would mean the new children's hospital at St. James's could open in the second half of 2024, after the necessary commissioning period.  I am informed that the development board continues to engage with the contractor to ensure the project can be completed as quickly and effectively as possible.  Work is also ongoing to determine whether the timeline for some of this commissioning activity can be reduced or whether such activity can be conducted in parallel with substantial completion, where it is safe and appropriate to do so, in order to expedite the opening of the hospital.<br/><br/>However, there remain risks to the timeline beyond the control of the development board and the contractor arising from the disruption to supply chains that has resulted from the pandemic over the last two years.  More recently, the war in Ukraine has given rise, and will likely continue to give rise, to global economic uncertainty, supply chain disruption and shortages of raw materials for construction.  The wider construction industry is challenged by these same supply chain issues and dramatic price increases.  The new children's hospital project cannot be immune to these external risks.  It is fortunate that most of the steel and concrete has been installed and that many materials have been procured and assembled off-site.  As a tier 1 construction company, BAM has global reach into supply chains and continues to make every effort to mitigate these risks.<br/><br/>The degree of construction inflation we are currently experiencing is a once-in-a-generation phenomenon and could not have been foreseen.  The contract between the development board and BAM provides for a risk-sharing mechanism for construction inflation.  Until recently, this collaborative risk-sharing approach was unique in our capital programme.  However, more recently, the Government has identified that the risk of inflation in this current economic environment is not tenable, viable or sustainable for the construction industry or for the achievement of our goals under the national development plan and has acted accordingly.  <br/><br/>In November 2021 and May 2022, the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, announced measures to address the impact that exceptional inflation in construction sector and energy is having on public works contracts.  In recognition that neither party is responsible for the global events that have given rise to inflation, the inflation co-operation framework apportions the additional inflation costs between the parties, with the State bearing up to 70% of the additional inflationary related costs, subject to budgetary constraints.  While the new framework does not apply to a project as advanced as the new children's hospital, the children's hospital contract already includes a bespoke risk-sharing mechanism with the contractor bearing the costs of the first 4% of construction inflation and the development board, and ultimately the State, making up the difference thereafter.  As a result, total inflation payments from 2019 to date have been &euro;21 million.  <br/><br/>The compound effect of the unprecedented increase in construction inflation will be a driver of additional costs which have always been outside the &euro;1.433 billion budget for the capital project.  However, in the current climate, inflation is a challenge for all capital projects.  Importantly, I can confirm the capital budget has not been depleted.  However, there will be additional costs associated with delays, inflation and the impact of external factors.  To date, just over &euro;1 billion, or 71% of the &euro;1.433 billion budget, has been drawn down.  The development board continues to monitor and respond to the risks to cost and timelines and to administer the contract as mandated by the Government.</p> <p> While I acknowledge the new children's hospital project has had its difficulties and delays, I also acknowledge the great progress made to date.  We now have paediatric outpatient and urgent care being delivered at Connolly, outpatient and emergency care being delivered at Tallaght and a site at St. James's that is visibly progressing towards construction completion.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-06-30a.277" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1622" speakername="Verona Murphy" time="17:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022063000054#KKK00200"><p>As a member of the Committee of Public Accounts, I am pleased to have the opportunity to support and speak on this motion.  I commend all those who worked on compiling the report, including the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, the committee secretariat, my colleagues on the committee, the Chairman, Deputy Stanley, and the witnesses who appeared before us.  The Committee of Public Accounts met with the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board on two occasions, on 9 February 2021 and 13 July 2021.  The committee then published a report on these two meetings in March of this year.  The report contained a number of recommendations.  The board was requested to provide an update in respect of each of the relevant recommendations.  No updates were received by close of business on 15 June 2022.  The fact that no updates were received illustrates the difficulty many members of the committee have faced in trying to get information from members of the board.  It has been frustrating to say the least.</p><p>The first recommendation was that they publish a report on the timeline and cost of the national paediatric hospital.  The Department of Health refused on the basis that this information was commercially sensitive.  During the two meetings with the board on the dates previously referred to, I also received non-answers to questions, citing the commercial sensitivity of the project as the reason for not answering.  At the second meeting on 13 July I said the following: </p> <blockquote> 	There is a vacuum in transparency and accountability with regard to the project.  There have not been any real answers from the board representatives this morning.  I appreciate that we can have commercial sensitivity, but we can take it too far.  I believe the board is taking the interpretation in the broadest possible sense in respect of commercial sensitivity.  As a member of the committee I believe the information being requested is in the public interest. </blockquote>  <p>Per bed, this project is on course to be the most expensive hospital ever built in the history of humanity.  Not only will it be the most expensive hospital ever built, it looks like it could end up being over two times more expensive than the second most expensive hospital ever built, per bed.  Yet, members of the Committee of Public Accounts were continually fobbed off when trying to get to the bottom of the matter.  At the board's last appearance in front of the committee, it was heavily criticised by the Vice Chair, Deputy Catherine Murphy, who said the board's attitude of indifference to the committee had to be addressed and that we had a job to do.  Mr. Gunning noted those remarks and said he took them on board and would ensure everything possible would be done in the future to address the issues raised.  That lasted for all of about 40 minutes as I asked a straightforward question which Mr Gunning failed to answer.</p><p>Inflation is one area of concern that is having a major impact, not just on the cost of living.  It will also have a major impact on the cost of this project.  I questioned the members of the board about the inflation clause in the contract.  I was informed by Mr. Gunning, &quot;There is an inflation clause in the contract.  It states that construction inflation above 4% becomes a cost the State will bear and below 4% it is the contractor's responsibility.&quot;  Mr. Devine further stated, &quot;It is based on an average of three published tender inflation indices from Linesight, AECOM and the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland.&quot;  I asked Mr. Devine if he believed that figure of 4% was a little low, given that at the time construction price inflation was at 7%.  I was told, &quot;The 4% figure was the result of detailed analysis we did back in 2016 when we issued the job out to tender.&quot;  Unfortunately, it looks like our current inflation predicament may result in the taxpayer having to pick up the tab for even more overruns.</p><p>With regard to the project as a whole, I have some sympathy for the Minister of State and the Minister for Health.  He has been handed a poisoned chalice and he has had to oversee the mess created.  The contract and design were started when the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Leo Varadkar, was Minister for Health and the construction of the project began when the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, was Minister for Health.  The Government has been hiding the cost of the hospital and the huge difficulties with it from the public.  It has gone from &euro;600 million to &euro;1.5 billion.  I remember Deputy Varadkar, saying that short of an asteroid hitting the planet the hospital will be finished in 2020.  Those are not my words they are the words of our current T&aacute;naiste in January 2020.  Two and a half years on, the cost difficulties are getting worse.  It looks like it may be at least 2024 before the hospital sees a patient.  It is as difficult as ever to get a proper picture of what is actually going on, although I for one, as a member of the Committee of Public Accounts, will keep trying.</p><p>Mr. Gunning and Mr. Devine also assured the committee that the budget to fit out this hospital was still at &euro;300 million.  I do not see how that is possible if inflation, which is already above 4%, will apparently be paid in and around the 10% mark.  How can the budget of &euro;300 million to kit out the hospital stay at that level?  It is time we got a proper figure that reflects the reality.<b></b>I do not blame the war in Ukraine for this.  There have been delays of a very serious nature.  Of course, we could not have predicted Covid but we had templates such as other projects around the world that saw very serious delays and the doubling of project costs.  It was a serious error to keep our inflation level at 4% in the contracts, particularly when it was at 7% last year.  The Exchequer is now paying seriously for that mistake.</p></speech>

I thank the members of the Committee of Public Accounts for this timely report.  I note the difficulties they have had.  This was a bonkers project from day one.  I also note, and this is no disrespect to an tAire St&aacute;it, that the Minister for Health is not here to take this item.  There is nothing new with senior Ministers abdicating responsibility.  This was the wrong site in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Everybody knew that at the time, except a few people within the Cabinet.  For different reasons, they wanted to put it there.  It is inaccessible at the best of times.  I do not know how Deputies travelled out there on their visits.  It is inaccessible.  I convened two different assemblies on this in the AV room in 2014 and 2015.  I salute Jonathan Irwin of the Jack and Jill Foundation, Aisling McNiffe, Dr. Finn Breathnach and others.  These are ordinary people who had no vested interest other than caring for the sickest babies in this country and beyond.  Their only interest was in ensuring an accessible, state-of-the art hospital was built to look after those very feeble little human beings.  That is all they wanted.  Their testimonies were there for the Minister of the State, and for anyone else who cared to see, at the time.  There were testimonies from ambulance drivers, nurses, parents, and others.  They talked about ambulances stuck in traffic with the nurses screaming "how long more" but the drivers not being able to move.  Then we built a project with no proper helipad.</p><p><i>7 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p>Imagine in this day and age having a helipad on top of a three-storey building in which there is supposed to be a nice ambience, with little noise, for sick children to recover and having helicopters land there.  The greed and the egos got in the way.</p> <p> There is a two-tier contract.  I salute former Deputy Mick Wallace for being at those meetings I held.  He understood a bit about construction contracts and the two-tier contract that was given to BAM.  At the time, BAM International expressed a concern about the low price that BAM Ireland quoted for the hospital.  That is a matter of public record.  We are where we are.  The cost went from &euro;200 million to &euro;400 million, up to &euro;600 million and then to &euro;1.7 billion.  Jimmy Sheehan built the Galway Clinic and Blackrock Clinic.  He was at the meeting.  We had a 70-acre site in Clondalkin with a fine lake in the middle of it.  He was asked how much he would build a hospital for and how long it would take.  He said that if he had planning permission and a sealed-off site, he would build it for &euro;1 billion or &euro;1.1 billion in approximately 13 months.  He was not wanted.  He had experience of building.</p> <p> We are now talking about equipment and fit-out costing &euro;300 million.  It will cost three times that much because the estimate is totally out of date.  The equipment will be out of date too.  Much of this equipment has been bought and is in storage.  This is the problem.  The fobbing off, cover-up and deceit are disgusting.  Deputy Verona Murphy said it is the costliest product in the world since time immemorial, and it is.  China built a hospital to deal with Covid in a couple of weeks.  This is shocking.</p> <p> We have not learned anything.  I am glad to hear this project is out of the ground and the building is relatively complete.  I cannot believe what I heard from Deputy Stanley.  I have not read the report in detail.  The Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and the Government have been talking about green issues and retrofitting here for the past ten years.  The report states that there is not a solar panel on the vast roof of the building.  We pillory and threaten people.  When anybody in local authority housing gives it up or it falls into disrepair, the first thing we do is block the chimney.  Taxpayers in this little country of ours are definitely being mistreated, blackguarded and pilfered.  All the money we are talking about, from the Department of Health, the HSE and so on, comes out of the pockets of ordinary people.  Instead of paying for serious scoliosis operations, orthodontic treatment and cancer treatment that is needed so badly by our people, it is used for other purposes.  I do not know why there is not a mutiny or a rebellion among the people.  My late brother was a paediatrician of some renown.  He dearly wanted to look after children too.  That is how I became involved.</p> <p> The Government and its advisers were shown the way, a sl&iacute; eile, sl&iacute; nua, a better way, but they did not take it.  They knew it all.  The former Minister, Joan Burton, is not blameless either because the site is in her constituency.  It is the wrong place.  It will never be the right place.  You cannot make a silk purse out of a sow's ear.  This cannot be made into a silk purse.  There are serious defects.  I have significant worries about the completion of the job.  I predicted many times that it will cost &euro;3 billion.  A report is available and the Committee of Public Accounts cannot get its hands on the information that it wants from the board.  When the contract was signed, there was 7% construction inflation,.  The contract dealt with 4%.  If that was not a case of snouts in the trough, I have never seen snouts in the trough.  There were many snouts in this trough.  They are still in it.  The corruption and the stench off it is disgusting, when we should be looking after our children and sick people.  We should not be going on with a project which is a vanity project for some.</p> <p> Deputy Verona Murphy quoted the former Taoiseach, now T&aacute;naiste, who is soon to be Taoiseach again.  I am not sure what word she used.  It was about how the hospital would be built unless a meteorite hit it.  There have been false promises and fake platitudes while sick children are waiting for treatment.  Surely that must be the most important issue for every Member of this House.  We have let this racket continue, with a black hole, for many years.  There was nearly a need to evacuate the houses.  I saw the buildings nearly falling because the pile-driving beside them had gone so deep.  There was mention of 1,038 claims.  Do those include the claims for all those houses that were affected by back gardens falling into the hole?  Where will it stop?  Will it ever stop?  Those people's homes should have been and must be protected.  We are going ahead today with a fake Bill to address problems caused by mica and defective blocks.  It is nothing short of fake.  This is another phoney project.</p> <p> The hospital is in the wrong place and is inaccessible.  We were told at the time that the sick babies could come on the Luas.  Did any of us here who have children or grandchildren ever imagine bringing a sick baby in their arms on the Luas?  People would get into the car if they cannot get an ambulance, which we cannot get either.  They might get a Garda escort if they can but they certainly will not get on or off the Luas.  We were told at the time that the sick children could come on the Luas.  I know of emergencies involving young children in my parish.  I thank everyone involved, including the local garda&iacute; who provided an escort, since children needed treatment in our current hospitals in Dublin.  Unfortunately, some are not with us today.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a n-anamacha.  We see such situations.</p> <p> Going ahead with this project is nothing short of sinful, if people believe in sin any more.  When it is Judgment Day, I do not think the man above will allow this blackguarding to go on.  It would not happen in some of the places that we call juntas and cabals, because it would not be allowed to happen.  It can happen here with no accountability.</p> <p> The Minister uses the HSE and the board of the hospital as a big shield.  I do not know who is on the board now.  I know there were problems and resignations.  Fred Barry from the National Roads Authority was on it for a while.  We build good roads in this country, on time, with good value for money.  Why can we not replicate that in the HSE?  Anything to do with the HSE or the Department of Health is seen as a gravy train or cash cow to be milked constantly.  Is m&oacute;r an trua &eacute; sin.  It is an awful injustice and a disgraceful thing to impose on the sick children of this country and future generations.  It is shocking in the extreme.</p> <p> We have issues with broadband and many other matters in this country.  The issues have doubled and quadrupled and the Government says not to worry because the State will pay.  Remember that the State is the taxpayers.  They are tired with and angry about this.  It is not good enough.</p></speech>

I am taking this on his behalf.  If he was here, I am sure he would have issues with the use of the word "corruption" by Deputy Mattie McGrath.  It is important to say that.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge the input of all Deputies.  I thank the Business Committee for facilitating the debate on this matter and providing an opportunity to address the report of the Committee of Public Accounts on the development board's 2019 financial statements.  I am aware of concerns that the development board is not sufficiently co-operating with the requests of the Committee of Public Accounts.  The development board has accepted and is implementing the recommendations of the Committee of Public Accounts relating to the provision of additional information on costs and claims in the format requested by the committee.  I am informed that the contract does not mirror the format in which the committee has sought the information, but the board is doing its utmost to provide information in as coherent a way as possible.</p>  <p>  Regarding the first recommendation of the committee, it is not a matter of not co-operating with the committee.  Rather, it is simply not possible to provide hypothetical or commercially sensitive information at this time without undermining the shared goal of everyone here to see this hospital completed as soon and as efficiently as possible.  The decision not to make this analysis available at this time was made on the basis that its contents must remain confidential in order to ensure that the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board's ability to enforce the contract is not prejudiced and, ultimately, that the project is not adversely affected.</p> <p>I will not be drawn on specific claims or speculation on costs as there is a live contract in place.  I do not wish to prejudice the enforcement of the contract or to undermine the role of the development board.  It is important to recall that the value of the claims quoted is that attributed by the contractor and is not reflective of the outcome of the claims process to date.  The value of those claims is not a true liability.  Simply adding those values to the existing budget in no way reflects the likely outturn on this project.</p> <p> The development board is co-operating with the Committee of Public Accounts, and at all times is trying to provide updated information to the committee in a meaningful way, wherever possible.  My Department and the board remain committed to providing information on the project to Members of the House, including members of the Committee of Public Accounts, in a timely manner, where possible and appropriate.</p> <p> My Department has accepted recommendation No. 3 and is committed to the ongoing investment in healthcare infrastructure, with a focus on improving the delivery of such projects to ensure speed of delivery and value for money.  The capital project budget approved by the new children's hospital and the two satellite centres is &euro;1.433 billion.  This budget has not been depleted, and I have acknowledged that there remain risks beyond the control of the development board and the contractor.  Delays and external factors will be a driver of additional costs, most notably construction inflation, but everything possible is being done to make sure the project is completed as soon as possible.  Should additional budget be required, this will be sought via the Government for sanction.</p> <p> An additional &euro;300 million over and above the capital project budget also remains intact and was budgeted for the mobilisation of services and a new ICT and electronic health records system for the State's first fully digital hospital.  Market engagement has concluded and I will shortly be bringing a memo to Cabinet seeking approval for contracts for the electronic health records, EHR, system to be signed.  The importance of this project for the provision of paediatric care in Ireland cannot be overstated.  When completed, Ireland will have a hospital that will deliver world-class facilities and we will improve and prioritise the medical outcomes for this nation's sickest children.  We will be bringing transformational change to the delivery of healthcare for children in Ireland for generations to come.</p> <p> I will take on board the Deputy's comment in relation to the solar panels.  The points were very well made.  I do not know how I can influence it but I will certainly bring back to the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, the points raised by the Deputy this evening.  In the current energy climate, the points are very valid and should be noted.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-06-30a.282" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="17:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022063000056#MMM00200"><p>I thank all Members who contributed to the debate and I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte.  In the debate today some useful issues were raised and useful points were made to inform our thinking on this.  The health budget is &euro;22 billion.  I am the last person on this side of the House who would not argue for more money, but the Minister of State has had the health brief for two years, and she will be aware that even if we fill an articulated lorry with money and deposit it at the Miesian Plaza or at the headquarters of the HSE, it may not make that much difference because of systemic blocks.  I am not blaming individuals but it is absolutely frustrating to watch how the system operates and does not operate.  I have raised other smaller but important matters locally with regard to how things pan out.</p>  <p>  We are talking here about a 340- or 350-bed hospital.  We are not building the moon, although this is a substantial project and we do want to get it right.  We cannot do much about solar panels because the die is cast and it is there now.  I will say, however, that we may have learned our lessons.  Somehow or other in this country we keep repeating mistake after mistake.  Politicians get blamed for the whole thing and it is important to note that we are ultimately responsible for the officials.  There are some very good public servants but it is important we do not allow our hand to be moved too much on the page, that we, as politicians, take matters seriously, and that we are careful of expert advice.</p>  <p>  I will not start to list them but I can recount many examples during my time in public life, both at local and at national levels, of advice given that turned out to be, within three or four years, a load of cock and bull, and contradicted.  We must be careful of that.</p>  <p>  Deputy McGrath referred to the site.  After the work had started, I went up one day to look around the site.  At that stage, there were trucks excavating and drawing the rubble out.  In the construction industry, it is called "muck shifting"  The trucks were like ants crawling out of a hole.  Streets and streets were congested.  They are narrow streets and it is a difficult site.  It is what it is and we must try to work with it now.</p>  <p>  On the response around the report, obviously it is disappointing for the committee.  We have made our views very clear on that.  I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, to convey this to the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly.  We have also made it clear to the Secretary General of the Department, Mr. Robert Watt, and everyone else who has listened to the committee on this.  We have a job of work to do.</p>  <p>  On a positive note, however, there will be greater accountability regarding the claims, including regular updates on that matter and on the volume of the claims.  There is an extraordinary amount.  There are probably between 1,200 and 1,300 at the moment, if it has not already exceeded that.  I have the January figure, which is the latest figure we have, and it is substantial.  It shows the open nature of the project.  I understand this is in the context of a large project.  When we were on site, I asked for examples of some of these claims and what they arose from.  Sometimes it is for small enough stuff, such as the movement of a window or changing the head of a door.  It is relatively small stuff but it is important that as much as possible is tied down in the original contract.</p>  <p>  I also welcome the acceptance, which I hope is not just verbal and that we will see this in years to come with actions, that the emphasis will be on functionality and value for money.  I do not want us to recreate what was built in the Soviet Union in the 1940s but we can have good functional buildings without having vanity projects for architects.  This is to be welcomed.  The Department has introduced a major capital projects function to oversee the application of the public spending code for capital projects worth more than &euro;100 million and to provide the necessary challenge function to ensure that future proposals represent value for money.  That is also to be welcomed, once it is not left lying on a page.</p>  <p>  On the timelines and the delays, the hospital was supposed to be completed this year. Someone said that hopefully it will be in 2024.  As far as we can ascertain, we are now talking about mid-2024 for completion of construction and then some nine months for a fit out after that.  Realistically, we are now looking at early 2025.  The contractor was off site for longer than necessary during Covid.  After the lockdown was lifted, they refused to go back on site for a number of months.  That is not acceptable and it needs to be addressed.  Obviously, we did not foresee Covid as the contract was being signed.  I do not expect anybody to be able to foresee these things but there is a lesson there for the future.</p>  <p>  With regard to the requirements around the number of staff on site, that does not appear to be there.  If it is there, it is very weak.  We have asked questions around the number of staff on site.  If there is a low number of staff on site, there will be runaway inflation because the longer the project drags on, the higher the cost goes up.  I want to highlight this to the House.</p>  <p>  If he does nothing else, I hope the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, reads the transcript of this debate tonight.  It would be good.  I welcome that the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, is in the Chamber for the debate but the Minister for Health needs to read the transcript of this debate.</p>  <p>Lessons need to be learned about the type of contract used because of the issues that have arisen since it started construction.  There is potential for a huge number of legal challenges and then there is the escalation in the overall cost.  What about when pursue large projects in future?  We have some high-risk projects and the broadband plan is another.  I will not go into it now but it is a high-risk, high-cost project with a high exposure for the taxpayer.  While we of course want these things done in that we all want broadband and we all want the children's hospital, it is important that these things are done differently and there are not so many loose ends.  We cannot have runaway costs and then have the taxpayer picking up the bill, as well as timelines that go far beyond what was originally put in the contracts when they were originally signed.  I want to emphasise that. </p> <p> I welcome the contributions from Deputies Verona Murphy and Mattie McGrath and the Minister of State.  Hopefully we can push along with this project and the lessons learned from it can be used into the future. </p></speech>
