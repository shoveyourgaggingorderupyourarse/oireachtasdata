    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-02-07a.6" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019020700003#A00200"><p>I very much welcome the opportunity to discuss this matter.  The industrial action taken by the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, and the Psychiatric Nurses Association, PNA, is clearly creating significant challenges and disruption for the health service and more importantly, has created a worrying time for patients and their families.  I acknowledge this is not an action nurses and midwives take lightly and that the situation must be resolved.  The Government remains steadfast in wishing to resolve the matter.</p>  <p>  There is no monopoly on political support for nurses.  I am privileged, as Minister for Health, to meet incredible nurses and midwives on a daily basis.  I also meet patients on a daily basis who remind me of the excellent work nurses do across this country.  This is not a debate about who cares more for nurses.  This is a debate about how one resolves an industrial relations dispute in the context of a public service stability agreement, which I believe most if not all parties in this House profess to support.  It must be remembered by everyone in the House that the Government, and the unions, including those involved in the dispute, signed up to a three-year public service pay agreement.  Honouring agreements does matter.</p>  <p>  The public service pay agreement expressly prohibits cost claim pay increases during the lifetime of the agreement.  That is what was signed up to, so it is within that space that a solution must be found.  Deputies have already heard in this House how the public service pay agreement takes significant steps towards pay restoration.  That agreement commits to seeing significant increases in pay by 2020, and nurses and midwives can expect to see their share of the increases beginning this year.  Reductions for pay levels up to &euro;50,000, which include a large proportion of the nursing and midwifery profession, will be fully unwound by the end of this year.  That represents a wage increase of between 2% and 2.5%, on average, across the sector, with new entrants and lower-paid professionals benefitting the most from the changes.  The Government is united in its support to unwind pay reduction measures introduced under financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, legislation.  The agreement was sought in full co-operation and collaboration with public sector unions, including nursing unions.</p>  <p>  We are eager to come to a fair and satisfactory solution for all parties involved that preserves the integrity of all elements of the agreement.  That puts us in a difficult position in terms of how we reach a solution which respects the public service stability agreement and the other unions who represent other hard-working public servants who are not engaged in industrial action.  There is an onus on those in this House who say that we should just support the claim being made by the nursing unions to answer the question to their constituents who work in other areas of the public service as to whether they believe they too should be treated equally in that regard.</p>  <p>  However, just because something is difficult &ndash; this is clearly a difficult situation - does not mean that we give up.  Far from it.  There have been repeated attempts to resolve this dispute, none of which have borne fruit yet, but I stress the word "yet".  I believe there are solutions to be found but it will require innovation and imagination on both sides.  On Monday, my colleague, the Minister for Finance and for Public Expenditure and Reform, and I issued a statement on the current nursing dispute.  The statement made it clear that the Government continues to be willing to engage in talks on the range of workplace-related issues to try to resolve the dispute.  The statement called for immediate engagement in the context of the current dispute with relevant unions.  Unfortunately, I regret that engagement has not taken place.  The Workplace Relations Commission remains available to facilitate all the parties in that regard.</p>  <p>  Issues of recruitment and retention in the health service, which unions have claimed are at the heart of the dispute, must be taken seriously.  We fully accept that the numbers of highly-qualified nursing, midwifery and medical professionals leaving the country is an issue that requires to be addressed.  That is why the Government engaged the Public Service Pay Commission to look at roles in the public sector where recruitment and retention had been identified as issues.  If we did not take those issues seriously, we would not have set up a specific module of the Public Service Pay Commission to examine those issues in the health service.  The commission itself features members with a wealth of experience working in trade union organisations including SIPTU, IMPACT and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU.  Nursing and midwifery were among the first of the professions investigated by the independent commission.  The commission's findings were clear and they were published and accepted in full by the Government.  The conclusion after in-depth assessment was the recruitment and retention issues were a cause of concern but that pay could not be found to be the one determining factor.  It is a complex issue with many aspects and one that requires a range of solutions.  That does not discount the equally clear actions recommended in the report that I, as Minister for Health, the HSE, and the Government are considering to improve staff retention and recruitment within the nursing and midwifery profession.</p>  <p>  In addition to the benefits nurses and midwives can expect to receive from the unwinding of pay restrictions under the pay agreement, and the correction of salary scale issues for post-2011 new entrants, the Government has agreed to the commission's recommendations of a 20% increase in local and qualification allowances for nurses, as well as accelerated promotion for staff nurses to the senior staff nurse level.  Despite the unions' recent rejection of the findings, the Government is hopeful that through further dialogue and clarification, these recommendations can be accepted and can be put into action this year for the benefit of nurses and midwives.</p>  <p>  The industrial action taken by the unions is having a significant impact on hospitals and healthcare facilities.  The decision to escalate the industrial action to include disability services was unwarranted.  The industrial action taken by the unions is impacting in a real way.  By the end of today's work stoppage more than 37,000 outpatient appointments will have been cancelled since the strike action commenced and it is expected that more than 6,000 inpatient and day-case appointments will have been cancelled.  Those are not just numbers.  Behind each case lies worry and concern for patients and their families.</p>  <p>  Looking ahead to next week, a further three days of industrial action is planned, with more cancellations needed.  In addition, the cumulative effect of the three days of industrial action will add to the stress on an already strained system.  Members should be under no illusion that this is a dangerous situation and that patients would be put at risk.</p><p>While the disruption is creating a worrying time for many people, contingency plans have been activated by the HSE to ensure urgent life-saving care is maintained throughout this industrial action.  I recognise that the unions are co-operating in terms of contingency planning in these regards.  These plans are being modified and refined daily to ensure this essential coverage is delivered during this dispute.</p> <p> I understand the strength of the unions' concerns and fully recognise that to have a first-class health service requires staff who have first-class support.  It is regrettable the unions feel that pay reforms are not coming into action quickly enough but the proposed industrial action and ongoing industrial action are not the answer.</p> <p> We are fully committed to coming to a satisfactory solution for all parties involved in accordance with the terms of the public service pay and stability agreement.  I hear many people say that the solution can be found within the agreement.  There is a duty on people to outline how exactly they would bring that solution about.  Any solution to this dispute must be affordable and fair; affordable to the taxpayer but fair to all other hard-working public servants, including nurses in other unions who are working today and who have faithfully observed the parameters of the public service pay and stability agreement.</p> <p> The stakes in this dispute are high.  I mentioned recently that this situation is like a tightrope, and it is.  The Government must maintain a responsible and prudent handling of our public finances, including public service pay, because without it, all future pay agreements may not only be at risk but may become unaffordable.  To agree to the demands of the unions as they currently stand would tilt that handling of the public finances into an unsustainable spiral.  This would damage our economy, our health service and ultimately public servants, including nurses, who we wish to support.</p> <p> It is essential that industrial action comes to a halt as soon as possible.  Our Government is sincere in its offer to want to talk and engage with nursing unions to reach a resolution to this dispute.  I am confident this can be accomplished through further dialogue and engagement.  I really hope after today's stoppage comes to an end that there is a real intensity of engagement as we work together to try to avoid further disruption.</p> <p> I am sure many of us have had the opportunity to see nurses on the picket line.  People have beeped their horns in support.  What struck me as I passed were the chants I heard, proclaiming the need for safe staffing.  While the key staff essential for running the services in the building behind them are outside on the picket line, there has to be a better way to do our business.  I believe that the better way lies in the industrial relations machinery of the State, the Workplace Relations Commission, the Labour Court and not on the picket line.  The solution will not be found here on the floor of the D&aacute;il.  The solution will be found using our industrial relations mechanism.  We want to use that mechanism.  We want to come to a solution.  We want to find an innovative solution but we also want to honour an agreement that most parties in this House claim they fully support, which is the public service pay and stability agreement, and the commitment we gave to all our public servants, including nurses and midwives, under that agreement.</p></speech>

Waiting times for CervicalCheck have jumped from two weeks to six months.  Mental health services are in crisis and chronically underfunded.  We have about half the number of consultants we need.  The costs of the national children&rsquo;s hospital have exploded threatening other healthcare projects for years to come.</p>  <p>  In this context, our healthcare professionals are at their wits&rsquo; end.  Hundreds of GPs took to the streets outside Leinster House yesterday to protest the asset stripping of general practice.  Consultant posts lie vacant around the country.  Ambulance drivers are taking strike action.  Psychiatric nurses are taking strike action.  The focus of this morning&rsquo;s session, namely, the nurses and midwives, have just commenced their third day of national strike action, only the second such action in 100 years of INMO history.  They have been calling for meaningful engagement for five years.  They want to discuss conditions, staffing levels, patient safety, cost saving opportunities, career progression and &ndash; one of the core issues of this strike &ndash; the inequitable situation where a newly-minted, honours degree educated nurse walks in the front door of a hospital on their first day of work with an allied health professional and the nurse earns &euro;6,000 to &euro;7,000 less. </p>  <p>  The Government's response to date is that it will meet the INMO so long as the issue at the centre of this strike is not discussed but, worse, the Government did not even have the courtesy to tell the INMO of its offer directly, rather it issued that offer via press release.  If anything, that action, that lack of respect, has further galvanised the tens of thousands of men and women on picket lines this morning.  The Government maintains there is no blank cheque.  They are not looking for a blank cheque; they are looking for real, respectful, open engagement.  The Government maintains it cannot engage on the issue of pay because of the public sector pay agreement but that agreement allows for these issues to be dealt where recruitment and retention has been identified as a problem.  The number of mental health nurses is falling.  The number of community nurses is falling.  Many hospitals across Ireland are struggling to hire staff nurses and have particular issues in specialties such as intensive care and emergency medicine.  That provides the space for an urgent review for nurses and midwives within the parameters of the public sector pay agreement.  The general secretary of ICTU has stated she believes the INMO issues can be addressed within the parameters of the public sector pay agreement.  </p>  <p>  We all know that these issues will be resolved sooner or later.  The question is: how much pain is the Government willing to inflict on patients, on their families and on healthcare professionals?  Not a single nurse or midwife wants to be strike today.  They are on the picket lines because they have not been listened to because they are not being respected.  </p>  <p>  The Government has a few critical days to get on top of this situation and avert strike action next week.  Our hope is that it will start taking its responsibility seriously.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-02-07a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1354" speakername="James Browne" time="10:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019020700004#B00600"><p>Today nurses and midwives are again on strike.  The Psychiatric Nurses Association is escalating its campaign, involving 6,000 psychiatric nurses and more than 37,500 whole-time equivalent nurses and midwives.  They do not want to be on strike.  Nurses want to be caring for their patients, for the sick.  What is this nurses' dispute about?  It is about a very reasonable unhappiness about their work conditions.  They have been warning the Government since 2013 about their work conditions and its impact on the risks to patients' safety.  They have many valid concerns, including overcrowding in our hospitals, which are running at 95% to 120% capacity.  They have concerns around understaffing.  They are seriously overstretched.  They are suffering from a phenomenal level of assaults; 70% of all assaults are on nurses.  Psychiatric nurses suffer a great number of assaults and that number has been increasing year on year.  There are serious issues around recruitment and retention.  There are issues around the cost of living and, of course, around pay.  They are asking a very fair question about pay, namely, why nurses are starting off on &euro;6,000 to &euro;7,000 less than equivalently qualified, allied health professionals.</p>  <p>  Nursing became an honours degree 17 years ago.  It is timely that the way they are paid, assessed, rewarded and supported is now reassessed.  This matter will be resolved, but when will the Government engage on a meaningful basis with the nurses in this country, the INMO nurses and psychiatric nurses?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-02-07a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1220" speakername="Mary Butler" time="10:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019020700004#B00700"><p>Unfortunately, for the first time since 1999, the country&rsquo;s nurses and midwives have gone on strike across the health service and in the absence of any meaningful engagement with the Government, industrial action is to be further escalated.  Today is the third full day of an INMO strike.  No nurse or midwife, whether they go into psychiatric nursing or other areas of nursing, ever trained to stand outside a hospital while there were patients inside it.  The Government should engage in good faith with the INMO and try to end the dispute once and for all.</p>  <p>  The health service is under fierce pressure.  It is absolutely creaking, even on a normal day with a full contingent of staff.  How many more patients' appointments have to be cancelled before both parties get back into the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-02-07a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1321" speakername="John Brassil" time="10:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019020700004#B00800"><p>Support for the nurses, midwives and psychiatric nurses is widespread but at this stage they are not looking for support; they want a resolution.  The only solution is to enter into meaningful talks.  We have suggested Kieran Mulvey as a mediator but somebody of that stature is needed because without meaningful negotiations, we are going nowhere.</p>  <p>  The pay issue is one element.  Stress, workplace conditions, staffing numbers, part-time versus full-time contracts, particularly for psychiatric nurses, continuing education, an accommodation allowance and so forth are all issues that have to be dealt with in this dispute.  The Government is claiming that the cost is &euro;300 million.  The INMO and the PNA say it is nowhere near that figure and that resolution can be found under existing structures.</p><p>I call on Ministers to stop pitching nurses against the rest of the public service.  I call on them to solve this issue for the nurses and to start as soon as this debate concludes today.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-02-07a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1217" speakername="Barry Cowen" time="10:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019020700005#C00200"><p>The Minister said that he is eager to come to a fair and satisfactory solution for all parties that preserves the integrity of all elements of the Public Service Stability Agreement, PSSA.  The general secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, has said that there is potential within the existing agreement that protects its integrity but also allows for a resolution to this issue.  The effort made by the Government the other evening leaves a lot to be desired, but it can correct that mistake by offering to enter into talks with no preconditions and it can allow independent arbitration on the issues referred to in clauses three and four.  At the time the agreement was put in place, it was believed by nurses that those issues would be resolved, notwithstanding the Public Service Pay Commission's recommendations.  The Minister was quick to say that the Government implemented in full the aforementioned recommendations, but he was very slow to admit that the chairperson of the commission alluded, in the report's foreword, to the fact that the commission did not have the correct analytics and statistics available to it which would allow it to make a recommendation it could stand over in terms of being the most informed one possible.  That must be acknowledged but the Minister was not too quick about saying that.</p>  <p>  The Minister spoke earlier in the week about the significant overruns on the children's hospital project, but we did not get a definition of "significant" from him.  What some nurses believe is significant is the rent they are paying or the cost of a washing machine that has to be replaced.  What is significant to some nurses and others in this country is the price of fuel in the event of a prolonged winter.  What is significant to them is &euro;300 or &euro;400.  I do not know what significant means to Fine Gael or to this Government, but it is time to get into a room and speak about it to arrive at a resolution.  Patients and the public are suffering, with 25,000 patients affected per day of strike.  Those whom I have met on the picket lines have said that when they signed up to the PSSA, there were clauses within it which they believed would address their concerns.  The Government took credit for them at the time but it cannot run away from them now.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-02-07a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1302" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="10:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019020700005#C00300"><p>As the Minister knows, I am a former trade union official and am also the daughter of a trade union official.  I have been a trade unionist all of my life and was very proud to stand on the picket line with nurses and midwives this morning at Beaumont Hospital.  They gave me a number of messages, one of which is a badge for the Minister which reads "Save Staff".  I do not imagine that the Minister is opposed to that and that is why they are on the picket lines today.  The Minister will have seen pictures of nurses and midwives in Abu Dhabi, Australia and all over the world who are asking the Minister to give them a reason to come home.  They are appealing directly to the Minister and asking him to give them a reason to come home by paying them decently.  They are asking him to stop educating nurses and midwives to work in health services elsewhere and to stop spending a fortune to supplement existing staff by paying for agency staff every single day of the week.  The agency bill is continuing to rise.  Indeed, that was one of the first issues I raised with the Minister for Health when I came into the D&aacute;il, and I have continually raised it since then because it is a waste of money to keep escalating the agency pay bill.</p>  <p>  The Minister asked what can be done and he put it to those of us on this side of the House to outline what we would do.  I have Ms Phil N&iacute; Sheaghdha's phone number in my phone and I will give it to the Minister when this debate is over.  The Minister can pick up the phone, ring her and have a conversation with her on what can be done.  He can also stop issuing press releases that are doing nothing other than getting the backs up of the men and women on the picket line.  The word used by the Minister's boss was "discourteous".  He said it was discourteous to issue a press release of that nature and not to talk to the people involved directly.  The Minister is dead right when he says that this will not be solved in here.  Any dispute in which I was involved when I was working in the union was never going to be resolved in this Chamber and we all know that.  There is very sophisticated industrial relations machinery available, but there is no point in everyone sitting around a table, looking at each other when the will is not there to resolve the dispute.</p>  <p>  The Minister can send a signal now.  He can send a signal to the third-party machinery and to the nurses, some of whom are here today and many of whom are listening or watching on the picket lines.  They want to hear what the Minister has to say, but what has he said to them?  He has said that he is terribly concerned about short staffing and patient safety, but every day of the week, nurses and midwives are cancelling procedures.  They are experts in that now.  They pick up the phone and tell people that there are not enough beds or enough staff and that their procedures are being cancelled.  Every one of us knows these people because they come to our clinics or are in our families.  We know that procedures are being cancelled every single day of the week.  The Minister's concern for patient safety in the context of a strike rings very hollow to the men and women on the picket line at the moment.  They are on strike for safe staffing levels.  The Minister must give them a reason to stay or to come home from abroad.  That is all they want.</p>  <p>  This dispute can be resolved within the confines of the PSSA.  The Minister should not take my word for it but should talk to the nurses directly.  They will tell him how it can be done.  They are out on strike for the sake of patients.  They are on strike because the health service needs more staff.  Many of those contributing to this debate today will say that nurses and midwives are only marvellous and are lovely and will ask what we would do without them.  They are workers who are on strike for decent wages.  They believe their dispute can be resolved within the context of the PSSA.  The Minister must listen to them.  He should not take my word for it but should talk to them directly.  He must stop issuing offensive press releases and pretending that he is offering talks while saying that the Government will talk about everything except pay.  That is an absolute insult.  Pay has to be central to this.  The Government did not oppose the Sinn F&eacute;in motion that was passed in this House last April, the very last line of which argued that pay must be central to the resolution of issues around recruitment and retention.  We have a recruitment and retention crisis which can be added to the list of the other crises and scandals.  The Government has an opportunity now to do the right thing.  This dispute will not be resolved in here.  Fine words from all of us will not resolve this industrial dispute.  What will resolve it is direct, face-to-face negotiations, but the political will on the part of the Government to resolve this dispute must be there.  These are workers and this is an industrial dispute.  Nurses and midwives do not want a pat on the back.  They want to be paid decent wages and they want the Minister to talk to them as professionals.</p></speech>

Unless a person has walked in their shoes, he or she can never truly understand or appreciate the dedication, hard work and humanity of those who work in the nursing profession.  Like me, I am sure most Deputies in this Chamber have reason to be grateful for the quality, strength, professionalism and compassion of our nurses.  However, nurses and midwives in our hospitals do not feel valued or respected.  They feel that they are being taken advantage of because they are caring for people.  They feel that as long as they keep doing what they are doing without complaining, the more that will be asked of them.  They should never be made to feel this way.  They deserve consideration, respect and recognition for the job they do.  It is a job that many of us could never do and they deserve proper remuneration for their incredible hard work and tireless dedication to their patients and to their profession.</p>  <p>  It is so sad and shameful that each year we lose great talent to other countries.  Across the world, hospitals in Australia, the USA, Europe and elsewhere are gaining at Ireland's expense.  How could anyone blame graduate nurses for leaving our shores for foreign lands where they will receive proper wages for the work they do?  Why should they struggle financially?  Why should they work just to survive?  Our nurses and midwives deserve better.</p><p>They deserve a living wage, not a struggling one.  It is the least we can do for those we will turn to in our hour of need.  This is their time of need.  Let us not turn our backs on them.  We and the Minister owe it to them.</p></speech>

Ba mhaith liom mo chuid taca&iacute;ochta a thabhairt do na haltra&iacute;.</p>  <p>  Last week, I joined the nurses on the picket line at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital along with an Teachta Munster and other local representatives.  Later today, I will be outside Louth County Hospital with them in Dundalk.  The nurses and midwives on the picket line do not want to be on strike.  It is clear, however, from the overwhelming public support they are receiving that the people, including patients who are being affected by the strike, do not blame the nurses.  They understand that the nurses have been badly treated by successive Governments.  They know, as everybody knows, that our health services are in crisis and they accept that this industrial action is about providing a health service fit for purpose and capable of treating patients effectively and efficiently.  They also accept that, without significant changes in pay, the core problems of recruitment and retention of staff, capacity and patient safety will not be addressed.  In these circumstances, the nursing shortage and the crisis in the health service will only get worse.</p>  <p>  The Minister must know that up to 80% of those who are leaving the profession of nursing and midwifery are resigning.  They are not retiring; there are resigning.  There are leaving the health service.  Fine Gael has almost had eight years to address the recruitment and retention crisis and it has failed.  The Minister for Health and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform are presiding over the scandal of over-expenditure at the new children's hospital.  The Taoiseach argues this is value for money.  At the same time, he rejects the demands from the nurses.  The Government has no problem with landlords, bankers and vulture funds making huge profits but it is denying nurses the modest and legitimate increase they demand.</p>  <p>  Last year, Sinn F&eacute;in introduced a Private Members' motion on the pay and recruitment of nurses and midwives.  It was passed unanimously but the recommendations were ignored.  The unions have proposed sensible, responsible solutions that, if adopted by the Government and HSE, would end the industrial action and improve conditions for staff and patients and therefore improve the health services.  They have been ignored.  It is up to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, the Minister for Health and the Taoiseach to engage with the INMO and PNA and find resolutions based on workable solutions.</p>  <p>  As for Fianna F&aacute;il, come on lads, get real.  An Teachta Martin's confidence and supply policy makes the party's protestations over Fine Gael's incompetence and arrogance, even if genuine, ring hollow.  Fianna F&aacute;il must know that Fine Gael is in government only because Fianna F&aacute;il supports it in its policies.  If Fianna F&aacute;il really supports the nurses, it should stop supporting this bad Government.</p></speech>

I do not say that in jest.  I hope he is going to take very seriously the concerns raised yesterday by the paramedics and doctors because, along with the nurses, they comprise the bedrock of our health service.  I am glad the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, is sitting beside the Minister for Health because they need to sit down and have a chat about the children's hospital also, considering that it took them and their officials so long to sit down and have a chat on day one, which is amazing.</p>  <p>  I am glad we got to debate this issue.  It is very strange there are those who did not want to debate it.  When we talk about this issue, it is important that we deal with some facts, one being that, in 2018, due to under-staffing and under-capacity, nearly 110,000 were forced to wait on trolleys and 7,000 procedures were cancelled.  Only one in every four nursing vacancies was filled.  There are almost 1,700 fewer nurses than there were a decade ago. </p>  <p>  An issue that really bugs me is the amount of money spent on agency nurses.  There will always be a role for agency nurses because gaps arise but they have now become the norm.  I am sure the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform will accept this is not an efficient way of spending money.  More money is spent because of the policy that has now become the norm.  It is continuous.  The scale shows why this issue has to be dealt with.  The costs of hiring agency staff and recruiting staff are so high that they are even adding to the problem.  When I hear it is going to cost X million euro to sort this out, I believe from the prudence perspective that the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform should consider this issue before circulating figures.  They should examine the recruitment costs, the issues related to agency staff, the issues related to comparable pay, the efficiencies that would be brought about if there were enough nurses in the first place and how stays in hospitals would be shortened because of a more efficient service.  The savings would be used to meet the requirements for which the nurses are rightly arguing.</p>  <p>  My party and I will be fully supporting the nurses and have done so.  We will be fully supporting them on Saturday on their day of protest.  They do not take this action lightly.  Members of my family are nurses.  There are very few Members in the D&aacute;il who do not have somebody in their extended family involved in the profession.  Nursing is a vocation.  We saw last night that nurses were staying on late to finish off their work.  They always work longer hours and always stay longer to hand over because it is a vocation.</p>  <p>  The nurses will continue to have public support because of the manner in which they conduct themselves, the way in which they act in their profession and the exemplary work they do.  Nursing is probably the profession that the public will stand behind most.  If the Minister believes he is going to wear down the nursing unions and public, he is completely and utterly wrong.  It is about time the Minister sat down with the nurses and engaged with them in a truthful manner.  Other Members have made reference to the manner in which he has communicated with the unions to date.  It is insulting.  Even the Taoiseach has had to apologise to this House for the manner in which the nurses have been communicated with, by press release.  It is not the way to do business and it must not continue.</p>  <p>  Instead of an elongated strike, which we all know has consequences across the health service, and instead of sitting down with the nurses in the near future, there should be an effort to compromise.  Ultimately, strikes come to an end and there will be compromise.  Since there has to be compromise of some form, why not sit down in a real fashion, get rid of all the preconditions and do everyone, including all of us, those in the Visitors Gallery, the watching public and all the nurses listening a favour and engage in proper negotiations?  Why not?  What is to be lost?  From a Government perspective, it is going to have to happen anyway.  It might as well happen now.  We are facing three days of strikes next week.  There is no reason the negotiations cannot happen now.  I just do not understand it.</p>  <p>  Let us consider some of the reasons the nurses feel the need to go on strike.  A figure that really hits me is that when nurses are leaving the profession, 60% do not do so because they are retiring; they are actually resigning.  They are leaving the profession to work in a private capacity or to do something else.  Does this not explain absolutely why there is such a genuine issue?</p><p>If one talks to nurses - this is something I see all the time in my daily work - pay is the real issue and a central component of the dispute.  In order to resolve it and deal with the issues of recruitment and retention, patient safety must ultimately be recognised as a real issue.</p> <p> I represent County Tipperary.  We have two of the most overcrowded hospitals in the country either side of where I live: South Tipperary General Hospital, as the Minister very well knows-----</p></speech>

The staff are working in environments in which they simply do not have enough space or nurses.  There are real issues in recruitment.  A range of vacancies in Limerick have not been filled.  Two weeks ago with other Oireachtas Members from County Tipperary I met management of the HSE and South Tipperary General Hospital where one of the modular units is to be built.  They told us straight up that it would not be opened within the timelines it should be opened.  There will be a nice new building, but the fact is that it cannot be opened because of the time it will take to recruit nurses.  It will take so long because it is not an attractive enough proposition and they will have to work extra hard to be able to do it.  It is in our interests to ensure the issue is dealt with quickly because the Government's capital programme is obviously now quite upset owing to the massive overspend on the children's hospital.  There are, however, quite a lot of good programmes, strategies and projects into the future, whether it be the national maternity strategy, of which I am hugely supportive, future mental health programmes or future developments across a range of other services in the acute and non-acute sectors.  The issue, though, is that, frankly, they are all a waste of time and will all go to pot, unless there are the staff in the first place to be able to implement them.</p>  <p>  There is workforce planning I hope in the public sector and the private sector to a great extent.  What workforce planning is taking place in the context of the future of the health service?  What workforce planning will be accurate and capable of implementing all of thee strategies and ensuring we will have the volume of human resources to carry out the strategies?  What workforce planning can be a vision to deal with the issue if the Government will not sit down and talk to the nurses and discuss their issues?  What does this say to them about their future?  What does it say to those who are taking four-year nursing degree programmes?  What does it say to all of the Irish nurses in Australia and all of the other countries around the world who want to come?  It says there is no plan and no vision.  The nurses will see that the Government has all of these fancy plans but no plan to ensure they will have decent careers.</p>  <p>  It is time to wake up and deal with this issue.  There is no requirement for the Government to set down preconditions.  It should treat the nurses and the public with respect.  I am not sure if Fine Gael and the Government know how to do industrial relations, but I ask them to learn quickly because I can absolutely guarantee them that the public will stay on the side of the nurses in this dispute for as long as it takes.  I urge the Government to sit down and talk to them now.  It is in its interest to do so.</p></speech>

I want to put in context the reason we are here and welcome all of the wonderful men and women who work in nursing services - in psychiatric, general nursing and midwifery - to the Visitors Gallery.  We need to put this issue in the context of the economy.  We are living in the fastest growing economy in Europe.  Personal wealth in this country has increased by &euro;300 billion in the past five years - no other country in Europe can make such a boast - yet our nurses and midwives are paid less, treated worse and understaffed compared with those in any other European economy.  This puts the issue in the context of priorities.  One of the key reasons the Government is holding out stubbornly against the will of the people, the general population, and the obvious moral case the workers have is that it does not want other workers to learn the lesson that they, too, can share in this wealth.  The wealth created on the backs of and because of the sacrifices made by workers is moving in one direction.  It is going to the wealthy; it is not being shared among wider society.  That is the agenda of the Government and it wants to maintain it.</p>  <p>  I will put another spin on the dispute which is contrary to that constantly put on it by the Government, including the Minister's latest that he had an opportunity to pass a picket this morning.  I have never crossed a picket in my life, nor have many other Deputies and Senators.  We stop and show a little solidarity.  The Minister said he heard the chant about safe staffing and thought to himself how one could have safe staffing if nurses were turning their backs on the building in which they should be working.</p></speech>

The ratio of nurses to patients is appalling.  The safe ratio is 1:4.  The real ratio in Ireland is something like 1:8 or 1:11.  That is why the nurses are taking the action they are taking.  They cannot guarantee patient safety and are sick and tired of apologising to patients and their families.  The safe ratio must be attained and the nurses' unions have given the Government a way to do so, which is to prove that where there is a safe ratio of nurses to staff, there is 50% less mortality, less risk of cross-contamination in wards, a reduction in the length of stay in hospital and people get home sooner, as a result of which the longer term care they need afterwards is also reduced.  The nurses' unions can scientifically reckon for the Minister that &euro;600 million a year would be saved by increasing the ratio to safe levels.  There is the Government's get-out clause and the reason it should pay nurses properly.</p>  <p>  Saturday will be a really important day for the general population which is behind the nurses.  RT&Eacute; cannot find a single voice to say they do not support them.  At 12.30 p.m., at Parnell Square, the entire population who can do so needs to be there to support the nurses.</p></speech>

That is the message I received from the nurses outside today and those on the picket lines every day.  They are sick of hearing the Ministers say they are on salaries of &euro;57,000 and that there is no retention or recruitment problem.  It is nonsense.  There are unsafe levels of staffing in hospitals.  A psychiatric nurse who is married to a midwife was at our public meeting last night.  He is at the top of the scale and earning &euro;47,000.  He had worked through the night and then gone home, having been up for 36 hours, because his wife had to go to work, while he minded the children and took them to school.  He must take his annual holidays to mind the kids, such are his hours, including overtime, and those of his wife and they have nothing.  The Government should, therefore, stop the spin and admit the truth.  We have a problem.  The country is haemorrhaging young nurses because they do not want to work in unsafe hospitals or take responsibility for doing so and they are being paid an absolute pittance.  That is the reality.  Therefore, the Government should admit the truth and talk to them.  Phil N&iacute; Sheaghdha and Peter Hughes are in the Visitors Gallery.  Why do the Ministers not toddle up after this debate and talk to them and actually listen to the reasons they are on strike?  If they will not listen, I hope on Saturday the public will come out in their tens of thousands to fight, not just for the nurses but also for the future of the public health service in order to make the Ministers listen.  Eventually they will have to do so.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-02-07a.34" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1433" speakername="Paul Murphy" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019020700007#E01000"><p>Two placards held by young nurses on the picket line in Tallaght on Tuesday morning summed up a very important aspect of this dispute.  One read, "I am not striking for the good of my health; I am striking for the good of yours."  Another was a message to the Ministers: "Pay your nurses as if your life depends on it."  These messages highlight that it is patient safety that has suffered first and foremost as a result of the chronic underfunding of the health service under successive Governments.  A key part of resolving the dispute is paying staff properly and fairly in order to recruit and retain nurses.</p>  <p>  I thought the Minister's move on Monday night, in offering negotiations to the media, not the INMO, was breathtaking in its cynicism, not only because of whom the message was directed at but also because of it what was.</p><p>Crucially, the message was not about discussing the central issue of pay but instead was transparently about trying to shame the nurses for seeking pay rises and pay parity.  It is the Government which should be utterly ashamed of its behaviour in this dispute and nurses should be unashamed in seeking pay parity.  Broadly, working-class people - ordinary people - support the demand for pay parity from nurses because other workers are also experiencing the massive cost of living rises, in particular the cost of accommodation, and also want to have a raise.  They rightly see that a victory for nurses is a victory for all workers.  The power of that support and solidarity was brought home to me on the picket line on James's Street when firefighters came along with soup to support the nurses and were met with hugs and applause from them.  That solidarity and support makes them very strong and means they can achieve a victory in this strike.</p> <p> The final point is in response to the question on where the money will come from.  How about the &euro;250 million spent in nine months last year on agency nurses driving a process of privatisation?  How about the &euro;270 million paid to Anglo junior bondholders, supposedly burnt, before Christmas?  How about the &euro;80 billion held by the richest 300 people?  There is plenty of money available.  The question is whether it is used to enrich the super-rich even further, to entrench inequality, to build a two-tier privatised health service, or to pay a decent wage and build a national health service that we need.</p></speech>

It is a battle I believe they cannot win.  Senators Colm Burke and Buttimer expressed concern at their parliamentary party meeting last night that Fine Gael could be hit hard in May over this issue.  Their nervousness is entirely justified.</p>  <p>  Our message to the public is to stick firm with the nurses and remember who is really responsible for disruption in the health service.  Our message to the D&aacute;il is that next Wednesday afternoon, Solidarity-People Before Profit will bring a motion before the House demanding that the Government pays the nurses.  We have head the fine words today.  Let us see the actions and have parties that have spoken for the nurses vote for that motion next Wednesday.</p>  <p>  Our message to the nurses is to keep their nerve, keep up the pressure and remember that striking workers never won anything in negotiation that was not first won on the picket lines.  They should step up the pressure on the picket lines, and they can win.</p>  <p>  Our message to the trade union movement is that the nurses must not be left to stand and fight alone.  The entire trade union movement should use the next 48 hours to mobilise the maximum number of people possible to rally with the nurses in Dublin this Saturday.  Moreover, other public sector unions should now open up a second front against Government pay policy.  This means balloting for industrial action to reverse completely the cuts in pay imposed in the austerity years, including the question of two-tier pay for new entrants.  The workers united will never be defeated.  Victory to the nurses.  Victory to the midwives.</p></speech>

I want to counteract the nonsense the Government is putting out that staffing levels are okay and that there is no issue with recruitment and retention.  The INMO has shown that there are 103 fewer staff nurses employed today than were employed in December 2007 and that there are 1,650 fewer nurses and midwives today than there were in 2007.  The INMO has informed us that hospitals are unable to recruit midwifery staff to match the recommended level of staff midwives to birth ratio.</p>  <p>  The PNA has said that, according to figures it has got, there is a 40% vacancy rate in psychiatric nursing.  At the same time, the INMO has figures to the effect that the HSE is paying out &euro;1.4 million a week in agency nursing costs.  In terms of psychiatric nursing, in 2013, &euro;14.3 million was spent on agency nursing.  That had increased to &euro;53 million in 2017.  That is the scandal we are facing as a public in respect of the way our health service is being run.</p>  <p>  The irony is unbelievable regarding the use of agency staff.  The HSE is paying agency nurses 20% more than the nurses they work beside in our hospitals.  So much for equal pay for work of equal value in that regard.</p>  <p>  Those figures came from a response to a parliamentary question tabled last year.  The HSE, in response, stated that this expenditure should be considered in the overall context, including increasing demand for services - absolutely - the impact of earlier constraints on recruitment in the public service - absolutely - and ongoing challenges in regard to recruitment and retention of clinical staff.</p>  <p>  The HSE is admitting there is a problem with recruitment and retention but why is the Minister not admitting it is a major problem and has to be dealt with?  Nurses are leaving their jobs and the country to go to Australia or Canada, private hospitals and agencies.  That is the reality.</p>  <p>  The Government says the nurses have to be responsible and that it cannot afford to pay &euro;300 million out of a &euro;17 billion health budget or on the back of all the other issues on which money can be wasted.  It should think about this.  It can afford to pay the &euro;450 million or &euro;700 million, with contractors breaking tenders, in respect of the children's hospital.  As reported in the news the other day, it can afford to allow the Department of Justice and Equality pay &euro;1,000 per week on taxis.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade can afford to pay &euro;1,000 per day on taxis.  Is that a responsible Government?</p>  <p>  What is really offensive is that Deputies on the Government side of the House who are telling nurses and midwives to be responsible pocketed &euro;7,800 in the past two years as a result of the reversal of the financial emergency measures in the public interest pay cuts from January 2017.  I did not take it because of what is happening here today and to support teachers and others in respect of equality of pay.  I gifted back the money.  These are the same people who are telling nurses to get off the picket line and not turn their backs on their patients in the hospitals.</p>  <p>  I heard reports on the radio this morning that patients are at risk.  Patients are at risk every single day of the year.  These nurses are out on the picket line because they will not stand over continuing that risk to patient safety.</p>  <p>  There is a way for the Minister to resolve this dispute.  There is a section in the public sector pay agreement which provides for a review of recruitment and retention.  Why will the Minister not look at public sector pay, offer a substantial down payment to start the talks and then go into negotiations on reviewing it?</p>  <p>  Irish nurses across the world are in solidarity with this action.  They are asking the Government to give them a reason to come home.  I ask the Minister to give them a reason to come home and come out on Saturday at 12.30 p.m. to support nurses, midwives, psychiatric nurses and GPs who are saying that the system is in crisis, that it is crippling, and that it has to be dealt with.  Will the Minister respond to that request and, following these statements, talk to Phil N&iacute; Sheaghdha, Peter Hughes and those who can make the difference?  If he does not do that, patient safety will be on his head.</p></speech>

They are caught between a rock and a hard place.  In terms of the reason for that, there has been a rise in inequality in most of the developed world in recent years and the problem has grown.  They will not solve the nurses' recruitment and retention issue.  Unless they pay them better, it will remain a problem.  It will not go away.  They will most likely continue to strike until they get what they see is a fair wage.</p>  <p>  The Government says it cannot break the public sector pay agreement, and that is understandable, but it will have to break it.  Does that mean that more claims and strikes will follow by other people who believe they should be paid more?  It is a huge problem but, truth be told, other sectors too are probably struggling to make ends meet.</p>  <p>  I do not expect the Ministers to solve the problem overnight, but it is a fact that in the 1980s a person could buy a house in this town for three times his or her wages.  People would need nine times their wage to buy one now.</p><p>That is a big problem, as is the cost of rent.  Nurses and other people are struggling to make ends meet.  Contrast is a significant issue.  We all look at what others have and what is happening in other areas.  That can be very annoying.  The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, knows that I have been raising the issue of the loss of money in NAMA for many years.  I genuinely believe that had things been done differently, up to &euro;20 billion could have been saved.  I have probably looked under the covers in regard to NAMA more than most.  It is a significant problem and the nurses see that.</p> <p> The situation regarding the children's hospital is nuts.  I do not know why BAM was considered for the project.  BAM delayed the development of Grangegorman by over two years at great cost to the State because it did not get the job.  It was contracted to carry out a job in Cork port and after it was given the tender it sought an extra &euro;11 million, claiming it had made a mistake in the tender.  It went to court to dispute the matter.  Why was it put on a tender list?  The price for the hospital is too high.  I have looked at it from a construction point of view and approximately 30% of the overall cost is fluff.  It is a joke.  BAM is conning the State.  It is a scam.  How does one deal with it?  Who analysed the increased costs?  Did someone go through it line by line to assess from where all the extra costs came?  I would love to see and analyse a full breakdown of all the extra costs.  PwC, which has done plenty of work for BAM through the years, is not the right entity to analyse it.  Is anybody from the construction sector looking at it?  That is where the extra costs arise.  We seem to almost turn a blind eye to these crazy prices that come in.  Tenderers seem to think that if a project is for the State, the costs will not be analysed and they will get away with things.  I will tell the House a very quick story.</p></speech>

The tenders had to be submitted by 5 p.m. on a Friday.  A week beforehand, one of the builders rang the other three and proposed a meeting.  They were aware of the identities of the other tenderers.  At the meeting, a deal was proposed whereby they would meet five hours before the tenders were due to be submitted and open the tenders, with the second-lowest tender getting the job and the lowest tenderer revising its price.  It drove the price of the job up by approximately &euro;2.5 million.  It was a relatively big job for a private entity.  The company carried out an investigation to find out why the cost was so high.  It found out what had occurred and threw the four builders out.  I would throw BAM out.  Yesterday, Professor Jimmy Sheehan spoke at the briefing organised by Deputy Mattie McGrath in the audiovisual room.  He made a lot of sense.  Connolly hospital should be reconsidered as a location for the hospital.  As a builder, I know that if the Government persists with the development of the children's hospital on the site of St. James's Hospital-----</p></speech>

All outpatient, inpatient and day surgery appointments for today have been cancelled.  Other planned admissions including respite care and rehabilitation to community nursing units, including for people with intellectual disabilities, have been cancelled.  Vulnerable people are losing out.  The Government must engage with the nurses.  All I hear from the Government is that it is disappointed that further strike action by the INMO is going ahead but the strike will be sorted out.  The INMO stated that it is disappointed that the Government will not discuss nurses' pay.  The Ministers, Deputies Donohoe and Harris, need to realise these are serious problems.  They say the Government has no money but the INMO says that nurses need more pay.  I ask them to please engage.  They should meet the INMO today because the vulnerable people in Ireland who have been waiting a long time for services are not receiving them.</p></speech>

The Minister, Deputy Harris, must engage with the INMO in a constructive and meaningful manner.  The ongoing issues of pay inequality, staffing levels and poor working conditions have been in existence for some time.  We can no longer afford to lose our newly qualified nurses to other countries where they get respect.  I met nurses on the picket line outside the Midland Regional Hospital, Tullamore last week.  They are frustrated and fed up with their working conditions.  They are pulled from one section of the hospital to another because of understaffing.  That is unfair on front-line workers and their health, as well as on patients.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, needs to take action.  It is appalling that the Taoiseach worked in the health service and saw how bad things were, yet he presides over this crisis.  These nurses are working in a health service which, like the Government, is not fit for purpose.</p></speech>

I have tried to constructively engage with them on health reform.  This issue crystallises into health reform.  It arises from issues of recruitment, retention and pay.  It is also about health reform and recruiting and retaining nurses to deliver a proper level of care to our patients.  The health service is about delivering care to patients.  Unless nurses are properly paid and their frustrations and  dissatisfaction with their working conditions recognised, we will not have nurses to work in our health system.  The strike indicates a failure to anticipate that and deal with nurses' frustrations.  It should not have come to a strike situation.  There has not been meaningful engagement.  The Minister attends the annual general meetings of nurses, GPs and consultants and makes promises but he never follows up on them.  He has committed to developing many reforms in our health service but none of them have been implemented or followed through.  An Oireachtas committee spent a year developing Sl&aacute;intecare and discussing health reform, how important it is to deliver primary and hospital care service and how to spend our money more efficiently.  It is about value for money.  Unless we reform our health service, the Government will spend a fortune on the health service in years to come.  One must anticipate, plan and reform.  This has crystallised into a strike which should never have happened.</p></speech>

They are the angels of mercy.  They work very hard in conditions so unbearable that they are fleeing the system and country.  Many have become ill.  However, the Government does not respect them, this House or the electorate.  If it did, the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, would have left his position long ago.</p>  <p>  I refer to the appalling vista of the children's hospital which is being built in the wrong place, with no co-located maternity hospital and without a helipad.  It is a black hole.  The Minister, Deputy Harris should see what is at the bottom of the hole.  I am told that the concrete base of the hospital is floating.  There are issues with drains and open sewers which must be relocated.  It is a mess and the Government is digging itself a bigger hole.  The Minister has arrogantly attacked the nurses by threatening to dock their pay if they go on strike.  However, no pay was docked from anyone involved with the children's hospital.  Consultants were paid &euro;80 million to design a mess.  The project went out to tender with BAM without a bill of quantities.  It is an unmitigated mess.  The Minister is incapable of running the HSE.  He would not be able to run a sweet shop such as the one that existed in front of Leinster House in the days before the Minister came to the House.  If they had any manners or respect, he, the Minister, Deputy Donohoe and the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, would get a guided tour of the hole that is the site for the children's hospital.  With a bit of luck, someone would ensure they stayed in the hole.  We would have an election and get rid of them.  People such as nurses and other healthcare professionals could then get a modicum of respect.  I am an employer.  One must respect one's staff.   The Minister, Deputy Harris, does not respect his staff.</p><p>He does not respect this House and the Members here.  He does not respect the electorate.  He has no respect for anyone only himself, looking in the mirror.  How does he sleep in bed at night with the way he treats people in this country and the shameless way he allows this gigantic overrun?  He can smile away if he likes.  He will go down in history as the worst, most incompetent and useless Minister for Health that ever sat in this Chamber.  It is despicable.  If he had any modicum of respect, he would be gone long ago, and to hell with his cabal of a Cabinet as well.  He has a Dublin trio with him - the Taoiseach and the Ministers Murphy and Donohoe.  They care nothing about Ireland.</p></speech>

All our young nurses are going abroad and, at the same time, we cannot attract nurses to open the other beds in Kenmare Community Hospital.  I saw the determination in the nurses' faces last Tuesday in Killarney and Tralee, where I was with them in the pouring rain.  The Government promised them that when the country was turned around, it would restore their pay.</p>  <p>  Just a week ago, the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, sat there and said he was going to put billions into a rainy day fund.  If he has the money to put into a rainy day fund to save the banks or bail out the banks at a future date, he must pay the nurses first and he must pay the people as he promised he would do - he must pay them first.  He must get talking around the table with these nurses' organisations with no preconditions, please.</p>  <p>  As I said, we need to protect nurses' safety and patient safety, which is at risk due to not having enough nurses and enough protection in our hospitals for them.  It was sad to see the state of one girl who will never again be able to work after what happened her in one of our hospitals.  I appeal to the Government to get around the table without any preconditions.</p>  <p>  We have highly trained young nurses going abroad.  Why is that happening?  It is clear they are not getting the right opportunities and that they are being treated better abroad.  The Government must address this issue or it may bring it down.</p></speech>

The Government is mismanaging it.  If we look at what it is paying agency nurses and agency staff, it does not make sense.  There is total disregard when it comes to politics.  How inexperienced and silly a thing could the Government have done last week to send out a press release from both senior Ministers, the Minister for Health and the Minister for Finance, telling nurses they will sit down with them all right, but one of the conditions is that what they are talking about - pay - will not be on the table at all, that they will discuss other work conditions and everything else, but they will not discuss what the nurses want to discuss?  That is what they are protesting about - getting a thing called fair play.</p>  <p>  I can only talk with sure knowledge of County Kerry.  I walked with the nurses from accident and emergency the last time they protested, when they explained in great detail to me the worry they have about their safety because of lack of numbers.  They are really under pressure.  I have been inside accident and emergency units in Limerick, Kerry and Cork during the middle of the night.  I have seen at weekends how busy and how pressurised it can be.  These are the people we rely on in emergency situations, whether dealing with older people, children or middle aged people.  They are the people who, when their eyes are closing are damn glad to see a nurse looking down at them when their eyes open again.  All I am saying is, for God's sake, wake up to this problem.  It is not going to go away.  Every Member here has a uniformity of purpose, and that is to demand this from the Ministers for Health and Finance.</p>  <p>  It is true what my brother said about a bloody rainy day fund.  It is pouring down on top of the Government now.  Take the money out, if they have it for a rainy day fund, and give it to the nurses.</p></speech>

There are undoubted serious shortages within nursing and, of course, there is then a vicious cycle because, when there are shortages, it means those who are left to carry the can within our health service are carrying a heavier burden, and stress levels increase as a result.  We also know that, in many cases, we are at a point where services are unsafe as a result of staff shortages.</p>  <p>  That scenario is having a very serious impact on the operation of our health services as they stand.  We have been talking for a long time about the need for reform of our health services and to switch to putting the focus on primary care to ensure that nurses' roles are expanded and that they play a key role in regard to, for example, chronic illness management, child health programmes, the maternity programme and all of those different reform plans, such as Sl&aacute;intecare.  All of those plans are predicated on a situation where we have an ample supply of nurses who are well resourced and well motivated.  However, we are not going to have that unless the Government responds to the current crisis.</p>  <p>  Nurses are going abroad.  They are voting with their feet.  They are going to places where they are valued and respected, and where they can live a life that is affordable.  They are living in countries and cities around the world where there is an affordable cost of living, unlike this country.  They are also going to places where there is a very clear policy context and they are not working in a system where, every time there is a new Minister, there is a new policy and everything is thrown up in the air.  That is what people working in the health service have experienced over recent years in this country.</p>  <p>  The evidence in regard to the shortage of nurses is stark.  For every four vacancies, there is only one application.  The HSE is spending &euro;2 million a week on agency nurses and we also know the HSE is travelling the world, paying very high recruitment charges, to try to attract Irish nurses back to Ireland but also nurses from developing countries.  We know that is the case and the figures from the HSE prove it.  We also know the HSE made that very clear when it stated: "The overall picture of the nursing and midwifery workforce is one of a constant challenge to effectively recruit and retain to meet ever increasing service demands."  I hope the Minister for Finance has heard that statement, which the HSE made to the Public Service Pay Commission.  Unfortunately, it did not get to the Public Service Pay Commission because the Minister's Department, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, insisted on that statement being excised from the HSE's submission.  I would like him to explain that.</p>  <p>  There are also, of course, genuine issues of fairness when it comes to pay parity.  Nurses are required to have the same academic qualifications as allied health professionals yet, at every point in the scale, they lag behind by about &euro;7,000, which is inexcusable.</p>  <p>  There is strong public support for nurses.  The public simply cannot understand why the Government will not engage in a positive and constructive manner in this dispute.  The question to both Ministers is what are they going to do about this.  We cannot afford a situation where the industrial action escalates even further.  This is taking its toll on patients, undoubtedly.  What we need now is leadership from Government in terms of taking an initiative in order to free up the logjam that exists; what we need is constructive engagement.  What the Ministers are doing is adding fuel to the fire.  They have been entirely unhelpful in their response to this.  Their actions have been provocative and they have fuelled the fire.  What we want from them is action.  We know that, under clause 4 of the pay agreement, there is provision for engagement in regard to areas where there are serious problems with recruitment and retention.  They should stop the megaphone diplomacy.  From Patricia King down, everybody has said it is possible to resolve this dispute within the context of the existing agreement.  What we want now is leadership from Government.  It should take action over this weekend to ensure we avoid what is likely to happen next week in terms of a crisis in our health service for everybody concerned.</p></speech>

I was a member of the Irish Transport and General Workers Union, the Federation of Rural Workers, the Amalgamated Transport and General Workers Union and the Irish Local Government Officials Union, now called F&oacute;rsa.  I have represented that union at national level and been president of the Clonmel Trades and Labour Council.  I have been on the picket line with nurses at South Tipperary General Hospital and Nenagh General Hospital in the past two weeks.  I fully support their claims and believe the industrial action they are taking is fully justified.  It is about fair pay and conditions of employment, but it is also about safe staffing levels, the safety of patients and the provision of a quality health service.</p>  <p>  The Government spin against the nurses is shameful.  Everybody in this House, including the Minister, knows that the health service is in a shambles.  They know that patient safety is at risk every day.  Cancellations occur every day of the year.  A colleague of mine had his cardiac bypass surgery cancelled on two occasions.  Having worked 21 years at South Tipperary General Hospital, I know the pressure nurses and staff are under.  The hospital works at 125% capacity, when normal capacity should be in the region of 85%.  It has one of the highest trolley counts in the country.  Mental health services are understaffed and under-resourced.  The acute inpatient service is non-existent, having been closed by Fine Gael and the Labour Party in the last Government.  The pay agreement cited by the Government does not represent a pay increase.  It is a pay restoration agreement which does not even fully restore pay to the previous levels.  I believe public representatives should support the nurses.  One thing we can do is call on all of our supporters to be at the Garden of Remembrance next Saturday at 12.30 p.m. to support the demonstration called by the nurses.</p>  <p>  I believe nurses are fighting a battle to establish and restore a civilised society in Ireland.  They are fighting to ensure all Irish people will have adequate and effective healthcare.  More than that, they are fighting for priority to be given to caring human values over the greed of the super-rich.  It is the greed of the super-rich and the feeding of that greed which are the driving principles of the Government, not just its Fine Gael component.  The Taoiseach told us that the Government would have to borrow money to meet the claims of the nurses.  That statement is shamefully and demonstrably untrue.  Anybody who doubts it might read the 2019 report of Social Justice Ireland which was published recently.  The Government states meeting the nurses' claims would cost &euro;300 million per year.  The unions dispute this and point out that many of the resources required could be found by reducing the dependence on agency nursing.  Even if the Government's claim was correct, the amount of money is minuscule compared to the untaxed, massive and growing wealth of the Irish super rich.  The Minister and the Government need to make the super rich pay their fair share of taxation.  There is massive wealth in the country and a disproportionate share is owned by the super rich.  According to the Central Statistics Office, there are 25,700 individuals who earn between &euro;200,000 and &euro;2 million per year.  In the last budget not only were no additional taxes placed on them but the Minister for Finance gave them tax relief, as he had done in the previous two budgets.  The money is available to resolve the dispute.  The Government simply has to address the very wealthy people who have billions of euro above the peak boom levels in 2007 and 2008.  The Minister should resolve the dispute by acceding to the requests of the nurses.  The Government should resign and allow the people to make a decision on what will happen in the future.</p></speech>

Deputies Rabbitte, McGuinness and Breathnach will then ask questions.  We will ask all of the questions at the same time and then perhaps receive responses.</p>  <p>  Does the Minister accept that there is genuine pay inequality between new entrant nurses and new entrant allied health professionals?  Does he accept that the issues surrounding the strike and this pay inequality can be accommodated within the public service stability agreement?  Does he accept that there is a recruitment and retention issue?  Does he stand by previous statements he made in this House, in which he described recruitment and retention in nursing as a crisis?  Does he accept that there are numerous cost savings which could be identified and secured in the context of better and safer staffing ratios, as identified in the pilot projects last year?</p></speech>

Does it accept that without pay on the negotiating table, this dispute cannot be resolved?  Will the Ministers commit to making a telephone call because it is very easy to come in here and talk about patient safety?  By the way, the Government's record on patient safety speaks for itself given waiting lists and every other issue, and the people in the Public Gallery know that.  Will the Ministers give a commitment to pick up the phone to have a meaningful dialogue with Peter Hughes and Phil N&iacute; Sheaghdha to ensure that this matter can be resolved because nothing is more certain than the fact that this will be resolved?  No dispute goes on forever.  Will the Ministers commit to picking up the telephone and talking to them?  There is no sense in us coming in here and talking about this clause and that clause.  I can go through that Public Service Stability Agreement with the Ministers and tell them where it can be resolved but the Ministers should talk to the people in the dispute instead of talking at them.  Will the Ministers apologise for issuing that disrespectful press release that was patronising in tone and very disrespectful to the men and women who are on the picket line, not because they want to be but because the Ministers forced them to?</p></speech>

We will only do it through intense engagement, which I hope can start imminently and that everybody can put their shoulder to the wheel.  I hope we use the industrial relations mechanism that is available to us.</p>  <p>  Regarding the statement issued the other day, it was never intended that people would find out through the media.

What we were doing was done in light of the fact that questions were being asked about whether we would engage with the WRC.  We were indicating our willingness to do so.  As the Minister for Health said, nobody in this House has a monopoly when it comes to respecting the fact that nursing is not only a vocation but a highly skilled profession, but it is only appropriate that all who comment on and participate in this issue know that at that point, we were, and still are, willing to engage in the WRC.</p></speech>

What he said goes to the heart of this dispute.  He said that the commission found that pay was not found to be one of the determining factors.  Does he believe this anymore because pay, retention and respect for nursing staff are at the heart of this dispute?  We could have a three-day dispute in our hospitals next week that will cause untold damage to the Government and the people who use the health service.  This is about pay.  The Government needs to recognise that if it does not pay the nurses, that decision will come back to haunt it, so it cannot afford not to pay the nurses.  Does the Minister still believe what the Public Service Pay Commission said?  Is this not about pay?</p></speech>

Does the Minister for Health accept that we have unsafe staffing levels in our hospitals?  We should have a ratio of 1:4 but it is more like 1:8 or 1:11.

Will the Minister comment on that and give us an indication as to whether that is possible?  The Minister says he will not talk about pay but he has shifted because in the weeks leading up to the dispute, he would only send the HSE to the WRC to talk to the unions.  He is now saying that he will talk to them.  When we shout outside on the picket lines, we say "open your purses and pay the nurses."  The Minister has the purse, which is full.  He can find money for military spending, to bail out bankers, pay off bond holders and do many other things, including the Government's bid to win a seat at the UN Security Council on which &euro;500,000 has been spent.  I ask him to open the purse and think creatively about how he can pay the nurses and make the savings when he employs the staff who are required.</p></speech>

With regard to the question from Deputy Gino Kenny, I still accept and stand by the analysis and recommendations offered by the Public Service Pay Commission.  It is independent in composition.  Recommendations came from the commission that acknowledged that targeted changes could be made, particularly with regard to allowances that at that point were unlikely to trigger any competing claims from elsewhere in our public service, so I still accept, stand by and believe in that piece of work.  I accept the analysis that was offered.</p>  <p>  In respect of Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith's point about our willingness to engage, especially from the middle to the latter phase, my Department has been present in the engagements along with representatives of the Minister for Health.  If we do find a way, which the Minister for Health and I are committed to doing, of moving beyond where we are at the moment, that will continue to be the case.</p></speech>

The Deputies are right.  We have agreed a task force on safe staffing and skill mix, which the unions have accepted, which is the framework and Government policy and which has a scientific and evidence base behind how many nurses and other skills are needed on each ward.  We have rolled that out to a number of wards and hospitals.  There is room to do more in this regard.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and I have been very clear in our utterances in recent days.  These are the sorts of discussions we want to be having with nursing unions through intensive engagement using the industrial relations mechanisms.</p></speech>

The Minister, Deputy Harris, said in his speech that he fully accepted the number of highly-qualified nursing, midwifery and medical professionals leaving the country is an issue that should be thoroughly investigated.  Why is it that it only should be thoroughly investigated now?  This has been going on for years.  The Government and previous Governments have known about it yet it still has not been investigated.  I want to know why, because I think that is wrong.</p>  <p>  I note what was said in terms of the contributions and responses around the negotiations.  Why has it not happened?  Why has the Minister not opened up the negotiations at this stage?  </p></speech>

Is it not true that the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, met the commission on 26 October and instructed it to the effect that this was not and could not be a pay review?  Will the Ministers accept at this stage that this problem will not be sorted without paying the nurses more money?</p></speech>

We established the Public Service Pay Commission specifically to examine what could be done on recruitment and retention.  We specifically asked an independent body with union representation from ICTU, IMPACT and SIPTU former personnel to examine that issue.  We have also tried a number of other initiatives, including offering all graduating student nurses full-time contracts.  Clearly, there is more to do.  Let there be no misunderstanding, we want to have that conversation to resolve the dispute.</p></speech>

On Deputy Pringle's point regarding engagement to date, there has been engagement to date.  The Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court have been involved.  It is obvious that engagement did not yield outcomes that were satisfactory to those who represent nurses as otherwise we would not be in this situation.  Engagement has taken place.  Preceding that, there was the process of the Public Service Pay Commission which went on for the best part of a year in terms of analysis of the issue and recommendations.  The commission went through a formidable analysis, which was far from easy, to make the recommendations it made.</p>  <p>  On Deputy Wallace's questions, the Deputy is correct that I did meet the Public Service Pay Commission.  My understanding is that all other participants and stakeholders in this process also met and made submissions to the commission.</p></speech>

On Deputy Wallace's point on pay, one of the challenges we face is that the Public Service Pay Commission did issue recommendations in regard to pay for which, in my appraisal at the time, the rest of the union movement would have understood the need.  We could have implemented them in such a way that would have allowed us to avoid the vista of knock-on claims elsewhere.  In fairness to Deputy Wallace, he is the only speaker in this debate who acknowledged what that risk is, what would be the challenges for the Government in respect of how we manage pay in this country and what that could mean for everything else.</p></speech>

Of course, we do.  It is insulting to suggest otherwise on the part of any member of the Government.  The challenge we face, which Deputy Mattie McGrath has no interest in acknowledging, is there are many other public servants whose work we also respect - over 290,000 of them.  If we make any one movement in this wage agreement for one group, it has immediate consequences for every other group, which Deputy Mattie McGrath has no interest in acknowledging, although I know he understands it.</p></speech>

The simple answer is that we will get into another difficulty in the future because we are an open economy and a huge amount is happening in the world at the moment, as the Deputy knows.  Our debt levels, on our emergence from the most recent crisis, are far higher than when we into the times of difficulty we are trying to put behind us.  Our difficulties will be even greater if we do not have some reserves available to deal with whatever shock the rest of the world might throw at Ireland in the future.</p> <p> I understand that is a tough argument to say we need to be better prepared for the future when we face challenges now but it is still the right solution for our country in the long run.</p></speech>

I am the daughter of a midwife and the sister of a neonatal nurse and am acutely aware of the incredible work nurses do.  I was delighted to join them on the picket line in Tallaght today because the work they do is among the toughest and most vitally important work undertaken by any group of people in this country.  They undertake that work day in and day out.</p>  <p>  Does the Minister accept that not being able to find adequate numbers to work in the nursing profession presents an overarching health and safety concern, a crisis and an emergency?  Why would one continue to work in a system in which pay is too low, conditions are in need of vast improvement and, crucially, there is no sign of change?  That is the situation nurses face.</p>  <p>  Our nurses are second to none but the system is failing them and their patients.  It is primarily a matter of pay, justice, fairness and equity.  Pay is at the heart of this dispute and for Government to make an abysmal offer through the media to settle the pay dispute by excluding pay from negotiations is inflammatory, idiotic and insulting.  It shows grossly poor judgment and a worrying absence of any understanding of the plight of nurses and midwives.  Will the Minister admit that statement was insulting and wrong and apologise for it?  Will he commit to engaging, in a meaningful way, with the general secretary of the nurses' union?</p></speech>

For the sake of patients, staff and the Government, the sooner that happens the better.  The Ministers said earlier that they are prepared to engage.  Both the Minister for Health and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform need to send a clear signal that employers will engage in an honest endeavour on this and there will be no preconditions on negotiations.  Everything must be on the table.  It will be sorted out around the table, sooner or later, but the Government must give a clear signal and make a clear statement this morning that everything will be on the table and there will be no preconditions.</p></speech>

Figures developed by the HSE and the Department of Health that have been shared with us make the point that, over the past number of years, 3,876 more nurses and midwives have been recruited.  That change has happened.  A report of the Public Service Pay Commission makes the point that turnover rates within that workforce at the moment, excluding retirees, stand at 5%.  That figure is 6.8% including retirees.  That is the other side of the figures that were put to me.</p>  <p>  This also applies in answer to the question of Deputy Shortall.  We are willing to engage in the machinery of the State, whether the Labour Court or the Workplace Relations Commission, but we need to adhere to the key condition of preserving the overall agreement that is in place.</p></speech>

A number of speakers have asserted that we do not have wage restoration or wage growth in place.  The agreement, as negotiated at the moment, provides that anybody earning below &euro;35,000 will see wage increases, as they should and deserve.  The agreement ensures, contrary to the claims of some, that anybody earning less than &euro;50,000 will have their wages fully restored by 2019.  The current wage agreement ensures that anybody earning less than &euro;70,000 will have their overall wages restored to &euro;70,000 by the end of 2020.  </p>  <p>  Claims that we are not budgeting for, or implementing, wage restoration or wage growth for some people are not true.  It is happening.  It is under way and part of the current wage agreement.</p>  <p>  On the questions that have been put to us about new entrant pay and our response to challenges, the current wage agreement contains provisions to ensure that anybody participating in that agreement could benefit from up to &euro;3,000 from the concluded negotiations with the Public Service Pay Commission of ICTU.  I have heard repeated claims this morning that we do not have agreements in place to tackle wage restoration, but we do, for low and middle-income workers.  The agreement we have in place makes provision for dealing with the issue of new entrants' pay.</p>  <p>  A charge and claim has been made and repeated by Deputies that there are four vacancies for every one applicant for nursing jobs.  That is a figure we have often heard.  That figure is based on an article from April 2017 that, in turn, had its origin in the Global Jobs website.  The figures from the Public Service Pay Commission showed that, on average, there are 1.86 applicants for every place on a recruitment panel.  Those are people who want to work in our public services and gain work there.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, and I have acknowledged in our contributions that, in addition to emphasising the understanding and respect we have for all who work in our public services, particularly our health services, we have also looked to sketch the competing claims we have and challenges we face.  The following is a core point for Government in its response to these issues.  It is not clear to me how, were this collective wage agreement to come to a disorderly end, we would be able to negotiate another to take its place.  That has consequences for our public servants, how we pay for them and how we ensure they get the wages they deserve and are entitled to in the future.</p>  <p>  I make the point to my Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues that it was their efforts and leadership at another point of great change in our economy that showed how collective wage agreements could play an essential part in how we manage wage pressure and ensure public servants are paid fairly. </p><p>A positive legacy of Fianna F&aacute;il Governments is that they showed in collective wage agreements we could pay people by reference to what they earned as opposed to the leverage they had.  They showed how that approach could be made to work.</p></speech>

We have just finished a debate in which the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, discussed the need for fiscal stability in the context of wage agreements.  Everyone agrees with that, but it is very difficult to take that lecture, given what is happening with the national children's hospital project.  There was no worry about fiscal stability and taking responsibility or control during that debacle.  For the thousands of nurses who are on the picket line for a third day, patients and psychiatric nurses who are subject to an overtime ban, it is very difficult to listen to lectures, in the light of the information that is continuing to come out on the goings on in the context of the cost overrun on the national children's hospital.  Within the past few minutes Jennifer Bray has released information in <i>The Irish Times</i>which outlines that there was a meeting of the project management board of the national children's hospital in September 2018 which was chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of Health at which information was presented which suggested there would be a cost overrun of up to &euro;400 million.  We have been asked to believe this information was not passed on to the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, or the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, despite the fact that the Secretary General had it in his possession in September ahead of this year's budget preparations.</p></speech>

Is it credible that such information has been floating around at Secretary General level and was not passed on?  What does it say to the Minister about relationships at the heart of the Government and those within the Department of Health?  Until now we have heard the Fine Gael defence - a backstop defence, if you will - which has been repeated with absolute discipline.  We now need to hear a different view.  This is the chance of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs to put her stamp on the controversy.  Is she comfortable, as a Minister, with the manner in which the issue has been handled?  We all agree that we want to see the project delivered, but it cannot continue to be delivered in the manner in which it is being carried out.  We have had a drip drip of information and seen the undermining of collective Cabinet responsibility, while thousands of nurses are on strike today.  GPs were on strike yesterday.  There will be more strikes.  Will the Minister bring some sense and perspective to the debate?  As she is known as a straight talker, she should talk straight on this issue.  Does she accept that the information was not shared at senior Government level?  When was she, as a member of the Cabinet, made aware of the cost overruns in the Department of Health?  Can she understand the frustration of the thousands of nurses who are picketing today at being lectured by the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, about the need for fiscal responsibility?  He said meeting the nurses' pay demands would cause a spiral in the public finances.  He was asleep at the wheel and is now lecturing people about the need for fiscal responsibility.  Can the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs understand the frustration in that regard?</p></speech>

I understand the connection people are making between the overrun in costs on the national children's hospital and the nurses' strike.  I have spoken to many people who are making that connection, including on doorsteps in my constituency.  I have spoken to a number of nurses, even retired nurses, about it.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy asked whether it was credible that information had not been passed on.  I believe what has been said by the Ministers.  I am the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and have come to the debate with that role in mind.  The major questions asked by the Deputy concerned credibility, management, political oversight and accountability and they are important.  It is the job of this House and the Opposition to hold Ministers to account and that is what Deputy Calleary and other colleagues in the Chamber are doing.  This is the third time this week different members of the Government have been asked questions by the Opposition about the extraordinary increase in costs at the national children's hospital, as well as questions about the nursing strike.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, have just answered questions about the strike and have both appeared before committees this week to answer questions.  I know that there are outstanding questions and that we have to get to the bottom of them.  The Deputy wants answers.  As an Independent member of the Government, I also want answers.  For that reason, PwC has been commissioned to review the escalation in costs.</p></speech>

First, as I understand it, there will be an audit process that will take place in terms of capital projects for 2019 that, apart from the national children's hospital issue, are already delayed.  We need to see how much money might be available in that regard.  Second, if there is still a deficit, and there probably will be, then a reprofiling of projects needs to be identified that would result in them being delayed, but only for a matter of weeks.  That is my understanding.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach and the Minister for Health have proved utterly incapable of resolving the various issues before us.</p>  <p>  Yesterday, we had general practitioners outside Leinster House due to the lack of Government investment in primary care.  Our hospitals have the worst waiting lists right across Europe.  Last month, there were 10,000 on hospital trolleys.  Last year was the worst year on record in terms of the constant trolley crisis.  The debacle surrounding the national children's hospital is beyond farcical now and we are no further along in it being resolved.</p>  <p>  The issue I want to talk about, and the question I want to put to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs today, surrounds the issue of 37,000 nurses and midwives who have engaged in another day of industrial action.  It is a 24 hour stoppage as a result of a complete and utter failure on the part of the Government to deal with the issues of recruitment and retention that have gripped our health service for many years.</p>  <p>  I met nurses this morning and I have met them on many occasions since this industrial action started in late January.  Their message is very clear.  Their message is crystal clear to Government.  None of them wants to be out on the picket line.  All of them want to do what they do best, that is, caring for patients in our hospitals.  Their actions are not selfish because they are taking their action and their stand on behalf of every one of us.  The public, the people at home, know that.  That is why their actions have the support of people throughout every community in the State, because they know that nurses are fighting for a better health service for all of us.  That is at the core of it.  That is what the people understand.  That is why they are standing with the nurses and midwives in this battle.</p>  <p>  The Government has, to this point, refused to engage on levels acceptable to the nurses and midwives.  Earlier this week we had the Minister for Health and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform issuing a joint press release stating that they were willing to engage in talks at the Workplace Relations Commission.  They said they would engage in talks on everything bar what is at the core of this issue, which is the issue of pay.  The Government has spouted that line time and again and it has been rejected by nurses and midwives and the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, and rightly so.</p>  <p>  It is time now for the Government to get real.  It is time for the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, as a Cabinet colleague, and the rest of her Cabinet colleagues to get their heads out of the clouds and deal with the issue at hand.  The Minister said the Government will engage with the nurses but what the Government needs to accept and act on is the urgent need for that engagement without clauses or preconditions.</p>  <p>  The approach that the Government has taken so far has failed utterly and dramatically.  Let me be clear on this and let me spell it out to every Cabinet colleague.  The Cabinet is putting patients at risk because nurses never put their patients at risk.  The refusal and intransigence of the Government to deal with this issue on the basis of no preconditions is putting patient safety at risk.  That is not surprising given this Government's record on health and the record of the Minister for Health.  Despite this, within a number of days we will have industrial action involving a three-day stoppage planned for next week.</p></speech>

Does the Minister accept that the Government's approach to tackling the recruitment and retention crisis so far has failed?

Clearly, we are not there yet.  As he has identified, with great eloquence, the risks are escalating.  We understand that.  That is why there is such significant contingency planning going on between the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation and the HSE.  I am fully with Deputy Doherty and aware of that with regard to the risks that are escalating.</p>  <p>  Second, I am here today as an Independent Minister because I am part of the Government and it is my responsibility to answer some of these questions as well.  In my view, we need something to shift to bring the people to the table.  That is what needs to happen.  On what basis do I say that?  First, there is reasonableness on both sides.  There is reasonableness, as Deputy Doherty eloquently set out.  I have spoken to nurses as well about their concerns.  The issue of the safety of their patients is primary to them.  Their understanding is that they need the issue of pay addressed to address the issue of safety effectively.  That is what they are saying to us.  On the other side, including the Government of which I am a part, there is reasonableness as well.  When I came in I was listening to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, identifying issues relative to pay, the collective pay agreement and all of the other aspects of that.  These are reasonable for us as the Government to lay out.  We have reason on this side and we have reason on that side.</p>  <p>  At the same time, we need something to shift to bring the parties together to begin to have that conversation.  Deputy Doherty asks whether it has to do with pay.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, has laid out clearly an understanding of that in terms of the current agreement as well as the future agreement, and pay is part of that.  No doubt that will be part of those discussions in terms of the safety and conditions that are required.  How that is discussed and what is decided will be determined once they get to the table.  This is the most important thing that needs to happen.  The talking needs to begin.  We require significant engagement and genuine and real intensification to find what the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, referred to as innovative solutions.  In my view, and I imagine Deputy Doherty shares it, before the significant intensification and the potential disruption that will happen next week, we need something to shift to get intensification in terms of engagement.  This requires the support of the INMO as well as ICTU and the wider union movement.</p></speech>

I put it to her that what needs to shift is that the Government needs to indicate &ndash; it can be done today, right here, right now &ndash; that it will enter into negotiations with the INMO on the basis of no preconditions.  What the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, and the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, have said is that the Government will enter into talks, but not about pay.  The Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Richard Bruton, was on "Morning Ireland" this morning.  He said, "I think we are prepared to talk about pay in the context of an agreement".  Is that the position of Cabinet today or is it the position of the Minister for Health and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform that pay cannot be discussed?  We need something to shift but those in the Government have dug their heels in and do not want to talk about what is the core issue of this dispute.</p>  <p>  Will the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs give clarity?  This is Leaders' Questions and not oral questions.  What is the situation of the Government at this point?  Is the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment correct in his proclamation this morning in which he said the Government was willing to enter into talks to discuss pay in the context of an agreement?  Is it the old position of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Minister for Health in their press release that the Government will talk about everything bar pay?</p>  <p>  This is a dispute in terms of two parties.  I know which side I am on.  I know which side the public is on.  I believe the public believes the Government is being intransigent on the matter.</p></speech>

I also listened the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton, this morning.  I did not think the way he answered the question was necessarily at odds with what the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, was saying or how I answered the Deputy.  As I have already said, we agree that we need a shift shortly to bring the parties together.  When that happens there will be discussion on the issue of pay, whether in the context of what has been agreed, which will start soon, or of allowances that have been determined in relation to nurses, which will also begin soon.  No doubt issues in relation to the future will also be discussed.  That is all.  That is what the Minister, Deputy Bruton, was saying and I think the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, would accept that if we get there, while at the same time identifying that there have been agreements and they are beginning to be followed up in relation to what the Government has promised.</p>  <p>  I do not think that there is a difference, but based on the concern that the Government and nurses share for the safety of our patients, we need to come together.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-02-07a.249" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1366" speakername="Thomas Pringle" time="12:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019020700017#P00300"><p>This week has seen the culmination of the Fine Gael and Independent Government's incompatibility with industrial relations, and its blatant disregard for workers' rights.  The Government has refused to engage with the INMO on issues of pay and recruitment in the health sector.  This has forced nurses to rightly protest for better working conditions.  The Government has refused to meet with the National Association of General Practitioners, NAGP, on issues such as the much-needed investment in the GP sector, particularly in rural Ireland, it has refused meaningful engagement with the Psychiatric Nurses Association over pay and conditions and has even refused to meet the union of choice for ambulance staff and the national ambulance representative association.  They do not even have the opportunity to meet with the Government on key issues of concern.  Even the Government's agencies refuse to engage or, in some cases, even recognise unions.</p>  <p>  Last week &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta announced a year-on-year increase in job creation figures for 2018, which is welcome.  Some 156 of those jobs were created in my constituency of Donegal.  However, a question remains over the quality of these jobs with employers that either refuse to engage with unions or simply refuse to recognise union membership at all.  For example, last year I supported workers at Rapid Action Packaging in Gweedore who had voted overwhelmingly in favour of industrial action in a ballot taken by SIPTU due to the continued rejection by management of the company to recognise the workers' union.  This company and many others were given grants by &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, a State agency using State money - our money.  To this day, there is no way for us to ensure that employers are respecting workers' rights because the power imbalance benefits the employer.  This, through &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta funding, is being reinforced by the Government.</p>  <p>  It is time that union recognition is granted once and for all to all workers and not left to the discretion of employers.  It should be the case in 2019 that &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta makes it a precondition for companies to recognise workers' union of choice before grants may be issued to that company.  It is not enough to create jobs, they must be good quality jobs with the appropriate conditions attached, including mandatory trade union recognition by the employer.</p>  <p>  Will the Government commit to making State agencies such as &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta impose a precondition for companies seeking grants to recognise trade unions representing future workers of that company?</p></speech>

The Deputy's question raises a very significant issue.  He is asking for a substantial policy change in relation to unions and industrial relations.  I understand the question and am in sympathy with the Deputy's position.  However, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta has confirmed that under current legislation it has no statutory role, contracted or implied, to undertake any role in assisting, intervening or monitoring industrial relations between a private company and its employees or to make any statement in such an instance.  The practice of all enterprise agencies is that to undertake such a role and to include conditions regarding union recognition and support grants would not be appropriate.</p>  <p>  That is the nub of the answer for now.  I understand the Deputy's point which he made with great strength and persuasion, particularly as it relates to his constituency, and the importance of not only creating jobs but quality jobs and the possibilities and ways in which companies can acknowledge or recognise unions that could contribute to higher quality jobs and even better pay and conditions.  It is very helpful for the Deputy to raise this issue in the context of the recent report by &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta which, as he noted, is very positive and deals with the many excellent aspects of its work.  It is a good time to raise this issue but there is no legal obligation on employers to negotiate with a union on behalf of an employee member unless previously agreed.  This does not prevent a dispute about trade union recognition from being a lawful dispute.</p></speech>

Who is it supposed to represent and look after?  &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta is supposed to look after the people living in the Gaeltacht which not only means providing them with jobs but also the right to defend themselves and talk to their employers in a fair, balanced manner that is based in equality.  Otherwise, agencies such as &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta are giving money to employers to provide jobs but are effectively saying "good luck" to the people who work there, that they can look after themselves and defend themselves because the agencies are having nothing to do with it.  It is not right that these agencies give all this money to employers and let them do what they want, and it fails to recognise the position of workers.  We represent those people and we should accommodate them that they may do their work properly.  It is not about creating conflict or strikes but about creating fairness so that workers can have their rights recognised.  That should be the role of all Government agencies including &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta. </p></speech>

As I said, I am in sympathy with that and understand that.</p>  <p>  He also spoke of the need to give additional supports to the Gaeltacht and this issue could be a good place to begin.  I also understand that.  Although this is not current policy or legislation, I would be happy to ask the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Minister Humphreys, to engage with the Deputy further on this matter.</p></speech>

People are sick to death of additional taxes appearing at every opportunity.  The latest attack on consumers is the increase in VAT on food supplements which is proposed to come in soon.</p><p>The majority of products in Ireland affected by the 23% VAT rate are supplied by Irish companies which work closely with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland to ensure their products' safety and compliance with regulations.  They employ hundreds of Irish people.</p> <p> The Taoiseach questioned the science behind food supplements.  All claims made for such products are governed by the European Food Safety Authority.  The claims relate to the support and maintenance of health.  The rulings are based on international large-scale clinical trials and peer supported research.  When I questioned him in the D&aacute;il recently, the Taoiseach was not sure whether folic acid was a food supplement, but he will find out soon enough on 1 March when the Government applies the 23% VAT rate to it, affecting women who are trying to look after their health during pregnancy.  It is the same Taoiseach who told people a couple of weeks ago that he was going to reduce his carbon footprint by decreasing his meat intake, one of the most idiotic statements ever made by a Taoiseach.  For a Taoiseach to send the message that he will stop eating meat to a farming country that is proud of its tradition of farming and in which people survived with nothing for years was so stupid and beyond belief.  He was encouraging people to adopt a healthy lifestyle, while at the same time agreeing to a 23% VAT rate on food supplements.</p></speech>

For example, we have a great person in County Kerry, Mr. Dan Horan, who is the proud owner of Horan's Health Stores and last week celebrated 30 years in business, giving much needed employment in County Kerry and beyond, just as other independent health food stores have done.  These businesses have customers who are young, middle aged and older and who, in taking care of themselves, rely on health food supplements for their well-being and in staying away from the doctor's surgery and out of the hospital system.  The Government's answer is to tax them at a rate of 23%.  I will provide a couple of examples shortly, but I want to hear whether Deputy Zappone, as an Independent Minister, supports the Government in applying the 23% VAT rate to such customers.</p></speech>

As I have an interest in this issue, I am glad that he raised it.  I will give the House my view as an Independent.</p>  <p>  There are at least two aspects to the Deputy's remarks on vitamins.  First, many people, including me, take them and avail of supplements regularly or, if we forget, sporadically in order to improve or optimise our health and well-being.  This is often the case for people, in particular older people, who believe they are deficient in certain areas and need supplements to counteract it.  In other cases people take vitamins while recovering from illnesses or because they feel run down.  From that perspective, I understand why the Deputy has raised the issue.  Many Irish people depend on vitamins and supplements for their well-being, including me.</p>  <p>  The second aspect relates to the viability of businesses that depend on the sale of these products for their livelihood.  Given the general uncertainty about Brexit, additional impediments such as the increased VAT rate cause concern and deserve our attention.  As my father sold health food products and vitamins, I understand the issue from the consumer's perspective, as well as from a business perspective.</p>  <p>  These issues have been raised previously and I have listened to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, address them.  I was in touch with him about them.  I am pleased to say he is reviewing the matter, albeit with the caveat that it involves an interpretation of the law that could prove to be an insurmountable difficulty.  However, I understand he will be in a position to come to a conclusion on the issue in the coming days.</p></speech>

She is a Cabinet Minister and a person who should have influence in the Government.  Will she and its other Independent members, many of whom I respect, including the Minister of State who is sitting alongside her, Deputy Moran, use their influence to try to make the rest of the Government see common sense?  I will provide a couple of examples.  A married lady with two teenage children who take a number of supplements currently has a bill of &euro;87 per month.  This figure will increase to &euro;107.  A 48 year old married person with two children who works four days per week takes a number of items at a cost of &euro;70 per month.  That figure will increase to &euro;86.  I have another case which involves a person who is 88 years of age.  These are the types of people we respect.  A semi-retired farmer, he still does a lot of work on his farm and is grateful to be in extremely good health.</p></speech>

A month later, with the Minister for Health sitting beside him, the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, delivered a budget to this Chamber under false pretences because somebody knew, at least senior officials knew, at that stage that there was a massive hole due to the overrun on expenditure on the children's hospital.  We are asked to believe that a number of senior staff in the Department of Health did not tell their Minister.

Mr. Kenny Tynan is a father of four from Roscommon who a number of years ago was diagnosed with a brain tumour and last year was granted a medicinal cannabis licence by the Minister.  Unfortunately, that licence did not involve reimbursement.  Somebody, in the interim, has paid for the first three months of medical cannabis.  Obviously, that person cannot continue to do so, putting Mr. Tynan in a stressful situation for his family.</p>  <p>  The substantial issue is the medical cannabis programme which was proposed two years ago.  As of yet, there is nothing.  This programme is not up and running.  If the programme was up and running, reimbursement would be guaranteed, as would access.  There are families who must leave the jurisdiction to go to Barcelona to get medical cannabis for their children.  As Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone is quite progressive on this issue.</p></speech>

Indeed, Deputy Gino Kenny and I have been in contact over this.  I will not take up time.  I would certainly support the comments being made here on behalf of Mr. Tynan and his family.

As the Deputies opposite will be aware, there is a compassionate access programme that is consultant-led.

Deputies Kenny and Murphy will be aware of the progress we are trying to make in the area as a whole.

An Post is closing post offices.  I am talking about Clogheen in County Tipperary today.  An independent review is supposed to be setting up an appeals system.  They are no more independent than my sheepdog at home because An Post is writing the letters to answer them.  An Post makes it so difficult for new people to take the post office.  It wants too much space in the shop and has too many regulations.  It is too expensive, prohibitive and with fewer services.  Departments are also sending out letters every day encouraging people to transfer their business from post offices to banks.  Will the Government do something to halt the attack on rural post offices which provide a vital service for rural areas?  In Clogheen, people will have to walk or try to get a taxi, if they can get one, or bus or whatever to neighbouring parishes.</p></speech>

I am fearful, with so much going on at present, that the approval of Spinraza may fall through the cracks.</blockquote><p>Will the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs please use her good offices?

I understand that three days later Mr. Breslin met with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, and the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, at a meeting in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The cost overrun was fresh in his mind.  Two issues have occurred here: the Secretary General withheld very serious and important information regarding this capital cost overrun or the Ministers knew unofficially and they are not admitting to that.  Either one of these has happened and I want the Minister to bring clarity to that matter.  Clearly the biggest capital cost overrun in the State was known to officials in June but we have no information or clarity on the issue and it is important that the Government brings clarity to the House.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, has said that he knew nothing of it until November, three days after the Secretary General received a briefing.  Is the Minister saying that Mr. Breslin did not mention a word about the children's hospital at that meeting?</p></speech>

Do any of the Ministers on the Government benches today believe that this stacks up?  Do any of them want to answer this?  Will they stand up and say they believe this has credibility?  This is beyond a joke at this stage.  Nurses and midwives are on the picket lines.  Do the Ministers think it is lost on the nurses that the Government has endless money for a children's hospital and not a shilling for nurses?  Do the Ministers think that nurses want to see members of the Government sitting in here folding their arms and shrugging their shoulders while saying they will have to wait for the PwC report?  We cannot wait.  Does this stack up?  Does Fine Gael believe it has credibility?  I ask the Ministers please to answer the question.</p></speech>

I understand, just as the Deputy does, the concerns of the nurses.  Just because I am sitting here does not mean that I do not understand that.  The initial question from Deputy Jack Chambers was whether the Secretary General had withheld the information or are the Ministers telling the truth.  I believe the Ministers are telling the truth.  With regard to the question on whether the Secretary General withheld information, the use of "withhold" implies that he did something wrong and I do not believe that he necessarily did anything wrong.</p></speech>

My Department reviewed the report and met the Department of Health to discuss it on 23 November and made a formal submission to me on 26 November.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health submitted a memorandum to Government in April 2017 that included a section on the proposed new governance arrangements for the national children's hospital, NCH, project.  This proposal included the establishment of the board, to be chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of Health, with responsibility for monitoring the progress of the children's hospital programme against the agreed parameters for the programme in relation to its timeline, scope and funding. </p><p>There is much in my prepared statement which I have already shared with the Deputy.

We are led to believe that the board discussed seismic overruns in June and that in September the Secretary General of the Department of Health was present when a figure of &euro;391 million was relayed to the committee.  The Minister's representative on the board did not remind the chairman to contact the line Minister, as was his duty.  The Minister and ourselves were in the throes of budget preparations.  He was well aware of the overrun in respect of current expenditure in the Department of Health, so much so that he was looking at a supplementary budget to the tune of &euro;600 million.  Obviously the Minister deals directly with Department of Health officials, officials of his own Department, and the Minister for Health in respect of budget preparations.  When it became apparent that there was such an overrun on the current side, did the Minister ask about the situation in respect of capital expenditure?</p></speech>

The time is doubled, but the two Deputies will have a better chance to ask more questions if they stick to one minute for each supplementary question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-02-07a.375" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="13:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019020700027#CC00400"><p>To answer the Deputy's two questions, I did not deal with the issue of whether a supplementary budget was required for capital expenditure at that point.  There were two reasons for this.  First, a supplementary budget would have dealt with last year, 2018, rather than with any additional costs for 2019.  The second reason is that in all of my experience of engaging on this issue in previous years, all supplementary budgets for the Department of Health focused on current expenditure.  In any event, we were dealing with 2018 and the costs that are now the cause of debate and inquiry in the House related to 2019 and beyond.  With regard to the role of my official on the board, I emphasise that, from working with him, I know of his excellence as a procurement professional and the work he has done in that area.  From his point of view, he could see engagement on the matter taking place in the board and with the Department of Health.  This engagement then led to the timeline that both the Minister, Deputy Harris, and I have shared.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-02-07a.376" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1280" speakername="Jonathan O'Brien" time="13:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019020700027#CC00500"><p>There are serious questions which need to be answered and we are not getting the answers.  For instance, we now know that in April an assistant secretary in the Department of Health made a request for an interim report to be forwarded to Government in respect of the escalating costs.  In May she again asked for a report to be sent to Government in respect of these escalating costs.  The minutes show that she asked for this to be done prior to the budgetary process taking place.  We now know that the figure of &euro;391 million was, to use the term used by the Secretary General yesterday, "crystallised" and known on 19 September.  Despite this, nobody seems to have told the Minister or the Minister for Health what the figure was until after the budget.  If that is the case, I put it to the Minister that there have been serious breakdowns in communication between the most senior officials in the Department of Health and the Minister and within the Minister's Department.  He was not able to get that information from the Department of Health when discussing a black hole of &euro;600 million or &euro;700 million in current expenditure.  Which is it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-02-07a.377" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="13:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019020700027#CC00600"><p>It is very important to be clear around the timings.  The so-called black hole to which the Deputy is referring, which ultimately resulted in a supplementary budget of &euro;645 million for the Department of Health, referred to 2018.  It was a supplementary budget for last year.  A discussion about additional funding for last year cannot be conflated with funding for this year and the years to come.  All of the engagement we had on the supplementary budget was focused on current expenditure for last year and referred to a process that had been ongoing between myself and the Minister for Health for a number of months.  With regard to the engagement within the Department of Health and between my Department and the Department of Health, the Minister, Deputy Harris, has outlined all of the work he did in trying to interrogate all of the costs and to come up with a figure he felt he could submit to me and on which we could then work.  That is what happened.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-02-07a.378" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1217" speakername="Barry Cowen" time="13:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019020700027#CC00700"><p>The Minister is saying that the discussions within his Department with regard to his preparations for the budget were solely concentrated on current expenditure.  I do not doubt that but I find it amazing that he would never ask the Minister for Health or his representatives, or his own officials to check the situation in respect of capital expenditure.  The Minister knows as well as I do that, when we spoke, we looked to see whether he was in a position to provide funds within the HSE service plan, under future expenditure for this year, to deal with our demands in respect of children who are were awaiting psychiatric assessment and in respect of the elderly and the lack of home help packages and hours to deal with the backlog in that area.  That was a priority of ours.  Obviously we were mindful of the commitments the Minister had made in the national development plan and the commitments he made at various roadshows around the country with regard to the different projects and primary care centres to be included in that plan.  They are now in jeopardy because of an overrun in capital spending on the children's hospital to the tune of &euro;100 million.  If the Minister did not ask about capital expenditure, that is very disappointing.  If he did ask, what is the answer?  The Minister is saying he did not ask and that he is therefore exonerated.  That is a poor reflection on the situation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-02-07a.379" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="13:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019020700027#CC00800"><p>As I have said, I have to take, and do take, responsibility for the framing of any budget.  Ultimately, while line Departments have responsibility for specific projects, I hold myself accountable for overall decisions on how the country's money is used and I understand why the House is putting these questions to me.  The majority of the discussions we had with the Department of Health were focused on current expenditure because that is where services are delivered.  The two issues the Deputy has raised, and which I acknowledge he pressed during our budget discussions, are entirely issues of current expenditure.  If the matter of the national children's hospital had come up in the way it has now, I would have asked the Minister, Deputy Harris, to quantify the costs.  As he has outlined, that is what he and his Department are doing.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-02-07a.380" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1280" speakername="Jonathan O'Brien" time="13:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019020700027#CC00900"><p>We are led to believe that the Minister, Deputy Harris, was not aware of the costs in September, despite the Secretary General and an assistant secretary knowing that the figure was &euro;391 million.  I accept that is a capital cost but surely it is a pretty important figure to feed into the budgetary process.  While the budget deals with current expenditure, there were also massive increases on the capital side, which we have all welcomed.</p><p>Surely if the Minister is dealing with the issue of increasing the capital budget for next year and further years, it is an important piece of information that the cost of the flagship capital project is running over by &euro;391 million.  Surely he would have an expectation that such information would be relayed to him, given that the assistant secretary in the Department requested as early as May that it be given to the Government as part of the budgetary process, which did not happen.  Will the Minister give a commitment that he will find out why it did not happen, given that it was requested at the steering group meeting in May?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-02-07a.382" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019020700028#DD00200"><p>The minutes that have been released for the meeting of the steering group in May outline all of the options that body was considering in moving the national children's hospital project forward.  Because the capital expenditure figures for this year had already been determined as part of Ireland 2040, the vast majority of the engagement I had with all colleagues o n budget 2019 was on the issue of current expenditure.  I will repeat what I said before.  In dealing with a project of this size, for me to do the kind of work I now have to do, the key issue would have been to understand the exact figure about which we were talking.  What we can see is that within the Department of Health that was exactly the work they were doing.  They were trying to understand why it had developed.  From the moment the Minister for Health was notified - he has outlined the timeline - he has shown what he did to try to interrogate the figure and deal with it.  He did the work I would have asked him to do.  I am now responsible for how we can include it in our plans for this year from a capital point of view.</p></speech>

The Government is the final sanctioning authority.  A procurement process was launched to engage a company to build, operate and maintain the State intervention network.  A final tender from the remaining bidder was received by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment on 18 September 2018.  Officials of that Department are examining this bid.</p>  <p>  Officials of my Department with responsibility for the Vote for the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment have been apprised periodically of progress in the NBP procurement process.  The Office of Government Procurement was represented in an advisory role on the procurement board for the project, but it does not have a decision-making role in the procurement process.  In accordance with the public spending code, the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment has submitted cost benefit analysis reports to my Department for comment regarding methodology.  I will be working with my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, as he gets ready to bring a recommendation to the Government once he has considered the outcome of the evaluation process being undertaken by his Department.</p></reply>

I am also mindful of the comments made this morning by the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  He said the Cabinet had collectively thought the right protections were in place to protect taxpayers' money, despite the overrun that occurred on the children's hospital project.  I am also conscious of the commitment the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, gave this week to bring forward proposals next week to deal with any such issue into the future.  It was last November when he became aware of the problems.  He is now bringing forward proposals only because of the furore caused by the fallout.  It is incumbent on him to carry out an audit or trawl of all capital development programmes and projects that are under way or have been contracted.  I have helped him along the way by putting questions about every item programmed for expenditure under the national development plan this year.  I hope he can meet the commitment given by the Taoiseach on Sunday when he said he would bring forward the details of the projects within the capital development plan that would not be progressed because the money was needed to plug the hole created by the overrun this year.  I hope in later weeks the Minister will bring forward the details of what will not proceed in the next three or four years to make up the shortfall of &euro;450 million.</p></speech>

Where we are with the national broadband plan is that any decision to be made on it will be made on the basis of a price now tendered.  In working with me the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment has completed a tendering process that is yielding figures.  These figures, a consequence of the completed tendering process, will form the basis on which the Government will make a decision.</p>  <p>  On what the Deputy aid about the furore caused, it is worth reminding the House that as part of the decision made to move ahead with the national children's hospital project, I said I would deal with the cost in 2019 inside the overall capital expenditure figures for the year.  My commitment and decision in that respect predate the debate taking place on the project.</p></speech>

He was specifically asked whether, as a result of the overrun, he would bring into the public domain the details associated with the figure of &euro;50 million to come out of the health capital plan and the &euro;50 million to come out of other capital plans.  He said he would; "reprofile" is the word he used.  As I have said to the Minister previously, there were plenty of road shows to tell us what was going to take place under the national development plan.  We only want one road show to tell us what is being cut, where it is being cut and the communities and sectors within the health service, in respect of which the Government will not be in a position to deliver on its commitments under the 2019 plan.  That is only fair and appropriate.  The public is very anxious to know the real effect the mismanagement of such a colossal amount of money is having on the daily lives and health not only of the nation but also of the various communities and sectors that will be affected.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach was repeating again, in the context of the current debate, the decision the Government had made on this matter in December.  I will be able to clarify the consequences of where we are with the national children's hospital project, but I also want to emphasise the long-term consequences when the hospital is delivered.  I fully acknowledge the difficulties we now have.  Next week I will deal with their consequences.  As we move forward with the project and see construction work begin to accelerate, the scale of and impact the project will have when it is open will become clear to the public.</p></speech>

It has been brought to my attention that a very important sentence in the HSE's submission intended for the commission was edited by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  It reads: "The overall picture of the nursing and midwifery workforce is one of a constant challenge to effectively recruit and retain to meet ever increasing service demands".  Is that the case and, if so, why did it happen?</p></reply>

I understand that both the HSE and the joint employer submissions are available on the website of the pay commission.</p><p>It is longstanding practice that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and before it the Department of Finance, represents the public service as employer.</p><p>The Department has the responsibility for co-ordinating, articulating and submitting the employer case in such matters on behalf of the Government as employer.  This is absolutely essential to ensure consistency and coherence in approach.</p><p>The employer submission compiled by this Department is based on data and inputs from a broad range of sources, including material submitted to the Department by both the Department of Health and the HSE. </p><p>It should be said that the joint employer submission to the pay commission reflects evidence presented by the HSE, particularly the increase year on year in absolute numbers of nurses and midwives, over and above the level required to simply replace leavers and retirees.  Since December 2013, the public service has now recruited an additional 3,876 nurses.  </p><p>The pay commission is completely independent and comprises seven individuals with a vast experience of human resources and industrial relations in the private and public sectors and in the trade union movement. </p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i></p><p>It forensically examined all the evidence from the employer side and from the staff side. </p><p>Its considered conclusion is that there are no generalised recruitment and retention difficulties in respect of nursing and midwifery.  The report states that the commission was not persuaded, based on the evidence available, that pay arrangements were in themselves a significant impediment to recruitment and that current pay rates do not appear to be unduly affecting the number of nurses, midwives and doctors applying to work abroad.</p><p>In respect of nurses and midwives it considered that the national levels of nursing and midwifery turnover rates do not indicate a generalised retention crisis and that the available evidence suggests that none of the turnover rates reported are significantly out of line with those experienced in private sector employment generally.</p><p>Instead it recommended a targeted package to incentivise nurses and midwives to work in certain areas, a recommendation which the Government has accepted and which remains on the table alongside the other pay benefits of the public service stability agreement and the significant measures agreed with ICTU on new entrant salary scales.</p></speech>

That is the line that is being put out, and it is entirely unhelpful to the current situation.  It flies in the face of the evidence before our eyes.  The HSE has said that difficulties in recruitment and retention pose a major challenge to its ability to meet the demand for health services.  The HSE knows; it is dealing with this problem on a daily basis.  It tries to find cover for its services, whether at hospital level or community level.  It has made a clear statement that this is a constant challenge.  In light of that, and in light of the fact that we are spending &euro;2 million per week on agency nurses, why does the HSE have to travel all around the world, paying very substantial recruitment costs and still not managing to get enough nurses, why is the Minister in denial?</p></speech>

The text to which the Deputy refers, which went to the Public Service Pay Commission on behalf of the employer, acknowledged the challenges we face.  It went on to state the challenges here "[c]ollectively ... represent some of the greatest challenges faced by our health services nursery and midwifery workforce".  It did acknowledge that there were challenges in this area.  It made the point, however, that these challenges are not generalised in nature and are concentrated in particular hospitals and particular disciplines.  It placed that in the context of our being successful in recruiting more nurses and midwives.  We have turnover levels that are comparable with the rest of our public service.</p></speech>

Why is it that our child health programmes and our vaccination programmes are hopelessly inadequate in terms of coverage as a result of the lack of public health nurses?  This is the evidence before the Minister's eyes, yet the Government continues to create the impression that there is no problem in this area.  We all know there is a problem.  Anyone who has any interaction with the health service knows there is a serious problem there as a result of those challenges.  The longer this goes on and the longer a situation is allowed to continue where we are losing significant numbers of nurses, the heavier the burden becomes on those who remain, the more stressful the job becomes and the more incentive there is for those people to move on also.</p>  <p>  This morning the Minister said he was genuine about engagement with the nurses.  Will he ensure that people get around the table as soon as possible and that they do so in a constructive manner?  Will he remove any preconditions in order that there can be open and frank discussions?  </p></speech>

I want to see another round of genuine and constructive engagement to try to deal with this issue.  The only condition I have - I maintain it is vital  - is that any engagement happens inside the context of the existing agreement.  That agreement says that strike action should not take place and that cost-increasing claims should not be made.  It is clear that those elements of this agreement are already being challenged.  As I said during our two-hour debate on this issue earlier, the consequences of this going wrong in a very disorderly way, if we cannot maintain a wage agreement in our society for our public servants, will create even greater difficulties in the future as we try to maintain and improve services.</p></speech>

The commission made its first report to the Government in May 2017; we are debating that report today.  </p>  <p>  In respect of the Defence Forces, in its first report the pay commission noted that the force was experiencing a significant exit of trained and experienced personnel in areas such as engineering, ICT, pilots, avionic technicians and air traffic controllers, as well as encountering challenges in attracting direct entry personnel in specialist streams, including doctors, marine engineers and engineers. </p>  <p>  In the context of these observations the commission, in its first report, suggested that "consideration [should] be given to commissioning a more comprehensive examination of underlying difficulties in recruitment and retention in those sectors and employment streams where difficulties are [clearly] evident". </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the first module was published by the commission in August 2018.

The Minister of State at the Department of Defence, Deputy Kehoe, informed the D&aacute;il that the joint submission had been sent to the Public Service Pay Commission, which was between military management and the Department of Defence.  We found out, in January of this year, that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform had a central role in the aftermath of the apparent submission.</p><p>What did the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform do around the changes made between military management and the Department of Defence?  Why did it take three months for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to intervene in that process?  In response to a parliamentary question the Minister said there was a collaborative basis between the management side parties to provide the commission with accurate and complete information.  Is he saying there was inaccurate or incomplete information from military management and the Department of Defence?  It appears that the Department is delaying on the issue of recruitment and retention and unusually intervening in a joint submission made by the civil and military sides in the Department of Defence.  The Minister needs to clarify his Department's role in the matter.  If he is playing a role in diluting the serious issues surrounding pay and conditions in order that he can uphold his top line on public pay, people working in the military will not place much hope in the report that will come from the Public Service Pay Commission.  The Minister needs to clarify the matter.</p></speech>

My Department has responsibility for overseeing total pay policy and acting on behalf of the State as employer.  My Department plays a role in making submissions to the commission that then looks at pay.</p>  <p>  Deputy Jack Chambers should join together the two strands of the debate we are having today.  I know that he will because I know how heavily engaged he is in this issue.  If we get to the point where the Oireachtas believes the Public Service Pay Commission is not the appropriate way and does not accept the recommendations in respect of the health service, it will have profound consequences in how we deal with issues related to the Defence Forces.</p>  <p>  I appreciate the fact that the Deputy wants to see the case advanced.  However, if we do not have a collective agreement to deal with these matters, we will end up with sector after sector looking to leap ahead of other parts of the civil and public service.  If we end up in that place, I am really concerned that the people who will ultimately suffer from the absence of a collective agreement are those on low and middle incomes.  It is for that reason I believe the pay commission is a good tool to deal with these issues.  The views the Oireachtas may offer on the work of the commission on health and the views on its recommendation will have a major effect on how the issues the Deputy is raising related to the Defence Forces can be resolved.</p></speech>

The issue I have is that I want to know what the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform did in contaminating the joint submission made by military management and the Department of Defence.  The Minister delayed the process for three months by interrupting the joint submission.  I want him to clarify the Department&rsquo;s role before the submission was made to the pay commission.  The issue I have is whether the Department, in effect, muzzled the Department of Defence and military management.  If the Minister diluted some of the recommendations and removed some of the serious issues for members of the Defence Forces, there is no credibility to the pay commission because it has not received the data or is not aware of the real-life circumstances of people working in the Defence Forces.  We need to clarify what the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform did in removing, adding to or diluting the core information sent in the joint submission from the Department of Defence and military management.  The Minister has not clarified the matter today.  In fact, he is involving himself and trying to filter and remove some of the core recommendations being made by the other parts of civil and military management.  He needs to outline his role in that process.  Otherwise, there is no credibility to the pay commission because it is not receiving real-time information on members of the Defence Forces.</p></speech>

Residents in 14 houses in Inchigeelagh are under threat, as are 14 businesses, while there are 21 homes and 25 businesses in Ballingeary.  The impact on people's lives and homes when a flood comes is severe.  There have been plans - we have discussed them in the House &ndash; talked about previously to advance flood defences, but they do not seem to be advancing.  Will the Minister of State update us on what is happening in the provision of flood defences in Inchigeelagh and Ballingeary in the interests of the people who live there?</p></reply>

I identified a total of 118 flood relief projects to protect the main flood risk areas throughout the country.  The plans and projects are a key part of the overall flood risk management strategy set out in the national development plan 2018 to 2027, involving a total investment of &euro;1 billion over the ten years of the plan.</p>  <p>  The proposed schemes for Ballingeary and Inchigeelagh are not in the first tranche of the project to be progressed.  The OPW and Cork County Council are working closely to ensure the programme of flood relief projects identified by Cork County Council is kept under review and that all projects will commence as soon as possible within the ten-year timeframe of the programme investment.  However, it is still open to Cork County Council to submit an application for funding under the OPW operated minor works flood mitigation and coastal protection scheme to undertake minor flood works to deal with problems in the area.  The scheme's eligibility criteria include the requirement that the cost be beneficial.  The details set out on the Office of Public Works website apply to all applications.  Once consultants are appointed to progress the flood relief schemes identified in the flood risk management plan, consultation with statutory and non-statutory bodies, as well as the general public, takes place at the appropriate stages to ensure all parties have an opportunity to have an input in the development of the schemes.</p></speech>

I am aware of the opportunity under the minor works scheme.  The council has been undertaking various works, but the minor works are temporary in nature.  They involve removing gravel and vegetation.  As anyone knows, the river will bring back the gravel and vegetation will return.  They are not long-term or real solutions.  What is really needed is the long-term solution of flood defences.  I realise the Minster of State is saying the schemes are not included in the first tranche.  It was a real disappointment for people in Ballingeary and Inchigeelagh that they were not prioritised.  Can they be prioritised in view of the constant threat?  There are 21 homes in Ballingeary, while there are 14 householders in Inchigeelagh.  When the flood comes, there will be no stopping it.  Can the schemes be prioritised for inclusion in the next tranche of the project or even within the current tranche?  By their nature, temporary works are not going to last long.  We need to provide relief for people.  We should also bear this in mind.</p></speech>

He has raised the issue several times in the D&aacute;il.  I respect the people he represents.  However, I have outlined the position in allowing for minor works to take place.</p><p>I disagree with the Deputy.  They actually work.  We are open to the county council seeking help on the work in the interim for the benefit of the people for whom the Deputy fears.  I am open to it but I have not received any application from Cork County Council relating to the two areas in question.  If that happens, I will take it on board and work with the council.  However, as I outlined, we have launched schemes under tranche 1 and are looking at some schemes under tranche 2, which I have announced.  The Deputy has put questions to me but he needs to tell Cork County Council to talk to us in the Department.  We will work with it but it must do that.</p></speech>

Different temporary works have been carried out in both Inchigeelagh and Ballingeary but the long-term scheme must be advanced.  People have seen the different drawings which have been presented and have given their input on where they see the flood and how the situation can be improved.  The expectation is there.  What is needed is for the wider scheme to be advanced and that there be no danger that smaller or temporary works might reduce the priority of a scheme at Inchigeelagh and Ballingeary which must be advanced so that the designs that have been presented to people are made a reality.</p></speech>

As I said, we are still open to this.  It is some time since Cork County Council came in on minor works.  We changed the minor works application to allow substantial moneys to go to the local authorities to help with this issue while we deal with the overall bigger scheme.  Cork County Council has had plenty of engagement with my Department in advance of the overall big scheme for the area and we are working on it together.</p></speech>

I apologise for not being here earlier but my question came up earlier than I expected.  I have come from a meeting of the Joint Committee on Climate Action which has been very busy in recent weeks.  Does the Minister believe that the public spending code takes adequate account of carbon impact on capital projects in the coming years?  The Project Ireland 2040 plan announced some months ago was very ambitious.  Does the spending code take into account the ambitious projects in that scheme?</p></reply>

This review concluded that the model used for pricing carbon in the public spending code is outdated.  As such, in 2018 my Department published a consultation paper proposing significant reforms of how carbon is priced in the appraisal of capital projects.</p>  <p>  The consultation paper proposed that future greenhouse gas emissions should be valued according to a shadow price of carbon that is based on the estimated marginal cost that will be faced by society in achieving Ireland&rsquo;s legally binding 2030 greenhouse gas emissions target.  In practical terms, this means a new shadow price of carbon for emissions not covered by the emissions trading scheme of &euro;32 per tonne in 2020, rising to &euro;100 per tonne by 2030.  Beyond 2030, it is proposed that the shadow price of carbon will rise by 5% a year, reaching &euro;265 by 2050.  For any elements of projects that will affect emissions in sectors of the economy covered by the EU emissions trading scheme, ETS, the shadow price of carbon will continue to be based on the estimated future value of allowances in the ETS.</p>  <p>  To be clear, the shadow price of carbon applies only to the public spending code which covers the evaluation of direct Government investment.  It is not a direct cost borne by consumers, it is not a carbon tax, nor does it imply any future direction for carbon taxes.</p></reply>

The greenhouse gas emissions challenge will be one of the biggest challenges of our generation as we try to reach our 2030 targets and beyond.  Are the projects which have been announced, including some of the large, very ambitious projects included in Project Ireland 2040, still under the existing emissions targets or must they be repriced in future?</p></speech>

I will decide the elements of the revised code shortly.  I expect that when we do that with many of the key projects in Project Ireland 2040, particularly in the area of public transport, the case for doing them will become only stronger, especially given that the plan already has such a significant allocation for climate change related funding.</p></speech>

I am glad to hear the Minister's commitment to the projects that are already there.  It serves to re-emphasise a point I would make myself, namely, that the large infrastructural projects are needed to join up the dots for things that were missing during the lost years of the recession.</p></speech>

We will complete the work we are doing on the public spending code.  The public consultation on this only finished on 14 December.  The Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton, is setting quite the pace in looking to publish the new climate action plan.  I will do my best to try to keep up with that and ensure that any decisions we make on the public spending code, which must be integrated from a policy perspective, will conclude at the same time as the work being undertaken by the Minister, Deputy Bruton.</p></speech>

He was reappointed in 2018 by the current Minister for Health.  He is a member of several of the board&rsquo;s committees.</p><p>The members of the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board<i>,</i>in line with the code of practice for the governance of State bodies and the board&rsquo;s code of governance, have a fiduciary duty to the board in the first instance, a responsibility to act collectively in decision-making and communication, and an obligation to observe its confidentiality arrangements.  The Department of Health, as the accountable Department for the children&rsquo;s hospital project, established the reporting and governance arrangements for the project through which the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board provided regular updates to it on the project. </p><p>On the role of the Office of Government Procurement, responsibility for construction procurement policy and the associated capital works management framework lies with that office.  Government policy requires the use of the capital works management framework on all projects delivered under the Exchequer-funded element of the public capital programme.</p><p>The public works contract is a key component of the capital works management framework and is a lump sum fixed-price contract that is to be used on all public works projects.  It is possible for public bodies to seek a derogation from the use of the standard forms of contract.  The national paediatric hospital development board commenced its formal engagement with the Government contracts committee for construction with a view to securing that derogation.</p> <p> It is important to note that a derogation does not sanction the approach or strategy of the contracting authority, but simply acknowledges that the circumstances are such as to warrant a different approach than the standard.  It is a matter for the contracting authority and the sanctioning authority to satisfy themselves as to the adequacy of the approach in terms of compliance with procurement rules and project appraisal in accordance with the public spending code.</p></reply>

I am sure he is aware that there has been much discussion of the role of the procurement officer in question and whether he should have brought information on the cost overruns to the Minister.  While I accept that a relevant code of practice is in place, one that clearly outlines that it is the chairman of a board who brings information to the relevant Minister, I am sure that the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, is aware of the circular setting out the procedure that a civil servant should follow if he or she believes there are issues of public concern.  Has the Minister held discussions with the officer since the controversy about the cost overruns broke?</p></speech>

When the Taoiseach was asked about this earlier in the week, he said that the duty was, as the Minister said, to the board and that it was the duty of the chair of the board to report to the line Minister.  The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, did not mention that.  Rather, he said that it was the duty of the board to report to the Department of Health.  Is it also the duty of the chair to report to the line Minister?  If the chair was not regularly reporting to the line Minister, is it not the fault of the line Minister not to have sought that information, given that, according to information now in the public domain, he was not aware of progress on this matter for up to a year?</p></speech>

I am absolutely satisfied that he met all of the responsibilities that he had as a member of the board.  I have worked with him since becoming Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and have seen at all times his professionalism and expertise in discharging his responsibilities.</p>  <p>  Regarding Deputy Cowen's question, the circular is very clear.  It says that if the person who is on the board does not feel that his or her concerns about an issue are being relayed by the chair of the board to the Department, that person has a duty to raise issues with the line Minister himself or herself.  It was the view of Mr. Quinn that this matter was being dealt with by the board.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, has outlined how the information was made available to his Department and then to him.</p></speech>

The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, is saying that Mr. Quinn was happy with the reporting structure that was in place and that information on the cost overruns was being passed to the line Minister in question.  We can only presume he was happy because he did not do any of the actions outlined in the circular.</p>  <p>  Will the Minister confirm when he met Mr. Quinn and whether they discussed the cost overruns at the children's hospital?  Did the Minister ask Mr. Quinn whether he had raised any concern with the chairperson with a view to that information being passed on?

These plans are the output from the catchment flood risk assessment and management, CFRAM, programme, the largest flood risk study ever carried out in the State.  They set out the measures proposed to address flood risk nationally and include 19 new flood relief schemes to protect towns in the River Shannon catchment in addition to the scheme already under way in Athlone.  Twelve of these have been prioritised as part of the ten-year programme.</p>  <p>  Since the launch of the plans, the OPW and local authorities have been pro-actively engaging to advance the implementation of these schemes.  Engagement with the local authorities is ongoing in respect of Springfield, Ballinasloe, Nenagh, Longford, Rahan, Castleconnell, Mohill, Leitrim, Clonaslee, Carrick-on-Shannon, Killaloe and, in Limerick city, King's Island and its environs.  The procurement of consultants for the detailed design of these projects will commence in the near future.</p>  <p>  Capital funding for the delivery of the existing schemes and the additional schemes identified by the flood risk management has been provided by the Government in the Project Ireland 2040 plan.  Expenditure on flood risk management will increase to &euro;100 million annually by 2021.</p>  <p>  In January 2016, the Shannon Flood Risk State Agency Co-ordination Working Group was established by the Government to support the CFRAM programme and further enhance the ongoing co-operation across all of the State agencies involved with the River Shannon, including the ESB, Waterways Ireland, Bord na M&oacute;na, Inland Fisheries Ireland, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the OPW and the relevant local authorities.  The Shannon group has taken a number of significant decisions since its establishment, including targeted maintenance at a number of locations, trialling the lowering of the levels on Lough Allen, studies to explore managing flood risk at the Shannon callows and lowering the Shannon below Parteen weir.</p></speech>

Like him, if I go out my back door or front door, I am not too far from part of the River Shannon, be that Roosky, Termonbarry or Ballyleague-Lanesborough.  The Minister of State and his staff keep in contact with me, given my role in this matter.</p>  <p>  Questions are being asked following what we have been told about the overspend on the children's hospital.  Is any of these projects going to be hit?  The Minister of State will agree that many areas that will experience difficulties are not included in the CFRAM programme of maintenance.  Climate change is having an effect and we will have more severe storms.  For example, the west coast has been promised very bad weather tonight and tomorrow.  We hope it will not be as bad as people are saying.  As the Minister of State knows, even inland areas are being flooded that never flooded before.  Will he confirm that the &euro;100 million he mentioned will be spent per annum?</p></speech>

We work together and have regular phone calls on it.  He will acknowledge our commitment regarding the money.  Since I started in this job, the amount has increased from &euro;40 million to almost &euro;70 million, and we will increase it further to &euro;100 million.  However, spending that money can be difficult at times.</p><p>One could have an objection to a scheme or judicial reviews or all such issues that can hold up the delivery of the schemes.  My Department is working with the local authorities right around the country.  The Deputy himself can see that.</p> <p> In particular, on the question proposed regarding the River Shannon, it is probably the first time in years.  The Deputies will be well aware that many taoisigh travelled around the country on the back of a tractor along the River Shannon.  Commitments were given and things done, and nothing has happened.  Over the past three years, and particularly since I came into office, the Deputies will be aware of the risks with the high levels and what we have done to maintain them through working with all agencies across the Shannon catchment.  Work is happening.  They are up in Carrick-on-Shannon, as the Deputies are aware, and we announced its funding recently.  Athlone is well on the way.  Even in Portavola, Banagher, which has been talked about for years, the job is finished.  It is done.  As for the targeted maintenance, we received nine licences.  We have done the work on seven and are back in there at present doing more work.  We are actively involved with each one.  On the question regarding the country overall, I am committed to spending the funding I have available but it is not always easy to spend all of it.</p></speech>

However, a few things concern me in this regard.  I acknowledge the Minister of State's undoubted role in this.  He is in contact and some works are being carried on.  In my county, however, because of the flooding and because the River Shannon runs from one end of the county to the other, people who should be relocated have not been relocated.  I accept certain works are being done on the River Shannon.  In terms of maintenance and the amount of silt and peat in the River Shannon, I had thought there was some agreement with Bord na M&oacute;na that there would be a pilot scheme to remove some of it.  Finally, my party brought forward a Bill on the ESB's control over the levels of water on the River Shannon.  That Bill has been sitting there for probably two years at this stage and it needs to be progressed.  I am sure the Minister of State agrees that we need to provide a single management board in charge of the River Shannon, rather than having all these groups.</p>  <p>  I appreciate the effort the Minister of State has made.  I do not question that in any way.  Because of climate change, however, we must get twice as busy and twice as serious about this.</p></speech>

As for Lough Funshinagh, plenty of people have made promises.  I have delivered in terms of the funding to the local authority to come in looking for a scheme, and we will make that happen.</p>  <p>  The Deputy talks about the relocation scheme.  I have sat in kitchens with people around this country.  One hundred and thirty-four people applied for it.  There are now 36 looking to move.  People do not want to move.  In some cases, people have come and said that they would move and we are working with those people, but when one returns and engages with them, they say it did not rain this year or they did not experience high floods and would like to stay.  We are asking people to give up their family home to move.  In some cases, people just do not want to and they work on it.</p>  <p>  What was the other question the Deputy posed?  The Deputy asked three questions.</p></speech>

I can only commend the co-operation I am getting from all State agencies on the Shannon, from the ESB to the National Parks and Wildlife Service, which many Members in this House have criticised.  They have worked closely with me.  We made things happen.  In Portrane, people were talking about houses falling into the sea for years.  We sat down with the different agencies, in particular, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, that made that work happen.  We are doing that right around the country.  A single agency around the Shannon will not work.  What we have, in terms of the steering group, is working and work is happening.</p></speech>

Last year, however, the Office of Public Works, OPW, started a project to facilitate visitors.  Some early work has been done to clear the tower of decades of accumulated bird debris and to carry out building surveys.  These surveys will facilitate the development of a design solution that it is hoped, once it has been approved by the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, will result in the provision of a safe access for visitors to the tower.</p></reply>

I will try to flesh out a little more detail.  The Kells round tower is one of the most important monuments in the country.  People in Kells have felt historically, and justifiably, that Newgrange, which is a world heritage site, has got most of the attention but there is considerable potential to have our heritage on show from the side of the street or from the grounds of a church-owned monastery and that the public would be able to have access to it.</p>  <p>  When would the Minister of State expect design solutions to be put in place and when would he expect those then to go to the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and for there to be public access?  Is there a plan to fund public access as well?  Obviously, one can have the design solution, which is welcome and important and must happen, but then one needs the ongoing expenditure and money it will cost to allow the public in to see this monument.</p></speech>

I am very much committed to heritage.</p>  <p>  This is a site I have visited.  This is a site on which the Minister of State, Deputy English, has me wound up to make something happen and we made something happen towards the end of last year.  We are now progressing that.  However, there are engagements.  Deputy Thomas Byrne knows the tower better than do I.  The safety of the public is most important.  Given that the work has now started, we will see it come to conclusion.  We must work with the other Minister to achieve a successful outcome for the people and the heritage of this country.</p></speech>

People will welcome this.  They are delighted that something is happening in this regard and certainly would like to see that come to fruition.  There is much effort in Kells at present to promote the town and to bring people together and this will help enormously.

We had been talking about the chief procurement officer in earlier questions.  I note that in the previous Government, in May 2014, the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board recommended a derogation, in other words, a different two-stage approach to procurement.  This is the context.</p>  <p>  There is a budget oversight unit in the Department and there seems to have been a formal approach about that to the effect that there would have to be a two-stage procurement process.</p></reply>

Of course, individual Departments play a key role in individual projects.  The management and delivery of individual projects within the overall capital allocation is primarily the responsibility of the relevant sponsoring Department and Minister.</p>  <p>  A public investment management assessment, PIMA, mission to Ireland was undertaken by the IMF in July 2017, which assessed our management of public capital resources compared with what would be expected in an advanced economy.  Its final report was published on my Department's website on 10 November 2017.</p>  <p>  The PIMA report concluded that, overall, Ireland manages its public infrastructure relatively well.</p><p>It highlights both strengths and weaknesses and contains a number of recommendations to improve future performance in terms of the efficiency of public capital investment.  The national development plan, published in February 2018, sets out planned improvements for the management of capital spend, drawing in particular on the 2017 PIMA report.</p> <p> More generally, in the context of the ongoing review of the public spending code, I will be giving consideration to how the current arrangements for procurement and management of major capital works contracts can be further refined and enhanced, with a view to maintaining and strengthening the focus upon value for money. </p></speech>

I looked at the agendas for the management board meetings and it appears that every quarter, there is an agenda item for high-level risks.  During all the time the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, has been the Minister, surely there was feedback through the Department of Health that there was a high-level risk with the escalation and ballooning of costs for the national children's hospital.  Surely this was brought to the Minister's attention way back in early 2018 or even in 2017 since the formation of the Varadkar Administration.  Was the management committee not aware, for example, that there was a derogation on the two-stage procurement?  Was the committee aware that a contractor would be doing the pile driving and so on but another contractor would be coming along with a totally separate bill for the building itself?  Surely the management committee knew this was the case and that the procurement was not working.  The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, has appeared before the Committee on Budgetary Oversight several times with regard to the budget.  I have a motion down in the D&aacute;il cl&aacute;r about this.</p></speech>

Amidst the language the Deputy used, such as "grotesque failure", I hope he also would give recognition to all the projects, including within the Department of Health, that are built and that are making differences for communities and citizens at present, as well as those projects that are being built as we speak through procurement and tendering processes that have worked well.</p></speech>

There was no figure and we did not know what figure we were facing.  There seems to have been total disagreement between the national paediatric hospital's quantity surveyors and the building contractors, BAM.  Surely we knew that the issue existed way back, possibly this time last year, and that we were facing some guaranteed maximum price the size of which we did not know.  I recall the Taoiseach speaking first of putting &euro;400 million to &euro;650 million by for this project.  Was it a mistake by the Government to put the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform back into the Department of Finance?  Would it not have been better if the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, had simply been the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, and able to do his job-----</p></speech>

The Public Service Superannuation (Age of Retirement) Act 2018 has no effect on those public servants who availed of the interim arrangements.  The terms of their fixed term contracts will continue to apply and they will cease working at age 66 as previously provided.</p>  <p>  Work on the report under section 3A(6) has commenced.

The report is under way, as the Minister has said.  During the passage of the Bill in the D&aacute;il and the Seanad, I had said that we also have to be cognisant of others, and Members agreed with me.  There is this cohort, and we all share in concern for them, but we also must be mindful of those public sector workers who did not avail of those interim arrangements.  If we were to enter into an arrangement - which the Attorney General has advised is not possible without legislative remedies on foot of the report - where would it leave those public servants who retired with a commitment from the Government that the interim arrangements were just that?  We had good discussions in the Houses and on Committee Stage about what would we do with the public servants who had decided not to enter into interim arrangements.  There was no real answer forthcoming on that.  It was pointed out, and the Government and I understood, that there was a difficulty for those people.  When the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, announced the Bill and the parameters of the legislation, and when the Bill was brought into the House, it was made very clear that - unfortunately for the people concerned - the arrangements for those reaching the age of 65 in 2018 were interim arrangements only for one year until they reach the age of 66.  Some other people had also fallen out of their interim arrangements during the passage of the Bill, and the delay in the legislation.</p></speech>

While we all accepted the advice the Minister of State was given about this cohort of people who may not have accepted the interim arrangements and the unfairness in that regard, I certainly understood we would look at this issue as part of the report and, I hope, find a way forward.  Whether it would be through a legislative or other solution, no one could say before the report was completed.  However, that is not impression I am now getting in terms of what the report will indicate.  We will just have to wait for it.</p></speech>

If there is a remedy, it may require legislation to give effect to it.  I made it very clear, as did the Government more widely, that there might not be a remedy, taking into account those who were included in this arrangement.  More importantly, I refer to those who did not avail of the interim arrangements because of the very clear commitment of the Government that those who entered into them were doing so for one year only and that there would be no continuation, regardless of when the legislation was passed.  I understand the concerns.  The Government and everyone in the House understand them.

There has been no access to it for tourists since last summer.  While work is ongoing, the pace of change is slow.  I am also concerned about other sites nationally where similar scenarios could emerge where a keyholder retires and access for tourists ceases.</p></reply>

This system worked well for many years, with a significant number of visitors gaining entry and good positive feedback being received from them.  However, the person in question retired unexpectedly from the post early last year and has not yet been replaced.  The OPW is working with Meath County Council to put in place a new arrangement whereby the key will be held in the local heritage centre facility which has recently been opened and which will in the future be a major focus for tourists in the town.  In addition, the OPW is engaging with a local tourism group, with a view to appointing another local keyholder who will be able to address issues at the site that cannot be managed by the heritage centre.  This is being done to ensure the greatest possible access to the site will be restored, while also making sure the historic building is not damaged.</p></speech>

She retired last summer and the town, wider region, tourists, archaeologists and historians were very grateful to gain that access through her.  Keyholders nationally provide access for limited reward and from a sense of love for their native towns and areas.  They take on the role with the OPW for the greater good, for which I pay tribute to them.  It is unfortunate, however, that when someone retires, having done tremendous work over many decades, significantly beyond normal retirement age, as discussed in the previous question I tabled, matters are left to stand with no access being provided.  There is no succession plan from the OPW.  I pay tribute to the Kells and district tourism network which the OPW is asking to find a keyholder.  While it will be good if someone suitable and willing to do the work is found, which I hope will happen, it is a burdensome role from the perspective of what is required by the OPW.  I accept that it is probably necessarily so, given what needs to be done to ensure a monument is protected and people are let in.  However, the OPW and the local authority must play a more proactive role to ensure the huge gaps in access will not occur and that the particular gap will be closed as soon as possible.</p></speech>

I acknowledge that work is now taking place, but it should not all be left to voluntary tourism groups.  It is something to watch out for in the future.  Last night I attended a meeting in Clonalvy, County Meath where there is another extremely important monument, FourKnocks, which is of equal standing to the momuments in Newgrange and Knowth.  Mr. White continues to give out the key on a regular basis.  There are so many such sites nationally that it was about time someone acknowledged it.  The OPW probably does so, but the individuals in question should be acknowledged nationally for the work they do to keep the sites open, while places that are considered to be more important, whether it be World Heritage Organisation sites such as Newgrange or sites in other parts of the country which historically have had more political clout, have visitor centres, seen substantial developments or have full-time staff.  The people in question do a great deal of work and it is important that it be recognised.</p></speech>

The River Erne is a major waterway which, unfortunately, causes serious flooding in parts of counties Cavan, Fermanagh and Donegal.  I ask that consideration be given to amending the 1945 Act to include further major river systems such as the River Erne navigation system which is a critical waterway through the three aforementioned counties.  The river rises in County Cavan and flows into County Fermanagh and on to County Donegal.  There are particular problems in County Fermanagh and I have been urging the Department, with its counterpart in Northern Ireland, to address the flooding issues.  Adequate drainage works will never be carried out if they are only done piecemeal under small-scale schemes.  The River Erne must be brought under the 1945 Act and a proper programme of drainage and remediation works put in place.</p></reply>

The maintenance of arterial and drainage district channels, as designated under the Arterial Drainage Act 1945, is the responsibility of the OPW and local authorities, respectively.  It includes maintenance by the OPW of the Boyne, Inny and Glyde-and-Dee arterial drainage schemes in County Cavan.  In 2018 it included 78 km of river channel maintenance at an estimated cost of &euro;460,000.  Owing to nationally increasing urbanisation, the Arterial Drainage Act 1945 was amended in 1995 to facilitate the OPW's implementation of localised flood relief schemes to provide flood protection for cities, towns and villages.</p><p>Flood risk management plans were launched in May 2018, following the largest ever study of flood risk in Ireland.  The study identified that Government investment was feasible to protect 95% of properties assessed as being at risk from significant flooding through flood relief schemes.  Together with this legislative amendment and in line with the Government's 2004 policy on flood risk management, the OPW has no plans for catchment-wide arterial drainage schemes.  However, to target the management of flood risk outside cities, towns and villages, in 2009 the OPW introduced the minor flood mitigation works and coastal protection scheme.  The purpose of the scheme is to provide funding for local authorities to undertake flood mitigation works or studies to address localised flooding and coastal protection problems within their administrative areas.  Since 2009, approximately &euro;46.4 million has been approved for in excess of 720 projects throughout the country, which illustrates the scheme's many benefits for communities all over Ireland.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-02-07a.535" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" time="15:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019020700036#MM00200"><p>I welcome the opportunity to update the House on the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes.  In particular, I would like to update Deputies on the commission's fourth interim report and what I have been doing to progress issues since the work of the commission began.  As Deputies are aware, the commission submitted a fourth interim report to me last December, which I published after securing Government approval on 22 January.  The report is available to view and download on the Department's website.  The commission advised that it would not be able to issue its reports within the previously agreed timeframe and requested an extension of one year to allow it to complete its work in full.  The Government has agreed to this extension request and the commission is now due to submit its final reports by February 2020.</p>  <p>  In making a case for an extension, the commission outlined the sheer scale of the work involved in investigating the matters set out under its terms of reference.  The investigation includes multiple lines of inquiry relating to the operation of quite different institutions over a period of more than three quarters of a century.  The scope of the terms of reference and timeline for this commission has always been ambitious and we remain ambitious for the outcome of the commission.  The public interest and, most importantly, the interest of former residents is best served by facilitating the commission to conduct the comprehensive analysis required to make accurate and robust findings on the extensive range of sensitive issues before it.  I know that many former residents have been eagerly awaiting the completion of the commission's work and I understand that many who contributed to the process and shared their information are disappointed and frustrated by this development.</p>  <p>  The commission's fourth interim report provides an update on its important work engaging with former residents and others connected with these institutions.  It has captured the personal experiences of 519 witnesses through the work of its confidential committee, and this process was expected to be completed by the end of January.  Hearing these stories grounds the work of the commission in the lived experiences of those who spent time in these institutions.  The commission is continuing to take evidence about conditions in the institutions from former residents, workers and the authorities that ran the institutions and this work is not yet complete.  The commission also stated that its wide terms of reference have necessitated the collection and analysis of a vast range of documentary material relating to the institutions under investigation.  While this process is ongoing, I can confirm that the Department has furnished the commission with all relevant records in its possession.</p>  <p>  Significantly, the commission now plans to deliver by 15 March 2019 a substantial report on the burial arrangements for persons who died while resident in these institutions.  The report will include extensive technical reports prepared in the course of the commission's work on the site of the former mother and baby home in Tuam, County Galway and the commission's assessment of burial arrangements at other major institutions.  I will seek formal Government approval to publish the report as quickly as possible after I have had an opportunity to consider its findings.</p>  <p>  Upon receipt of the interim report, I consulted with the commission to explore whether any of its three reports could be completed in advance of February 2020.  The commission is strongly of the view that it will not be possible to complete any of its reports in isolation from its companion reports.  When I met Judge Yvonne Murphy I was reassured by the absolute commitment of the commission to establishing the full facts of what happened to women and children in these institutions.  I accept that the commission is using its best endeavours to conclude the investigation as quickly as possible.  The chair wants to conclude matters, and I know the Deputies in the House want the same thing.  It is clear that the commission is seeking to collate and analyse information on these institutions at a level of detail that has never been done before.  This will greatly assist public understanding and possibly assist individual citizens with their personal stories and experiences.</p>  <p>  I can confirm that the extension of time for the commission will not impact on the planned forensic excavation of the Tuam site.  These are separate processes.  However, the commission's burials report is expected to assist and inform the ongoing work to advance the legislative and operational arrangements for this priority project.  If a decision had been made not to grant the extension sought, the commission would, effectively, be obliged to submit incomplete reports this month.  Clearly, such a scenario would ultimately undermine its findings and impact on the opportunity within this process for Irish society to acknowledge and start to understand the harrowing manner in which single women and their children were often treated during this period.  This would be placed at risk.  In these circumstances, the Government's approval of an extension was the only viable option.  The Government will continue to make available whatever resources and supports are required for the commission to continue its vital work.  The commission has confirmed that despite the extension, it expects total costs to remain within the initial costs estimate of &euro;21.5 million.</p>  <p>  In October 2018, the Government approved the recommendation for the phased forensic excavation of the available site of the former mother and baby home in Tuam, County Galway.  As the Minister responsible, I was honoured to make a recommendation to colleagues, which was not only supported by the best experts in science and law but, more importantly, was also informed by the voices of survivors, families and loved ones.  Implementing this decision will not be straightforward.  New legislation is needed to provide specific lawful authority for the proposed course of action.</p>  <p>  The preparation of legislation is a key priority in the Department and a new dedicated unit has been established for this task with additional staff from other Departments expected to be assigned to the unit in the coming weeks.  The wider interdepartmental group on Tuam, led by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, will continue to assist in terms of strategy and overall approach for the project.  Scoping of the required legislation has commenced.  There is no precedent for this kind of project in an Irish context and it is vital that we get it right in the interests of the survivors and the relatives and dignity of those buried at the site in Tuam.  The approach taken will be further informed by the forthcoming report in March on burials at these institutions.  In parallel to the legislative project, work will be carried out on sourcing appropriate expertise to carry out the works.  As Minister, I will continue to examine the ways we can respond to the wider concerns of the advocates, families and survivors.</p>  <p>  While the commission's work and the work regarding Tuam is ongoing, I am committed to engaging with former residents about their needs.  The collaborative forum of former residents, which I established last year, has assisted in constructive engagement with former residents.  It was established as a progressive response to the theme of "nothing about us without us", which emerged from facilitated consultations with former residents and their advocates.  I recently received the collaborative forum's report, which identifies a number of issues of concern to former residents and includes a series of recommendations on matters of priority to them and their families.  I am considering the recommendations made in the report that fall under the Department's remit, which include access to records and concerns about how Tusla deals with requests for information, tracing and access to records.  There are arrangements in place with Tusla in regard to these services.  I will look at ways in which these services could be improved where possible.</p>  <p>  The report also makes recommendations on access to health services.  Memorialisation and commemoration are also strong themes in the report, as is the appropriate use of language and terminology.  Many of the recommendations do not fall within the remit of the Department.  However, I am engaging with my Government colleagues and their respective Departments to discuss and progress these matters further.  I propose to bring the report to Cabinet shortly to facilitate its consideration by the Government and I hope to have responses to at least some of the recommendations when I do so.</p>  <p>  Picking up on questions and concerns raised by Deputies recently regarding Bethany Home, it might be helpful to set out some of the background on the matter.</p><p> As Deputies will be aware, my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy McHugh, is responsible for the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002 legislation and related arrangements.  The redress scheme established under the Act has not been extended to any additional institutions since 2005.  When the Ryan report was published in 2009 there were a number of calls for the redress scheme to be extended to include additional institutions, including the Bethany Home.  The Bethany Home is one of the 14 named mother and baby homes currently being examined by the current commission. </p> <p> Mother and baby homes and related institutions have never been the focus of a statutory investigation before.  The decision regarding extending the scheme has been reviewed on a number of occasions by this Government and the previous Government.  There is no change in the decision not to extend the scheme.  In its second interim report, the commission suggested eligibility for the scheme be re-examined.  We examined it carefully and concluded it was not possible to implement redress at that time. </p> <p> In reaching that conclusion the Government was conscious the commission has made no findings to date regarding abuse or neglect, and believes it would not be appropriate to deal with the question of redress in advance of any conclusions by the commission.  Deputies may also wish to note that the Bethany Home survivors are represented on the membership of collaborative forum and the report contains powerful contributions from the member representing the Bethany Home and Protestant survivor groups.  I met representatives of the forum when it presented me with its initial report in December.  I heard from some of the members at first hand and was deeply moved by that testimony from them.  Information on the forum can be found on my Department's website.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-02-07a.537" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1231" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019020700037#NN00200"><p>This is my third time to stand here as the Minister seeks an extension regarding the commission of investigation.  On the two turns before this I was favourable to, approving of and co-operative with the request.  Today, I am disappointed.  The Minister will understand why I am disappointed to see yet another extension to the commission of investigation timelines.  That is particularly the case for the survivors and the families affected by what happened in the mother and baby homes and who have been awaiting this report for years at this stage.</p>  <p>  Only the other night, the "Prime Time" programme covered this issue from Tuam.  Three gentlemen, Peter, Pat and Tommy, spoke up.  I spoke about Tommy in this House before.  His final comments on that programme referred to the survivors getting old.  He hoped this issue was not being dragged out so that no one would be left to talk about it or fight for the survivors.  That is how he sees it, which is unfortunate because that is not the intention of the commission of investigation.  I have no doubt the commission and the Minister want to get to the bottom of this matter.  It is, however, unfortunate that we are going into another year of waiting.  </p>  <p>  We need to get some answers and to see where this process is going.  The "Prime Time" programme the other night brought up many questions I have brought up in this House before.  I look forward to getting answers to those questions and I feel those answers will feed into the commission of investigation.  I am referring, in particular, to the role of Galway County Council in all of this.  I want to know in particular what its role was as it started building houses in the 1970s when the council knew about the sites prior to that.  The maps have become available.  </p>  <p>  Tommy told the story previously about how, after five years and two months, he was very lucky to be "sponsored".  That was the word used.  He also spoke about later in his life getting the price of a bike when he turned 18.  The price of that bike came from Galway County Council.  I know, therefore, that there are many records and much information there.  I need to know exactly how many other people got the price of a bike.  How many other families got that allowance for caring for those people?  That will tie up much of the information needed.  I need to know serious co-operation is taking place between Galway County Council and the commission of investigation.  The survivors would also like to know co-operation is happening.  </p>  <p>  I also want to know about the role of the coroner in all of this.  What information was available to the coroners, what have they shared and how have they engaged?  That is a major piece of this jigsaw but nobody is talking about the role of the coroner in respect of the death certificates.  We have spoken of birth certificates but death certificates have not been mentioned.  I am sure all of the deaths had to be recorded somewhere, at whatever age those deaths might have taken place, be it adults or children.  The role of the coroners links back in again to Galway County Council.  The council has a major role to play in this investigation.  It is the silent body with no statements whatsoever coming out.  </p>  <p>  I am cross about the council in this regard.  The reason is that when I speak of the Pats, the Tommys, the Peters or whoever and when I go to Galway County Council to seek some form of housing adaptation grants for those people I know have been through the mother and baby homes, I can get very little co-operation.  This issue has been raised previously.  There should be some streamlining of the system in order that I can help some of the former residents of the mother and baby homes when they need adaptation grants.  Some of those people have disabilities yet they are being long-fingered.  That is wrong.  Certain comforts are required for these people.  I am referring to day-to-day practicalities.  They are not within the remit of the Minister's Department but they are within the remit of local government.  </p>  <p>  There should be some form of co-operation on that issue while we are awaiting the results of the commission of investigation.  I think the final report of the commission is going to be quite damning from the point of view of Galway County Council.  I want to see that report and I want to see it soon.  Age is not on the side of the survivors.  That is wrong.  I refer to Peter, who wants to know the story and is going through the High Court now to find the link with his sister.  We are denying that man the opportunity to have knowledge of his family.  We are forcing him down the road of the courts.  That is not right.  </p>  <p>  The people of Tuam are not proud, by any manner or means, that this is being dragged out for so long.  They would like this issue brought to a conclusion.  Burials and excavation works are now going to take place.  All of that is taking place, however, in a vacuum. We do not know what has fed into it in respect of the commission of investigation.  I implore the Minister, and the people she has commissioned to do this work, to please stick to the timelines on this extension.  It is essential that we do not have to look for even another hour of an extension.  The targets set out by the Minister today in the interim report should be followed through.  I state that because I have last year's statement concerning this process running from 2018 into 2019.  Now we have it running from 2019 into 2020.  That is not good enough.  It cannot happen again.</p>  <p>  In her report, the Minister also stated the cost would be &euro;21.5 million.  One of the initial reports referred to &euro;6 million to &euro;12 million and now the cost has gone to &euro;21.5 million.  I can understand an expansion but in respect of the costings we need to keep things in line and within targets.  We also need to know exactly where we are spending that money.  I do not mind spending it because these people need answers.  That is not what this is about.  Let us, however, meet our targets and give these people a definite answer.  </p></speech>

Many Deputies, across this House, expressed their frustration with the delays but by and large, it was understood at the time.  With this second delay, that frustration is now turning to anger.  I am sure the Minister is aware of the sheer disappointment this delay has caused.  The survivors of these mother and baby homes have waited a lifetime for their stories to be heard.  To be told, yet again, that they have to wait another year is an injustice.</p>  <p>  The Coalition of Mother and Baby Home Survivors described the second one-year delay as an absolute kick in the teeth for the people who will never see justice or an apology or redress.  The Irish First Mothers group has described the delay as a mechanism for evading redress, while the Tuam Home Survivors Network has called the delay devastating.  This is powerful.  What does the Minister suggest we tell these victims, what words of comfort can we supply?</p><p>What do we tell the survivors of the Bethany Home who were wrongly excluded from the 2002 redress scheme?  They have described the Government&rsquo;s attitude towards them as a policy of delay and denial until they die.  Many survivors' and relatives' groups are beginning to feel the same, because every time a report is on the horizon there is another pushback.  I raised the question of whether it was a matter of resources.  Why was it that in December some 26 people were still waiting for their testimony to be heard?</p> <p> According to the report, the HSE yet again seems not to have a clue where the files are.  One institution that is referenced is the Castle in Donegal.  It operated until 2006, yet the HSE, which was heavily involved, has not handed over any documentation - zilch.  I acknowledge and share the commission's frustration on the matter, but it is utterly shocking.</p> <p> In the part of the report that covers burial arrangements, it is stated that a geophysical survey has been conducted at the site of the former Sean Ross Abbey in recent weeks and that further investigations may be carried out, depending on the findings. Will similar surveys be conducted at the former Bessborough mother and baby home in Cork?  Not only was it run by the same religious order as the Sean Ross Abbey but the death register shows that 470 children and ten women died there between 1934 and 1953.  The religious order, however, seems to have provided different figures to State inspectors for the same period.</p> <p> All the facts I have outlined make it important that this mother and baby home is surveyed in the same manner as the Sean Ross Abbey.  It seems that much of what is contained in the interim report has been copied and pasted from the previous one.  Each delay to the final report not only means there will be a longer wait for justice and closure for the survivors but also that many people will not see the truth, justice or closure, which is a harsh reality.  As I have previously stated to the Minister, justice delayed is justice denied.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-02-07a.540" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1239" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="15:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019020700038#OO00200"><p>We all accept the scale of the commission's task in investigating this shameful chapter in the State&rsquo;s past.  The need to investigate mother and baby homes and the provision of redress to survivors have been debated in the Chamber for the past 15 years.  In 2005, my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, called on the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to include mother and baby homes in the work of the Ryan commission.  Members of the Opposition in the D&aacute;il and Seanad repeatedly called on Governments led by Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael to recognise the wrongs endured by the women and children who passed through the doors of the institutions but their demands fell on deaf ears.</p>  <p>  The Minister's recent apology to survivors for the further delay to the commission completing its work was welcome, for what it was worth.  I accept the sincerity of her belief that by granting an extension of 12 months, the final report will provide a better picture of what happened in the institutions.  Unfortunately, however, the Minister's sentiments are not matched by her Department's actions.  I was alarmed to learn that it took two full years for her Department and the Department of Health to hand over the first tranche of discovery to the commission.  Even after such an inexplicable delay, the material provided by both Departments was just one tenth of the documentation that would follow over the next year and a half.  As late as November 2018, the commission was informed of many thousands of pages of discovery yet to be handed over.</p>  <p>  While that is bad, the HSE has fared even worse.  It has been unable to provide documentation of its involvement in institutions from as recently as 2006, as Deputy Mitchell noted.  The fourth interim report indicates that the commission is dismayed that so little relevant documentation has been found by the HSE.  It also reveals that the HSE does not have a system for storing or archiving material.  How can it be that any State agency in 2019 does not have an archiving policy and procedure embedded in all levels of its administration function?  As an aside, it is reminiscent of the behaviour of state authorities north of the Border, which seek to hide information from families seeking the truth about legacy inquests and past events.</p>  <p>  Many survivors and families simply no longer have confidence in the Government or the State to do the right thing.  It is as stark as that.  They fear that the Government is dragging its heels in a cynical attempt to limit the State&rsquo;s redress liabilities to a small group of survivors whose numbers decline with each passing year.</p>  <p>  I make particular reference, as the Minister did, to the survivors of the Bethany Home.  As she will know, detailed research undertaken by Dr. Niall Meehan on behalf of the survivors provides a catalogue of State culpability dating as far back as 1939.  Let us not forget that statutory inspections of maternity homes began in 1934, and the Bethany Home was inspected from 1935.  Just four years later, the State&rsquo;s deputy chief medical adviser ignored the advice of a departmental inspector who wanted a Bethany Home nurse mother to be prosecuted for severe neglect.  At least 247 children died in the institution. Some 222 of those babies and children have been memorialised by survivors in Mount Jerome Cemetery, and it is possible that more died.  Children were routinely shipped out to unsuitable homes in Ireland and further afield.  We know that at least 54 of those children died from convulsions, 41 from heart failure and 26 from malnutrition or starvation.  In 2017, by examining the records of undertakers, the group discovered 25 additional children, many of whom also died from malnutrition.</p>  <p>  Mr. Derek Leinster, arguably the leader of the group, has outlined his heartbreaking story of abuse and neglect, as are those stories of survivors who have since passed away without justice or redress.  In 2016, the commission stated in its second interim report that, logically, children resident at the Bethany Home and similar homes should be eligible for the residential institutions redress scheme.  I cannot for the life of me understand why the Minister has not taken it upon herself to champion that cause.  I do not accept her blithely setting the matter aside and telling us that the Government position remains the same.</p>  <p>  On Tuam, which the Minister mentioned, if legislation is needed for the gathering of DNA, let us have it promptly.  We must listen to victims and survivors.</p></speech>

Deputy Daly raised it again during Leaders' Questions.  Mother and baby homes are one of the darkest parts of our history.</p></speech>
