The purpose of the redesign was to facilitate a new process within the Department whereby forms would be scanned rather than manually keyed into the new IT system.  Claims received on the new forms and certificates are being processed into the payment system on the same day as they are received.  That is a significant improvement on behalf or our clients.  The introduction of the redesigned form was discussed with the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, in advance.  The IMO advised its members, one month before its introduction, that they should co-operate with the use of the new forms.</p>  <p>  The Department subsequently communicated directly with general practitioners, GPs, as is our responsibility, shortly before the introduction of the redesigned forms.  Given the confusion that has arisen over the last couple of months, we have to accept that we should probably have communicated directly with the GPs more quickly than we did.  We accept that and we apologise.</p>  <p>  The majority of the certificates in the claim forms that are now being received each day by the Department are the new scannable versions.  These claims are being processed without any delay.  However, some GPs have continued to use the old forms after the changeover date.  To facilitate the continued payment of the illness and injury benefits to our clients, my Department has, to date, considered to accept those old forms.  While their continued use causes delays to our processing times, my Department is doing everything possible to ensure that customers are paid as quickly as possible.  There is currently a backlog of two days in processing the old forms and certificates.</p>  <p>  The introduction of these and other initiatives is the subject of ongoing discussions with the IMO.  A framework and timetable have been agreed with the IMO, during which intensive discussions are planned.  New processes will not be introduced until these discussions are concluded and advance notice, including details of any changes to payment arrangements, will be provided to the individual GPs directly from my Department.  It is important to note that the Department has had a long and positive relationship with GPs for many years.  We are committed to working hard to resolve any outstanding issues which cause concerns among our GP partners.</p>  <p>  I would like to put on the record of the House my immense gratitude to the people in the illness benefit section of my Department.  They worked tirelessly, including coming in at weekends, to ensure that the clients, who rely on the weekly payment and have no other form of income, did not have to wait due to a delay.  We had to find a work-around IT system because had already moved to the new system and the old system was therefore not working.  I say genuinely, and do not think it can be understated, that they worked their socks off to ensure the service we give to our clients is as good and reliable as it always is.  I, for one, am exceptionally grateful for their commitment.</p></speech>

The Minister said that the IMO was consulted.  The Minister must be aware that the IMO only represents approximately 18%, fewer than one in five of practitioners who have to certify people for illness benefit.  If I heard her correctly, the Minister also said that individual GPs were informed shortly before the new forms went out.  My information is that the prescribing GP simply got all these new forms with a whole lot of different information and different questions from what had hitherto been the case and was simply told to get on with it without any consultation or discussion.  I think the Minister has accepted that this is not a proper way to do business.</p><p>What percentage of GPs are using the new forms at present?  Are there residual difficulties as a result of the fact that the full transition has not taken place?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-09-26a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1252" speakername="John Brady" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018092600004#B00200"><p>I want to be associated with the Minister's comments about the staff dealing with the illness benefit forms.  The reason they had to come in and work those extra hours, however, was the unmitigated disaster and mess that was created by the officials and by the Deputy herself, as Minister, in unilaterally introducing these new forms on 6 August without any proper consultation.  It is interesting that she said that one month before the introduction, the IMO was consulted and informed that it should co-operate with the use of these forms.  That is exactly what the Minister said, and that is certainly not consultation.  I also heard her apologise to the GPs.  That must be welcomed.  She needs to extend that apology to the people.  We are dealing with some of the sickest people in the State such as cancer patients and terminally ill people who, unfortunately, were caught up in this complete mess.  The National Association of General Practitioners, NAGP, to which Deputy O'Dea alluded, representing the vast majority of GPs, has tried to engage with the Minister and the Department in this entire process and has been completely ignored.  Has there been or will there be engagement?  It is critically important that one of the organisations that represents the vast majority of GPs has not been consulted, negotiated with or simply spoken to.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-09-26a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018092600004#B00300"><p>I do not know whether Deputy O'Dea is aware of the long-standing relationship - it has existed for many years - between my Department and GPs.  We rely on them not only for illness benefit, but also for carer's benefit and a variety of other schemes.  They are an invaluable resource to both the people they serve and to the Department.  We have never, ever told anyone to get on with anything, so I do not know who is giving Deputy O'Dea his information but it is not quite accurate.  Our relationship with individual GPs is based on individual contracts.  There are no representative bodies with which we negotiate or mediate.  We deal directly with our GPs.  However, out of respect for the long-standing framework that has existed in this country, of which Deputy O'Dea is well aware, and which was established by Fianna F&aacute;il many years ago, and perhaps to flag potential issues we ourselves within the Department would not have seen, we did have discussions with the IMO.  Those discussions were fruitful and, notwithstanding other issues and other new efficiencies that will be discussed over the coming months, the IMO instructed its GPs that they should move ahead with the new, more efficient process being enabled by the Department to ensure the efficiencies provided by the GPs and the Department result in expedited claims and payments for the clients who rely on them.  This is exactly what happened for all the GPs who used the new forms that were scanned in.  Normally one must wait a week and get paid a week in arrears on an illness payment.  People are now getting paid on day two.  There are huge efficiencies, and I am very grateful to all the GPs who have come on board.  I apologise to the Acting Chairman for rabbiting on.  To answer Deputy O'Dea's question, I do not have a percentage, but the vast majority of claims coming in to us daily are on the new scannable forms.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-09-26a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1227" speakername="Willie O'Dea" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018092600004#B00400"><p>The Minister asked me whether I am aware of the relationship between her Department and the GPs - yes, I am - and who informed me that the GPs were told to get on with it - the GPs did.  Given her Department has such a wonderful relationship with GPs, this is a pretty shoddy way to treat them, with respect.  As Deputy Brady has said, there is an organisation that represents over 80% of GPs and has sought to consult directly with the Department, and for the life of me I cannot understand why the Department chooses to consult with an organisation representing 18% of GPs and refuses point-blank to consult with an organisation representing 82% of GPs.  The Minister referred to "the vast majority" in response.  The vast majority would be well over 50%.  The information I got - and I got it in writing - is that, as of yesterday, 80% of GPs are still relying on the old forms and doing photocopies, etc.</p></speech>

It appears to me that the only reason these forms were introduced was to make the process more efficient for the Department, certainly not for patients.  This is what we see.  I mentioned cancer patients and terminally ill people who are being caught up in this complete debacle.  It is not the first time the Department has made a complete mess of changeovers, of introducing new schemes and so on.  We saw this last year with the dental examinations that were introduced without any consultation with dentists or any organisations and the mess this created at the time, and that is a fact.  The Minister can shake her head.</p></speech>

I ask the Minister to conclude on this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-09-26a.29" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018092600004#B01300"><p>Public policy on discussions or consultations with professional organisations such as those representing GPs has, since about the mid-1970s, been to engage with one representative body rather than try to negotiate or communicate with multiple bodies claiming to hold the mandate for that particular group of people.  The Deputy cannot say on the one hand that one organisation represents 80% of the people it represents when, on the other, another organisation claims more or less the same thing because both sets of details cannot be true.  In the case of GPs, the representative body which is affiliated with ICTU and has been for many years is the IMO.  The NAGP is a relatively new body which is not affiliated with ICTU, and the Department's understanding is that its membership is less than that of the IMO.  Nevertheless, the Department is happy to take input from the NAGP and has had some contact with the organisation and will consider any input we receive from it regarding any efficiencies it might like to see in our system and our offering.  We will, however, continue to hold substantive discussions with the IMO as it is the body that is recognised as holding the representative rights for all GPs.</p>  <p>  If Deputy Brady wants to make stuff up as he goes along, that is his will, and it is probably a practice that is well engaged by Sinn F&eacute;in.  The reality of the matter is that the new forms and the new system have brought far greater efficiencies than were ever there before.  When we used to get an old form and it had to be manually inputted, people would have to wait perhaps five or six days for their illness payments.  Now when the form comes in it is scanned in on the same day and the client gets the payment the following day.  I do not know in what world Deputy Brady does not think that is a better system.  In our world, however, we think that having efficiencies is a good thing, not only in the Department, which ultimately saves the Department money and allows us then to spend that money elsewhere.  Perhaps in Deputy Brady's world it is not a good thing.</p></speech>

This included the policy to introduce the TCA model.  The consultation process was lengthy, thorough and inclusive and involved regional seminars, a national conference and consultation meetings with sectoral interests, as well as many written submissions.  The consultation informed the development of the 2010 national pensions framework, which set out the policy to introduce the TCA, indeed by Deputy O'Dea's party, which was in government at that stage.  This approach was subsequently endorsed by the OECD in its review of the Irish pension system in 2013.</p>  <p>  As the Government intends to introduce the TCA from 2020, I launched a public consultation on its design on 28 May.</p><p>This consultation is not about the policy concept or rationale, which has been well thought out, but the design and implementation of the TCA.  My Department invited a range of sectoral interest groups and the media to the formal launch at which we provided, I hope, an informative presentation.  More important, we hosted a series of workshops on the various aspects of the proposed reform and there was also a separate briefing for Members of the Oireachtas and their staff.  The consultation was hosted on the Department's website and it was open to everyone to submit responses and make submissions.</p> <p> The consultation lasted for over three months and we received almost 300 responses by the time it closed on 3 September.  These responses are being examined and considered and we will publish a summary of the outcomes on the Department's website when that work is completed, and I will also let the Deputy know the details.  The initial analysis shows the main areas of concern to respondents include the number of contributions required to receive a full pension, the amount of credited contributions that will be available and whether there should be a phase-in period for its introduction.</p> <p> I thank all those who made submissions.  I was at pains to ensure we did not just get representative bodies replying in an official capacity, given that is their job.  I was keen to hear from the people who will be affected by this.  In the main, we have received a substantial number of submissions from them and I am grateful for their co-operation.</p></speech>

How wedded is the Government to the 40-year baseline?  The Minister will be aware the national pensions framework document envisaged a baseline of 30 years.</p>  <p>  Second, the system in place at present requires 520 paid contributions for a person to be considered for a contributory pension.  Has there been any feedback on that aspect?  Does the Government intend to stick with that or is it open to change?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-09-26a.39" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" time="10:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018092600005#C00300"><p>On the first point, the issue was raised in a number of submissions.  I am a told a Deputy made a similar submission, although I am not sure if it was Deputy O'Dea.  I am conscious it is one of the matters that has to be considered before we make the final decision.  Forty years is the norm for many pensions and it is the number that will be required under the TCA 2012 model.  When the legislation is passed in regard to those affected by the 2012 rate band changes, the Deputy will be aware that as the class S contributions were only introduced in 1988, it will be challenging for many self-employed people to qualify for a full pension by 2020 if the number of contributions at the time exceeds 32.  The early analysis from the consultation shows that, for some of those who responded, a more transitional model is preferred, whereby those qualifying in 2020 would have a lower bar than those qualifying in the later years and would have the opportunity to catch up by, say, 2028, given that the latter would have had more access to PRSI contributions than the people who were there beforehand.  The Deputy will appreciate that I cannot pre-empt any of the deliberations we will have on the outcome.  However, the reason we ask for submissions is to consider them exceptionally carefully.</p>  <p>  With regard to the Deputy's other point, the number of paid contributions to qualify for the contributory State pension has increased over the years.  The most recent increase to 520 was agreed and passed in legislation by the Deputy's party in government in 1997 and implemented in 2012.  This was also raised in a number of submissions, including that made by the Deputy on behalf of his party.  Again, it is something that will be considered in the context of the new proposals.  Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.</p></speech>

How long will that option last?  I take it that it will only apply to pensioners who become 66 before the TCA comes into operation.</p>  <p>  There is a proposal for home caring credits to replace the current homemaker system.  Will there be any difference?  Will the same types of people be covered for credits under the new home carer system when compared to the homemaker system?</p></speech>

Again, it is not me who will be wedded to making the decision.  It will be made mindful of all the submissions that are made.  I want to ensure that when we introduce this next year or the year after in legislation, it will be with the agreement of all of us because we think it is the right thing to do for the generations to come, which might include myself and the Deputy.  We will do it collectively and we will do what is in the best interest of pensioners going forward.</p>  <p>  The homemaker's credit is outdated.  Historically, it was only women who made homes and we all know that is not the reality of many people's lives today.  It will be called a caring credit.  It will not just be confined to children but will be extended to adults who may be looking after their parents or a sibling who might not be lucky enough to have good health.  I want to ensure that people who are caring, and who are an invaluable resource not only to their families but to the State, are recognised and their contributions towards their State pension are fulfilled.</p></speech>

Within this region, unemployment has fallen from a peak of 16.6% in 2012 to 5.8% at the end of July 2018.  Numbers in employment in the region have increased from 153,700 to 214,200 over the same period.  While data from the labour force survey are not available on a county-by-county level, trends in the live register can give an indication of underlying trends in local unemployment.  I am pleased that they are positive for Tipperary.  Overall, the live register in Tipperary has fallen by 46% in the five years to August 2018, which is close to the reduction of 48% nationally.  If the Deputy is under the impression his area is lagging behind the rest of the country, I am pleased to tell him it is not.  In the year to August 2018, the live register in Tipperary had fallen by 1,270 people, or 12%, again, closely in line with national trends.  In Tipperary town, the live register has fallen from 1,840 in 2012 to 962 currently, that is, by almost half.</p>  <p>  The Government's primary strategy to tackle unemployment is twofold.  First, the Action Plan for Jobs, which was originally led by the former Minister for Jobs Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, and is now led by the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Heather Humphreys, sets out to create an environment in which businesses can succeed and create jobs.  That success is evident and I wish continued success to all of those people.  This policy now includes a specific regional action plan relating to the former south-east region, covering south Tipperary.  The plan has resulted in more than 21,000 jobs being created in the region in the past three years.  Successful implementation of the plan is targeted at the creation of 25,000 additional jobs in the region by 2020.  The plan aims to achieve this through building on key sectors of potential for the region like technology, biopharma and tourism in the beautiful county of Tipperary.</p></reply>

Variables used in the compilation of the HP index include those related to demographic growth, dependency ratios, education levels, single parenthood, overcrowding, social class, occupation and unemployment.</p>  <p>  Figures can be dressed up any way we like.  However, Tipperary town and its environs are in a sad place.  It has very proud people, wonderful entrepreneurs and a wonderful workforce but they are not getting the opportunity.  The Minister can throw us into the mix of the whole mid-west region and come up with what figures she wants.  However, according to the Pobal index, the overall male unemployment rate in north Tipperary stands at 14.5% while the figure is 14.2% in south Tipperary.  In the south of the county, according to the latest data for semi-skilled and unskilled classes, unemployment for this group stands at 23.7%.  Five years prior to that, in 2011, it stood at 23.9% so it reduced by just 0.2% in five years, no matter what way the Minister wants to dress up the figures.</p>  <p>  We need serious efforts by IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and others to bring industry to Tipperary town and its environs.  It is not fair to throw them into the mix, as the Minister did glowingly.  I ask her to come to visit the town to see the situation at first hand.</p></speech>

The Deputy asked for information on the huge unemployment issues in Tipperary and I have explained to him how fortunate Tipperary has been in the past number of years to have enjoyed the recovery it has, but we are not done.  I reassure the Deputy that every effort is being made to continue to create jobs, building on the good work of both international and local businesses in Tipperary in providing employment in both the town and the county.  The Government's goal is to create 200,000 jobs nationally by 2020, of which 135,000 are to be created outside the capital, which includes Tipperary.  The south-east regional Action Plan for Jobs was launched in September 2015 and it covers counties Carlow, Kilkenny, Tipperary, Waterford and Wexford.  The plan will see employment increasing in the region at a rate of 10% to 15% over the years from now until 2020.  That will result in the creation of 25,000 new jobs in the region, which will benefit the people of Tipperary town and county.  The reality is that tens of thousands of jobs are being created and that Tipperary is benefitting to nearly the same extent as the rest of the country.  Those are not my figures, it is just reality.</p></speech>

The real issue is in the Minister's last answer where she referred to the south-east region of Carlow, Kilkenny and Tipperary.  In an earlier answer, she said we were in the mid-west region.  That is the problem with Tipperary town.  It is on the border of the mid-west and the south east.  We are falling between all stools.  We do not have the jobs in Tipperary town, we do not have the IDA bringing visitors down and we do not have the factories either.  The Minister is looking through the figures and cosying them up to suit whatever she wants to say herself.  I gave her figures.  I gave her the deprivation indexes.  Tipperary town and its environs have been left behind badly over 25 to 30 years and it has not got the industry.  The Minister can quote figures from the mid-west or the south east, but I ask her to focus on west Tipperary, including Tipperary town.  The jobs are not there.  While we have thousands of foreign direct investment jobs in Clonmel and other parts of Tipperary, for which we are grateful, I am talking about west Tipperary, which is languishing behind.  The town is not being supported at national level or at local level by the county council.  We need support.  We are crying out for it.</p></speech>

This is the time, therefore, to reverse what was the worst cut during the period of difficulty and crisis, namely the cut to the single parent's allowance from 18 to seven years, which was introduced four or five years ago.  I am interested to know whether the Minister will do that and what policy approach she will take in that regard.  Those parents and families are 230% worse off than the average.  Their children are growing up in poverty.  Lone parents make up two thirds of the homelessness figures and they are usually women.  Will the Minister support them and will she reverse the policy?  It needs to change now.</p></reply>

The scheme currently supports more than 39,000 recipients and their almost 73,000 children and has played an important role in providing income support to lone parents since its introduction in 1997.  However, income support for lone parents was passive in nature in the past and involved limited engagement by the State employment services with recipients.  Research shows that being at work reduces the at-risk-of-poverty rate for lone parents by 75% compared to those who do not work.  This highlights that the best way to tackle poverty among lone parents is to assist them into education and then employment or directly into employment.  Access to activation supports is vital to achieve this objective and it is, therefore, imperative that the Department continues to engage with lone parents to assist them into good careers.</p>  <p>  The unconditional nature of the payment, which was unique in Europe, coupled with its long duration, has, over time, contributed to long-term social welfare dependency and, as the Deputy rightly describes, associated poverty among many lone parents and their children.  Reforms to the scheme were introduced to address the issue of poverty specifically.  The reforms provide enhanced access to the Department's Intreo service for lone parents once the youngest child turns seven years of age.   Access to the Department's range of education and employment support services is essential to facilitate lone parents to progress into sustainable employment and financial independence.  Budget 2018 contained a number of measures to support lone parents, including working lone parents.  For example, a lone parent on the jobseeker's transitional payment working 15 hours at the national minimum wage experienced an increase in his or her overall income of almost &euro;1,000 per annum.  The budget also increased the disregard and the qualified-child payment which changes saw some people being moved out of consistent poverty.  While I agree with the Deputy that we have a long way to go, it is only by intensifying the supports we give to those 39,000 lone parents that we will achieve fruitful careers and financial independence for them for the rest of their lives.</p></speech>

The facts belie the policy approach the Minister and her Department seem to be taking.  I understand that the Indecon report, which reviewed the effect of the cuts, showed a 50% increase in poverty for those families.  I disagree fundamentally with the basic premise that parenting is not work, does not count, is passive and does not matter, and that one has to get people into the workplace to tackle social inclusion.  If the Taoiseach said after the recent abortion referendum that the key thing we had to do now was make Ireland the best place in the world to raise all families, what is being done with these most vulnerable families is wrong.  It is an opinion which is formed on an economic analysis that caring does not matter and that lone parents are a problem who must be got out of the home and into the workplace at all costs.  It is a fundamentally wrong approach and a tragedy that it is applying now, whatever about it applying in 2012 when we had no money.  It is ideological and that is why I have a concern.  Even at a time of full employment and increasing income, the Government wants to stop supporting parents for an ideological reason.</p></speech>

I have done nothing since I was appointed to this position in June 2017 but advocate as strongly and loudly as I can to destigmatise the issues around lone parenting and to support lone parents.  I have made commitments to ensure I will continue to do that.  The Deputy has conflated the cuts that were made in 2012 and 2013 with the changes in policy.  I reiterate that the Indecon review on the one-parent family payment changes, which was worth every single penny we were charged, found that those changes resulted in an increase in employment among lone parents and a decrease in welfare dependency.  I am the first person to stand here and admit to the Deputy that the cuts were harsh, targeted and unfair.  That is why I am unravelling them.  However, I ask him to please not conflate those cuts with introduction of a new policy that provides educational and activation supports with a pathway to employment.  That policy has had a positive outcome, as borne out in the Indecon report.  The cuts were harsh and they will be unravelled but the Deputy should not conflate one policy with a cut.</p></speech>

It is purely the policy that concerns me.  We should not discriminate between one parent and another and, in particular, we should not discriminate against lone parents who are in most in need of the State's support.  We should not say to them that the way to help them is always through the paid workforce.</p><p>It is right for us to leave the parents with the choice for that and, for those parents who do not enter the workforce, to provide the supports we gave as early as the 1970s that fundamentally transformed the experience of being a lone parent in this country.  I believe the policy being applied by the Minister is having a deleterious effect on lone parents and their families.  All the evidence in the homeless statistics show the poverty figures and the levels of consistent poverty among children of lone parents.  This is not a huge budget issue with regard to numbers: I understand that the restoration might cost &euro;40 million or &euro;50 million.  It is the policy of the Department; it is not the Minister's policy because it was also there with the Labour Ministers before.  I fundamentally disagree with it and I ask the Minister to reconsider whether forcing people into the paid workforce is the best way of providing social protection.</p></speech>

I would like to know how much of that reduction is down to job creation and how much is down to individuals leaving the region's labour force through factors such as migration or retirement.  Does the Minister know if the number of people who are working in the region increased or decreased in that period, and if so by how much?</p></reply>

The most recent official data from the labour force survey show that at the end of the second quarter of 2018 to the beginning of August, the Deputy is correct, that unemployment in the area is now at about 7.2%.  As compared with the same period last year employment in the south-east region had risen by 6,100.  The labour force in the region had increased even faster, by 8,400, so that employment rose by about 2,400 over the year, with the unemployment rate rising from 6.4% to 7.2%.</p>  <p>  The figures for a single quarter at the regional level can be volatile and the labour force survey is a sample survey and therefore subject to sampling error.  Over the longer period since the recovery began in mid 2012, employment in the south east is up by almost 33,000, with the labour force increasing by 15,000 and unemployment decreasing by 18,000.</p>  <p>  Migration estimates are published at State level only, so it is not possible to identify the impact of migration on regional labour force and unemployment levels specifically in the Deputy's county.  The data quoted indicate that the reduction in unemployment is not attributable to a reduction in the labour force.</p>  <p>  The Government's primary strategy to tackle unemployment since 2012 is twofold.  First, we have the Action Plan for Jobs, which is led by my colleague the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, and we also have regional action plans that are yielding results through working with IDA Ireland and the local enterprise boards.  Second, we have Pathways to Work, and my Department ensures that as many new jobs and vacancies as possible are filled by people from the live register.  We have a tremendous relationship, which is growing, particularly because employers cannot find people when they have their stands at jobs fairs or through recruitment agencies.  Our relationships are growing and there are more piloted and targeted projects being worked on and developed, not least of which is Project Yes being launched this week.  Things are getting better.  The employment numbers are not matching the rates for people in employment.  The rates for people in employment are higher in most of the regions around the county than the drop in numbers on the unemployment register.</p></speech>

There are always issues about figures in here, such as those we heard about housing in the last while.  Is the Minister aware of the South East Economic Monitor?  I do not know if the Minister reads it but the latest edition was published a couple of months ago.  This publication provides an analysis of the regional economy carried out by independent non-politically affiliated academics.  It is independent of the Minister's Department interpretation and independent of my interpretation of what might be happening in Wexford or the south east.  One of the points made by the monitor is that between the first quarter of 2017 and the first quarter of 2018 the number of people in work increased by 62,000 nationally, but in the south east the monitor maintains that the number actually decreased.  There were 2,400 fewer people working in the south east in that period, and therefore the so-called reduction in unemployment is accounted for primarily by individuals leaving the region's labour force.  If that is true it is pretty worrying.  I do not know if the Minister is familiar with those statistics but I am interested to hear what she has to say about them.</p></speech>

My figures show that the amount of people taken off the live register is less than the amount of new people employed in the county.  This means that people who were not on the live register actively seeking jobs decided to take up the jobs that were being created or that people are moving to Wexford to take up the jobs.  Either way I will come back to the Deputy later this afternoon with clarification on the report he has just cited.</p></speech>

Only 2.2% of the Ireland 2040 capital investment in higher education is due to be spent in the south east.  I am aware that Wexford is different again; the live register figure for Wexford in July was 15.5%.  Wexford is by far the worse off of those counties in the south-east region.  I honestly believe that the statistics bear out the fact that we are one of the top three most deprived counties in the State currently.  There is a real need for cross party co-operation to address this.  There is a need for some really proactive work across the Departments to change that.  Wexford has been a deprived county for a long time and this is directly linked to the fact that we have the highest suicide rate in the State for the last three years.  The Minister will be aware that mental health challenges and deprivation are very strongly linked.  Might there be an appetite for cross-party co-operation to look at the realities of the situation in Wexford? It did not start with this Government: umpteen Governments have failed to do this.  It would be a powerful exercise on the part of the Minister's Government if it were to do this.</p></speech>

If not then maybe we will have to look at it and I will come back to the Deputy on it.  I can only take responsibility for my Department.  There are tremendous amounts of supports available in Wexford and in recognising it is lagging a little bit behind the rest of the country.  There are 40 case activation officers looking at the people in the region on the live register.  There are a number of training initiatives that have been developed with the Waterford and Wexford Education and Training Board with a wide variety of courses to go to.  The Turas Nua offices there are helping people to find the real jobs that are being created.  The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation may need to focus in specifically on that area and come back to the Deputy.  If there are blackspots or real deficits then perhaps we can sit down together and work on something in the future.  I would be happy to do that.</p></speech>

In line with the then existing arrangements for unemployment assistance, including the smallholders and pre-retirement allowances, the income of farm assist recipients was exempt from class S pay related social insurance, PRSI, for self-employed workers.  Recipients of farm assist who had previously paid class S social insurance had the option of paying voluntary contributions to maintain their social insurance record, provided they satisfied all of the qualifying conditions.  Since 1 January 2007, the exemption from class S PRSI has been removed and those receiving jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and farm assist are subject to class S PRSI as self-employed contributors on their self-employed income, provided their annual income is &euro;5,000 or more.</p>  <p>  There are currently no plans to amend legislation relating to the State contributory pension to award a maximum rate of payment to pensioners who had a period between 1999 and 2006 when they were exempt from paying PRSI contributions.  However, a person aged over 66 with limited PRSI contributions over the course of his or her life may claim a State non-contributory pension if he or she has an income need and this entitlement is not based on the payment of social insurance contributions but on the basis of need.  The maximum weekly rate is &euro;232 which is over 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate.  While it is means tested, there are significant disregards which are to the benefit of claimants and a significant majority of such pensioners are paid at the full rate.  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></speech>

She referred to the fact that farm assist was introduced in 1999.  At that time Deputies O'Dea, Durkan and I, as well as most Members of this House representing rural constituencies, were very strong in our advocacy for replacing the smallholder's allowance with farm assist unemployment assistance.  The Minister's predecessor at that time, Dr. Michael Woods and the late Joe Walsh, the then Minister for Agriculture and Food, were to the fore in introducing the new scheme which took account of present income circumstances, unlike the smallholder's assistance payment, which was very much based on historical income for the previous 12 months.  As we all know, farm incomes can change very suddenly if there is an outbreak of disease and a total or partial depopulation of a herd, for example.</p>  <p>  In the instances I have come across, those farmers who took up farm assist for a short time continued to make tax returns but were not informed by Revenue or by the Department that they needed to make a contribution to maintain their insurance record.  There was always an understanding that if one was in receipt of a social welfare payment, one's social insurance record was maintained but that did not happen in this instance.  The cases with which I am dealing all involve people who did not employ an accountant to file their tax returns because they were not in a financial position to do so.  They made their returns themselves and were not aware that their insurance contribution record was being broken.  They had always hoped, through making their insurance contributions, that on reaching pension age they would be entitled to a full contributory pension.  Unfortunately, that is not happening now.</p></speech>

I can only look into the matter on the Deputy's behalf.  I can relate to the fact that their contribution record having been broken has resulted in them getting a lesser pension payment now.  The options that would have been available to them were to make those contributions or, just before retirement, to buy credits to supplement their annual contributions over their lifetime of work.

On behalf of those due to be reviewed, I ask for confirmation that the process as outlined last January is continuing and that the reviews will be completed later this year, with adjusted payments beginning early next year.</p></reply>

On 23 January last the Government agreed to my proposal that would allow pensioners affected by the 2012 changes in rate bands to have their pension entitlement calculated on a total contributions basis, including a provision for up to 20 years of a new home caring credit.  Legislation will have to be enacted to enable the implementation of these arrangements and a number of options regarding the best approach to passing that legislation are being considered.  In addition, a new information technology system must be developed in line with the legislation.  My Department is currently working on both of these projects and both are at a very advanced stage.  We must then design the procedures with which we will work.  We are currently recruiting some temporary staff who will conduct the reviews.  Once recruitment is completed, we will start carrying out the reviews.</p>  <p>  My Department will write to the 67,000 impacted customers in the next number of weeks to explain to them what is happening and how the review process will work.  As I have stated previously, it is still planned to commence these reviews before the end of this year, with the first payments being made in the first quarter of 2019, backdated, where relevant, to the end of March 2018, or later where a person attained his or her 66th birthday after that date.  I wish to reassure people that it is not necessary for them to contact the Department on this matter.  Once the legislation is enacted and the systems and processes are ready, my Department will write again to the people impacted and provide them with the opportunity to have their pension recalculated.  Once they are presented with the recalculation, they will then have the option of continuing on their old pension payment or moving to a new pension payment.  I have been asked on a number of occasions if there will be winners and losers in this recalculation process, as has happened on different occasions in the past but I can absolutely assure Deputies and those listening that there will be no losers.  Those whose pension entitlements are recalculated and are found to be smaller than their current payment will obviously choose to stay on the current payment.  That said, the anticipated outcome of the process is that the majority of the 67,000 people who were adversely affected will be positively impacted by the recalculation and will be moved to a new, higher payment.</p></speech>

I am glad to hear her reiterate that the details of the plan which were originally announced in January are on track.  Some of those affected by this issue have begun to think that it may not happen because there has not been much recent media coverage of the matter.  After many years of campaigning, they are almost afraid to believe that the issue will finally be resolved.  Great credit is due to the Minister not alone for the announcement last January, but also for the work since then by her and her officials in order to be in a position to undertake what will be a very significant review.  I welcome her statement that the letters will issue in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  The Minister is aware that the issue has caused upset, frustration and hardship for many of those affected by the changes in 2012.  The payment of a reduced weekly pension reinforced their feeling that their work caring for family members over the years was unrecognised.  Addressing those feelings is a very important step.</p>  <p>  Can the Minister confirm that an allocation will be set aside as part of the budget to make the necessary repayments next year?  She mentioned that 67,000 people have been affected.  Is that the total number of people in receipt of contributory pensions post-2012?  Will people who are not covered by the review receive letters about it?  Will all 67,000 letters issue at once or will it take a couple of weeks for that to be done?  It is a large number of letters but it may cause confusion if some people receive a letter and others do not.  How quickly does the Minister expect the letters to be issued?</p></speech>

People are very keen to see progress in that regard.  It was understood that legislation would be advanced in the earlier part of this year with a view to the letters issuing approximately now and through the autumn and payments issuing at the beginning of next year.  Has such legislation been advanced?  I understand that it has not.  People believe that the timeline is not being adhered to.  Are things still on schedule?  When will the letters issue?  Will it be this side of Christmas or thereafter?  People need reassurance.  Those affected by the 2012 cuts are very conscious of time and hope that this will be addressed as quickly as possible.  The Minister indicated that temporary staff will be recruited.  How many will be taken on and when will they be in a position to carry out the reviews?</p></speech>

Given the number of people who will qualify for two levels of pension and are likely to opt for the higher of two, I ask for an indication of the extent to which provision is likely to be made to ensure that the system will work in the way it is intended for the benefit of all.  Are those who have made contributions in this jurisdiction and other jurisdictions likely to be affected?</p></speech>

I am very pleased to reiterate that there is no delay on this issue, nor any change of mind or tactic.  We are in the position envisaged at the time of my announcement in this Chamber several months ago.  The Cabinet decided to address the anomaly and legislation in that regard is well advanced.  The only thing that must be decided is whether it will be addressed in the social welfare Bill or in stand-alone legislation.  I make that point not to confuse or conflate the issue but, rather, in view of the particular timelines of this House.</p>  <p>  I appreciate the comments made by Deputy Heydon.  I was lucky to be the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection at a time when a large number of pensioners had mobilised over an unfair, unjust and discriminatory issue by which they had been affected since 2012.  I pay particular tribute to the pensioners who persistently attended weekly clinics and to Age Action Ireland for its co-ordination of that campaign.  I am happy to say that this is one of several instances when people have shouted loudly and the Government has heard them and is able to allocate money to the matter in the budget.</p>  <p>  A total of 67,000 people have been impacted.  To answer the question of Deputy Durkan, not all of them are in Ireland, with some 9,000 living outside the State.  All those affected will be contacted in the coming weeks, well in advance of Christmas.  I hope and assume that the assessments will be completed by then.</p>  <p>  The temporary staff will all be in place by the end of next week and will then begin training.  Thereafter, the letters will issue and the assessments will commence.  By the end of the first quarter of next year each of those 67,000 people who choose to move to a new increased payment will have received their backlog in the form of a little lump sum and will be on the new payment.</p></speech>

She is correct in her remarks on pensioners.  Those with whom I dealt in Kildare on this matter were very persistent, and rightly so.  This was one of the few issues on which there was no counterargument to those who raised the matter at clinics.  There was an inherent unfairness in the measures and that cut people to the bone because they felt their contribution to the State, the role they played and the choices they made throughout their lives were being questioned.  I welcome that this is being addressed.  I welcome the confirmation that the 67,000 letters will be issued as closely together as possible because, notwithstanding the size of the undertaking, it will cause consternation if some people receive letters but others do not for three or four weeks thereafter.</p>  <p>  I ask that consideration be given to one of the bugbears for those affected, namely, that announced increases in the pension - of &euro;5, for example - do not apply to their pensions in full because they are on a reduced amount.  If there is to be an increase in the pension announced in the forthcoming budget, I ask that the full amount be given to all those in receipt of a State pension because that anomaly has driven home the inequality of the system to date.</p></speech>

I am pleased to note the outline of the timeframe for dealing with it because those affected by the 2012 changes wish for matters to be advanced as quickly as possible.  The Minister indicated that she has not decided whether this will be provided for as part of the social welfare Bill or in stand-alone legislation.  Will that decision impact on the timeline for implementation?  When will she know when such legislation will be advanced?</p></speech>

Will those persons who made contributions in Ireland and overseas receive the same treatment as everybody else such that there would be no balancing of the situation whereby they might have a higher level from the United Kingdom?  Will it be adjudged on the basis of achieving a pension of a particular amount in this jurisdiction?</p></speech>

The 67,000 letters will not issue on one day because we have not taken on 15,000 temporary staff to facilitate such a feat.  Rather, they will issue over several weeks.  I ask Deputies for their assistance in terms of assuring their constituents who have received a letter when others have not that the letters will be issued to all.  Assessing and addressing this anomaly had to be provided for out of the staffing fund for this year.  Through certain savings, we have managed to secure funds for temporary staff but not a huge number thereof.  There is a sufficient number to enable the Department to carry out the reviews, issue the letters and stick to the timeline set out, namely, that each of the 67,000 people affected will receive their little backlog and move onto their new payments before the end of the first quarter of next year.  Nothing has changed.  Timelines have not slipped.  The decision on whether the legislation is included as an amendment in the social welfare Bill or progressed as a stand-alone Bill will not impact on the timelines.  It might be easier to progress as a stand-alone Bill and we are considering that but the decision will not impact on the dates for the payments.  However, aspects of this will be done on a phased basis because a significant number of people are affected and the staff of the Department, although great, are not wonder women and men.</p>  <p>  Given the common travel area agreements and the reciprocal arrangements between Ireland and the United Kingdom in particular, the arrangements will be identical for those living outside or inside the State.  We want to give people the fullest possible payment based on the contributions they made in Ireland or any state with which we have reciprocal arrangements.</p></speech>

They are not employees of my Department or public servants.  There are currently 1,346 supervisors or assistant supervisors employed with CE sponsor organisations.  My Department funds wages and training costs in respect of CE participants and supervisors.  It does not, and has not, provided provision for funding for CE supervisor pensions.</p><p>Employers, including CE sponsoring organisations, are legally obliged to offer access to at least one standard personal retirement savings account, PRSA, under the Pension (Amendment) Act 2002.  I am sure the Deputy is well aware of that.  On foot of the Labour Court recommendation, the issue of CE supervisor pensions is currently being examined by a community sector high-level forum, which is chaired by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  A number of Departments, including mine, are represented on this group, as are the unions and Pobal.</p><p>A detailed scoping exercise was carried out with input from the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service, IGEES, on the costs of providing Exchequer support for the establishment of such a pension scheme for employees across the community and voluntary sector.  The exercise clearly illustrated that this matter presents significant issues for the Exchequer, with a potential cost to the State of &euro;188 million per annum in respect of funding to enable an employer pension contribution in State-funded community and voluntary organisations, excluding any provision for immediate <i>ex gratia</i>lump sum payment of pension as sought, which could, depending on the size of the sector, entail a further Exchequer cost of up to &euro;318 million.</p><p>I am very conscious that while the issue relates to CE supervisors and assistant supervisors, such individuals comprise just one small group within the wider community and voluntary sector.  Any provision of State funding for such a scheme in respect of those employees could potentially give rise to claims for similar schemes on the part of those in the broader sector, thus crystallising the level of liability.  Any solution to this issue will require careful consideration, in particular the implications for scarce Exchequer resources.</p></speech>

When community employment and later, job initiative, JI, schemes were set up - Ruair&iacute; Quinn initially set up the social employment scheme, SES, in the mid-1980s - people did not realise they would become such a fundamental part of society in terms of local development, training, caring and childcare.  I am a director of a number of such community companies.  I was involved in them before I became involved in politics and have been all through my political career.  Wonderful work is carried out that benefits both the individuals themselves through the training provided and their work in communities.  That must be recognised.</p>  <p>  The Minister referred to the Lansdowne Road agreement and the high-level forum chaired by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  We expected an outcome from that in late 2017.  We had a Private Members' debate on a motion tabled by our Sinn F&eacute;in colleagues.  The Minister quoted the potential cost put forward by IGEES of &euro;400 million to &euro;500 million but we estimated the cost to be much lower in budgetary terms and the issue must be revisited as a matter of urgency.</p>  <p>  We are all deeply aware of, and grateful for, the work being carried out.  Local groups are valiantly trying to support supervisors and assistant supervisors for the brilliant work they have done over decades.  The issue is similar to a previous question on women's pensions pre-2012 and the Minister should acknowledge the situation and begin to move on it.</p></speech>

Does the commitment still stand?  When we were dealing with the Employment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, the Minister cited legitimate concerns about the implications of proposed amendments on the working of the WRC and the Labour Court and those concerns was addressed.  There was a clear ruling by the WRC in 2008, which has been ignored by successive Ministers and Governments, affecting 1,250 CE supervisors and assistant supervisors.  The Minister hides behind the scoping exercise that is being carried out, brings in the community and voluntary sector and comes up with the figure of &euro;188 million, which was not part of the WRC ruling from 2008.  The WRC was categoric in what was being proposed, namely, that pensions should be provided for CE supervisors and assistant supervisors.  Could the Minister provide an exact figure on the cost to provide a pension scheme solely for CE supervisors and assistant supervisors, who are individuals doing exceptional work across communities in this State?</p></speech>

Deputies Durkan and Murphy O'Mahony have both been sitting in the Chamber for a long time and I want to ensure they have an opportunity to have their questions answered before 12 noon.  Could Deputies Broughan and Brady stick to the rules and regulations to which we all agreed on the running of this House?  I urge all speakers to be brief so that we can accommodate those two Deputies who have been sitting here a long time.</p></speech>

To be fair, the forum is chaired by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform but it includes the various Departments that have responsibilities towards the community and voluntary sector and not just the valuable organisations that provide CE schemes funded by my Department.  All of the Departments recognise the valuable services provided in communities by people on CE schemes.  That is why the high-level forum was established.</p>  <p>  I am not sure whether Deputy Brady is aware of the history of this case and that the Labour Court made a recommendation.  It did not make a ruling.  The recommendation has been scoped with input from IGEES on the costs of providing Exchequer support to all involved in the community and voluntary sector.  Unlike Deputy Broughan, who is an Opposition Deputy, we do not have the option of pitting one part of the community and voluntary sector against another.  If one is going to do something, one must respect equally the contribution made by all those in the community and voluntary sector.  That is why this is such a difficult task.  If it was easy to fix, it would have been fixed.</p>  <p>  We have not looked at individual costs for CE scheme supervisors because one cannot fix the problem without causing an additional problem elsewhere.  We have learnt lessons from the past when we tried to fix issues in a piecemeal way by ignoring the outputs from advisory groups.</p></speech>

We had this debate.  On the IGEES figures I cited earlier, up to &euro;500 million or whatever, that is obviously if we have an immediate big-bang approach.  Given that Labour Court Recommendation No. 19293 is sitting there for ten years, whatever excuses could have been made in respect of the crash and the aftermath and the austerity period, there is no validity in them now.  The matter is crying out for justice.  The Minister herself has been floating the idea of the supplementary savings scheme, automatic enrolment and this plan for 2022-2023 to ensure that this will not happen again to any segment of our society where people have given very valuable service to communities.  In this budget, in line with that, can she not as a start implement this recommendation at a very modest cost?  The budget committee is meeting the Minister, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, this afternoon.</p></speech>

I am asking her to introduce the full recommendation of the WRC from back in 2008.  What that recommendation lays out would cost a fraction of the &euro;188 million the Minister cites.  We are not talking about doing things piecemeal.  We are talking about the Minister following up on the commitments in the programme for Government, honouring and respecting the WRC and not being an impediment to its work.</p>  <p>  A motion was passed in the D&aacute;il before the summer recess, brought forward by the Minister's friends in Fianna F&aacute;il with Sinn F&eacute;in's support.  It called on the Government to implement the recommendations from the WRC.  We are coming into the budgetary process and, in the next couple of weeks, we will have a negotiated budget presented between Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael.  Have there been any discussions about implementing that motion?  Have there been any discussions between Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael about implementing the pensions for community employment supervisors and their assistants?</p></speech>

In terms of suggestions as to how we could magically find the &euro;0.5 billion that is potentially needed, maybe Deputy Brady will come up with a great budget himself in the next couple of weeks and show us what he would cut or stop doing to provide that extra &euro;500 million every year.</p></speech>

Approximately 85% of all claims are awarded and only 1% of all claims are appealed annually.  It is a very small number.  Nevertheless my Department is genuinely concerned that these cases be dealt with as quickly as possible.</p>  <p>  Significant efforts and resources have been devoted to reforming the appeals process in recent years.  As a result, appeal processing times improved from what was a staggering 52.5 weeks for an oral hearing in 2011 to 26 weeks in 2017 and from 25 weeks for a summary decision in 2011 to 19 weeks in 2017.  The most recent figures, for the period January to August 2018, are at 30 weeks for an oral hearing and 25.2 weeks for a summary decision.  This matter has been raised with me on a number of occasions.  It is too long.  We need to improve it.  There are a number of reasons for this.  One of the things we are going to attempt to do is simplify the carers allowance application form so that the process speeds up and people are not waiting four months to get a rejection and another four or five months to do their appeal.  We are doing everything.</p>  <p>  We have had some great successes with the domiciliary care allowance application.  That was at one stage taking up to 26 weeks but, because of a redesign undertaken with DCA Warriors and other interested bodies that were using the forms and finding them complicated, we designed a new form.  The application time for domiciliary care allowance is now down to five weeks.  I have every expectation that we will have the same results when we introduce the new carers allowance form.  I hear the Deputy's concerns loud and clear.</p></speech>

The problem is that for the period of the review, the person may be cut off with no payment.  That can cause very serious hardship to people in particularly straitened circumstances.  In some cases, it can lead to someone losing his or her house due to rent arrears.  That is a particular issue that I would like to see pursued further.</p></speech>

As the Deputy is aware, it is funded by the Citizens Information Board, which comes under my remit.  The Government and my Department in particular is committed to supporting the service which, it is recognised, is an invaluable support to people with hearing difficulties.</p>  <p>  The 2018 budget for the Sign Language Interpreting Service is &euro;676,000.  This includes more than &euro;300,000 to expand its activities in order to deliver on the commitments set out in the National Disability Inclusion Strategy 2017&ndash;2021, which include the extension of the operating hours and the availability of the remote interpretation service to evenings and weekends; the resourcing of the Sign Language Interpreting Service to increase the number of trained sign language and deaf interpreters; putting a quality assurance and registration scheme for interpreters in place; and the provision of ongoing professional training and development.  Additional staff resources have been given to SLIS, which has facilitated the extension of the Irish remote interpreting service appointments to 6.30 p.m. Monday to Friday, and 10 a.m. until 1 p.m. on Saturdays.  The Sign Language Interpreting Service is currently recruiting a quality information and development officer to develop a quality assurance and registration scheme for interpreters and to develop and deliver ongoing professional training and development.</p>  <p>  In preparation for the commencement by the Minister for Justice and Equality of the Irish Sign Language Act 2017, the sign language interpreting service has drafted guidelines for the administration of a scheme to facilitate access to social, educational and cultural events and services by ISL users.  There is no doubt that it is important for anybody who is deaf to live a full and supported life and this goes a long way to recognising the deficits that existed in the past and reinstating the services that should be available. </p></speech>

Immediately, she revealed her main concern was the significant burden and cost education was placing on the household budget, which admittedly was limited.  I refer to the pressure owing to her children going back to school.  More important, the pressure of paying a voluntary subscription to the school was real because it was made clear that failure to do so would mean her children would not gain access to textbooks and materials centrally procured by the school.  The subscription had to be paid up front by the parent.</p>  <p>  This illustrates that the ongoing cost of education and going back to school is genuinely growing.  Schools have little choice but to raise funds voluntarily.  We know from the Grant Thornton report of last February that the average Government allocation to schools for operating costs, amounting to &euro;46,000 per year, does not cover the average expenditure, which is approximately &euro;91,000.  Lighting, cleaning, heating, insurance, equipment and printing add to the costs and increase the expenditure when running a school.  Small and medium-sized schools suffer even more.  DEIS schools, or disadvantaged schools, because they do not have the capacity to raise money, are particularly disadvantaged.  They cannot fundraise.</p>  <p>  The Oireachtas education committee, under the chairmanship of Deputy Fiona O'Loughlin, held valuable hearings in August on this subject.  The Catholic Primary Schools Management Association made a presentation to the committee and stated unequivocally that the current model is unsustainable.  It stated the issue is urgent and that many schools are running out of contingency funds and are running deficits.  The chief executive officer of the Irish League of Credit Unions, Mr. Ed Farrell, told the committee that the league's annual back-to-school survey results showed a rise in the number of parents in debt due to back-to-school-related costs.  Well over one third of parents in Ireland said they were getting into debt to cover back-to-school costs.  In particular, the credit unions were worried about the prevalence of moneylenders and the degree to which they are giving loans to parents to try to get through this difficult period.  Some 46% of parents said that the cost of going back to school was their biggest worry, and 67% said it represented a significant financial burden.  Four in ten said they would not be in a position to afford new shoes for their children, while seven in ten said extracurricular activities would have to be cut.</p>  <p>  One of the most effective ways to deal with this, among a number of measures, is to accept that the existing capitation grant is wholly inadequate to fund primary schools, particularly the small and medium-sized schools and DEIS schools.  Does the Taoiseach accept that?  Does he agree this must be a budget priority and that provision must be made for an increased capitation grant in the forthcoming budget, with a commitment to phased increases in subsequent budgets to try to reduce the pressure on parents who find their children's return to school presents a great difficulty?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-09-26a.175" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018092600012#K00400"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising this important matter.  It is raised very much in my engagement with parents as I go around the country and on the occasions on which I knock on doors.  The cost of education can be an enormous burden on families.  Often, these are the same families who bear the high costs of childcare, school transport and, in some cases, rising rents or a large mortgage.</p>  <p>  Increasing capitation grants for next year is, of course, a budgetary matter.  No budget decisions have been made as yet but I know it is a priority that Fianna F&aacute;il has raised in negotiations with us on the budget.  In the letter I wrote to the Deputy last month suggesting that we continue the confidence and supply arrangement through to 2020, I specifically listed this matter as one that should be included as part of a future arrangement, should Fianna F&aacute;il choose to continue the confidence and supply agreement through to the summer of 2020, as I proposed.  It is also included in the programme for Government.</p>  <p>  It is always necessary to prioritise.  We have a budget of &euro;10 billion this year for education.  It is the largest budget for education in the history of the State.  That is making a difference.  It means we have hired 5,000 more teachers in the past two years.  It means we are building new schools all over the country and extending schools.  It means we are developing technological universities, in Dublin and hopefully soon in the south east.  It means we have more special needs assistants than we ever had in our education service.  It means the pupil-teacher ratio this September is the lowest ever for children attending primary school.  Therefore, we can see how the massive investment in education is making a real difference for children, their teachers and families.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge that, because we had to focus on other areas, we have not been able to increase capitation.  It is under consideration for this budget but Deputies should bear in mind that there are always competing priorities.  Even the wealthiest countries have limited budgets and we have to prioritise within them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-09-26a.176" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1224" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018092600012#K00500"><p>Prioritisation is an important issue.  When the population increases, we will have more teachers.  Generally, because of the significant growth the number of children going to primary schools in recent years, there is a need for additional teachers because of the pupil-teacher ratio.  That is a matter of fact; that happens.  What has not increased in recent years in any shape or form, however, is the capitation grant.  The cost of living is affecting people.  Many parents who have children going back to school face higher costs.  These individuals are not entitled to the back-to-school allowance or anything like that.  They face a higher cost than others in society.  Priorities, therefore, have to be targeted and focused.  It is clear from all the evidence given to the Oireachtas education committee in August that schools are the end of their tether and are running deficits.  Parents are under particular pressure.  It is embarrassing for them if they cannot pay.  The children come back from school and say the principal is saying they have to pay the voluntary subscription.  If we were honest about it, we would say it is not voluntary.  There is great pressure on parents to cough up.</p><p>Along with an increase in the capitation grant there must be a restatement of the guidelines around that.  Children are conscious of it.  When I spoke to the mother concerned the children were in her presence as she told the story.  It is a story many Deputies have heard.  There must be an acknowledgement that the cost of living is a key issue and that giving tax cuts to the wealthy alone does not deal with it in a significant or substantive way.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-09-26a.178" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="12:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018092600013#L00200"><p>I can assure the Deputy that, as was the case in the last couple of budgets, we will not be giving tax cuts to the wealthy alone.  Tax cuts will be focused on those with middle incomes.  We have already taken people on the lowest incomes out of the tax net altogether and we have relieved them of the burden of the USC, which Fianna F&aacute;il imposed on them.  Some 38% of the lowest earners do not pay any income tax.  Now the focus will be on those on middle incomes.  People on modest incomes of approximately &euro;40,000 pay the highest rate of income tax on some of their income.  We believe that is unfair.  We stand over our policy of taking the lowest paid out of the tax net altogether and now focusing on those on middle incomes.  I will defend that to the hilt because it is the right thing to do.</p>  <p>  The Deputy is correct that the population has grown, and spending must increase in line with population growth.  However, we have done better than that.  If spending had only grown in line with demographics the pupil-teacher ratio would have stayed the same, but we have improved on that.  That is why we have the lowest pupil-teacher ratio ever this September.  There are also more resource teachers, 500 new guidance counsellors, 500 deputy principals to give schools better management, as well as junior cycle reform.  In terms of prioritisation, we wish to prioritise the families who are struggling the most.  We have reversed some of the cutbacks to the back to school clothing and footwear allowance that were imposed by the Deputy's party in government.  We have not fully reversed the cuts but we are getting there in that regard.  I have also introduced the school books scheme which has been of value to parents and we are expanding the school meals programme, which is very important particularly in DEIS schools.</p></speech>

The national executive of the Psychiatric Nurses Association is also meeting today to consider the recent report of the Public Service Pay Commission.  For years nurses, midwives and their unions have highlighted the recruitment and retention crisis in the health service.  They have proposed reasonable and responsible solutions to address it, yet there has been complete disengagement from the Government on the issue.</p>  <p>  The Public Service Pay Commission report was supposed to independently analyse and assess the crisis, its causes and how to address the problems.  However, as the report conveys, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, met the commission in October 2017 to emphasise that its work "is not a pay review nor can it be".  It is clear that from the outset the Government was determined that a commission mandated to investigate both pay and conditions was to focus solely on conditions and to disregard pay.  It appears as if it was determined to establish the conclusions of the report long before the work had even begun.  In carrying out its international pay comparisons the report acknowledges the number of nurses and midwives who have chosen to work in Britain instead of Ireland.  While acknowledging the fact that pay and conditions vary across England, the report failed to address adequately differences in pay between Ireland and London specifically, a popular destination for our nurses and where entry pay is more than &euro;3,000 higher.  A pay comparison that fails to address adequately one of the most popular destinations for our nurses is flawed.</p>  <p>  Our nurses and midwives perform an invaluable service to patients in the health service and we should expect their jobs to pay well and to have high morale in their ranks.  However, that is not the case.  There is only one application for every four nursing and midwifery vacancies in the health service.  In the meantime the Government does not wish to talk about pay, but that is the conversation that must take place.  It wilfully ignores that this will only worsen the state of the health service and make it impossible to implement Sl&aacute;intecare fully.  All the while the bill for agency staff continues to spiral.  In April, the D&aacute;il passed a Sinn F&eacute;in motion calling for the introduction of recruitment and retention measures based on realistic proposals which would prioritise pay.  It called on the Government to work with the unions to draw up a roadmap for pay equality and how that would be achieved for nurses and midwives, with an implementation plan to deliver pay equality within a short timeframe and not the eight-year timeframe the Government now proposes.  Will the Taoiseach commit to acting and engaging with unions in order that nurses and other health professionals get a fair deal?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-09-26a.180" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="12:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018092600013#L00400"><p>Absolutely, we always engage with unions.  That is the reason we have a public sector pay deal which was agreed less than a year ago.  That deal runs for the next three years and it applies to all public servants in the country.  It provides for pay increases every year for the next three years at a total cost to the taxpayer of &euro;400 million last year.  We made that agreement after engaging with unions and we intend to honour it.  We certainly hope all the unions honour the agreement they made with the Government and Irish taxpayer.  The agreement runs for three years and all public servants will receive pay increases every year.  There are over &euro;400 million worth of pay increases for public servants next year, which is about as much as we can afford.  We do not wish to repeat the mistakes of the past and to start borrowing money to pay for pay increases.  That is illusory.  It would mean going back to the cycle of pay increases followed by pay cuts down the line.</p>  <p>  The Public Service Pay Commission report is worth reading, and I am sure the Deputy has read it.  It is based on facts and puts forward solutions.  Those who are not interested in point scoring or exploiting industrial relations issues will find it very informative.  It is independent, incidentally.  It was not written by the Government or a civil servant or anybody in the Department of Finance.  Anybody could make submissions and many people did so.  The report sets out the facts.  One of those facts is that the number of nurses working in the public health service has been increasing year on year for the past three years.  It shows that pay is comparable with the UK and Europe and that Ireland has a high number of nurses per bed relative to other countries.  These are the facts, not my opinion.  They are set out in black and white in the Public Service Pay Commission report.  The report also points out that many countries are struggling to recruit and retain nurses because there is an international shortage of nurses.  Pay measures alone will not change that.  Just as there are Irish nurses in Australia and the UK there are nurses in Ireland from the UK, Spain, India and all parts of the world.  Those are the facts in the report.</p>  <p>  One of the most pertinent facts we should not deny, because it is set out in the report and in the OECD figures, is that Ireland has more nurses per head of population than most countries in the world.  It is in the top five or six.  If one reduces the number of nurses per bed it is even higher.  Any reforms must involve changes to how we deploy our nurses to ensure nurses are used in appropriate roles.  For example, in Ireland nurses are doing jobs that would be done by theatre assistants or scrub technicians in the United States and we have nurses doing jobs in outpatient departments that would be done by other grades.  Reform must involve those types of changes.  Of course we are willing to engage on that type of reform.  That is what Sl&aacute;intecare is about, reform and not more of the same.  If more nurses, more pay, more beds and more of the same was the solution we would be improving the health services now.  We do not need more of the same but a different approach.</p></speech>

That is a fact too.  The fact is that we train what are said to be the best, brightest and most capable nursing and midwifery staff and then we lose them, specifically to London, Canada and Australia.  When one makes a pay comparison one must benchmark the pay rate here with those destinations.  Nurses and unions have said loudly and clearly that there is an issue with pay.  There is certainly an issue with pay equality and then there is the broader issue of pay if we wish to recruit and retain staff.  The Sl&aacute;intecare report will gather dust on a shelf somewhere unless there are the resources, human resources and the capital to make it a reality.</p><p>The report is being considered by the real experts.  As we speak, the nurses are gathering in Croke Park and they will take a view on this report.  In light of this, will the Taoiseach honour the motion passed by the D&aacute;il, which called on the Government to engage with unions on the issue of pay and to do so in real terms in order that we can recruit and retain the best and, thus, deliver a first-class health service?</p></speech>

It is because of engagement that we have a three-year pay deal with all public servants to increase their pay every year.  The sum of &euro;400 million has been set aside for next year alone for increases in pay for our public servants.  Two pay increases will be made next year.  It is because of engagement that we have negotiated with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions a pathway by which we can equalise the pay scales of those public servants recruited after 2012.  As the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, often states - and he is right - there is only a set amount of money.  We have set aside approximately &euro;400 million for pay increases for public servants next year.  There is a point at which if we go beyond that, we either have to take the money out of public services, new schools, new hospitals and away from new medicines or borrow it and then pay later.  This is not the responsible approach.  The Sinn F&eacute;in approach will always be to back any demand of any interest group for anything they seek-----</p></speech>

When the economy collapsed, Ireland's tax base was exposed as fragile and narrow.  Ten years ago, tax receipts fell by 30% in one year.  This did not happen by accident.  For a decade, Fianna F&aacute;il had riddled the tax system with all sorts of tax breaks and bought popularity at budget time by cutting personal taxes to a level far below those of other European countries.  The property boom meant that windfall tax receipts from stamp duties and VAT brought in the necessary cash for public spending.  This all ended with the economic collapse, leaving Ireland unable to pay for basic public services such as schools, hospitals and the Garda.  We all know the history because the people of Ireland suffered and endured it.  It is not clear that the current Government has learned the lessons of history.  I am determined that we will not return to a situation where our basic health and social services are vulnerable to collapse because our tax system is weak.</p>  <p>  Tax lobbyists are seeking cuts to income taxes, with comparisons being made with personal tax levels of ten years ago.  From my perspective, income taxes in 2008 were excessively low.  Government spokespeople have suggested in the last week or ten days that the local property tax should no longer be linked to property values, which totally undermines the logic of a tax on assets and undermines the economic benefits of such a tax in dampening the growth in property prices.  This Government is now, I believe, embarked on the same process of driving down income tax.  From what we have heard in terms of the kites that have been flown over the past ten days, its focus is almost entirely on the top 20% of income earners.  Reports from the Revenue Commissioners make it crystal clear that only the top 19% of taxpayers pay any tax at the higher rate, which means over 80% do not.  Yet the Taoiseach insists on calling this 19% of taxpayers "the middle", as he did again today.  They are not "the middle".  The Taoiseach obsesses about the marginal rate of income tax.  I remind him that I was directly involved in the negotiations in respect of which the Taoiseach referenced Fine Gael having taken the lowest paid workers out of the income tax system.  The Labour Party insisted on that.  I negotiated directly with the Minister for Finance.  Fine Gael's plan was to reduce the top rate of income tax but by agreement, we took the lowest paid out of the universal social charge.  Despite that almost all north-western European countries have higher rates of personal income tax than Ireland, the Government is talking about reducing income tax.  My point is there is a real risk of repeating the disasters mistakes of the past.</p>  <p>  Will the Taoiseach confirm that only the top 19% of income taxpayers pay tax at the marginal rate at present and will the Government confirm its intention to strengthen rather than weaken the overall tax base of this economy in the forthcoming budget to ensure we provide decent and sustainable public services into the future?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-09-26a.188" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="12:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018092600014#M00700"><p>The Deputy raises some valid points.  In respect of our tax base, ten years ago we relied heavily on stamp duty, tax revenues from capital gains tax and tax receipts from the property sector.  Now, our tax base is much more broadly based.  We have a local property tax which, unpopular as it may be, has broadened our tax base.  We also have a sugar tax and a carbon tax and as such we have a much more broadly based system than we had ten years ago.  The area of vulnerability is corporation profit tax.  In the past couple of years, we have had a windfall in terms of big increases in taxes from big companies.  We cannot make long-term spending commitments with this money because we cannot be sure it will available to us in a year or two.  While I acknowledge the issue the Deputy raises, it is important to make that the point that we do have a much more broadly based tax system now.  If there is a vulnerability, it is not around income tax but corporation profit tax and whether we will be able to take in as much money from corporations in two or three years' time as we do now.</p>  <p>  The Deputy also mentioned that there are a lot of people talking about a return to the low taxes we had ten years ago as if ten years ago, pre-crash, was somehow normal.  This applies to other areas as well.  There are people talking about a return to the pay levels we had ten years ago and to the house prices we had ten years ago, as if ten years ago was normal.  If we return to the pay levels, house prices and low taxes we had ten years ago we are heading for another crash.  This Government needs to be responsible and to try to contain the increase in house prices, the increase in demands for higher pay and the increase in demands for lower taxes.  If people think that what we had in Ireland ten years ago was normal, we are heading for another crash.  This Government will be responsible and make sure that does not happen on any of those levels - tax, pay, spending or property prices.  </p>  <p>  On income tax, I can assure the Deputy that our plan is to raise more from income tax in 2019 than we will in 2018.  This is largely due to increasing employment and higher incomes and not due to rising taxes.  We do not intend to cut the marginal rate.  Our focus is on average incomes.  The average person in Ireland working full-time, excluding students, earns approximately &euro;44,000 per annum, some of which is subject to tax at the higher rate.  I believe people who earn &euro;40,000 or &euro;50,000 are "the middle".  The Deputy may say they are in the top 19% and that they are the rich.</p></speech>

That is the anomaly and that is unfair.  People on middle incomes who get a pay increase, an increment or do overtime lose more than half of that income in income tax.  I do think that is unfair and it is something we want to change.  We cannot do it in one go but we will do it in this budget, the next budget and the one after that if we are given the opportunity.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach spoke about sustainable house prices.  There are no sustainable house prices.  In many parts of the country, house prices are back to the unaffordable level we had during the boom.  The issue is that people's incomes have not recovered, such that they are worse off in terms of affordability.</p>  <p>  What is demonstrable now is the priority for our economy must be to invest in quality public services.  This is what all of the people want.  The Government proposes to give a marginal tax break to 19% of taxpayers.  There will be no benefit for 81% of taxpayers.  A marginal tax break for 19% of taxpayers is not a tax break for "the middle".  I am sure that if asked directly, that 19% of taxpayers would prefer to have that money invested in health and education.  </p><p>I ask for that to be the priority as the Government approaches the budget, rather than falling into the notion that everything can be done at once and that it can give tax breaks and invest in quality public services at the same time.  The Government cannot do both if it is going to have a sustainable economic policy.</p></speech>

There will be three priorities in the budget coming before the House in two weeks.  The first priority is that it be broadly balanced and that we do not repeat the mistakes of the past by ramping up spending and slashing taxes when the economy is strong and doing well.  We will reduce the deficit and our national debt will fall as a percentage of gross domestic product, GDP.  The first principle is to be prudent.</p>  <p>  The second priority is investment in public infrastructure and services.  We will increase spending on public infrastructure and services by &euro;3.4 billion next year at least.  There will be a 25% increase in capital spending on new homes, healthcare facilities, schools, transport infrastructure and broadband.  Anything more than that would probably drive up construction inflation and would not allow us to build any more.</p>  <p>  The third priority is that there will be a tax and welfare package which will put money back in people's pockets, not just middle income tax payers but also pensioners and people on welfare.  While we have not signed off or agreed on the budget as yet, I firmly hope that it will be the budget that finally reverses the cuts made to weekly welfare payments made by a Government in the past.</p></speech>

Earlier in the summer, the head of the Climate Change Advisory Council, Professor John FitzGerald, said that we are off course and heading rapidly in the wrong direction.  At last week's Joint Committee on Climate Action meeting, we asked for the Secretary General of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment to appear in advance of this afternoon's committee meeting and if we could see a first draft of the plan that the Government has to present to the European Union by Christmas, only to be told yesterday by the secretariat that no such plan exists yet.  Ms Marie Donnelly, a former Irish civil servant in the European Commission set out a vision of how we could turn this into an opportunity for our country at last week's meeting.  By being ambitious and going for a zero-carbon Ireland, we could create jobs and opportunities right across the country.  We have to have the draft by Christmas but in truth this is a question for Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin as much as for Deputies McDonald, Howlin and every other Deputy in this D&aacute;il because the final sign off on this new climate action plan, which is the one we have to do, will not be agreed by this Government but by the next Government towards the end of next year.</p>  <p>  My question is whether we are able to make the leap that Ms Donnelly set out.  We have done it previously.  In the late 1950s, we went from a closed economy to an open economy and Fine Gael played its part.  The Taoiseach's party appointed Dr. T.K. Whitaker before Fianna F&aacute;il and supported Se&aacute;n Lemass when the D&aacute;il at that time collectively set our country on a new course.  That is the scale of the historic moment that we are in now and we must organise ourselves in the next 16 to 18 months.  Then we must repeat it for the subsequent six Governments because the reason that Whitaker and Lemass were successful was that there was a stable political agreement in this House to invest in education, join the European Union, set up the Shannon tax free zone and so on.</p>  <p>  That level of co-operation, ambition and joint effort is needed and the people are ready for it.  They are good at tackling climate change; they just need some leadership, help and support, which this D&aacute;il must provide.  In going green, which we can do as an island, it will be 40 shades of green.  We must change everything, including our transport system, energy system, food system and business system.  Work must be done in Killybegs, Galway, Shannon, Waterford, Cork, Drogheda, Dundalk, Belfast and Derry to turn them into ports that will bring us energy from our seas.  It will happen on every street where we change them from the current car-dominated streets to greenways such as the one in the Taoiseach's area of Blanchardstown which I am sure he knows.  It is a beautiful cycle path and we need those in every area so that our children can cycle to school and do not have get asthma growing up.  Similarly, instead of looking at the future of farming where the average age of a farmer is 67, let us be bold and ambitious and pay them properly for storing carbon and reduce the average age of farmers in ten years to 37.  This is the front-line of this global challenge, which is the biggest that humankind has ever faced.  We should engage Bord na M&oacute;na to retrofit our homes, double the size of the company and start immediately storing the peat in the ground.  We need to make that level of a leap.</p>  <p>  I ask the Taoiseach in the spirit of collaboration to follow the example of those who appointed Whitaker.  We need a Whitaker today within the public service and we need a Lemass in every party to get agreement on this climate leap we need to make.  Is the Taoiseach willing to make that leap to think about everything and think big about how we write this new plan together by Christmas?</p></speech>

I will await the report from the all-party committee, which is being ably chaired by my colleague, Deputy Hildegarde Naughton.  On the Government's commitment to climate action, it is important to put the kind of initiatives that the Government has committed to on the record of the House.  We do not need an all-party agreement to make the commitments that we have made.  Under Project Ireland 2040, the largest single bloc of investment is in climate action to the tune of more than &euro;20 billion in investment in infrastructure that will allow us to tackle climate change.  We have confirmed that Ireland will become one of the first countries in the world to ban the use of smoky coals, for example.  Moneypoint will be taken off coal in 2025 and we will be one of the first countries in Europe to come off coal as a means of generating power.  We will take peat out of electricity system by 2030, if not before.  From next year, any new buses that are added to our bus fleet will be either low emission or zero-emission vehicles.  The first few will arrive this year and we will buy no new ones from the middle of next year other than low emission or zero-emission vehicles.  We have agreed to begin electrifying more of our railways, including the Maynooth and Kildare lines.  When BusConnects is looked at, it is not just to do with busses; one quarter of the programme relates to cycling because along those high quality spines and bus lanes, there will be space for bikes as well.  The Deputy is right to acknowledge the enormous investment that this Government has put into greenways, not just in my constituency but also around the country in places such as Waterford, and there will be many more similar investments.  We also have plans to retrofit public buildings and homes to make them more energy efficient.  We have the new renewable electricity support scheme to deliver an additional 3,000 to 4,000 megawatts of renewable energy and we have renewable heat as well.  We have a pretty good plan but we need to implement it.  We also need the co-operation of the Opposition in doing so and perhaps even some encouragement and acknowledgement as well.</p></speech>

The Government's development plan sucks when it comes to climate action and it will not do the job.  We need ambition that goes way beyond what the Taoiseach has just set out.  We also need political support.  I support the BusConnects project but we all know in this House that it is politically dead in the water at the moment because the real story there is that we will take the cars out of our cities and move towards car sharing and public transport.  We should have the level of ambition where we will turning Dublin city into Copenhagen and the Government's plan does not do it.  It is the old model of more roads with 63 big motorways and more sprawl.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach said that we are taking the peat out of Ireland by 2030 but that is not good enough because there will be no peat left by 2030.  The Taoiseach should listen to all the advice that has been offered to the Joint Committee on Climate Action, which says the Government has to stop the peat production now.</p></speech>

The director of the rape crisis centre, Mary Crilly, who has outstanding credibility in this field for many years and who has been running that particular centre said the young women involved were between 18 and 19 years of age.  The most alarming fact is the three women did not feel they could go to the Garda because of the circumstances of the sexual assault and the rape.  They went to the rape crisis centre.  They felt it was their own fault as alcohol was involved.  Two of the three women have already dropped out of college.  There is research and evidence to suggest that September and October can be the most dangerous time for young women, particularly first-year students, as they are going to college.  There are commitments in the programme for Government to legislation to reduce excessive delays in trials and court proceedings but this is beyond that.  I ask the Minister for Justice and Equality to convene an urgent forum involving the Garda Commissioner, representatives of the Rape Crisis Network, leaders of third-level institutions and the Higher Education Authority to begin the process of looking at this in a more comprehensive way than we have done to date.  It is alarming.  Apparently it is happening across the country.  There was a report today on Galway.  People are vulnerable during freshers' week and the first month.  We cannot read these reports and not respond in a comprehensive, urgent and different way in addition to whatever legislation we have to introduce.</p></speech>

I have been engaging with Garda management on the issue and with interested stakeholders and advocacy groups.  There is merit in making contact with the management teams in our third-level colleges.  I acknowledge the importance of the Garda protective services unit, which is engaged on the ground in ensuring those who report crime of a sexual nature are dealt with in a most compassionate and comprehensive way.  I urge any person and any young woman in particular who suffers as a result of such criminal activity to report the matter to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na where there are structures available.  I acknowledge the legislative programme in that regard to ensure those who are brought to court and convicted of such crimes are dealt with.  Later this afternoon, the House will discuss the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) (Amendment) Bill.</p>  <p>  In conclusion, I will point to a review of the practice and procedure of reporting on sexual offences which is under way under the chair of Mr. Tom O'Malley of NUI Galway.  There is merit in making direct contact on this specific issue with the heads of colleges and those involved in pastoral care in our colleges to ensure that anybody who suffers at the hands of a criminal receives an adequate and comprehensive response from the State.</p></speech>

Last night the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government survived a motion of no confidence as a result of the cowardice of Fianna F&aacute;il.  Despite that, the issue of demanding political accountability for housing and homelessness is not going away.  We need a huge change of direction and policy that delivers secure, affordable housing for all our citizens.  In the coming weeks, we will have a referendum on the issue of blasphemy.  I am sure it is a very worthy issue but it is not the most pressing one we face.  A more productive course of action would be to hold a referendum on the right to housing.  That would give effect to the decision by 80% of the participants in the Constitutional Convention that such a right ought to be enshrined in the Constitution.  It is not a novel idea.  In fact, over 80 countries across the world already have the right to a home enshrined in their basic law and their Constitution.  The Government could and should provide for the holding of a referendum to enshrine a citizen's right to a home and the right to housing in the Constitution and the Government should do it without delay.  It could be done on the occasion of the local and European elections in May if not before that.  Will the Taoiseach take that course of action?  We heard - and I agree with the Taoiseach - that empathy on this issue is not the sole preserve of any party in this House or any individual.  Let us have demonstrable evidence of the Government's empathy, understanding and compassion and let us have this referendum.</p></speech>

As the Deputy rightly points out, 83 countries have a legal right to housing and many of those countries have a homelessness crisis and people living in shanty towns.  Putting something into the Constitution or law does not mean it will have any impact on people's lives.  There is always the risk that if something is put into the Constitution it may be interpreted in a particular way by the courts.  What if, for example, as in many of those 83 countries, it turned out to be a meaningless right?  What if it turned out to be a basis on which somebody could sue the State and instead of spending money building houses we would spend that money compensating people for not having a house?  That would not make sense either.  When changing the Constitution, one needs to know exactly what the wording is, what it means and what the implications are.</p></speech>

We all applauded the sterling wok of the Naval Service in rescuing distressed families and children in the Mediterranean.  The <i>Aquarius</i>vessel has been operating in the Mediterranean rescuing migrants at sea.  M&eacute;decins sans Fronti&egrave;res and SOS M&eacute;diterran&eacute;e have described the decision by the Panama maritime authority to deflag that vessel as a major blow.  There are concerns that Panama was forced to revoke the registration due to pressure from the Italian Government.  M&eacute;decins sans Fronti&egrave;res has asked other European Governments to consider the issuing of a flag to <i>Aquarius</i>to continue its work.  It is the last private vessel operating between Libya and Europe.  Last week it rescued seven families including 18 children and one woman who was 23 weeks pregnant.  I do not expect the Taoiseach to give me a &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot; answer now.  Will he consider offering an Irish flag to the <i>Aquarius</i>to continue its humanitarian work?</p></speech>

The plan is evidently not working.  The Minister last night in the debate said he would like to hear alternatives.  Our alternative is based on the idea of public housing to be built on public land.  I have four examples here of how that might be done.</p><p>The first is Damastown village in Dublin West for 1,200 social and affordable houses.  Another is the site on the Old Whitechurch Road in Cork for 800 social and affordable houses.  There are also Kilcarbery Grange in the South Dublin County Council area and Belcamp Lane in the Dublin City Council area for 892 and 532 social and affordable houses, respectively.  These are plans for mixed communities, 100% social and public affordable housing without the need for any privatisation whatsoever.  The Dublin West proposal has been on the desk of the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government for the guts of a year.  At the end of this session, I will give the Taoiseach details on all four but I ask him to comment now on the idea of public housing on public land, which is a good and viable alternative to the Government's plan for mass privatisation of land through the Land Development Agency.</p></speech>

The Deputy is well aware that those councils have developed plans for those lands: Fingal County Council with Damastown, and South Dublin County Council with Kilcarbery.  What they have proposed is a mix of housing, that is, some private housing for young people who want to buy and own their first house, some affordable housing for people who qualify for it, and social housing for those on the housing list.  That is the right way to go about this.  We should have integrated mixed communities and use those lands to build social housing for those who need it, affordable housing for those who qualify for it, and private housing for those who want to buy their own homes, in order that everyone can live together and we can build communities as well as houses.  What the socialists want is something different.  They want segregation, to divide people and to have people living in council estates in one area and private estates in the other.  They want a wall built between the two.  They want to divide our society into people who live in different areas, with some people paying for everything but qualifying for nothing.  It is the wrong way of doing it.</p></speech>

The latest Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, report has raised further alarm bells about the impact of the housing crisis.  The report highlights that there appears to be no end in sight to the pressure on rent prices.  In particular, this pressure affects low-income families in the private rental sector.  Apart from the human misery this causes, the ESRI now warns that the issue directly affects our international competitiveness, which is something that we can all see and easily understand.  Will the Taoiseach now accept that the policies he is pursuing will have no impact for a number of years on the cost of rent, and that it will effectively wipe out any increases or extra moneys that may be made available to families after the budget?  People cannot get accommodation and it is simple as that.  Therefore, the Rebuilding Ireland policy is not working.</p></speech>

Last Wednesday was a serious day weather-wise for this country.  It seems that some people have forgotten that two people lost their lives.  Some 200,000 people's homes and businesses lost power.  A number of people were trapped in vehicles by falling trees.  In some ways it appears that Met &Eacute;ireann and others got it wrong.  It was a serious event.  I drove from Roscommon to Dublin, and the amount of debris flying around the place was shocking.  Even in this city some people were trapped in cars by falling trees.</p>  <p>  This brings me to the national weather forecasting service which has been promised.  We know the steering group has been set up and it has had a number of meetings.  I understand terms of reference have been agreed and some other issues have been addressed.  This service will deal with flood forecasting, which is so important due to climate change.  I was somewhat annoyed that Deputy Ryan was dismissed in some important points he was making.  It is anticipated it will take five years to put this service in place.  As the Taoiseach knows, wind and rain will not wait for anybody.  Only two staff have been appointed but 15 are needed.  I appeal to the Government to speed this up.  We are told many storms will come our way because of climate change, and it is a matter we must take seriously.</p></speech>

Women who came of pension age and applied for that pension in 2012 either got no pension or got a reduced pension.  While the Taoiseach indicated he would start to address that anomaly in this budget, I would like to ask him about another category of women who are mothers to the men and women of today and who were altogether left behind.  They got no pension because they reared their children and stayed at home.  Many of them are in their 70s and 80s and are still alive.  They deserve recognition in this budget as well to ensure they are in some way rewarded and recognised for what they have done for this country.  They are the mothers of the people who are running the country today.  I see the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Doherty, nodding her head.</p></speech>

There are a considerable number of people, just under 90,000, who are in receipt of a non-contributory pension, the vast majority of whom are the people the Deputy has described.  There is no discrimination, alienation or non-recognition of the contribution those people made to rearing their families and to the State.

In the programme for Government, a clear commitment was given to support and grow our tourism industry.  In 2013 the Taoiseach was the Minister who introduced the 9.5% VAT rate for the tourism and hospitality industry, the effect of which has been significant.

Those houses are now coming up for sale and cannot be sold to the families looking for them.  The local authorities cite the regulations made by the Department as preventing these houses being sold on to families that badly need them.  The Taoiseach should look at the Department.  He should make sure that any regulations or bureaucratic frustrations in the Department that are stopping houses being moved on to genuine people who need them should be obliterated.

There is no public system to allow for <i>in vitro</i>fertilisation, IVF, treatment.  This Government has committed, from 2019, to funding IVF treatment for couples unable to conceive.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, has stated that the assisted human reproduction Bill will regulate the area regarding the support that will be provided from 2019.  The Minister has also stated that financial assistance will be available to families.  A woman approached my constituency office only last week.  She has been married for the past five years and is 39 years old.  She and her husband have been trying to have a child for the last five years.

All of us know from our personal lives or from our constituents that a large number of people have to spend a lot of money to access IVF treatment.  The Government's objective is to legislate for it.  We do not have any legislation governing assisted human reproduction in Ireland.  It is an unregulated area, which is far from ideal because people can be exploited on occasions and we want to make sure we bring in some form of funding for it.  There is already some support in that medicines and clinical expenses can be offset against income tax but that is only 20%.  I believe the legislation has gone to pre-legislative scrutiny but we do not have a date for publication.</p></speech>

He made a point that I have been making for some time.  Investment in research is critical and not just in commercial research, which is highly important, but in basic pioneering research.  The most important discoveries happen by accident when great minds are concentrated with relevant supports.  The reality is that sector of our education and enterprise portfolio is being squeezed.  The discovery and frontier of basic research is not being funded as funding is being diverted elsewhere.  Will the Taoiseach answer the provost's call and engage with the sector because we fear a loss of talent, risk a degradation of our education sector and, by extension, enterprise if this is not tackled?</p></speech>

This weekend in my home town of Fermoy, the Thomas Kent school of history symposium is being held.  I ask the Taoiseach to propose that the Department of Education and Skills revisit the downgrading of history as a subject in the new junior certificate.  History should be kept compulsory in light of the changing facade of modern day society.  It must be acknowledged that things being decided today are often based on what we know from the past.  That is why history should be kept as a compulsory subject in our curriculum.</p></speech>

It is not compulsory in half of the sector.  Despite that, 90% of people take up history.  The new curriculum will be much more creative in its content and we believe it will attract people to take up history.  It will also be more fulfilling in that they will look at history in the context of their own community and it will encourage research and curiosity about that community.  We feel it is a very strong curriculum.  Broadly, we have introduced limited compulsion into the junior cycle.  Only mathematics, Irish and English will be compulsory subjects and this followed wide consultation on the best way to develop a junior cycle programme that developed the talents of people for future needs.  That is why more student choice was built into this and less compulsion.  We are confident that in the choice of the ten subjects junior cycle students will make,  we will see a continuing high take-up of history.</p></speech>

They also want to draw attention to the level of care, assessment and investigation available within the country for that illness.  Many suffers have had to go to Germany to receive diagnoses.  As the Taoiseach will be aware, a cross-party Oireachtas committee has been set up to try to move this issue forward.

The problem is multi-facetted.  A comprehensive strategy is required to address the issues and the challenges posed by the disease.  Such a strategy should involve education, awareness and greater research, but diagnosis and treatment should also form a part of it.  It is not acceptable that people must travel abroad, in some instances to Germany, at their own cost to get a diagnosis and then have to travel for treatment as well.</p>  <p>  Has there been any progress on developing a comprehensive strategy to deal with the challenges posed by Lyme disease?</p></speech>

The legislation mirrors the Waste Reduction Bill the Green Party introduced more than a year ago.  Our committee had to write to the President of the European Commission and the European Council to say that the Government has no intention of dealing with plastics in the immediate term.  Those bodies will not be surprised, because we do not do environmental legislation.  What is the Taoiseach fearful of?  He should allow a Committee Stage debate on the Waste Reduction Bill.  The rest of the House wants to debate this issue.  It could set out the approach we will take and give the Government or any future Government time to introduce it.  Why is the Taoiseach fearful of such a debate?  Why is he spinning the issue, telling people on Twitter that they have to do the right thing with plastics but taking no action to make it easier for people to do that?

That greenway stretches into County Kerry.  Applications have been made to Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, for signage on the N21, and I am asking that this be prioritised so that decent signage can be placed on that road.  We hear of the Waterford greenway, among others, but there is also a fantastic greenway in County Limerick.  Applications have been made to resurface that greenway, but we need signage on the N21 - the Dublin to Killarney route - to let people know they can stop at Rathkeale and towns along the greenway and to ensure they make use of Limerick's tourism offering.</p></speech>

The Bill will provide that people who suffered as a result of maternal ingestion of thalidomide are not excluded from pursuing their cases because of time limits in the Statute of Limitations Act 1957.  The Bill will amend the Statute of Limitations Acts of 1957, 1991 and 2000.  I am inserting into the Acts that: &quot;A person shall, in respect of injuries suffered by that person as a result of the ingestion of thalidomide by that person's mother during the person's gestation period, be deemed to be under a disability.&quot;</p><p>The background to this is that the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, and his Department have been trying to technically knock-out thalidomide victims and litigants and victims by using these limits in a case management action in the High Court.  New thalidomide victims who have emerged since the 1960s, as well as those not acknowledged as survivors back then, remain unacknowledged by the HSE and the Minister for Health.  They have never received any entitlements from the State associated with their injuries.  They should have the right to make their case if they can, and should not be locked out by a timing or technical issue.  The State, through the Irish Thalidomide Medical Assessment Board of the 1960s, failed to acknowledge many people who were injured by the ingestion of thalidomide by their mothers.  Fifty years later, sufferers are still emerging as there is a degree of cover-up associated with the existence of records.  The unfortunate situation is that my Bill is sadly too late to help two of these litigants, who have passed away since the action began four years ago.  I hope the Government will take this legislation on board so that those who have survived can proceed with their cases.  It is not right that they should be stopped from taking their cases because of the Statute of Limitations.  They deserve the right to pursue their action.  Even with my proposed change, those people will still have to prove their cases, which will not be easy, given the length of time involved.  </p><p>Thalidomide survivors have been subjected to threats - by way of court applications - that their claims will be struck out on the grounds of timing and for the failure to provide medical records details.  The State is being intransigent and difficult with thalidomide survivors, which is shameful given what befell those people.  Furthermore, this House is being told that the reason the litigation is not resolved is that any payments of compensation would become deductible from German or Irish state pension entitlements.  This statement is inaccurate.  These litigants have never received a penny of compensation or of pension entitlement, or any thalidomide-related benefit at all from the State.  A 2010 State Claims Agency report on the thalidomide controversy was fundamentally flawed, and the State has held on to an entrenched position because of that.  The report did not acknowledge that thalidomide remained on the Irish market for several years after the date of the knowledge that it posed a risk.  Like the cervical cancer cover-up of this century, in the previous century, pregnant women who ingested thalidomide were never told that their unborn babies could have been injured <i>in utero</i>.  Why Ireland neglected to withdraw and recall thalidomide in a timely manner back in the 1960s has never been properly explained.</p><p> Unlike in the aftermath of the cervical cancer controversy though, no provision of funding has been delivered to the HSE by the Minister for Health or his Department to enable it to provide the necessary medical records to thalidomide litigants.  The Minister of Health has a conflict in this matter.  One one side, he underfunds the HSE's facilities for the provision of medical records, with the consequent effect that thalidomide litigants are placed in a vulnerable position in that their cases could be struck out for failure to provide medical records.  On the other side, the Minister for Health is a defendant in the very same court proceedings.  It is therefore within his remit and that of his Department to cure the issue upon which advantage is being sought in regard to litigation.</p> <p> The Minister and his Department need to end the two-faced tactic of sympathising with victims on one hand and blocking their progress on the other.  In this action by the thalidomide survivors, more than 1,100 court documents have had to be filed so far.  Some 1,539 of the medical records have been sought by the defendants and the Minister from the survivors as well.  The hospital system's ability to deliver the records is very limited, so the litigants are in a catch-22.  It is important that the medical records are delivered to the litigants, and I would like to see collective agreement in this House so that this legislation can be progressed.  I welcome the thalidomide survivors who are in the Gallery today and want to see political progress on this.  This is something that we can do for them, to help them in their court action so that the matter is progressed.  I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to introduce the Bill.  I would like to see it progressed quickly to Second Stage, Committee Stage and beyond.</p></speech>

During that visit, I attended and spoke at the event that formally launched Ireland's bid.  I also spoke at an event commemorating Ireland's record of 60 years of unbroken service on UN peacekeeping operations and met with representatives of more than 30 African Union member states to emphasise Ireland's commitment to partnership with the continent, and to highlight Ireland's Security Council campaign.</p>  <p>  I made a return visit to the UN earlier this week to represent Ireland at the Nelson Mandela Peace Summit, where leaders and representatives of more than 130 countries gathered to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the birth of Nelson Mandela as part of the week's events around the United Nations General Assembly.  The political declaration from the Summit reaffirms the signatories&rsquo; commitment to the three UN pillars: peace and security, development, and human rights.  It also reaffirms the importance of the multilateral system in preventing and resolving conflict.  Ireland and South Africa led the preparation of this political declaration.</p>  <p>  While at the UN this week, I had the opportunity to meet bilaterally with the Presidents of South Africa, Namibia, Columbia and Mozambique, the Prime Minister of New Zealand and the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Malawi.</p>  <p>  During each of these meetings we discussed our bilateral relations as well as Ireland's campaign for a seat on the UN Security Council.  I also had the opportunity to discuss these issues in informal conversations with several other Heads of State and Government, including the Cypriot President, Prime Ministers Trudeau of Canada, Muscat of Malta, and Ratas of Estonia, and with senior UN officials including Secretary General Ant&oacute;nio Guterres, Deputy Secretary General Amina Mohammed, and President of the General Assembly Mar&iacute;a Fernanda Espinosa Garc&eacute;s.</p>  <p>  Attendance at the United Nations also presents the opportunity to engage on an impromptu basis with many people in leadership positions in politics, international development and civic society.  Among others, I met informally with the widow of Nelson Mandela, Ms Graca Machel; the Secretary General of the Arab League, the Secretary General of Amnesty International, Mr. Kumi Naidoo, and representatives of the Governments of Monaco, Bahrain, Guyana, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. </p>  <p>  I am sure the House will agree that Ireland's credentials as a candidate for the Security Council are very strong.  Since joining the UN in 1955, Ireland has made a sustained contribution to the international community&rsquo;s efforts to tackle important global challenges like peace and security, human rights, international development, climate change and sustainable development.  Ireland&rsquo;s candidature for a seat on the UN Security Council will deepen our UN engagement at a time when the multilateral institutions which are so important for international peace and order are under pressure.</p>  <p>  Before I travelled to New York last weekend I had the opportunity to meet Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas during his short visit to Ireland.  We were joined by the T&aacute;naiste and by members of President Abbas's delegation including Deputy Prime Minister Abu-Amr, Foreign Minister al-Maliki, and chief negotiator Saeb Erekat.</p>  <p>  Our discussions covered the Middle East peace process, Ireland's support for the Palestinian people and challenges facing the Palestinian Authority and the Palestinian people regarding peace, security, welfare and human rights.  I emphasised to President Abbas the Irish Government's continued and consistent support for the rights and aspirations of the Palestinian people.</p>  <p>  As regards further international engagements over the next six months, I will attend the scheduled meetings of the European Council in Brussels on 17 and 18 of October and 13 and 14 of December.  I will also attend any extra meetings of the European Council that are scheduled, including the one mooted for November.  I expect to attend the next meeting of the British-Irish Council scheduled for 9 November in the Isle of Man.</p>  <p>  I will also continue with my programme of bilateral meetings with other members of the European Council.  I will keep the House informed as and when details of any future visits and engagements are finalised for announcement.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-09-26a.302" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1239" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="13:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018092600020#S01800"><p>I think it is absolutely necessary for the Taoiseach to move beyond articulating an aspiration of recognition of the state of Palestine to actually doing so.  He has long-fingered this issue.  He says that he will do it in the context of a two-state solution, at a time when that looks very remote; a time of great trouble in the Middle East and particularly in Gaza.  It is the will of the Oireachtas to recognise the state of Palestine.  Rather than waiting for the solution, I argue that recognising Palestinian statehood is a necessary precondition and ingredient of advancing towards it.</p>  <p>  As the Taoiseach says, on Monday he addressed the Nelson Mandela Peace Summit in New York, held in honour of the centenary of the birth of Nelson Mandela.  That is a considerable honour and privilege, and I hope it was a productive engagement.  I read the speech in which the Taoiseach quite rightly held up our own peace process as a beacon for building peace and reconciliation.  The Good Friday agreement remains a triumph of hope over despair, and it is as relevant today as it was 20 years ago.  Of course it is regrettable that 20 years on, the political institutions of the agreement are not functioning.  In the context of Brexit, the actions of Tory hardliners, the denial of rights by the DUP and the actions of a British Government that in my view is undermining the agreement, it is absolutely essential that we recommit ourselves to the Good Friday Agreement.  Those institutions are what is best for all of us, for our economy, our public services and for building reconciliation.  The way forward is not to discard the agreement but to embrace it and to re-establish the Executive and the Northern Ireland Assembly on the basis of equality and respect as was intended.</p>  <p>  As the Taoiseach knows we have tried to do that over the last year.  We reached an agreement with the DUP leadership to do so in February.  They walked away and the thing collapsed.  Listening to some of the Taoiseach's Ministers last night, one would be forgiven for thinking that the impasse in the North was entirely to be blamed on Sinn F&eacute;in, that we were somehow behind the renewable heat incentive, RHI, scandal or that we were denying fundamental rights to citizens.  However, the Taoiseach knows the state of play and his T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Simon Coveney, knows it even better.  Yet the Taoiseach's Ministers, Deputies Ring, Doherty and Griffin engage in opportunistic sniping that is patently inaccurate and untrue.  The Taoiseach cannot be a statesman and rejoice in the benefits of the peace process one day, and then watch as his Ministers descend into the gutter with comments like those that were made last night.</p>  <p>  I think it would be useful for the Taoiseach to discuss this at ministerial level.  Perhaps it is the case that the Taoiseach is not actually briefing Cabinet accurately or fully.  If that is the case, I ask him to remedy that situation.  The only way we will find a viable pathway back to full power-sharing is with the active and fully informed engagement of everybody.  Crucially, that includes every member of the Taoiseach's Cabinet.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-09-26a.303" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1353" speakername="Brendan Howlin" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018092600021#T00100"><p>I am interested in the discussions the Taoiseach has had about the application for Security Council membership.  This is an application I and the Labour Party strongly support and we have used our contacts to advance it.  In general, has it compromised our ability on the world stage to criticise countries as we look for their votes?  The Taoiseach met the secretary general of the Arab League.  That was an important meeting.  I had the privilege of meeting the secretary general last year when we were on the delegation to Egypt.  Are we inhibited from criticising Saudi Arabia's involvement in Yemen?  Are we clear in what we say internationally, that although we are looking for support we are not holding our punches in our normal role?  That would be a mistake.  It is important if we ask people to support us that they know we are honest brokers and we will call out violations of human rights where we see them, without fear or favour.  That is Ireland's strength in our application.  I am interested to hear the Taoiseach set out this in clear terms.</p>  <p>  With regard to the point made previously about recognition of the state of Palestine, it is an important position for us to advance now.  Every time it has been raised, although it was supported by all parties in the House, the Taoiseach's general view is it is contingent on a two-state solution.  Things have moved remarkably badly in the wrong direction, particularly since the election of Donald Trump as President of the United States and the movement of the United States embassy to Jerusalem.  It is important that we are clear we support a two-state solution but in the interim that we recognise a state of Palestine and the legitimate aspiration of the Palestinian people to their own state, which would include, of course, a capital in Jerusalem on an agreed basis.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-09-26a.304" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1224" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018092600021#T00200"><p>In the past when Ireland has succeeded in being elected to the UN Security Council at regular intervals, it has been through a relentless focus on diplomatic contacts.  We have all been involved.  I was involved in previous Governments in getting direction from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on the state of play.  This is why it caused some surprise that the Government decided to assign a marketing expert to the campaign.  There has been a lot more showboating and razzmatazz about this.  One gets the sense it is for a domestic audience as opposed to the international reality of how these things happen and how election to the Security Council is won.  People were surprised by how the former head of the strategic communications unit was by the Taoiseach's side in New York on Monday.  Will he explain to whom he reports and why the Taoiseach decided we needed marketing expertise in this bid?  Was there a competition for the particular post the person now occupies in line with normal procedure?</p>  <p>  With regard to the visit of President Abbas at the weekend, will the Taoiseach explain whether he is any closer to clarifying what appear to be entirely contradictory policies on Israel, Palestine and the occupied territories?  Ireland's position as a country, and the Oireachtas in particular, has consistently been in favour of a two-state solution as well as recognition of the humanitarian crisis especially in Gaza.  Mr. Netanyahu's Government has effectively made efforts to undermine any possibility of reaching a two-state solution.  That is where we are now.  It has been steady and consistent in reducing the feasibility of an eventual two-state solution.  There is a worsening humanitarian situation in Gaza, and we should acknowledge the negative role of Hamas in this deteriorating humanitarian situation.  The question is whether the international community acts or simply stands on the sidelines.</p>  <p>  Many states are now actively working to try to push back against Netanyahu's policies by recognising a Palestinian state and seeking new ways to combat illegal settlement.  At each stage the Government has been resistant to action.  In fact, we have been lectured - I do not like to use that word - by the T&aacute;naiste about how we are damaging his efforts to bring peace to the region.  I spoke with the T&aacute;naiste about the occupied territories Bill.  He is earnest, but he told me it could damage Ireland's peace role and the perception of Ireland by the United States.  He gave me the impression a peace initiative was about to happen, but what was done by the US Government was the antithesis of any movement towards peace, as it removed its funding from UNRWA, the United Nations relief organisation that does extraordinary work in Gaza and the West Bank to feed people and educate children.  I have been in the schools in Gaza where children are taught about the atrocities and horror of the Holocaust, but the one civilising and significant humanitarian response to the crisis is being steadily undermined and eroded by the US Government and President Trump.  I have made clear to the T&aacute;naiste that the bottom line is people's patience is running out with the response of this Parliament and the Government.</p>  <p>  Is it the Taoiseach's view that targeting goods from illegal settlements is a problem in terms of EU law?  What will he do to try to change this?  Will he take any steps to implement the clearly expressed will of the Oireachtas?</p>  <p>  On the peace process in the North, I must put on the record that the Sinn F&eacute;in Ard Comhairle at the time should not have contrived to collapse the assembly and Executive.  We now know from evidence that letters were written by Sinn F&eacute;in Ministers pleading for the extension of the renewable heat incentive scheme and that it would continue to be kept open.  That is now out there in the public domain.</p></speech>

I do not accept it.  Setting aside that debate, and the fact the two-state solution is falling apart anyway because of Israel's complete flouting of every elementary aspect of international law on human rights with regard to the Palestinians, what does the Taoiseach say in seeking nomination for Ireland to the UN Security Council about UN Resolution 194, which deals with the right of Palestinian refugees and their descendants to return to the homes from which they were expelled and to recover the property lost when they were expelled, whether in 1948 or 1967?  In answering this question, the Taoiseach should consider the appalling conditions of refugees in camps in Beirut.  I was there in July and it was absolutely shocking and worse then what we would see in the West Bank, Jordan or Syria.  As the Taoiseach seeks to get Ireland onto the UN Security Council, do these refugees have a right, as those on the Great March of Return demanded, to have that UN resolution vindicated and be returned to their homes in what is now called Israel?  If the Taoiseach does not believe this, his aspiration to be on the UN Security Council is meaningless because it is completely selective in its implementation of its own resolutions when it comes to the Palestinians.</p>  <p>  Will the Taoiseach look at UN Resolutions 55 and 56, which deal with the Kimberley process and conflict diamonds?  This is a process which the EU will chair and there will be a meeting from 12 to 16 November where reforms of the Kimberley process will be discussed.  There is a big demand in this regard by those who support the Palestinian people, and the Palestinian people themselves, because of Israel's flouting of international law, its suppression of Palestinian rights, its continuous use of violence, which we saw most recently against the Great March of Return and the killing of approximately 170 people, its use of administrative detention and the shocking national law passed by Netanyahu recently that states Israeli Palestinians no longer have the right to self-determination - another tenet of international law - in Israeli territory.  Will the Taoiseach champion this demand, that Israel is suspended from the Kimberley process and that its diamonds, in which there is a massive trade that finances the Israeli military, are suspended from the Kimberley process and labelled conflict diamonds as they absolutely are?</p><p>I will allow Deputy Ryan to ask a short question.</p></speech>

Who in the Government will signal our disapproval of President Trump's comments yesterday in his UN speech?  I do not know if the Taoiseach has had the chance to see it yet but the level of bellicose and threatening content was beyond belief.  It would have been laughable in its arrogance if it were not so worrying in its intent.  What is the diplomatic approach and how can we comment on that?  Will the Taoiseach comment on it?  He may not have had the chance to hear it so if the Taoiseach does not comment on it today, will the State, in the form of the T&aacute;naiste or the Taoiseach, make some response to what was said?  I ask the Taoiseach to listen to the comments and revert with a suitable response.</p></speech>

That applies to all refugees and not just Palestinian refugees.</p>  <p>  I did not have a chance to hear President Trump's speech in full, although I heard some extracts from it.  I am always reluctant to comment on extracts of a speech because comments heard in their entirety are often different from soundbites.  I can comment on two matters.  I strongly disagree with his assertion that we should abandon globalism in favour of patriotism; the speech seemed to be in favour of nationalism as opposed to globalism.  The Government has a different outlook in that regard and we are globalists by nature.  We are very much in line with European colleagues in defending and supporting the Iran deal, which we believe has been successful in discouraging Iran from developing nuclear weapons.  We stand with our European allies and colleagues in that regard in disagreeing with President Trump's approach to Iran.</p>  <p>  The Government recognises the Palestinian people's right to statehood, self-determination and to be treated decently.  The programme for Government provides for the recognition of a Palestinian state as part of a two-state solution.  It is important to point out that Palestine has not yet been recognised by many other peer countries and many OECD countries do not recognise Palestine as a state.  They include Canada, Japan, United States, Australia and New Zealand, as well as most western European countries such as France, Germany, Spain, Britain, Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands.  One of the few exceptions in western Europe is Sweden, and as a consequence of its recognition of Palestine as a state, the Israeli embassy was closed, relations were downgraded and Palestinians did not benefit at all.  The country endured some criticism from the US for doing that, so we should bear that in mind when we make any of our decisions.</p>  <p>  When I met President Abbas, I had the opportunity to raise with him concerns about the protection of the Christian minority in the Palestinian territories, which has dwindled over the years.  I also raised the need to protect lesbian, gay, bisexual and transsexual, LGBT, Palestinians.  Decriminalisation has yet to occur in Gaza, although it has occurred on the West Bank.  I also raised the need to advance the rights of women.  I had a good engagement with the delegation on those points and they responded to my concerns.  I encourage other Members when speaking about Palestine not to ignore such matters.  We should support Palestinian statehood and self-determination but we should not allow ourselves to be silent when it comes to discussing the treatment of the Christian minority in the Middle East, particularly Palestine, as well as the need to promote women and decriminalise homosexuality in Gaza.  I am disappointed when people speak about Palestine but seem to turn a blind eye to such human rights matters.</p>  <p>  The delegation was also grateful to Ireland for some of its actions, particularly our support on the Jerusalem matter and voting in the interests of Palestine in the UN General Assembly in opposing the recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.  The delegation also welcomed our support for Palestine's observer status and membership in the UN and the fact that we increased our contribution to UNRWA after the United States reduced its contribution.</p>  <p>  Deputy Martin asked about the trade Bill and our advice is that the legislation contravenes a European law and, therefore, cannot be implemented.  It would probably be struck down if challenged in the European courts.  The advice should not come as any surprise, as trade is an exclusive EU competence and individual countries cannot make their own laws with respect to external trade.</p>  <p>  Our UN Security Council campaign does not in any way inhibit us from raising concerns about human rights or objections to the actions of other states.  I am sure the countries with which we are competing - Canada and Norway - will take the same view that the fact we are campaigning for votes should not restrain us in saying what needs to be said.  The person Deputy Martin asked about is seconded to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and reports to the T&aacute;naiste.  As a communications professional, that person is involved with the communications aspect of our campaign for the Security Council.</p>  <p>  With regard to the Northern Ireland institutions, Deputies now know that, unfortunately, Northern Ireland holds the international record for the length of time in which a government has not been formed.  It is something of great regret that we do not have devolved government in Northern Ireland and people do not have an Executive or Assembly to represent their interests.  It is regrettable that we do not have functioning North-South institutions, as they have been there for a number of years.  While governments are ultimately there to support parties, there cannot be an Executive formed in Northern Ireland unless Sinn F&eacute;in and the Democratic Unionist Party, DUP, are able to do a deal.  Both of those parties are involved in breaking the world record as they have been unable to do a deal and form a government.  It is deeply regrettable.</p>  <p>  To a certain extent, Deputy McDonald protests too much at comments from my Ministers yesterday.  It is a fact that Sinn F&eacute;in collapsed the Assembly and Executive over the renewable heat incentive, RHI, controversy.  When the inquiry is done, it may transpire that Sinn F&eacute;in knew more about it sooner than it previously indicated.  It is all history now and we must work together to try to get things going again.  That is the position.</p></speech>

The meeting was attended by Ministers and senior officials from the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, Foreign Affairs and Trade, Justice and Equality, Health, Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Transport, Tourism and Sport, Housing, Planning and Local Government, and Defence.  Arrangements are being made for the next meeting of Cabinet Committee F but a date has not yet been finalised.  The role of the Cabinet committee is "to keep the State's systems for the analysis of, preparation for, and response to threats to national security under review and to provide high-level co-ordination between relevant Departments and agencies on related matters".  Given the recent publication of the O'Toole report on the reform of the Garda, we intend to have a meeting of this Cabinet sub-committee and the justice sub-committee to examine the Government's response.</p></reply>

We could also bear in mind that we have had a change of Garda Commissioner, among other changes in the Garda.</p>  <p>  I ask about the long-standing discussion about how national security be addressed.  The report on the future of policing has recommended the immediate creation of a national centre for intelligence collation and analysis.  It would be a strategic threat assessment centre, STAC, situated centrally within Government, and which should be headed by a national security co-ordinator.</p><p>That would be a new post and that person would answer directly to the Taoiseach.  Does the Taoiseach agree with this recommendation and will he implement it?<br/><br/>They also recommended the updating of our capacity to cope with cybersecurity strategy, which, as the House will be aware, particularly based on events in the UK, is important, and there is a proposal that the national cybersecurity centre should answer to the national security co-ordinator and, therefore, indirectly to the Taoiseach.<br/><br/>On the role of the Naval Service in the Mediterranean, I am sure the Taoiseach will be aware that the ship that M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res, MSF, has been using to save lives, the <i>MV Aquarius</i>, has been deflagged by Panama.  Has the Government considered offering to register that ship so that it can continue to save lives?  I understand the responsible line Minister is Deputy Ross.  Will the Taoiseach ask the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to do that because MSF carries out important life-saving work in the Mediterranean?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-09-26a.329" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1239" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="13:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018092600023#V00200"><p>I am delighted that the Taoiseach raised with the Palestinian President, Mr. Abbas, issues relating to women's rights and LGBT rights.  No doubt in giving Mr. Abbas the benefit of his wisdom, the Taoiseach would also have reflected that he and his colleagues themselves are relatively recent converts to those causes.  I am sure the Taoiseach can assist Mr. Abbas in walking that journey.</p>  <p>  I welcome the publication of the report of the commission on the future of policing.  I thank Ms Kathleen O'Toole and the commission for its considerable work.  It is undoubtedly a significant and detailed report and it includes many positive recommendations in respect of modernising policing.  I commend the important strong emphasis on community policing and policing within the community.  I commend the emphasis on human rights and tackling cybercrime and on providing quality training for garda&iacute;, as well as an access programme.  All of these are welcome but there are some areas on which we will need further clarification and that we need to pause to consider.</p>  <p>  We have concern around the proposal to abolish the Policing Authority and to reassign some of its functions, for example, with regard to appointments to a new statutory Garda board and the Garda Commissioner.  It is not insignificant that there were differing views on that point within the commission itself and I note the minority view of Dr. Vicky Conway and Dr. Eddie Molloy contained in the report in that regard.  We, in Sinn F&eacute;in, had sought more power for the Policing Authority, including in respect of appointments, because the authority was making progress and was advancing.  An independent appointments process is essential and transparency has to be kept front and centre.  It is our view that the current process is the best way of doing business and the removal of such powers from the authority is a regressive step.</p>  <p>  Can the Taoiseach tell us whether the Government has considered the report, when will we have a debate and what is the current state of play?  Can we have some sense of the next steps in the process?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-09-26a.330" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1224" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="13:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018092600023#V00300"><p>In the context of the national security committee and its work, the report led by Ms Kathleen O'Toole is an important piece of work.  The report is comprehensive and deals in a fundamental way with many of the issues that require reform in relation to security and in relation to Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I support, for example, its emphasis.  Many of the recommendations tally with much of Fianna F&aacute;il's submission to the review.  We had called for this review originally.  We were the first party to call for a fundamental Patten-style review of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and we welcome it.</p>  <p>  We are weak as a country when it comes to cybersecurity.  It is a vulnerability and I note that countries are telling the Taoiseach that Ireland is vulnerable to cyberattack.  We need more specialisms and we need faster routes to recruit specialists to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in cybersecurity and related fields.</p>  <p>  There are issues around the Policing Authority and the Garda Inspectorate.  I can recall someone articulating at one stage that there were five bodies to which a Garda Commissioner had to answer, including an Oireachtas committee, and there are question marks about that.  Simplifying and streamlining that is important.  I believe in a strong Policing Authority but there has to be a clear delineation of roles.  The operational responsibility has to be with the Garda Commissioner and his team.  A policing authority that is only about public commentary is not what I envisaged the authority to be about, for instance, every time an incident happens.  I do not like the look of that.  That is not where an authority should be.  I would look at the minority view in the report and accept there is a debate to be had on that.</p>  <p>  GSOC has not worked out.  There are garda&iacute; investigating garda&iacute;.  There are two many minor issues getting in GSOC.  Garda&iacute; are being sent to investigate every kind of complaint whereas their primary responsibility should be to continue to do their job.  I refer to a higher management rank in certain parts of the country.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately, the sense of satisfaction with GSOC inquiries among the public does not seem to be high.  I base this on those who have come to my party seeking inquiries.  I find it difficult to recommend to such persons that they should pursue serious issues with GSOC.  I am reluctant because it could extend the trauma for the individual without any definitive sense of there being closure at the end of the GSOC process.  The process is far too long altogether.</p>  <p>  There has to be a radical look at GSOC.  Its operation should be concerned with more serious complaints as opposed to those that should be primarily dealt with by the internal governance structure within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which has not worked in practice for the past while.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-09-26a.331" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="13:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018092600023#V00400"><p>Cabinet Committee F is a new committee, which I set up to deal with national security issues.  It is not designed to meet on a regular basis but on an <i>ad hoc</i>basis as needed.  A separate Cabinet committee deals with public sector reform, including justice reform.</p><p>My practice, as I have explained to the House in the past, is to deal with more issues in the Cabinet as a whole.  I believe in collective Cabinet responsibility and where important matters need to be discussed such as Brexit, I prefer to have them discussed by the whole Cabinet rather than a sub-committee of the Cabinet.  Sometimes that takes more time.  It is why we often must have two meetings a week or why meetings take longer than they did in the past, but, as much as possible, I prefer to have a matter, if something is of great importance, discussed by the Cabinet as a whole rather than a sub-committee.  I appreciate one needs different types of government and different styles of government for different times, but I certainly felt during the previous Government that many matters were decided by the party leaders or decided by the Economic Management Council, EMC, and then rubber-stamped by Cabinet.  I have tried to adopt a different approach, involving the Cabinet more collectively in making decisions.  For example, the O'Toole report was discussed by the full Cabinet first.  We got to discuss it as a whole rather than sending it to a Cabinet sub-committee, which would then just refer it on for a short discussion by the full Cabinet.  The same applied to the appointment of the Garda Commissioner.  That went straight to the full Cabinet rather than to a Cabinet sub-committee.</p><p>With regard to the commission on the reform of policing, I want to put on the record my profound thanks to Ms Kathleen O'Toole and her team for the good work they have done over the past few months to produce this report on time and to inform us regarding a roadmap for the reform of the police service between now and 2022.  The commission identified that date as the centenary of the creation of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and suggests that we set it as our target date for introducing a reformed policing service in Ireland.</p><p>Among points that are particularly appealing to me in the report are the acknowledgement that policing is about more than the Garda, the need for more of what we saw yesterday, for example, which was a joint approach between the Garda and social services to responding to crime, preventing crime and preventing recidivism, and some of the proposals in respect of GSOC.</p><p> I agree with Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin regarding some of the proposals in respect of GSOC.  It makes sense to move GSOC from being what it is now into an independent office as the police ombudsman, to use its permanent staff more and second garda&iacute; a little less, and have minor complaints dealt with at Garda level rather than at the level of the ombudsman.  It was correct to establish GSOC but it needs to be strengthened and modernised.  The report also allows for the Garda Commissioner to be allowed to do his or her job, which is also important.  The current accountability arrangements where there is a garda inspectorate, a Garda authority, GSOC and regular requests to appear before at least two committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas, namely the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality and the Committee of Public Accounts, are quite strange.  One must get the balance right between allowing people to do their job and being accountable for it and then spending all their time accounting, which can make it hard to execute the job.  The reports suggestions on the Garda Commissioner may be a step in the right direction in that regard.</p> <p> The Government considered the report at Cabinet, noted it and provided for its publication.  We have committed to study it, respond to it and develop a reasoned response and a timelined action and implementation plan before the end of the year, which is the next step.  The Minister for Justice and Equality will develop a reasoned response to the report and to each of the recommendations and then a timelined action and implementation plan, which will go to a Cabinet subcommittee and then to Cabinet.</p> <p> It would be useful and welcome to have a discussion on this very good report in the House.  I do not want any of my comments to be misconstrued as the Government not accepting the report or the vast majority of it.  That does make good sense.  There are one or two particular recommendations which are controversial and, as has been noted, on which there is disagreement.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-09-26a.342" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1324" speakername="Frank O'Rourke" time="14:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018092600025#CC00300"><p>I thank the Ceann Comhairle's office for selecting this matter for discussion as a Topical Issue.  I thank the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, for coming to the Chamber for this debate.  I would like to outline three areas of significance that are contributing to people unnecessarily ending up homeless or being unable to access the services that have been put in place to prevent them from becoming homeless and help them to get into some form of semi-permanent or permanent accommodation.  I believe a policy change from the Minister or the Department will be needed to address some of the issues I am raising.  Perhaps a letter of approval can be sent to each local authority to clarify the position, provide more flexibility and assist in a positive way.  As a representative of the Kildare North constituency, I am speaking about Kildare County Council.  Everybody in this House wants to prevent people from becoming homeless and help them to secure a roof over their heads through the social housing allocation of each local authority or through private rental accommodation.</p>  <p>  The first area I will touch on is the homeless housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme.  The Minister put in place a placefinder service under the homeless HAP scheme to help people to find private homes to rent.  When a tenant who has received notice to quit presents himself or herself to Kildare County Council or any other local authority, he or she has to find a home so that he or she does not end up homeless.  We are finding that people in such circumstances are unable to access upfront deposits until very close to their eviction or get-out dates.  It can be extremely difficult for such people to find homes at short notice.  Some people do not get their deposits until three or four weeks before their eviction dates.  As it is very difficult to find properties in north Kildare, like everywhere else, through the private rental market, people need to be given as long as possible to try to source private rental accommodation.</p>  <p>  Having spoken to various groups about this issue, I am aware that when people present themselves to a local authority after receiving notice to quit - three or four months' notice is normally given, but it might be as little as two months in some cases - they aggressively pursue new properties in order to ensure they and their families do not end up homeless.  If people in such circumstances are able to prove that they have found a property, if they have confirmed to the homeless section of the local authority that they are going to be homeless and if the notice to quit is in order with the statutory guidelines, I believe they should be able to access a deposit and one month's rent to assist them in finding alternative accommodation.  It does not matter whether this happens a month or three months in advance of the eviction date.  As it gets closer to the eviction date, it gets far too tight to try to find a property.  That is how people end up in hotels.  I know of cases in which people from County Kildare are being accommodated in hotels in Carlow and Portlaoise.  This is not very practical for families when children are going to school and people are going to work.  People in these circumstances need all the time and all the supports they can get to try to find alternative accommodation.</p>  <p>  I can understand where the Department's 30% disposable income calculation comes from.  It is acceptable that people must have a disposable income to live on after they have paid their rent and made their top-up payment.  As I have said in this House previously, the difficulty is that even with the 20% discretion under the HAP scheme, there is still a gap with current rental market values.  I have asked for this discretion to be increased temporarily while we are waiting for supply and stock to come into the market.  In the absence of such an increase, the gap between the payment under the HAP scheme and the actual current rental market value needs to be made up so that families in these circumstances can find homes.  People are getting letters of support from reliable family members - parents, brothers and sisters - who are in full employment and are willing to help with their efforts to get homes and pay the balance.  Under Kildare County Council's current policy, unfortunately, it is unable to accept such letters unless it can get bank statements and letters from employers to confirm that the people in question are in permanent employment and can support their family members in making top-up payments.  That is adding to the substantial distress and concern of families.  It is very difficult to get a property.  If one is lucky enough to get a property, one should be allowed to get family support to make a top-up payment as long as one has a strong letter of support.  I believe it is unwarranted to require people to undertake needless tasks like getting personal details from those who are providing support to them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-09-26a.343" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1295" speakername="Eoghan Murphy" time="14:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018092600025#CC00400"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  I acknowledge his hard work and dedication on it.  We have been in contact on HAP and homelessness prevention measures on a number of occasions.  The Deputy has been working with my staff over recent months to bring various concerns to my attention.  He has explained his concerns about the terms and consistency of application of homeless HAP in his area.  I have heard what he has said.  HAP is operating as a flexible and immediate housing support and is available throughout the State.  It is playing a vital role in families and individuals that are eligible for housing supports.  More than 40,000 households are having their housing needs met via HAP.  Over 21,000 landlords and agents are in receipt of payments under the HAP scheme.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy knows, the rent charged for HAP accommodation must be within the limits set down for the household type in each local authority area.  HAP tenants pay a weekly rent contribution to the local authority, based on their income and ability to pay.  The HAP rent limits were increased significantly in July 2016.  They were increased by up to 60% in some areas.  The Government has given each local authority the flexibility to agree to make a payment under the HAP scheme of up to 20% above the maximum rent limit if that is necessary because of local rental market conditions.</p><p>The increased rent limits, together with the additional discretion available to local authorities to exceed the maximum rent limit where necessary, are allowing HAP households to find suitable accommodation and willing landlords.  At the end of the second quarter of 2018, excluding households accommodated under the homeless HAP arrangements operated by the Dublin Region Homeless Executive, 21.3% of households nationally were benefitting from the additional discretion.  In those cases, the average rate of discretionary payment was 15.7% above the relevant rent limits.  In a further reply, I can give more detail on this to the Deputy.</p> <p> In addition to the flexible and immediate housing supports set out, a significant dimension to homeless HAP was the establishment of the place finder service, to which the Deputy referred.  Homeless HAP is a targeted support for homeless households who may find it difficult to secure HAP tenancies and, under the place finder service, the local authorities can appoint new dedicated staff to assist individuals in emergency accommodation to find appropriate long-term housing solutions.  The place finder service has been in operation in the Dublin region since 2015 and the option to establish the service was made available to all local authorities from January 2018.  It was take up in Kildare earlier this year.  It is a matter for each local authority to determine the appropriate deployment of the place finder service based on local needs, including the point at which a household will be directed to the service.  I understand that many local authorities are focusing on those households who are already in emergency accommodation, assisting them to transition into HAP tenancies.  The place finder service recognises that, for a certain number of people, particularly those already in emergency accommodation, sourcing property and securing a tenancy, including the financial constraints around deposits and advance rent, might be very challenging.</p> <p> The provisions of the homeless HAP scheme provide local authorities with the discretion to assist homeless households by providing a deposit to secure property and paying up to two months' advance rent.  This discretion was provided as an exceptional measure for exceptionally challenging circumstances and, as such, must be applied only where necessary.  To broaden the provisions of advance rent and deposits is contradictory to the principles of the HAP scheme, and could undermine the careful checks and balances that are in the system to ensure the best use of public funds.  That said, the Deputy has been engaging with my Department on this matter.  I hope he will be able to have further engagement in which he can bring to light more specific issues that can be examined given what he has raised in the D&aacute;il today.</p> <p> The homeless HAP scheme has been successfully utilised by the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive across the four Dublin local authority areas since February 2015, supporting more than 3,600 households to date.  More than 1,600 new homeless HAP tenancies have been set up so far this year.  That goes for people at risk of homelessness or coming out of emergency accommodation.  Therefore, it is an important support for people in this crisis.</p> <p> We monitor HAP data on an ongoing basis.  I have a report to hand for the Deputy that he will be interested to see.  We also monitor other key information relating to the private rental market.  I am satisfied that the current HAP rent limits and the flexibility to exceed them in certain circumstances provide local authorities with the capacity necessary to assist households in securing rented accommodation that meets their needs.  However, I am grateful to the Deputy for raising his concerns.  I hope he will engage further with me and the Department over the coming days.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-09-26a.345" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1324" speakername="Frank O'Rourke" time="14:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018092600026#DD00200"><p>To that end, I am meeting some of his officials tomorrow on these three issues, in Dublin as far as I know.  If there is clarity and flexibility in respect of the issues, it will assist positively.  I am not criticising the measures at all.  What I am saying is that the homeless HAP and place finder services put in place in Kildare County Council earlier this year were welcome.  This was a debate we had just before the summer recess.  Anything we can do to prevent people from becoming homeless is welcome.  The issue, however, is the timing associated with one's ability to gain access to the upfront rent and deposit.  That is the key and the point I wanted to tease out with the Minister.</p>  <p>  Departmental officials and the council are saying one has to be very close to one's eviction date before one can gain access to the upfront deposit and rent.  That is contributing to homelessness because one will not get the property the day one goes out looking for it.  If one is looking for a property before one can access the fund, one is competing with someone who has the money in his or her back pocket.  Therefore, if someone has notice to quit - a statutory document that meets the criteria - he or she is virtually on the home stretch to being homeless unless he or she gets another home.  If one has a notice to quit in two or three months, one will have to go into emergency accommodation unless one can find a home.  That is costly.  We want to avoid that.  Therefore, I suggest that tenants should be able to access the payment immediately on getting the notice to quit to help them to get another home between then and being evicted.</p>  <p>  On the 30% threshold related to disposable income and the letter of guarantee, the problem is that most families need a three-bedroom semi-detached house.  I know the HAP relates to the family unit but, rather than getting into that calculation, as we do not have time, we should note it equates in some cases to the rent for a three-bedroom semi-detached house.  With 20% discretion, the HAP in Kildare is about &euro;1,250.  The current market value is &euro;1,500 so a top-up is needed.  We need to be able to get the local authorities and Department to agree to accepting the letters of guarantee that are coming in without forensically subjecting them to post mortem analyses, which leads to further problems.</p>  <p>  The final issue concerns people on the housing list who are currently in HAP units.  They could be in them for one, two or three years.  Where these houses come up for sale, perhaps because the landlord or landlady is under financial pressure from banks or other personal reasons, is there a possibility that the Department could engage with the local authorities to ask them to purchase them?  They are not purchasing the units.  The families affected need to look for alternative accommodation but may not be able to gain access to any, perhaps due to the lack of supply, and end up going into hotels, not even in the county but perhaps in a neighbouring county.  That is a problem.  Can some clarity be brought to this?  Can approval be given to the local authorities such that if a property occupied by someone getting the HAP payment is being sold, it can be purchased either by the local authority or the departmental agencies?</p></speech>

Of course it can be improved.  Not every Deputy in this House recognises the considerable support the HAP is giving to people who are at risk of homelessness or coming out of emergency accommodation.  Tens of thousands of people throughout the country have been supported.  Some individuals, for ideological reasons, refuse to recognise that.  Therefore, I welcome the Deputy's comments.</p>  <p>  Let me address the three specific points the Deputy raised.  On the matter of when someone can access the deposit and the first month's rent, we should consider it.  I want the Deputy to engage on that.  I will tell my officials to engage with him to determine what is going wrong.  We do not want, for administrative reasons, to be putting people into distress when they should not be in distress.</p>  <p>  On the Deputy's second point, on the gap and letters of comfort, we should examine this also.  We are talking about taxpayers' money so we have to ensure appropriate checks and balances are in place.  I do not want to be taking discretion from local authorities.  Since they are at the front line of the services and at the coalface, they might have a better understanding of what they are dealing with themselves.  Of course we can examine it, however.</p>  <p>  With regard to the third point, on the Department potentially buying homes or allowing the local authority to buy a home with a tenant in HAP and which might be sold, the difficulty concerns value for money and cost.  It may not represent value for money for the local authority to purchase the home.  That is a call it has to make.  It is based on the costs of the time, its own building programme, other acquisition programmes it has, prevailing market rates and everything else.  I appreciate the Deputy's highlighting of these issues.  We can engage positively on them through my Department over the coming days and through the meetings the Deputy is having.</p>  <p>  I will give the Deputy the official report being prepared for the Oireachtas joint committee tomorrow.  Let me give the Deputy a couple of figures on Kildare.  The total number of active HAP tenancies is 1,667, 355 of which were set up in 2018.  That is roughly 14 per week.  Therefore, HAP is helping people in the Deputy's county, which is great.  We want it to help more.  The average rent being paid in Kildare by the local authority to the landlord is &euro;916, which is above the national average.  Of course, Kildare is very close to where many people want to live and work.</p>  <p>  The Deputy also raised the use of discretion.  About 42.6% of people getting HAP, or almost half, are getting the discretionary payment.  They are getting some uplift above the HAP rate.  With regard to the amount of uplift, they are getting an average of 14.1%.  The Deputy, when talking about the gap, should note that even those who are coming into the system do not need the full 20%.  Most of them are in this category.  Therefore, there is still plenty of flexibility and plenty of headroom in the 20%, notwithstanding the point the Deputy raised about letters of comfort and the additional payments.  We can consider these issues.  The HAP is working.  Anything we can do to make it work better, I will absolutely welcome.</p></speech>

In saying this, I mean no disrespect to the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly.  I said this to him in March in respect of a similar topic when he came in to deputise for the Minister.  I understand the Minister for Health is very busy and I have no problem with that but he has never once come here to address one of my Topical Issue matters.  Normally all of the issues I raise are related to University Hospital Limerick.  Can the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, Ceann Comhairle or Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, raise my concern with the Minister so he might try to get here himself the next time one of my Topical Issue matters is selected for discussion?  By March, I had tried to get him in here 13 times.</p><p>Obviously, there have been more occasions since then.  It is quite disappointing that this hospital has the worst crisis in the State and has the highest number of people on trolleys every day, yet the Minister has been unable to appear on even one occasion.  I understand that he is busy but he cannot have been unable to attend on every occasion it has been selected as a Topical Issue.  It is simply not good enough.</p> <p> To be honest, I have lost count of the number of times I have submitted a Topical Issue on this matter.  There is an issue in the hospital every day and every week.  The full capacity protocol is used every day in Limerick even though it is supposed to be a temporary emergency measure.  That means staff are under huge pressure and elective operations are cancelled.  A number of them were cancelled this week.  There have been 166 people on trolleys already this week.  There were 46 on Monday, 63 on Tuesday and 57 on Wednesday.  However, I am astonished that I am obliged to ask the Minister for Health today, and the Minister of State might convey this to the Minister, to explain why there were not enough staff to feed patients in the emergency department in Limerick's largest hospital last week.  It is a crazy and outrageous situation.</p> <p> On Monday I was contacted by somebody who works in University Hospital Limerick.  That person stated there was only one attendant providing food for over 90 patients in the emergency department for the previous four days and, as no staff cover was available, some patients could not get food or even a cup of tea.  The agreed figure for such staffing at the hospital is a minimum of three.  This is inexcusable.  Today there are 57 people on trolleys in the hospital.  That is more than the number of patients on trolleys in 17 other hospitals across the State combined.  Can the Minister explain this situation?  I hope he or his Department will contact the hospital management immediately to ask what is happening.  What additional funding will be provided to ensure there are enough staff to feed the patients at least?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-09-26a.350" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1261" speakername="Jim Daly" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018092600027#EE00200"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising the important issue of the challenges arising in University Hospital Limerick and, on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Harris, I welcome the opportunity to address the House on this issue.</p>  <p>  The emergency department in University Hospital Limerick, UHL, is one of the busiest in the country, with approximately 67,000 attendances annually.  Demand for emergency department services at the hospital continues to rise with an increase of 6% in attendances at the emergency department at UHL in 2017 compared with 2016.  I acknowledge the distress overcrowded emergency departments cause to patients, their families and front-line staff working in very challenging working conditions in hospitals throughout the country.  Behind every trolley number there is a patient in need of effective, timely and compassionate care from the health service.  That is why the Government is committed to breaking the cycle of overcrowding in the health service.  As emergency department attendances continue to rise, those departments are under increasing pressure to meet the new level of demand and ensure the provision of timely, safe and effective care for patients.  A considerable number of patients presenting to the emergency departments are frail or acute patients who often require admission.</p>  <p>  With regard to the claim that some patients are not being fed, the University Limerick, UL, hospital group has advised that except for one catering attendant who is currently on leave there is a full catering staff complement.  UL hospital group has advised that it is managing this deficit from its relief pool.  At times there may be unscheduled sick leave that could create pressures on the service but full catering is available to all patients who are not fasting due to medical reasons.</p>  <p>  As regards patient experience, the House will be aware that overcrowding at the UHL emergency department has been a concern for some time.  The emergency department is frequently working above capacity using the full capacity protocol and this contributes to inefficient ways of working and poor patient experience.  In recognition of this high demand, funding of &euro;24 million was provided for the new emergency department at UHL, which opened in May last year.  The new facility is triple the size of the old emergency department and immeasurably improves the experience of patients in terms of their comfort, privacy and dignity.  Furthermore, against a background of increasing demand for unscheduled care services, an extra &euro;30 million was made available nationally to respond to winter pressures in 2017, with a further &euro;40 million being provided in 2018.</p>  <p>  To conclude, the UL hospital group has assured me that full catering is available to all patients who are not fasting due to medical reasons.  Regarding the overcrowding, I am acutely aware of the current situation and I am monitoring it closely.  The Department, the HSE and UL hospital group are carrying out measures to improve the situation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-09-26a.351" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1327" speakername="Maurice Quinlivan" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018092600027#EE00300"><p>The Minister of State said the UHL emergency department is frequently working above capacity.  It is doing that every day.  The emergency measure has been in place every day this year and was in place every day in 2017 so it is not frequently but daily.  That leads to elective surgeries being cancelled and extra beds being put into wards, which is not safe.  When this measure was introduced by the HSE a number of years ago in consultation with the nurses, the nurses expressed huge concern but they were told at the time that it would be an emergency measure.  However, it is used every day in Limerick and that is not good enough.  It is not true to say in the House that it is frequently used as it has been used every day this year and every day in 2017.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State mentioned the new emergency department.  It is a good facility but, as I highlighted previously in this Chamber when the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, was in attendance as the Minister, Deputy Harris, did not turn up again that day, the nurses were concerned about the proposal to have 24 people usually on trolleys in the new department.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, rubbished that and said it would never be the case and would never happen.  The hospital in Limerick would almost be happy if there were 24 people on trolleys because the number is far more than that every day.</p>  <p>  I wrote to the Minister last January seeking a meeting with him to discuss ways to reduce the overcrowding problem in the hospital because it is abundantly clear that his plan for our local hospital is failing miserably.  I have yet to hear back from the Minister.  University Hospital Limerick is in a terrible state.  It is constantly overcrowded and operations are being cancelled all the time.  It is unfair to make nurses, doctors and staff work in such pressurised, overcrowded conditions and even worse to make sick patients lie on trolleys for days waiting for a bed.  How does the Minister expect to attract nurses home from places such as Australia to work for lower wages and in far worse conditions?  I was proud to stand with the nurses outside the hospital a number of days ago.  The full capacity protocol is being used every day despite it being designed only for emergencies.</p>  <p>  The Minister might refer back to me on my questions this time, although I was told previously that he would and he did not.  What plans does he have for the 96-bed extension?  When will it be built?  Is there any progress on speeding that up?  The last we heard is that the plans might be ready in 2019 but we need the building work to start.</p></speech>

To address the issue of the Minister not being present, it is a very fine balance.  I appreciate the Deputy's frustration and I am not saying this to be argumentative but to illustrate the challenges the Minister faces daily in getting the balance right between trying to deal with the issues and engaging with the parliamentary process.  The House places many demands on the Minister's time, as do the Seanad and the committees, as well as the pleas for hearings from numerous lobby, interest and advocacy groups and representative bodies.  The Minister, like every Minister, has to make a judgment call between the amount of time to spend actively engaging one-on-one with complaints and issues and actually dealing with the problems behind the scenes, such as by meeting with UL hospital group, the management and getting one's head around the issues that exist.  That is a continuing balance.  I can assure Deputy Quinlivan it is not a snub to him.  Diary challenges are always difficult, and they are probably more challenging for the Minister for Health than for other Ministers.</p>  <p>  With regard to the emergency department in UHL, I wish to reassure the people who are using the facility that there is a full catering service available at the hospital.  I believe the Deputy emailed the management about it and he probably should engage more proactively with the management.</p></speech>

Notwithstanding that others took the time to talk to him, the Minister did not, which is disappointing.</p>  <p>  Mr. Daly is one of a large number of parents dealing every day of the week with the broken promises that have been repeatedly made.  There is a pattern emerging in that whenever there is an expos&eacute; in the media, such as "Living on the Lists", the Minister issues an apology and commits to ensuring things improve, and when there is no improvement and this generates further media interest, we get another apology.  The scoliosis waiting lists are not being dealt with in any meaningful way, particularly for those children who have complex medical needs.  More than 60 children with complex needs who have been on the waiting list for a long time have been moved to what is known as a "suspended list", in some cases because they have been on the list for so long their health has deteriorated to the point of them not being able to have the surgery.  </p>  <p>  The theatre in Crumlin children's hospital is not yet open five days a week.  It should be open seven days a week but it is not yet open five days a week as promised.  Children were also promised that they would be sent abroad for treatment.  So far this year, only one child has received treatment abroad.  Hundreds of children await this surgery and only one has been sent abroad to have it.  This is not fair to them.  I met Sophia McGuinness, who cannot speak but uses assistive technology to communicate.  The first thing she said to me was, "I am in pain".  She is in pain while she waits for surgery but she is not the only one.  There are other children in pain while they wait for surgery.  Their parents want to see real efforts to address their children's pain.  People like Aaron Daly should not have to stand outside Government Buildings begging for a few minutes of the Minister's time.</p></speech>

I met her father a couple of weeks ago in D&uacute;n Laoghaire and he told me of her case.  He has since told me that, in 2015, he wrote to then Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, who told him that no child would be waiting for scoliosis surgery for longer than 15 months.  At that time, Sophia had to wait 16 months following her initial diagnosis in 2013.  More recently, the Minister for Health said no child will wait longer than four months for surgery.  Sophia was placed on the urgent list in April 2017 and, without having had her surgery, she was removed from it in August 2018, which is 17 months later.  The Government, at the highest level, through the Taoiseach and Minister for Health, has let this young girl down.  Sophia suffers from scoliosis.  Her condition is deteriorating and she could face the possibility of emergency surgery because the screws in the rod in her spine, which goes into her hip, are loose.  Her internal organs are being affected and the curvature of her spine is worsening.  This deterioration may impact on her ability to undergo surgery.  It is not fair to put a child, and her parents, through that suffering and pain.</p>  <p>  As stated by Deputy O'Reilly, this is linked to the wider issue of 52 people having been removed from the surgery list, giving the impression that the list has reduced when in fact these people have only been moved to what is known as a "suspended list" and still need surgery.  Many of them have complex needs and the State is letting them down.  This is not acceptable and I want to know what the Government intends to do about it. </p></speech>

The Minster for Health and I are sorry that any child and his or her family experience a long waiting time for treatment for scoliosis.  Improving access for these patients is a key priority for this Government and specific plans have been developed and funded in 2017 and 2018.  However, I fully accept there is room for further improvement in patients accessing timely scoliosis treatment.  The Minister has prioritised the development of a sustainable scoliosis service in Ireland and an additional &euro;9 million has been provided to the HSE in 2018 specifically to develop paediatric orthopaedic services, including further increasing access to scoliosis services.</p>  <p>  Last Monday, the Minister met the deputy director general of the HSE and the chief executive officer, CEO, of the Children&rsquo;s Hospital Group to discuss their short-term and long-term plans to provide a better service for patients and their families.  The Minister sought assurance from the CEO regarding the management of children with complex needs, as a great deal of concern has been expressed by parents of children with such needs.  The CEO advised that there are a number of complex and difficult cases at present and that the hospital has provided all support and services required to children and their parents, and will continue to do so.</p>  <p>  Where a child has multiple clinical complexities and medical conditions, consultation between parents and a multidisciplinary team of specialist consultants is required to develop and manage a treatment plan.  Given the complex nature of the care required, this often requires extensive discussions and planning so that appropriate surgery can be scheduled in a timely manner, if clinically safe.  Notwithstanding that, the Children&rsquo;s Hospital Group has made progress towards the development of a sustainable scoliosis service this year.  It published the scoliosis co-design ten-point action plan in July and an orthopaedic implementation group has been established to oversee its implementation.  The action plan was developed through the participation of professionals,</p>  <p>families and advocates.  Importantly, this has ensured that the voice of the child has been incorporated.</p>  <p>  This year, the group aims to deliver 447 procedures.  This equates to a near doubling of 2016 activity.  By the end of last week, 314 surgeries, of which 151 were spinal fusions, had been delivered.  Overall activity is slightly ahead of surgical targets.  Waiting list figures for 21 September show that there are 77 active patients waiting for scoliosis treatment, of which 35 have been waiting for more than four months, which is a reduction of 21 since the start of this year.</p></speech>

This is about children with complex needs.  The Government's mechanism for dealing with these children is simply to move them from the primary list to a suspended list.  These children do not need an action plan or another working group; they are in pain and need surgery.  Is this lost on the Minister of State?  What these children and their parents need from the Minister for Health is a timeline for treatment for those on the urgent list; confirmation of when the theatre in Crumlin children's hospital, which is currently only open three days per week, will be open five days a week; an explanation as to the reason only one child has received treatment abroad, although they were told this mechanism would be used to address the waiting lists; and if will he commit to an independent clinical review of the cases we have raised, namely, the children who are on the urgent list, the children that have been forgotten and those who are in the most pain?</p></speech>

It is even more disappointing for Sophia's father that despite repeated requests the Minister will not meet him.  Consequently, we get answers which do not respond to the questions asked.  Yesterday, I asked the Taoiseach when the backlog of urgent and complex will cases be addressed.  The Government needs to stop trying to manipulate the figures by moving people to a suspended list.  As stated by Deputy O'Reilly, only one person has had scoliosis surgery in the UK under the treatment abroad scheme, despite many people being in pain and suffering.  Why has the scheme not been approved for people on the list who are urgent, complex cases?  If the Minister or the Government does not fully understand what is going on, they should meet Sophia's father who will explain the problem and discuss what solutions can be found to end Sophia's suffering and the suffering of other urgent and complex cases. </p></speech>

Deputy O'Reilly keeps using the word "simple" in that she wants simple answers to simple questions but this is a very complex, difficult area of surgery.  The Deputy can nod her head all she likes but we sometimes have to listen.  Nobody in this room has a monopoly on understanding or compassion for what is involved for these patients.  I am a practising politician the same as everybody else in this House and we all have constituents and are aware of people, sometimes family or other people connected to us, who are awaiting these urgent, difficult and complex procedures.  There is a variety of challenges and difficulties, both in capacity of personnel and in a lack of theatre space.  There are other competing procedures because scoliosis is not the only procedure that has waiting lists.  There are many other waiting lists in the medical system competing for the same theatre space, skill set, time and resources.  We as a Government prioritised scoliosis in 2018 and put an additional &euro;9 million towards it.  As I understand it, as of today that money will not be spent by the HSE in its entirety because of the difficulties and challenges that are there.  Despite what the Deputy might say-----</p></speech>

She can nod and if she wishes to play politics with this she can continue to do so but there is another side to the story that has to be understood before we can reach a solution to this difficult and challenging issue.

I am speaking on the role of primary school principals - teaching principals and those who are walking principals.  I raise this after meeting the Irish Primary Principals Network and also from working closely with my colleague Councillor Alison Gilliland of the Irish National Teachers Organisation, INTO, which consistently raises this issue with me.</p>  <p>  Put simply, the working conditions of primary school principals are unbearable.  I know the Minister has set up a forum to deal with many of the issues I will outline but as part of the budget the Minister now has a unique opportunity to deal with these working conditions.  If he does not do so, the educational benefit for children at primary level, which is so important and where my own children are today, will suffer.</p>  <p>  I was gobsmacked to find out that the guidance on the role of principals has not been updated since a circular in 1975.  That was the year I was born and this is not acceptable.  There has been a range of missives and circulars issued on the role but the actual role has not been updated.  Principals are expected to be in charge of all education and teaching in schools but are also expected to be administrators and the administration has now grown to an insufferable level.  For instance, last year there were 84 circulars issued to primary school principals.  How in the name of God can principals be in charge of the teaching component of the school, which is so important, and be in charge of administration at that level as well with the resources that they have?</p>  <p>  Three people who I know well, one of whom is a good friend and all of whom are female, have resigned their jobs as primary school principals and teachers.  They are more or less the same age as me and a couple of them are younger than me so they are all in their late 30s and early 40s.  They are resigning as principals because they cannot bear the conditions they are working under.  It is a real issue for them that it is actually more difficult to get back into teaching because teachers do not really have any rights in that sense.  They do not even have panel rights so that is another issue the Minister needs to deal with.</p>  <p>  Given all of the responsibility that principals now have and the fact that in many cases they now have to work through the summer to deal with the backlog of administration, the Oireachtas, including the Minister, must now deal with these real issues.  They need more resources and they need greater pay and conditions.  They have to know that the Department will support them in their role because voluntary boards will not cut it in terms of picking up the slack.  There are so many good people on those boards and so many brilliant chairs of boards of management but it is still ultimately left with the principals to deal with having the best teaching conditions and to do all of the other administration, much of which is necessary but some of which could probably be better dealt with.  A model for helping these people and resources for doing it must be found or the educational opportunities and benefits for my children and the children of this country will be affected.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-09-26a.369" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="14:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018092600029#GG00900"><p>I welcome the Deputy's interest in this issue because the role of leaders in our schools is hugely important and I wish to give him some reassurance.  We have successfully recruited 6,000 additional teachers to our schools in the last three years and as the Deputy knows, the standards of reading and mathematics among our ten years olds are the best in Europe.  We have a great deal to be grateful for around the manner in which our schools are managed.  That does not mean that we should stand still and I have set an ambitious target that by 2026 we will seek to have the best education and training service in Europe.  That means improvements in literacy, digital technologies and the learning environment, breaking down cycles of disadvantage and reforming curricula to update them and make them more relevant to people.  That involves change and we of course rely on principals to be the leaders of change within their schools.</p>  <p>  I mention some of the measures we have taken, for example, last year we appointed 2,600 additional assistant principals.  Not only have we done that but we negotiated an agreement with the trade unions on a new approach to management which involves a more devolved and collective leadership.  It also involves reporting on the role that these assistant principals will take within their schools and will move away from appointments based on an approach of one's turn having come around.  We have also made a substantial investment in primary education which has helped principals in having additional resources at their disposal and I have mentioned some of these in the written reply.  We have reduced the pupil-teacher ratio to the lowest level ever in the history of the State and we have provided over 600 resource teachers and over 1,800 special needs assistants, SNAs.  Hundreds of schools are now operating innovative projects in clusters where principals and others within the school are taking on leadership roles in adopting technology and applying DEIS initiatives and creative initiatives.</p>  <p>  On teaching principals specifically, this year I allocated additional time off to allow them to manage their responsibilities more effectively.  I increased it by between two and four days depending on the size of the school as is outlined in the written reply.  Extra time off has been a continuing demand from teaching principals.</p><p>The other thing I did, which came directly from the INTO because its former president was impressed by the initiative, was to introduce clusters.  There were 14 clusters in existence which meant that more remote schools could come together in a cluster and pool their time off, which allowed them to employ a permanent position.  It has been really beneficial.  I have extended the number of clusters from 14 to 50.  </p> <p> The biggest thing, which the Deputy did not refer to at all, is the creation of the centre for school leadership, which is now investing in the leaders in our schools.  Each year about 1,000 principals get the opportunity to have mentoring or coaching or to gain postgraduate qualifications to improve their capacity to manage their resource.  They are very significant changes.  As the Deputy rightly observed, many principals feel there is too much coming at them.  They recognise the importance of child protection, new curricula and new ways of teaching.  All of these things are important.  We have set up a forum to look at the sequencing of those things to try to allow them to manage those issues.  In terms of pay, principals are benefitting under the pay agreement.  I absolutely support the Deputy's belief that investing in leadership is possibly the best bang for our buck we can get.  We have started to put in place measures that show our commitment in this area.  </p></speech>

It has to be a concern for the Minister.  Will the Minister please update the guidance for principals, which has not been updated since 1975?  I am sure people will be shocked when the Minister outlines what their full role is.  A survey by the Irish Primary Principals Network showed that 89% of principals felt their mental health has been affected by the amount of work they have to do and 84% said they are considering stepping aside from their job.  I have a very good friend who went to school with me, has been working in a local school but has resigned from her job.  She does not have any rights.  Will the Minister address this situation in order that principals who choose to go back into the classroom, because of the volume of work, have some rights, given the amount of time they have given?</p>  <p>  The Minister also is not dealing with issues of pay parity.  Pay equality across all areas for teachers is required.  Commitments with regard to pay parity that were given to principals in 2007 should be addressed.  We need to look at the issue of the restoration of posts across the board in the primary sector.  My wife is a teacher.  Posts were suppressed and they need to be brought back in to help principals.  We need to understand why there has been a change on the appointment figure needed to get a mainstream teacher back.  Why is it higher than to retain a teacher?  It does not make sense.  We need an immediate increase in the ancillary grant allowed for secretarial staff, caretakers and cleaning staff.  Once and for all, will the Minister help those teaching principals who work in small schools?  A friend of mine who sat beside me in primary school is a brilliant teacher and a brilliant principal.  His name is John.  They deserve a day off a week to deal with what I have already outlined.  There are 84 circulars.  To be a working principal in a three-teacher, four-teacher or five-teacher school and to deal with this at the same time is impossible.  Is it any wonder that principals are resigning from their posts?  They want to stay teaching but they did not sign up to do this amount of work.  It is inconceivable to do the work.  They do not get paid well enough.  They cannot do it.  Will the Minister please deal with that issue as well?  </p></speech>

I am glad the Deputy is urging more investment in education because it is something I want to do.  The Deputy should acknowledge there are many really good principals doing great work and we have succeeded at a very difficult period in driving our education system to have the highest standards of literacy and numeracy in Europe.  That is no mean achievement.  We need to credit our leaders in the schools with that.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-09-26a.384" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1353" speakername="Brendan Howlin" time="15:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018092600030#HH01500"><p>I move "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>  <p>  In 2013, the House passed the Local Government Reform Bill, which was steered through by Phil Hogan, who was then Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  My party was in government at that time.  Some 80 town councils were abolished, which was a mistake.  I personally regret that the Government of which I was a member made that decision and that we did not stop town councils from being abolished at that time.  I spent the past three days at the British Labour Party conference trying to persuade the British people to think again on a matter of some importance to this country.  If one recognises that something needs to be done differently, it is important to put forward a solution.  Town councils were replaced by 137 municipal district councils which were essentially sub-committees of the county council.  Let us not pretend they were anything else.  They are sub-committees of the county council and are seen as such.  They were also replaced by public participation networks ,which were meant to involve local community groups and other civic society actors in discussing local concerns.  That was an extension of a proposal that I made many years ago when I was in the Department of the Environment and published a document called Better Local Government.  </p>  <p>  It is fair to say that five years later, this policy has not delivered an ideal system of local government.  I acknowledge it is not all bad.  Some public participation networks have successfully engaged with civic society and with their own communities but they are very much reliant on the presence of active citizens and organisations in particular areas.  In other places, public participation networks have not worked so well and that must be acknowledged too.  Municipal district councils have not delivered as a replacement for town government.  I say this as somebody who has been involved in the local government system since I was a town councillor.  I have been mayor of Wexford, a county councillor and Minister for the Environment and I have been involved in looking at the evolution of local government and at people attempting to alter local government.  One thing I have been clear on for a very long time is that for decades, the Department of the Environment was anxious to merge town government into a county structure.  As I have said, municipal district councils, as were created in 2013, have not delivered.</p><p>First and foremost, they operate across urban and rural areas in a way that undermines the concept of the urban centre, the town, the driver, the heartland of a community.  A town is a defined urban area, a place with clear boundaries, with deep municipal histories that in many instances, as both Ministers of State here will remember, go back a long time.  These are areas with an identity.<br/><br/>A clear focus on building towns lends itself to better planning decisions, more compact coherent settlement patterns, which in turn facilitates the delivery of public services, and which are more likely to deliver a stronger local economy.  Strong and vibrant towns drive local communities.  They drive not only the urban environment but also rural enterprise and they create jobs.  Towns are central to economic development.  They are the central focus of commercial activity up and down the country, and all of us who have had the opportunity to travel up and down the country know that.<br/><br/>There are approximately 100 towns in Ireland with a population of more than 5,000 people in what we describe as &quot;defined urban boundaries&quot;.  Some of them have had town councils for more than a century, and some for many centuries.  Others, notably places like Swords and Blanchardstown, never had a town council, despite in some cases having populations in the tens of thousands.<br/><br/>We propose changes to what existed in the past.  Our proposals are for a single type of town council which is a uniform system across the country, rather than the system which many of us remember, where there were town commissions, town councils, urban district councils and borough councils - each with not only varying membership but also varying powers.  In the past, there were also large towns which had no council at all for anomalous historical reasons.<br/><br/>I ask people to give our proposal a fair hearing because it is one of the most important democratic initiatives that we can take as a House.  We propose councils of nine members for every town with a population of 5,000 inhabitants or more, and councils of 15 members where the town population exceeds 25,000.  The restoration of town government is to be done on a cost-neutral basis using the existing local government resources, simply moving the personnel that was taken from the town councils back to them.<br/><br/>Town government is not primarily about the economy, however, important and all as that is.  It is about local democracy.  According to an Edelman global survey of people's trust in institutions, Ireland scores particularly low.  In 2018 just over one third of the people, 35%, reported trust in government.  A lack of trust in government, the media and so-called &quot;experts&quot; is a recurrent theme not only for Ireland but around the world.  It was a theme that helped elect US President Donald Trump, it was a theme that drove Brexit, and it has been a theme in the argument made by populist, nationalist parties across Europe, which continues to be made by them, as Mr. Steve Bannon and some of his cohorts arrive on our shores now to bang a populist drum.  The whole theme is best summarised in one of the Brexit slogans, &quot;Take back control&quot;, or in President Trump's election slogan, &quot;Make America great again&quot;.  They have all these empowering-sounding slogans.<br/><br/>What we want to do in the Bill that we are now proposing to this House is to give real power back to local people at local level.  One of the core principles of the European Unions is subsidiarity, which is the idea that decisions should be taken as closely as possible to the persons or people who will be affected by them.  It makes sense for the population of towns, that is, those most affected by the decisions of local government, to be directly involved and consulted.<br/><br/>What does &quot;Take back control&quot; mean?  It sounds mundane but it really is relevant.  If Deputies talk to people in their communities, they will find that the things most people get animated about are what we would call &quot;the smaller things&quot;, namely, the street lights, the footpaths, the vacant buildings, dog-fouling or minor things in the greater scheme of things but important things for people.  It is town councillors, who are clearly accountable to the local population, who address those issues most effectively.  Many people involved at local level do not know who their town councillors are because, as the Ministers of State know, the councillors in my area, for example, are drawn from a quarter of the entire county of Wexford.  It is just not working.  It is often the job of councillors to inform citizens about what is going on with planning permission, big development plans and to bring them around to some of the big ideas.  Citizens must know and trust the people they have elected to do that.  It is that interface or immediacy which is so important.  <br/><br/>This proposal is undoing a mistake that was made, and it goes much further than the <i>status quo</i>.  I am not asking people to go back to exactly what existed prior to the abolition of town councils, but to put in a uniform system where every urban centre will have the opportunity to elect its own council and restore the immediate connection of the community to the elected council.  I ask the Ministers of State present and the Government to give fair consideration to what is a truly important proposal.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-09-26a.386" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1349" speakername="Alan Kelly" time="15:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018092600031#JJ00200"><p>I thank the Ministers of State for coming in today.  The Labour Party proposes this Bill because we believe it is necessary.  My party colleagues around the country felt that getting rid of town councils was a mistake and that reforming and regenerating how they worked was the right thing to do, but we went a step too far.  I am thinking of people like Mr. Sean Counihan in Killarney, who has been chasing us on this issue for years.  It was a mistake, and it was one made by Fine Gael and the Labour Party.  We need to deal with it now.  I thank in advance Fianna F&aacute;il, Sinn F&eacute;in and others who have said they would support such a change.</p>  <p>  This is a practical Bill to bring back town councils for towns that have 5,000 people or more, and it is necessary.  In my county, Nenagh, Thurles and other towns need town councils, because town councils are on the money when it comes to issues relating to real things that affect people in towns.  One can see how the municipal districts and the areas covered by the council at county council level do not get down into the detail as quickly as possible.</p>  <p>  Our proposal is cost neutral, which means it should be embraced even more.  It also gives the opportunity to right the wrongs of situations, such as Ballincollig and other towns, that did not have town councils when they should have had then, while other areas had town councils historically which maybe should not have.  The Government has an opportunity to right a wrong as well as dealing with something that is needed.  </p>  <p>  It is also apparent that it is needed when at various announcements and when dignitaries come to an area the representative is not from the area.  He or she could be from the other side of the county, doing his or her best, and be a good person across a whole range of different political views, but not actually from the area.  In a situation where there are town councils, they would obviously elect one of their own in order that if there were a major tourism initiative, a major announcement or a dignitary coming to the town, he or she would be able to deal with it and do so with local knowledge.  There would be no need to ask for directions or where the event was on.</p>  <p>  We recommend that a local government commission should have between nine and 15 members.</p><p>We are open to compromise in how that works but that is our proposal.  In fairness to the Minister, he has acknowledged that there is a need for a change.  I refer to the changes made to the local government boundaries.  I looked at my own local district municipal unit of Nenagh.  The councillors from all parties were expected to cover an area that extended from the Limerick border to the Clare border and all the way to the Galway border.  It was incredible, crazy and impossible for many councillors, paid &euro;17,000 or &euro;18,000 a year, to cover that area.  That has been acknowledged, as the councillors are in the same municipal area now.  The local electoral area has been changed and made more realistic for their area of coverage.  That was a step in a positive direction.  Now we need to go further when it comes to dealing with the return of town councils and add to the progress made in recent times.  When it comes to town councils, there may be some push back against this within the local government administration.  I know what I am talking about in this regard from previous jobs I held.</p> <p> Ultimately, Deputy Eoghan Murphy is the Minister and we are the people's forum. Town councils may have been a nuisance for some in local authority administrations.  I do not accept that.  I believe the decision was wrong and it is up to us, the Minister and the Government to be strong and to support this Bill because we know it is the right thing to do.  Walking around the corridors of Leinster House, the majority of Members in the Minister's party, my party and in Fianna F&aacute;il - no other party is represented in the House at the moment - know that we have to do this.  If the current Government will not do it, it will have to be done by a future Government.  I ask the Government to take the opportunity we have now to deal with this issue and show a bit of progressiveness and embrace what we are doing.  The Government can change it if it wants.  We are not stuck in the mud on every single detail.  We will embrace any changes that the Government wants to bring forward but I believe that the D&aacute;il is going to vote to back this Bill.  I hope the Government will accept it in that spirit.</p></speech>

I am proud of the fact that I started there, as did my late father in 1967.  In government, we become part of a collective agreement and I was part of the decision that collectively agreed to abolish town councils.  I am glad that we as a party have taken a decision to seek to rescind that decision.  It was a grievous error and I acknowledge fully that I was part of that decision.  I support the legislation that we have put forward so that we can create again the front-line for representative democracy, that is, through our municipal or district councils.  People will argue that local authorities such as Cork County Council have the municipal districts.</p>  <p>  In my experience, since their creation, people have been a little removed from the decision-making mechanisms.  The resources of the local authorities have become more stretched in the allocation of engineers, housing staff and outdoor staff and they are covering a larger geographic area.  If we decide to implement this legislation as a Legislature and reinstate town councils, what we will put back into them is the core competency of staff who always looked after these towns.  Since the abolition of town councils, I have noticed a diminution of services in towns.  I am sure many Members find themselves doing council-related work more often.  We are all happy to do that because all politics is local and we will help everybody at every turn of the road, no matter how high up the food chain we go politically.  I believe though that having a coterie of town councillors again representing districts and towns would be another service.  It would mean a return to basics and to core principles in representative democracy and the people would welcome that.</p>  <p>  No matter what town a person comes from, when he or she walks down the main street as a public representative - whether as a councillor, a Deputy or a Minister - there will always be somebody on a Friday or Saturday afternoon that will ask why we abolished the town councils.  I am hard-pressed to give an answer.  This legislation seeks to address that.  People liked the idea that they had a local person they could go to who would represent their interests and advocate for the bread and butter issues that affect them.  I refer to getting the bread and butter issues or the simple things right because sometimes it is the simple things that exercise people.  The town council gave everybody access on those bread and butter issues.  There is now a sense of remoteness.  Citizens in towns do not feel that connectedness through the relationships in the municipal districts.  That is something that this legislation would address.</p></speech>

I welcome this opportunity to discuss important issues relating to the local government system, to hear the views of Deputies, and to share with the House the Government&rsquo;s proposals for the future of local government in Ireland.  One thing that most of us value is the work of local government, be that in the former town councils or the existing local authority areas and local councils.  Most of us present served that apprenticeship and it is without doubt a major benefit coming into this House as a Deputy and going on to be committee chairmen or Ministers or Ministers of State.  The opportunity that one gets at local government level is second to none.  It gets a person ready for a proper career in politics and political representation.  We cannot value that enough.  Many of us have developed good working relationships at that level as well and that has benefits in this House because we carry that with us right the way through.  Local government has achieved much when it comes to politics and we all value that.  We might differ over the different versions of it and disagree with certain parts of it but we all recognise the importance of local government one way or the other.  It is important that we remind ourselves of that as well.  </p><p>The Bill proposes the re-establishment of town councils, as recommended by a Local Government Commission based on the census report on population distribution and movements published by the Central Statistics Office.  We are opposing the Bill, mainly for reasons of timing, as the matters raised are part of the report on local government matters and have been submitted to the Government and the Oireachtas under the Programme for a Partnership Government.  There are also parts with which we might agree with but for now we think the timing of it is premature. I am instead proposing that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann declines to give the Bill a Second Reading in order that the issue of town councils can be considered in the context of the report, Municipal Governance - Districts, Towns and Local  Electoral Areas.  This examines potential measures to boost local government leadership and accountability and to ensure local government funding, structures and responsibilities strengthen local democracy, including the issues of town or borough council status and a reduction in the size of local electoral areas.  That is currently under consideration by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government.  </p><p>The report is with the committee, having been submitted to it for consideration in April.  It is appropriate to allow the committee time to complete its deliberations before making any decisions.  The Government's, Action Programme for Effective Local Government - Putting People First, which was the platform for the wide-ranging reform programme implemented in 2014, set out an ambitious vision for local government to be the main vehicle of governance and public service at local level, leading economic, social and community development, delivering efficient and good value services and representing citizens and local communities effectively and accountably.We intend to further that objective, building on the significant improvements that have been made in recent years.  All of us can see how local government has stepped up in the past number of years to deliver a much wider range of services.</p><p>Local authorities have been involved in driving both social and economic development and have had some great success, and that should be recognised.  They are taking a greater role, and in my view are much more of an authority than they used to be and are much more relevant across the board in many aspects of the development of our towns and counties, and rightly so.  They are the key vehicle for making things happen at a local level.  I have certainly seen the benefits in recent years.  </p> <p> The next stage in that process is the report to the Government and the Oireachtas under the programme for partnership Government on potential measures to boost local government leadership and accountability and to ensure that local government structures and responsibilities strengthen local democracy.  The programme signals this process as the next wave of local government reform and indicates specific issues to be considered, including reducing the size of local electoral areas and the question of town and borough councils.  To date, several papers have been submitted to the Government and to the Oireachtas for consideration.  In addition to the paper on municipal governance, papers on local authority boundaries and local authority structures have also been completed.  Indeed, the recommendations in the local authority structures paper are the main substance of the Local Government Bill 2018 which will be before this House in the coming weeks.  My colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Phelan, also will bring forward proposals on local authority leadership, governance and administration - the issue of directly elected mayors - in the coming weeks, and a final paper examining devolution of functions will also be presented to Government in the coming weeks.   </p> <p> To achieve the vision set out in the 2012 policy document, the structural framework must be fit for purpose.  Accordingly, a core element of the reform programme was structural reorganisation, involving the unification of certain city and county councils, and replacing 80 former town councils by municipal districts integrated with the county councils in a new, innovative, system of governance.  This builds on the Barrington committee report of 1991 which identified the need to overhaul sub-county arrangements including the replacement of existing town authorities and also highlighted significant concerns with the existing town council system, including the issue of double representation, where towns have separate councils in addition to representation at county level.  Outdated boundaries and other anomalies have now been removed.  The new system provides more effective and community-focused decision-making and implementation.  There is full integration of local authority resources across each county and elimination of duplication both in administrative and electoral terms.  The new municipal district system is also closer to the European norm, covering the entire territory of each county, in contrast with the previous unbalanced arrangement of isolated town councils, while rural areas, many town environs, and some larger centres lacked municipal status and local governance.  Indeed, a 2013 Council of Europe report specifically welcomed the decision to replace the town council system with the new municipal district arrangement, particularly because it ended the dual franchise in towns, which the report described as unfair.  </p> <p> An important benefit of the new system is a more appropriate assignment of local authority functions.  Local matters are dealt with at municipal district level, while those of wider strategic application are decided at county level, without duplication between county and district jurisdictions.  In effect, there is now a dual system of governance but an integrated administrative structure in each county, which maximises operational efficiency while ensuring devolved decision-making throughout the county.  </p> <p> Turning to the Bill itself, I must record that it has technical flaws, particularly the fact that it is linked to repealed provisions of the Local Government Act 2001.  Substantial redrafting would be required if it were to progress.  However, there are more fundamental issues in principle with the Bill.  Insofar as there are shortcomings and scope for improvement in current local government arrangements, these matters can, and will, be addressed without resorting to the re-establishment of an array of town councils, if that is what this House decides.  Nobody has said that everything is perfect.  Ongoing reform is required and we must constantly tweak the system to make it better.  The Bill relies on a local government commission to define the town councils.  The local government commission is provided for in sections 89 to 95 of the Local Government Act 2001, which have not been commenced and were repealed in 2014; the commission does not exist.  Even if the local government commission was in place, the Bill provides for the commission, and not the Minister, to make orders determining what constitutes a town, including defining the boundaries of a town.  The Bill proposes that each town council would consist of one local electoral area.  Having more town-focused local electoral areas was part of the terms of reference for the independent local electoral boundary review, which is now complete.  Local electoral areas will be now be provided for in legislation, in line with the boundary review report recommendations, and these recommendations do not align with the proposal in the Bill that each town council would consist of one local electoral area.  It would not be possible to implement the Bill's proposals based on the 2018 local electoral area boundary committee report.</p> <p> Arguments being made for restoring the town councils, such as a lack of investment by local authorities in towns, are not generally supported by facts.  My home town of Navan, for example, has been very well served by the municipal area approach, although I recognise that the boundary of the municipal area in that example is married closely to the new town boundary, as well as some rural areas.  It is one of the municipal areas we got right, and that has been recognised with the changes that have happened with the boundaries.  We have tried to recognise those larger towns and realign the boundaries to match up with some of those towns.</p> <p> Concerns about lack of urban focus, as well as geographically large municipal districts, have in the main been addressed by the local electoral area boundary review of 2018, published in June 2018, in line with its terms of reference to define distinct urban-focused local electoral areas as appropriate in respect of towns where the population was equal to or greater than 15,000.  This provision also applied to county towns where they did not meet the population criteria. </p> <p> There is little general support for the restoration of town councils, even among councillors, as has been confirmed on several occasions by comments from the Association of Irish Local Government.  We have met that group at various meetings and it has said that it is not interested in restoration, and has said the same publically.  We have to have this conversation, but-----</p></speech>

There are different views out there, and unlike Deputy Sherlock, I do not have people knocking on my door to ask where the town council has gone.  That does not really happen.  Perhaps it happens in some cases, but I am being genuine and telling the truth.  I am not saying the Deputy is incorrect, but that there are different views out there.  I am not getting the feedback the Deputy is getting, although I recognise that Deputy Cassells will also have very strong views on this matter as well and might get different feedback.  We have to find a way of processing the different concerns that exist on different issues.</p>  <p>  The reasons for restructuring local government in 2014 are still valid, and if town councils are re-established, the flaws and weaknesses that gave rise to their dissolution will return and would, in fact, be increased because it would be necessary to apply much wider boundaries in many towns and create authorities in new locations.  In my county, for example, places such as Ashbourne, Dunboyne and Enfield did not have town councils.  The only councils we had were those in Navan, Kells and Trim.  It was not exactly a fair system.  Those boundaries had to be changed, and that process took a long time in some cases.  It was not perfect, and it is worth bearing that in mind.  The change to municipal areas makes it much more effective.  There also have been some benefits in terms of effectiveness and decision-making.  I often felt that a twin approach was required, between the council area and the town council.  Decisions were delayed, and in my experience, decisions delayed are often bad decisions.  If we ever go back to the town council system that should be borne in mind, because the opportunity for nothing to happen then arises.  </p></speech>

Indeed, I introduced a Bill on behalf of Fianna F&aacute;il on the re-establishment of town councils last year, which was brought through Second Stage and committee scrutiny before Christmas, after which the Government tried to suffocate it with a money message.  However, we will persevere.</p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il is passionate about making sure that we can have an enhanced system of local democracy, because the model of the municipal district simply does not deliver that in a truly meaningful way.  It has conspired against our urban centres and means they are not provided with the powers to improve the lives of the people living in them.  We flagged this issue quite clearly, and indeed were joined in chambers across Ireland by members from other parties who shared our view.  We said clearly that if key powers, including budgeting and planning powers, were taken from local towns, the ability to positively impact the way these towns are governed would be neutered.  Each town is unique.  Each has its own challenges and its own strengths.  Accordingly, the ability for each town to set different commercial rates, rather than having one rate per county, was always helpful in bad economic times when councillors could use their discretion and judgment to help businesses survive.  Equally, in terms of the passing of town plans, councillors in a particular urban centre knew the area best and could produce stronger plans.  </p>  <p>  I spent 17 years as a councillor at town and county level, and our ability to get things done was far more effective at town council level, where we ran budget surpluses, had the powers to raise our own finance, take bank loans and pursue projects for the people of my town, Navan.  These plans were not subjected to a vote or a debate at county council level, where there was an inherently anti-town attitude from many members from other geographical areas.  We were already living in an over-centralised and under-represented system before the abolition of town councils, but it got worse after those councils were abolished.  We once had 1,627 elected councillors in Ireland.  It has been slashed to 950 in the name of reform.  Lest anyone think we had too many councillors before this, let us reflect on the hard facts.  </p><p>The average population per councillor in Ireland used to be 2,815 and even that was the highest in the EU in 2015, with the UK in second place.  We now have one councillor for every 4,838 persons, effectively 5,000.  Let us compare that to the rest of Europe.  In France, there is one councillor for every 118 persons.  France has 36,500 councillors.  In fact, across Europe the average of number of people per councillor is in the hundreds, yet here we have one for every 5,000.  Those issues might have gotten lost for the ordinary person in the street, but when ordinary people saw the impact hit home as their towns formed part of larger urban boundaries, in some cases the size of D&aacute;il constituencies, the net impact was realised.  As I said, the crucial issue of finance then kicked in and the revenue which had been raised in towns from commercial rates or parking charges was now pooled into a county council budget.  Our towns have suffered as a result.<br/><br/>Politically, it has to be said that it was the Labour Party which supported Fine Gael in government in implementing this disaster.  It was the assassination of our democracy and it was shameful.  I heard Deputy Brendan Howlin in the Chamber earlier today accusing Fianna F&aacute;il of buying popularity at election time, yet here we are debating the re-establishment of a much-needed layer of local government because Deputy Howlin and the Labour Party went along with a so-called &quot;populist&quot; move, culling 1,000 councillors in the name of reform to try to make it look to the public that they were doing something positive.  It was unforgivable because it centralised more power.  More devastatingly, it crippled the ability of small and large towns to run their own shows, to be free of the shackles of government and to progress their own plans.  It took away their ability to show how imagination could create urban spaces that are a pleasure to work and live in.<br/><br/>I read the email that Deputy Howlin sent around last week, with the <i>mea culpa </i>story about what they had done.  It was a like a fox going into a henhouse.  Having savaged all the chickens, he meets the farmer on the way out, and with a shotgun at his head says &quot;<i>Mea culpa&quot;</i>.  That is Deputy Howlin.  Here he is today, the Fantastic Mr. Fox, with feathers coming out of his mouth as he begs forgiveness for culling so many effective councils that represented the beating heart of our towns.  <br/><br/>I served on Navan Town Council and was honoured to have been mayor of my town on two occasions.  We achieved a hell of a lot.  Another town I know very well is Drogheda, located close to us, where the local government proudly held borough council status.  That town has felt the brunt of this decision very badly.  It is a town with a very proud Labour Party tradition, where I attended many meetings of the National Union of Journalists, NUJ, in the local union hall.</p></speech>

That town has felt the loss of those decisions.  We will not oppose this Bill on Second Stage because as I said, we believe that any advancement of democratic institutions is to be welcomed.  We made a firm commitment to town councils in our own election manifesto, and we moved our own Bill in this respect last year.  However, we also believe that the model to be introduced needs to be different from what was there before.  I have no problem admitting that there were many ineffective councils that had previously been town commissions.  They had little budgetary power, if any.  I also believe, as I said during scrutiny of our own Bill on Committee Stage with Deputy John Paul Phelan, that we need to be brave and imaginative about what we want to see for our local councils in future.</p><p>I have had a lot of engagement with councils in Italy, in the towns of Bobbio and Broccostella with which I twinned Navan.  I gained huge insight from interaction with their elected administration.  Those towns effectively have mini-cabinets at council level.  Different councillors have portfolios concerning infrastructure, education or recreational facilities and the mayor has executive powers.  The most immediate impact I could see was that when the mayor walked down the street of his own home town, people knew that this man was responsible for the running of their town.  With that come all the perks and responsibility of that role.  Crucially, people can see who is responsible when things go wrong and indeed when they go right.  They have a sense of belonging to the administration in their town.  There is a starting point for accountability, and that is crucial.</p><p>I firmly believe we need to get to that stage.  We have the ultimate pass-the-can system in this country.  We should be brave.  We should look at enhancing the executive control of our own council chambers as opposed to the board of directors ethos that we have at present, whereby councillors come each month to simply receive a chief executive's report and toddle off again.  We need something more radical and imaginative, something giving real power to those who are accountable to the people.  </p></speech>

It is similar to a Fianna F&aacute;il Bill that was produced last year.  Some 80 town councils and almost 750 town councillors were effectively abolished by the last Government.  This idea was not merely created or endorsed, it was actually championed as a populist move.  It fundamentally undermined democracy.  We were told it would save a lot of money.  That obviously never happened because every level of staff that was there before was kept on, and rightly so as they were needed.  The only thing that was taken out was one level of democracy.</p>  <p>  We heard from Deputy Cassells that there is now only one councillor for every 5,000 people and those councillors, especially those based in the towns, are massively overstretched.  One can see that from talking to any of the councillors dealing with those major towns.  Why is that?  It is because we used to have another layer of local democracy.  In those towns, councillors were councillors who had no ambition to be county councillors or Deputies.  They were solely and purely interested in their local town.  They were always on the ground and if there was an issue with lights or footpaths one could meet with them.  They knew who their engineer was.  They would meet their engineer later that day, and that engineer would be able to sort out the problem.  One now has to approach a county councillor who has to go to the town where the county council is based.  The request goes into the abyss and one may or may not hear about it again.  The council might have to contact some third party contractor, or Irish Water as the case may be, to solve the problem.  </p>  <p>  Local government spreads democracy.  It has been said that without local government we do not have democracy.  That is very much the case.  I very much want to see the return of our town councils.  I was proud to serve on a town council for five years.  It was a very effective town council that had a balanced budget.  The loss of those councils is an absolute shame on this democracy.  </p></speech>

I never served on a town council, but my late father served as chair of Ballina Town Council twice and before he went into public life served as town engineer, a position also occupied by my grandfather.  From that vantage, I note the debate we had last night is absolutely relevant to this debate.  Town councils, urban councils and borough corporations were the most effective providers of public housing in this country.  They delivered it and they minded it, when they were properly resourced.  This is a good step in the context of a housing and homelessness debate.  We are also holding this debate in the week of Tidy Towns.  Again, the urban councils, town councils and borough corporations were the initial providers.  They gave people the chance to take ownership of the issues and challenges facing their towns and to exploit their towns' cultural and economic opportunities.</p>  <p>  In the four years since that has been gone, towns have weakened.  I heard Deputy Howlin say the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment wanted this for years.  The Department got its way.  Deputy Howlin does not see the damage that has been done on a daily basis in towns throughout the country because he got his way.  We do, because we are the people on the ground.  This year, that damage resulted in community groups in towns in Mayo, such as Tidy Towns, graveyard management and tourism bodies being forced to wait until July to get their community funds because the county executive decided to use the town budgets as pawns in a budget battle with councillors.  Organisations suffered because of that.  That would not happen if we had town councils with their own planning powers, made up of nine people known in their communities, or whatever the figure in this Bill is.</p>  <p>  The Minister's lack of ambition for towns throughout the country is ridiculous.  He seems to be afraid to restore their power because Fine Gael does not like town councils.  It never did well in them because it never understood them.  The Minister has the chance to undo the damage his constituency colleague did in 2013.  He has the chance to restore Kilkenny's reputation by restoring town councils.  </p></speech>

It utterly failed to transform how we do politics in this country.  However, this policy shift must be welcomed.</p><p>The main strength of town councils was in the personal touch.  One of the town council's most vital roles was regular liaison with the local area office of the local authority on issues such as grass cutting, road and footpath maintenance, signage, area enhancement and weed control.  These are all the simple things that go unnoticed unless they are not done.  For example, Lismore, a stunning heritage town, was dependent on its town council to promote tourism, interact with the tidy towns group and liaise with the local authority.  The loss of the town council was widely felt by the local community.  In Ireland, towns were used to electing representatives to represent them at local level.  In 1898, local government in Ireland was recognised.  The county town of Dungarvan, which has a population of 10,000 people, became an urban district in 1898.  This system worked well and contrary to the idea peddled at the time of its abolition that we had too many elected representatives, we had the lowest number of councillors relative to population in the EU.  The seaside town of Tramore, with a population of 12,000 residents, lost its town council and the right to make local decisions.  We need local solutions for local problems.</p></speech>

Bot&uacute;n a bh&iacute; ann nuair a chuir an Rialtas deireanach deireadh leo agus c&eacute; nach bhfuilimid ag lorg go dtabhairf&iacute; iad ar ais mar a bh&iacute;odh siad, t&aacute; deis ann anois ruda&iacute; a bhr&uacute; chun cinn agus rud nua a chur ina n-&aacute;it.</p>  <p>  I welcome this opportunity to support the motion because the loss of their town councils was strongly felt in many towns.  More than five years ago, more than a dozen town councils and 100 town councillors in my county were dismissed.  Those town councils had provided a voice in their areas.  They provided a leadership role and a platform not just for local issues but for how national issues impacted the local community.  Macroom residents, for example, would have reasonably expected to be able to walk down the street any day and meet a number of councillors if they wished to raise an issue with them.  They also have expected to be able to go into the town council office to discuss a housing application but this is not available to them under the current system.</p>  <p>  The town councils were able to advance housing with a local emphasis.  I will focus on one example where people in Macroom lost out as a result of the previous Government's abolition of town councils.  Macroom Town Council was ready to start construction of seven houses in Masseytown.  The town council was dismissed and at county level there was a different focus on bigger schemes.  Time was lost having to retender and we have ended up with the houses being under construction only now, five years after the town council could have progressed them.  It means people in Macroom have missed out on the opportunity of having those houses over recent years.  I have no doubt that if Macroom Town Council had continued in existence families would be facing into their third or possibly fourth Christmas in those houses but they are not yet finished and it does not look like they will be finished this side of Christmas.  It was a mistake to end the town councils and the Minister of State needs to look at a way to bring back an upgraded variation of them.</p></speech>

Most seem to follow Napoleon's advice never to retreat, never retract and never admit a mistake.  The Fine Gael and Labour Party Government most certainly got it wrong when it abolished town councils, doing so without any public consultation to add insult to injury.  At least in this instance the Labour Party has recognised how ill-judged that decision was and is now advocating the restoration of our town councils.  The decision at that time showed a complete lack of understanding of how local communities function.  It prioritised the saving of a paltry amount of money over the empowerment of local communities.  Our 2017 Bill, proposed by my colleague, Deputy Cassells, sought to right that wrong.  The Bill before us clearly resembles that Fianna F&aacute;il Bill.</p>  <p>  The democratic deficit created in 2014 must be repressed to allow all of our constituents better access to the political process.  Our towns absolutely need good local governance structures to deliver quicker and more efficient services.  I got my first bite of the political cherry in Newbridge Town Council when the good people of Newbridge saw fit to elect me to represent them at that level.  I saw at first hand the incredible unpaid efforts of community groups, such as tidy towns, community games groups and many others, working to help one another.  I was privileged during that time to see so many dedicated people carrying out work to deliver new, exciting and innovative projects, activities and initiatives throughout our town.</p>  <p>  The point of the Maastricht treaty, which Europe adopted 26 years ago in 1992, was the principle of subsidiarity, whereby people would make decisions as closely as possible to the citizens on the ground.  This has taken us completely away from that.  We must absolutely restore town councils.  We must restore confidence in our structures.  We must restore local democracy and bring back real power to the people.</p></speech>

Many mistakes were made by that Government but at least Deputy Howlin has admitted to this one.  Putting People First was, in fact, putting people last.  I was a member of Bandon Town Council for ten years and served twice as mayor of the town in which I now live.  I was the first female mayor of the town, an honour of which I was very glad.  As such, I am supportive of the Bill.</p>  <p>  The Labour Party's Bill reflects similarities to the Fianna F&aacute;il legislation that passed Second Stage in 2017 following a commitment in our manifesto of 2016.  The reintroduction of town councils would revitalise towns throughout west Cork and the country as a whole.  I have made many references to this on many occasions.  Local government is a driving force behind towns and communities because it is at the heart of job creation, democratic representation, civic participation and local service provision.  Town councils ensure real issues pertaining to local matters that affect people in west Cork are tackled head-on.  It is important that people engage with local communities and participate in local government.  The town council structure is conducive to allowing this to happen.  Issues such as housing, vacant premises, commercial rates, increasing rents, water, road infrastructure and antisocial behaviour need to be addressed urgently but, more importantly, they need to be addressed continuously.  In this regard I welcome the principle of the Bill and we in Fianna F&aacute;il will work with all parties to revitalise local democracy.</p>  <p>  Town councils were the bottom rung of the ladder and when they are taken away it is very difficult to jump up to the next step.</p></speech>

This is why we voted against the Bill, introduced and passed by Fine Gael and the Labour Party, to abolish them in 2013.  Sinn F&eacute;in believes in the retention of properly functioning local democracy that provides for better engagement with citizens and improved accountability at local level.  There is nothing new in this and it remains our view.  The Local Government Reform Act did not reform town councils.  It abolished 75 town councils and five borough councils, including the borough council in Drogheda.  In 2012, the Labour Party and Fine Gael Government published Putting People First, which acknowledged the importance of town councils.  It was a big glossy brochure but despite it the Labour Party and Fine Gael went ahead and abolished town councils anyway.</p>  <p>  This Bill represents the height of hypocrisy.  The Labour Party was in government when town councils were abolished.  It voted for the abolition of the councils and the then Minister, Deputy Kelly, enforced the policy when he took over responsibility for local government.</p><p>There is a list the length of my arm detailing how Labour sold out during its time in Government.  It cut the respite care grant, lone parent's allowance and social welfare for young people, and introduced water charges and the local property tax.  Abolishing town councils was just another item on that long list.</p> <p> Section 10 claims that the re-establishment of town councils will be met from existing resources and there will be no additional cost to the State.  Will Deputy Howlin explain how re-establishing 80 councils could be done cost free?  How will additional councillors be paid, for example, and how will councils run without additional resourcing or budgeting?  I can only assume this section was included because of the obvious fact that establishing 80 town councils would cost money, and Opposition parties cannot enact legislation that costs money.  The Labour Party is now in opposition but when it was in power, it got rid of councils.  The Labour Party talks the talk in opposition but sells out the country when in power.  The people know this, as was made clear in the last election.  Every argument made by Labour today for the reinstatement of borough councils was known in 2012 and 2013 but the party still went ahead to abolish them.</p> <p> This Bill also only states that the Minister "may" resurrect councils if he or she so wishes.  The Minister knows that and it is only up to him or her.  There is an onus on the Minister to reinstate borough and town councils.  The Bill, unfortunately, would achieve nothing but the Deputies know that.  The Labour Party had the opportunity to reform local government as part of the national Government but it did not do so.  It just got rid of councils.  Labour does one thing in opposition and the complete opposite in power, so why would anybody trust the Labour Party after all it did?  Why in God's name would anybody give the party the time of day?  It is a new low in cynical politics, even for the Labour Party.</p></speech>

When Deputy Alan Kelly was Minister with responsibility for local government, he stated in reply to a parliamentary question that he was satisfied Drogheda had a status appropriate to its size and location within Louth County Council.  He said he had no proposals to introduce amending legislation to establish a new city authority in Drogheda or elsewhere.  His colleague, a former Labour super-junior Minister in Cabinet at the time who is from Drogheda, said absolutely nothing and put up no fight for the town.  He actively removed Drogheda's borough council.  Labour was warned about this consequences time and again of removing local democracy or power from borough and town councils and setting up toothless municipal councils.  We in Drogheda and Dundalk have had to put up with the mess created day in and day out since.  Louth has the two largest towns in the State and neither has a council worth anything.

I spoke to a very similar Bill in 2017 introduced by the Deputy across from me, and, needless to say, my position has certainly not changed.  The decision in 2014 to abolish our town and borough councils was a sad day for Ireland.  It left a deep democratic deficit that has not, and will not, be filled unless this policy is reversed and these councils restored.</p>  <p>  We can speak today about the destruction of rural Ireland and the breaking of the social contract between citizens and the State but the extent of power and decision making removed from urban communities at the time was fundamentally wrong.  In my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan, we lost eight town councils.  County Cavan lost councils in Cavan town, Belturbet and Cootehill, and County Monaghan lost Monaghan town, Clones, Castleblayney, Carrickmacross and Ballybay.  There were 72 elected members from all parties and none on these councils.  They were entrusted by their local communities to make the right local decisions to make their town the best place in which to live, visit, grow up, work and invest.</p>  <p>  This form of local government worked.  It was a short-sighted and ill-thought out decision to remove this tier of local democracy and administration.  Of course, at the time we did not have as much revenue to spend on public services but this has changed.  Now that it has changed, we must reconsider how best to reflect ordinary people's opinions in the democratic decision-making process.  It has been my consistent position, and that of Sinn F&eacute;in, that the best means of doing this would be through the restoration of town councils.</p>  <p>  At a meeting of the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government last May, the Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy John Paul Phelan, who is present, addressed the committee on the matter of local government reform.  He quoted a published report on municipal governance relating to districts, towns and local electoral areas, which "sets out a range of proposals to strengthen the current municipal district system within local authorities and to address identified shortcomings rather than re-establish town councils".  He also indicated that stronger powers would be preferred for municipal district members, which would involve strengthening the role and capacity of elected members at municipal district level, particularly in budgetary and local development matters, with financial capacity being of particular importance.  These proposals are welcome, as they indicate consideration is at least being given to restoring some powers to municipal areas but I still do not see any impediment whatever to restoring town councils.  The boundary changes announced over the summer period complement their restoration.  Local people and representatives make the best decisions for their local areas.  Fighting for investment, facilities and resources as part of municipal areas and their budgets simply will not deliver the same results.</p>  <p>  As others have said, the Labour Party has done an about-turn on the disastrous and short-sighted decision it made in government.  It is now attempting to rectify the disaster by introducing this Bill today.  I, for one, welcome this.  Ultimately, Fine Gael must do the same and admit a mistake was made.  I have made my own so it is not the worst thing to stand up and be man or woman enough to acknowledge it.  The Government should return power to the people and restore town and borough councils at the earliest opportunity.  I support this Bill and I welcome it wholeheartedly.  I commend it to the House.</p></speech>

He left ruin after him.  The Government, with the Labour Party a part of it, supported him.</p><p>Deputy Howlin was a Minister at the time.  I described him as being like the high priest because he would not listen to anyone.  Deputy Howlin had a close family member who was a senior member of the Association of Municipal Authorities of Ireland, AMAI, and consequently, Deputy Howlin above all should have been best advised as to the fatalities of this measure.  However, this was not the case and I do not know what medicine he was trying to dispense to people.  In Tipperary, Clonmel was a proud borough council and the Labour Party was founded there.  As a result, the Labour Party could not go back there to celebrate when the party's centenary came around, which was a pity.  I decried those who objected to the Labour Party.  It should have been welcomed back anyway to Clonmel, but to protests and everything else.  There is Carrick-on-Suir, as I said, Clonmel, Thurles, Templemore and, indeed, Nenagh, Cashel and Tipperary town.  Cashel of the kings has been renowned for centuries.  Now the council building, that was only opened a few years beforehand, is locked up to the people.  There is not a place to host a civic reception for all kind of dignitaries who come from far and near.</p> <p> We retained the town hall in Clonmel with great difficulty because Mr. MacGrath, the chief executive officer, CEO, of the council - they are not called county managers any more - wanted to close that as well.  He gave us a lucky-bag chain of office, while we have a noble chain, worth &euro;50,000, that is locked away in a vault.  It is an insult to the town of Clonmel.  That is what we have and a lucky-bag would be better.  We are in and out to - I was going to say "fishmongers" and I might as well - jewellery shops to get it fixed every time it is worn.  Those chains of office were a disgrace and those for all the counties were all the same.  They diminished and rubbished the people and the dignity of those offices.</p> <p> Almost three years ago to the month, I highlighted the necessity of a constitutional challenge to the Local Government Reform Act 2014 as well as the urgent need for a judicial review of the legality of the Act, which led to the eradication of more than 80 town and borough councils throughout the country.  It was high-handed in the extreme.  We can all talk, as Sinn F&eacute;in is talking there now as well.  On the last day of that Bill's passage here, I was the only Deputy standing - there were other parties representing - to challenge the then Minister, Mr. Phil Hogan, to tell him how fatal it was and that we would be meeting in another forum.  The following day, thanks to Former Local Authority Members &Eacute;ire, FLAME, and former Councillor Niall Dennehy, a former mayor of Clonmel, I served Mr. Hogan with a summons in the D&aacute;il canteen - probably the first ever.  Of course, Mr. Hogan was laughing because he knew where he was heading.  He did not care about the ordinary people.  We are only minions.  It was to hell with the people and "Croppies lie down", as Cromwell was back in a different guise.</p> <p> At the time, the statement provided by Government sources suggested that the merger of Cork County Council was also a solo run by the then Minister, Deputy Kelly.  Where is he today?  He is not even happy with his Labour Party colleagues.  He wants them all gone.  He would run the party himself.  I told the Labour Party at the time it would come back in a car but they came back in a seven-seater.  If they get Deputy Kelly in charge, God knows, I do not where they will end up.</p> <p> At the end of 2015, the then Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, properly described the abolition of 80 town councils as his single greatest policy regret in four years of Government.  I acknowledge that and fair dues to Deputy Howlin for that.  It was the worst thing that ever happened.  Those comments were then backed at the Labour Party conference by Deputy Kelly.  The Deputy was backing Deputy Howlin at that time - now he is snapping at his heels.  They wept tears for local government but did nothing to try and reverse that disastrous decision.  When they were in government, they could have seen the folly of their way sooner and tried to change it.</p> <p> In the intervening years, however, we have had no meaningful political debate about the implications of those admissions by the two then senior Ministers, Deputy Howlin agus An Teachta Kelly.  This has, in turn, exposed a chasm of political indifference at the heart of Government concerning the threat to democratic structures in the State.  It was absurd for this matter to continually go on without debate and for it to be relegated to the margins of political conversation.  I stood here on countless occasions in that four-year period on the Order of Business questioning when the Government would return them but they were all happy to forget about it.</p> <p> I fully supported the work of FLAME, which, at the time of the so-called Local Government Reform Act, challenged the constitutionality of the decision to axe the councils.  It was unconstitutional, as far as I am concerned.  FLAME advanced the view that the Act was repugnant to the Constitution, specifically, that it violates Article 28A of the Constitution, and the European Charter of Local Self-Government.</p> <p> At a committee earlier, I was talking to the EU representatives celebrating 45 years membership.  I note that our Commissioner is due to retire soon.  I told them to bring him to another country and not to send him back here, even to stand for any town council because he would not get elected to it.  As I stated, the 80 town and borough councils had 744 members.  These were decent people working for a pittance.  They were the servants of the people on the ground.  They were members of the joint policing committees, JPCs.  They were able to help An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na solve crime.  They were able to help with the Tidy Towns competitions.  They were able to help with planning matters and many other issues.  Most of them did not do it for money.  They were committed to better their own places.</p> <p> As I said, the Fianna F&aacute;il election manifesto, and indeed, the programme for Government, want to restore those with populations over 7,500.  Why is that not being acted on?  We are fooling around.</p> <p> The Labour Party has suffered seriously over this.  There were funds then as well.  I have asked questions about that.  There were funds in the relative organisations of the members such as the AMAI and others.  Where did that money go?  I am not saying anybody took it but it was amalgamated and sucked in somewhere.</p> <p> We talk about savings.  There were no savings.  We talked about &euro;5 million in Tipperary with the putting together and although the British could not rule Tipperary when it was such a long county, Big Phil, the enforcer, thought he could push us all in together and we would get &euro;5 million.  We got zilch savings and we got anti-democratic decisions.  The decisions are being stripped away as late as last week by reserved functions being taken off the members in Clonmel borough districts.</p></speech>

That is what is going on.  The local authority is now is too big.  They also must have two big constituencies, which are nearly half the size of a D&aacute;il constituency that it was at one time.  It is just not functioning and the Minister knows that.  The Government stripped the powers and it insulted them then, as I said, with lucky-bag chains of office.  It gave them token reports about developments for employment.  They have no powers.  Our all-famous powerful CEO is king and they have workshops for everything.  When I was a member of the council, we had a workshop once a year before the budget meeting.  Now there are workshops for everything behind closed doors and the press are locked out of the proceedings.  It is dictatorship.  The Government removed the democratic right of the people to have people represent them and it banished them all.  It acted as it did with so many other matters.  The Government refused to take down the HSE.  It took the power away from the people and locked them out as the CEO, Mr. MacGrath, is locking the people out of Clonmel cemetery to even visit their dead.  There are former mayors and former Teachta&iacute; D&aacute;la buried inside there.  People who are unwell to go in were allowed drive in but the powers of health and safety were invoked to take more reserved functions from the members.  It is dictatorship.  It was by the former Minister, Mr. Hogan, and is by our CEO, Mr. MacGrath.  The sooner something is done about it the better and give some vestige of power back to the members.</p></speech>

I had not the opportunity to hear what Deputy Kelly had to say as I had to leave the office but if he has admitted to making a mistake, indeed, it is a monumental and historic occasion for this Chamber.  It must give the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, great satisfaction to sit there and listen to us tearing strips off his former constituency colleague, the former Minister, Mr. Hogan, and all the Minister of State has to do is sit down and agree with us without opening his mouth.  It is a good day all round for the Minister of State.</p>  <p>  Deputy Cassells has been to the fore in promoting the return of town councils since he was elected to this D&aacute;il and I, along with all my colleagues in Fianna F&aacute;il, very much support his efforts.  I very much welcome that the Labour Party, Sinn F&eacute;in and the Independents, and I would hope the Minister of State, agree that a mistake has been made, it is time to rectify it and now is the time to do that.</p>  <p>  Local decisions are always best made locally.  Issues around housing, planning, street maintenance etc. are best dealt with at a local level.  One will get much better value for money by letting local democracy return to a local level.  For example, since the abolition of the town councils, Tralee and Killarney recently passed town plans and the level of engagement in both of those plans was significantly less than would have been the case, were the town councils doing the work.  Already, less than a month after they have been passed, significant errors are beginning to show and will now have to be rectified.  The reason is because of the lack of engagement from the public.  When one has a healthy local democracy with people providing an input and local councillors who know their own area dealing with the issues, one will get far better results.</p>  <p>  There are improvements that can be made to the town council structure.  There are lessons that can be learned.</p><p>I hope the Minister of State, having the full support of the House, will consider reinstating town councils, particularly in towns with larger populations, and reintroduce local democracy where better decisions can be made.  I will not repeat what my colleagues said, but local democracy is best dealt with locally.</p></speech>

I will upset the Minister of State, Deputy John Paul Phelan, when I say that his former colleague, Phil Hogan, made an outrageous error of judgment when Minister in what he did to local authorities and town councils.  It has been stated here time and again that many of the urban councils were the strong voice of the people.  I take the town of Ballinasloe in my constituency as an example.  There is no doubt that the town of Ballinasloe with a population of 7,000 has suffered significantly because of the loss of that town council.  That is why we will not look at this figure of starting to put back town councils where there is a population of 10,000.  That must come down to 6,000 or 6,500 to take in towns like Ballinasloe.</p></speech>

Those town councils were a strong voice.  Time and again today, we have heard how that voice was important in things such as Tidy Towns and promoting employment and what was good in those towns.  When one looks back at what happened, there was a little snobbery involved because the guys and girls in the town councils were seen as bits of idiots that one could not really have representing their town or area.  That was very wrong, but it existed.  I hope the damage done and the hurt caused to people will now be reversed as quickly as possible and town councils for a population of 5,000, as Deputy Howlin just told me, will be restored to their rightful position.  That will mean a lot to those towns and invigorate them, giving them a real voice at local level, one that should never have been taken away.</p></speech>

I say this in a magnanimous and sincere way because it is important when one realises that something is wrong that one says so.  I also recognise my colleague, Deputy Shane Cassells, who brought forward a similar Bill which passed Second Stage not long ago.  It is a very important measure.  We know that decisions are best made by those closest to them.  The principle of subsidiarity has been recognised for millennia, since the first city charters.  The famous Irish American politician Tip O'Neill spoke of all politics being local and they are.  That is why it is so important that we recognise the role.  There are anomalies, such as the poor maligned town of Ballybay - I am looking around the Chamber for any colleagues from Cavan-Monaghan and see Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in is present - was an example of where there were 900 residents and nine councillors, so it had a ratio of one to 100 whereas the towns of Celbridge and Maynooth in my constituency have 20,000 residents and not a single councillor because it did not have a town council.  It is important that if we re-establish them, and I hope that we do, it is done in such a way that it is uniform and balanced across the country.</p>  <p>  We have heard much criticism of the former Deputy Phil Hogan.  When the abolition took place, the cost savings amounted to &euro;15 million over the 72 town councils abolished.  It reminds me of the 132 Garda stations that were closed for a cost saving of &euro;2 million.  There was a general populism at the time, which we might put at the door of Fine Gael.  It was a kind of anti-quango talk, of which the current Taoiseach was to the fore, calling for the abolition of various agencies, when all he was doing was abolishing public services.  It was a populist, anti-expert kind of mood because the figures do not bear it out.</p>  <p>  There was an idea a few years ago that Ireland was over-represented and had too many politicians but if we look at local government, France has one councillor for every 118 people, Denmark has one councillor for every 115 people and Ireland has one councillor for every 4,800, so we are actually at the opposite end of the scale.  We are hugely under-represented in local government.  That type of populism was unhelpful to local democracy.</p>  <p>  I commend the Bill and hope it is enacted.</p></speech>

It will address the democratic deficit that arose with the abolition of town councils.  It is a political correction for democracy.  It represents a return to a form of democracy whose loss we now understand.  The pendulum has swung too far away from local democracy.  This Bill attempts to allow local towns and councils to make decisions for themselves.  The centralisation of local government into county councils drew politics too far from people, including in substantial towns.  In Clare, Shannon, Ennis and Kilrush lost their town councils and Kilkee lost its town commissioners.  This Bill would restore to County Clare town councils in Ennis and Shannon which would be welcome because we are suffering a sustained attack on rural Ireland and rural life.  The withdrawal of local democracy was another example of that.  We in rural Ireland are losing our services, including medical services and post offices, and we need to restore local democracy which would help to redress that balance.</p>  <p>  It also allows towns to make decisions specific to themselves, develop local amenities and cultural activities but also maintain services within the towns and the integrity of those communities.  Council councils have now divided into municipal districts which often means a huge area being covered by a small number of councillors.  Often many areas have no representation at all.  The restoration of this democracy, this correction of local democracy, is extremely important and I commend this Bill to the House.</p></speech>

The previous Government abolished the town council tier of local government.  The abolition of the tier which focused on urban centres was clearly a mistake and must be rectified by the restoration of our town councils.</p>  <p>  I strongly argue for the reintroduction of an urban focus.  There is disconnect between the municipal districts and urban towns.  People in the towns of west Cork no longer have ready access to the same number of councillors or what used to be the town hall, and we must restore that.  In my constituency, when the town councils were abolished, Clonakilty set up a mayoral council.  Volunteers such as Anthony McDermott, John Loughnan, Gretta O'Donovan, Colette Twomey and Cionnaith &Oacute; S&uacute;illeabh&aacute;in have given tirelessly and continuously to their community.  There is an annual mayoral contest and the mayor attends between 150 or 160 functions.  I commend them for giving their time to the people. </p>  <p>  Some of the decisions around rural Ireland of the previous Government and the current one beggar belief.  Take the community voluntary forum and how it struck them off.  The way the last Government was going, we were lucky it could not get its hands on local community councils or it would have struck them out too.  It wanted to make sure it did not give a voice to anyone but has anything changed?  The recent boundary changes in Cork, which include the transfer of Cork County Council areas with large populations from the county council into Cork corporation, will have a detrimental effect on the county.  The loss of revenue from areas such as Glanmire, Blarney and Ballincollig will result in a huge drain in revenue from the county in the long term.  Once again, it is dictation from the top.  I represent rural areas in west Cork, some of which are the most disadvantaged in the county, including the peninsulas and islands which cannot afford any loss of revenue.</p>  <p>  Has anything changed?  When we consider the new county council boundary changes, there was no consultation with the people of Courtmacsherry, Barryroe, Timoleague and Darrara.  They do not want to be pushed into the Bandon electoral area but the Government has pushed them into it.  It is dictation from the top again.   </p><p>Nothing has changed.  The Government got rid of town councils.  It is seeking to erode anything to do with community as much as it can.  All of this is being led by a political party that has another agenda.  While I agree with the restoration of town councils, I do not trust this Government to do it.  In my view, it will be doctored in some way to suit its own needs.  The Government needs to start taking the people of rural Ireland seriously.  It should give the people of rural Ireland back their voice.  The reintroduction of town councils would be a step in that direction.</p></speech>

I did not care whether they represented Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael, the Labour Party or Sinn F&eacute;in, or were Independents.  They were doing great work in their localities.  The Fine-Gael-Labour Party Government of that time was so arrogant that it thought it could impose whatever it wanted.  It had such a majority that it was able to do so.  It tore the heart out of local democracy because it was so big-headed and swollen-headed.  I remember having a debate in this Chamber with the then Minister, Phil Hogan.  I hate talking about somebody who is not here.  I mentioned to him that certain Fine Gael councillors with whom I was personally friendly were upset about what their party was doing.  I liked and admired the people in question because I was brought up as a child knowing about the work they were doing in their communities.  When I was finished speaking, the then Minister stood up and said, "I am quaking in my boots".  It is on the record of the D&aacute;il.  That is what Phil Hogan thought of his colleagues at the time.  Just because he was a big fancy Minister above here, he forgot completely about the local councillors.</p></speech>

He and his ministerial colleagues did not listen to us at the time.  We did not just ask them to retain the councils; we begged them to do so.  It was not about saving money.  The Government of the time was being stupid and arrogant.  Deputy Howlin has now realised that a big mistake was made.  Other people like Deputy Alan Kelly are not here.

I welcome this Bill and hope it will be passed.  I am calling on the Minister to withdraw his amendment to allow this Bill to be scrutinised on Committee and Report Stages.  Local decisions should be made at local level, as near as possible to the people affected by them.  Local government was working well.  There was no need to fix it because it was not broken.  I have seen at first hand the workings of town and borough councils.  I was a member of Clonmel Corporation and Clonmel Borough Council between 1985 and 2004.  I served as mayor of Clonmel from 1994 to 1995.  Clonmel is a significant and substantial town.  It used to be the biggest inland town in the country.  Councillors across all political parties, including independent councillors, worked very well on the corporation and the borough council in Clonmel.</p>  <p>  County Tipperary was very badly hit by the abolition of the councils, which has been a disaster and obviously has failed.  I welcome the introduction of this Bill.  It is a pity that it has to be introduced, but so be it.  County Tipperary lost Clonmel Borough Council and the town councils in Carrick-on-Suir, Cashel, Tipperary, Thurles, Templemore and Nenagh.  It is important to get a flavour of these towns, which have been stripped of local representatives and local government.  Carrick-on-Suir is known for the only existing manor house of its kind in the country.  It was visited by Anne Boleyn, who was the wife of Henry VIII at one stage.  Carrick-on-Suir was the home of the first president of the GAA, Maurice Davin.  It is the home of Se&aacute;n Kelly and Sam Bennett.  It was the home town of the Clancy brothers.</p>  <p>  Clonmel, which is the capital of south Tipperary, defeated Cromwell in May 1650 with the help of our northern neighbours, Hugh Dubh O'Neill and his people.  The mayor of the day - Mayor White - negotiated a deal with Cromwell that saved the town and its people, and the soldiers who were supporting the town.  Clonmel courthouse was the scene of many high-profile sessions, including the trial of the Young Irelanders in 1848.  Of course, the Labour Party was established in Clonmel town hall in 1912.  Clonmel has been the seat of administration in the south of the county for many years.  Musicians like Frank Patterson, Mick Delahunty and M&iacute;che&aacute;l &Oacute; S&uacute;illeabh&aacute;in came from Clonmel, which is a Quaker town.  Charles Bianconi, who was mayor of Clonmel on two occasions, set up his first transport system in the town.</p>  <p>  Cashel is famous for the Rock of Cashel, which was once the seat of the kings of Munster.  Tipperary town is known in Irish as Tiobraid &Aacute;rann, or the well of Ara, and may be described as the nucleus of the War of Independence.  Se&aacute;n Treacy, Dan Breen, S&eacute;amus Robinson and S&eacute;an Hogan started the fight for Irish freedom in nearby Soloheadbeg in January 1919.  Nenagh, which is the capital of north Tipperary, is a Norman settlement.  Nenagh Castle was built in the 13th century.  A great-grandfather of mine - Michael Healy, who was a Fenian - was incarcerated in the county jail in Nenagh for some time in 1867.  Semple Stadium is in Thurles, which is the birthplace of the GAA.</p>  <p>  Roscrea, which is a heritage town, has 600 years of the finest Irish architecture at St. Cronan's cathedral and a Norman castle that dates back to 1280.  Cahir is the location of Cahir Castle.  I could also mention Templemore.  This kind of history gives towns their identity and makes them communities.  These towns should not have been stripped of their local government.  There is no doubt in my mind that we should restore the town and borough councils as quickly as possible.  It appears that the Minister and his Government colleagues, who abolished these councils some years ago with the help of the Labour Party, intend to put this off again.  I hope they do not do that.  I ask them to withdraw their amendment and to allow this Bill to go forward for scrutiny on Committee and Report Stages.</p></speech>

As one of the longest-serving Members in the Chamber, I am somewhat surprised by the peevishness and small-mindedness of Deputies from various parties who have used their contributions to this debate to try to undermine Deputy Howlin.  In my 26 years as a Deputy, I have not previously seen a former Minister come into the House, put his hands up and acknowledge that something wrong was done.  It is very important that he has done so.

He is using the ould Meath trick.  We know well in Westmeath what he is like.  Deputy Munster is feeling the heat from Senator Nash.  There is a campaign being led by the local newspaper to ensure Drogheda will have corporation status restored.  Ultimately, we should all learn lessons and not be afraid to come in here to apologise.  I have great respect for Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in.  Former Senator M&aacute;ir&iacute;a Cahill is looking for acknowledgment on various issues.  Perhaps if they adopted the same position as Deputy Howlin, regarding where we have made a mess in abolishing town councils, it might be useful.  Let us be clear that we did make a mess and regret it.  One could not say, however, that town councils in which one could get elected by 50 people were worthy of retaining.  There should have been reform rather than abolition.  Let us be clear and call a spade a spade.  I know of some of the town councils in question.  Let us all grow up here.  Let us not always fly off the handle over nothing.  Let us deal with this in a critical, cool-headed way.  We made a mistake and are in here apologising for it.  I am delighted with the support coming from all quarters.  We feel this Bill could probably be improved and put together with the Fianna F&aacute;il Bill, brought forward and put into the committee.  It was the colleague of Minister of State Deputy Phelan who led the charge.  I was not there at the time.  I was not even a member of the Labour Party.  I did not have the Whip when this happened but I still assume responsibility, unlike some, because I was a Member of the House.  I suppose I could have spoken out with greater clarity against the proposal.</p>  <p>  We are now proposing that every town with a population of more than 5,000 and at least 1,000 dwellings, and with a clearly defined urban centre, should have its town council restored.  In other words, there is critical mass.  There should be nine councillors elected from one electoral area, but if the town is larger, as in where Deputy Lawless represents, there should be 15.  This could be changed or reconsidered, of course.  Deputy Cassells's idea may well be better.  Let us bring the two ideas together.  Let us not be afraid of this.  Other Deputies, including Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, have other points of view.  The central point is that the town would elect its own councillors to serve the needs of the town.  People do feel remote from their public representatives at present.  The proposal would remedy this.  Councils would have the ability to set their own rates.  They could be lower or higher than those set by the county council.</p>  <p>  The restoration of the town councils for Mullingar, Athlone and Longford would enable them to be in control of their own development plans, budgets, planning applications and finances.  In Mullingar, the town council could promote the local industrial park at Marlinstown, which has 27 ha, so it could be sure to get an industry there.  It is centrally located, well appointed, has planning permission and three-phase electricity, yet IDA Ireland has failed to secure an industry for the area.  We could do more.  Athlone and Mullingar both have well over 20,000 people, heading towards 25,000.  Longford has 10,000.  All of those areas would qualify.  That is important.</p>  <p>  The decision to abolish councils in wholesale fashion was stupid, driven by a false narrative that abolition would lead to significant savings.  What happened as a result was that the reduction in the number of local public representatives, who are the fulcrum of representative democracy, just heaped work and pressure on a smaller number of public representatives, many of whom were not local to the area to be represented and who had to carry an extra load with no pay.  The pay is absolutely useless.  Let us call a spade a spade: the big problem we will face in the coming years is trying to get people to actually run for those offices.  We bow to the lowest common denominator.  Someone in the media makes a point about public representatives and we immediately rush in.  We in this House are kings and queens of it.  We condemn every public representative and lacerate ourselves in here.  I have seen it.  The deterioration over 26 years is frightening.  When I came in here first, we respected one another.  We had our political arguments, no more than the way in which I might now disagree with Deputies Cassells or &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, but ultimately there was respect.  If we do not have respect for one another, we should not expect anyone outside to have respect for us.  One might think one is gaining the upper hand by some snide or glib remark but one is only playing to the gallery and denigrating one's fellow representatives.  We should argue the political toss vehemently and strongly but we are all colleagues, and I am sure we are in politics for the best motives &ndash; 99.9% of the people I have served with were always motivated by public service and I was proud to be one of their own.  After the next election, I clearly will not be but I will be proud to leave and say I was part of that House and that it was a great honour.  We should not run around denigrating one another because it is only fuel for somebody else to continue the denigration.</p>  <p>  In the last week I have heard stories from across Ireland on the impact of the loss of the town council and why it should be reintroduced.  Mr. Liam van der Spek, our representative in Cavan, is urgently seeking the restoration of his town council.  He told me that Cavan town, with its population of more than 10,000, has been noticeably underdeveloped since losing its town council.  The main streets and housing estates are suffering.  The town has been dropped from the top spots in the league of Irish Business Against Litter.  Owing to the lack of representation, Mr. van der Spek doubts the town could now host the Fleadh Cheoil like it did in 2010.  I was very proud to be at Cavan's three fle&aacute;nna, bearing in mind that I am a great Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann man, as most people know.  It would be difficult to attract such events now because all towns want them.  We are spending &euro;3 million in Mullingar and hope to get the Fleadh Cheoil in 2020 and 2021 because it was founded in Mullingar.  We want it in Mullingar for the 70th anniversary.  Let that go out to everyone, including Deputy Howlin, who is seeking to have it in Wexford.</p></speech>

Towns have lost out greatly because of the 2014 legislation.</p>  <p>  Mr. Seamus Ryan from Ennis, County Clare, told me communities took pride in having their local councils for their towns, and that the councils were a vital avenue for advocacy for people in small communities across the entirety of the country and they gave people a local focal point.  People are being badly represented because of the changes introduced in the municipal districts, where it can literally take hours to cross from one end to the other.  Ennis, a town of 26,000, effectively has three councillors as the other five are all rural.  Shannon, which has a population of 13,000, has one councillor from the town.  This shows the imbalance that can arise.  I mean no disrespect to the rural councillors.  They are fighting tooth and nail.  Every councillor is travelling miles and getting damn-all for it.  I was a rural councillor myself, in an area 12 or 14 miles from Mullingar.  I was representing rural areas but the councillors elected in Mullingar knew intimately every pothole, ditch, hedgerow, light, pavement and manhole cover.  I could not know those.  This is where it all fell down.  We need to give back a voice to the councillors and not be afraid to do so.</p>  <p>  Mr. Aaron Byrne from Kells, County Meath, is a neighbour of Deputy Cassells.  Mr. Byrne told me the removal of the town councils has created a deficit of representation for people in smaller towns and villages around the country.  In his area there are three towns - Kells, Athboy and Oldcastle, which neighbours my county - that have all lost town councils and are now represented at county level by the shared seven councillors.  This means seven voices among 40 on Meath County Council fighting for resources for three towns in a large municipal district.  Kells is listed in the county development plan as having only a support function to Navan, which is in a different municipal district.  As a result, there are seven councillors trying to vie for funding across a huge area of the county against seven councillors specifically elected to serve Navan town, backed up by a county development plan.  That is the type of imbalance that happens because of the structure.  While I might represent Mullingar and Deputy Cassells represents Navan, we represent everyone but it is important that the large towns have representatives.  Kells needs representatives who can prioritise the needs of Kells and focus on developing the town and hinterlands in their own right and not as supporting entities of larger towns in the county. </p>  <p>  Mr. Johnny Walsh from Ballinasloe, County Galway, listed eight reasons a town council is needed in the town.  First, the town could set its own commercial rates, which were 30% lower than the county rate.  The increase is hitting the town hard.  Second, it would restore personal contact with local council officials instead of people having to travel 40 miles to the closest office.  Third, it would reconnect the general public in our towns with the political process, which is important.  Fourth, it would restore our budgetary, planning and housing functions to our town, giving people local control. Fifth, it would restore the discretionary community fund in respect of which the town council had the relevant local knowledge for allocating money to projects that needed it. Sixth, it would ensure proper services for people in the town for council housing maintenance and the upkeep of council green areas.  Seventh, the previous town council had an affordable council rent scheme but the county council scheme is a more expensive scheme for tenants, even if there is no increase in their income.  Eighth, it would restore a sense of civic pride in that the town would have its own local mayor to officiate at important local events.</p>  <p>  As the Minister of State can see across the State, people who care about their towns want the opportunity to make their urban areas better.  Their specific concerns are getting lost.  Diversity is essential.  It allows towns to experiment with new ways of doing things, to try out new projects and specialise based on the attributes they have.  It gives towns a voice &ndash; a voice they now lack.  I support the returning of those voices to the local councils. </p></speech>

It was very interesting, and I am something of an anorak about matters relating to local government.  I cannot support the legislation drafted by Deputy Howlin.</p>  <p>  Nineteen Deputies spoke in the debate and they gave some good reasons as to why they feel the changes were not suitable and have not worked in some areas.  My fundamental principle is that when people vote in local elections, they should have one vote, as in national elections.  The previous Victorian system, introduced by the Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898 and referred to by Deputy Butler, created a situation where certain individuals who lived in certain urban centres had two ballot papers at a local election.  There is much work to be done in this area and perhaps there is not much between my view and those of other Members as to how we develop an integrated system of local government.  We can all agree that the county as a unit, outside of the larger cities, is the primary identifiable geographical division by which local government should be implemented.  Is there a method of ensuring that our towns can be more strongly or better represented within the county structure?  Our current system has 30 local authorities, which is enough.</p>  <p>  I note the contributions regarding representation from Deputy Lawless and others.  Deputy Cassells spoke about a councillor for every 118 people in France.  It would be interesting to have that in this country, although that proportion is perhaps too low.  Our system is undoubtedly on the higher end but we are also over-represented at national level.  Perhaps we should cut the number in the D&aacute;il in half and double the size of local authorities to bring us more into line with international norms, or we could have our own proper integrated system of local government</p></speech>

I listened to examples given by Deputies from around the country.  Deputy Mattie McGrath spoke comically, as usual, about chains of office in Clonmel and council offices in Cashel.  What offices are open and not open are matters for Tipperary County Council.  The idea is that because the British could not rule Tipperary - I do not know if they could rule Deputy Mattie McGrath - the county was divided in two and should be kept frozen in aspic in perpetuity.  Deputy Penrose made the best contribution when he spoke about people not denigrating each other.  I do not dismiss any of the arguments made by others but I cannot understand how people who are supposed to be democrats in this House think that some people should have two votes in a local election and others should have one.  Nobody referred to it.</p>  <p>  Can we integrate our towns properly-----</p></speech>

However, I am changing that.  There is a committee, which will have legislation shortly on how Members of the Seanad should be elected in the future.</p>  <p>  I wish to deal with other specific issues.  Members spoke about this Bill being cost neutral.  It is not cost neutral.  Deputy Howlin spoke about 100 towns with a population of 5,000 or more.  Interestingly, Deputies Butler and Aindrias Moynihan said they were supporting the Bill because it would bring back Lismore Town Council and Macroom Town Council.  Those two towns are far below the population threshold of 5,000 so perhaps they should have read the Bill before they contributed.</p>  <p>  I believe the reason Deputy Cassells's legislation, which was passed by the House, has not been discussed since then is that there was a report due before the Cabinet on local government and local leadership.  That was approved by the Cabinet.  I find it frustrating, as the spare leg in the Customs House who is not directly involved in housing, that most of the issues discussed by the housing committee relate to housing, which is natural given that it is the biggest national issue at present.  It is difficult to get time to discuss local government matters.  I would prefer if there was a separate local government committee, and most Members here have served on local authorities, or if there was a subgroup of the joint committee to examine local government. We could have a proper and full discussion there, without shouting at each other, as to how we wish town councils, county councils and local authorities to progress in the future.</p>  <p>  Deputy Browne said there were no savings.  There have been savings.  Some &euro;21 million was saved following the mergers of Tipperary, Waterford and Limerick local authorities and between &euro;18 million and &euro;20 million was saved through the abolition of town councils.  It is not necessarily a huge amount but it is untrue to say no savings were made.  I was struck by Deputy Cassells's comment that there was an anti-town attitude in county councils across the country.  Perhaps that is the case in Meath but I never encountered it.  Perhaps Kilkenny was unique.  There was one urban centre and everything else around the county was much smaller but there was never a sense of anti-urbanism.</p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il's deputy leader, a man for whom I have great respect, made a strange contribution in which he spoke about his ancestors being town engineers.  He let the mask slip a little when he said Fine Gael never did well on town councils and was always opposed to them, the corollary being that Fianna F&aacute;il always did well on them.  I do not believe that this is behind Deputy Howlin's contribution or behind most of the contributions to the debate but there is an element of patronage involved in town councils.  It offers a role for local party activists, who can be paid by the rate payer or the property tax payer, to become involved in the political activities of an organisation or as an independent in seeking election.  I got a strong whiff of that from Deputy Calleary's contribution, which is unusual for him.</p>  <p>  There was nothing much from Deputy O'Loughlin.  Deputy Murphy O'Mahony spoke about town councils being the bottom rung of the ladder and said that people could stand for further elections after being on town councils.  They did serve that function to an extent but that is not necessarily a good enough reason for them to exist in the future.</p>  <p>  With regard to Drogheda, it is in the same boat as my own part of the world in Kilkenny where the borough council was abolished.  The new Drogheda borough district was drawn up and most Members who contributed to the debate have acknowledged that the recent review of local electoral areas has made an attempt to make them more manageable geographically.  It has also made an attempt to make them more manageable in terms of the focus on towns.  Deputy Howlin has spoken to me several times about Wexford town.  The new Wexford borough district corresponds to Wexford town and its immediate hinterland.  My local town-----</p></speech>

The committee members erred in terms of their terms of reference.  Any town of more than 30,000 or any ex-borough will have its own municipal district.</p>  <p>  My local town is New Ross in County Wexford.  In the case of the town council in New Ross, some of the people who live in Rosbercon, which is my home area, had a vote in New Ross but the rest of them were in County Kilkenny.  There will always be the boundary issues, with which I am familiar.  New Ross is a beautiful place and I have great memories of going to school there, but it was run by five Fianna F&aacute;il people out of nine for most of my life.  It was like a cumann.

This being Private Members' business, the Bill has had one of the largest number of Members contributing that I can remember in recent times.  Everybody in the House has an affinity to the democratic system.  We all strive in our own ways to try to make it better.  There have been various attempts to do so, including by me during my tenure more than two decades ago in the Custom House when I produced the Better Local Government plan.  The idea then was not only to strengthen local government but to link it to community activity for the first time.  There was great resistance to the notion that unelected community groups should be involved in strategic policy committees and in shaping policy, although the majority of every committee would be, of course, the elected members.</p>  <p>  The former Minister, Phil Hogan, also produced plans, in respect of which I do not attribute any malice to him.  There have been various contributions to this debate, most of which were very constructive and measured.  There are some Members from whom one never expects anything more than vitriol and they never disappoint.  I am taken aback by the ungraciousness and lack of generosity in the comments of Deputy Cassells.  It is important for politicians to recognise that mistakes were made and to come into this House and say that and to change their minds.  As I said in my opening contribution, up to last night I had spent three days in Liverpool trying to persuade the British people to think again about what I believe is a grievous mistake in Brexit.  We must have the ability to say that we should think again on the basis of how things work out.  Whatever the merits people argued for a more integrated type of local government, it has not worked.  </p>  <p>  I would like to make a couple of points on the contributions of the Ministers of State, Deputies English and Phelan.  The Minister of State, Deputy English, said that the municipal system is working.  It is not, although I acknowledge that the revised boundaries will improve matters.  We all know our own areas best.  The new municipal district of Wexford, which is essentially Wexford town and its immediate environs, will be immeasurably better than the old one which encompassed one-quarter of the county because as people from Kilmore Quay to Rosslare Harbour had no affinity to the town and mayors elected from those areas had no urban tradition, it did sunder the district.  There needs to be an urban driver.  While I acknowledge that an attempt has been made in the new boundaries to bring about improvements, I believe we need to have a stand-alone urban council and not one that is merely a sub-committee of the greater county council, which is what it is now.</p>  <p>  I am anxious to have this Bill enacted and I am determined to ensure it proceeds.  I acknowledge the campaigning work of Deputy Cassells on the issue but his Bill did not seek to create the new councils.  If this Bill is passed new councils will be created.  Deputy Cassells's Bill sought to create a process that would consider the creation of the councils, which was welcome and we supported it.  There will be a lot of work to be done on this Bill in Committee if it passes Second Stage.  I would like to see this legislation in place in time for the next local elections.  This is not an impossible task.  The Minister of State, Deputy English, also said that Government proposes to commission another report on the issue, but that will probably be subject to a further report.  This is not the way to deal with this critical issue.  We want a debate.  If the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, wants a debate then let us set aside a Friday or a Monday for a full debate on local government issues.  I would be delighted to map out my own time to contribute to such debate and I am sure all Deputies who spoke this evening would do likewise. </p>  <p>  On the contribution of the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, I think the Minister will regret talking about the patronage issue.  I believe that was unfortunate.</p></speech>

They work really hard and they have ideas.  I served for many years on Wexford Borough Council.  I also served on Wexford County Council.  I can say with clear conscience that far more constructive work was done at Wexford Borough Council than at Wexford County Council.  Perhaps because of the scale of Wexford County Council, not everybody was interested in every issue but on the borough council everybody was interested in every issue and it was of great moment.  An awful lot of time was wasted all well.  I recall that one rates process took ten meetings even though we were dealing with relatively small sums of money.  People were passionate about their roles and the issues and the wider public knew it.  The public was aware that their councillors often met until 10 p.m. or 11 p.m. arguing for their issues, such as whether &pound;20,000 should be allocated for a local playground.  It was about small money but really important decisions for people.  I regret that we no longer have such a system and I would like to put that right.</p>  <p>  I have taken note of what everybody said.  What I found most damning about Deputy Munster's contribution is that she clearly had not read the Bill.  One expects that people would know what they are talking about, even if fairly general terms, before they make a critique.  Deputy Munster was obviously motivated by whatever is going on in her own constituency.  Perhaps because Senator Ged Nash is championing this and has traction on it, because he is right on it, the Deputy feels she has to put her oar in.  If her general thesis is that it is fundamentally wrong to change one's mind, Sinn F&eacute;in is in a sorry state.  I welcome people changing their minds.  I welcome people admitting they did not get something right, that they made a mistake or that they could have done something better.  If we could all do that, our democracy would be an awful lot better and an awful lot healthier.</p></speech>

The local government elections will take place next year.  In light of the fact that there is consensus in this House on the restoration of town councils in some shape or form, not necessarily in the formulation of the Labour Party as presented tonight, will the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, commit to trying to have this Bill enacted in time for next year's elections, even if doing so requires the establishment of a special committee of the Houses if the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government is too busy?  I will serve on that committee.  I ask people to assist in making this transformation, which I believe will be an important restoration of our local government system and a real important step in reconnecting people who are increasingly disenfranchised and disconnected from the things that matter most to them.</p><p>When talking to people at the doors they speak about the small things such as anti-social behaviour, the state of the footpaths, the lights, the signage, the grass verges and all the issues that are the bread and butter of local government which people want to be able to contact their local representatives about.  I ask the Minister of State to withdraw his amendment and allow this Bill to pass.  I think that it will pass in any event and I thank all of the Deputies who supported it.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-09-26a.497" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1302" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="17:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018092600043#VV01200"><p>I move amendment No. 1:</p><blockquote>In page 7, between lines 7 and 8, to insert the following:&ldquo; &ldquo;Audiovisual Media Services Directive&rdquo; means Directive 2010/13/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 March 2010 on the coordination of certain provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in Member States concerning the provision of audiovisual media services; &ldquo;audiovisual media service&rdquo; has the same meaning as it has in Article 1 of the Audiovisual Media Services Directive;&rdquo;.</blockquote><p>Subsection (1) is a prohibition on the advertising of alcohol online unless all reasonable steps are taken to ensure that children cannot view the advertising.  All reasonable steps is a formula widely found in the Statute Book.  It is the same test used by the Department of Health on the offence of selling tobacco products to children under 16.  The reference to information society services reflects the EU terminology used to define services such as websites, email, search engines, Twitter and YouTube, etc., and it is the terminology used by the Department of Health in its ban on e-cigarettes.</p><p>Section 6, subsection (2), then sets out factors to be taken into account in determining whether reasonable steps have been taken to ensure that advertising cannot be viewed by children.  The reference to the court or jury reflects the fact that the offence could be tried on indictment before a jury.  The subsection is not proscriptive as to what constitutes &quot;all reasonable steps&quot; but I expect that it would effectively require the following: age gates which would at least consist of a user-entered date of birth or similar; the use of any demographic targeting tools provided by advertising networks to limit viewing to users over 18; and registration of websites with internet filtering software providers and a restriction on retweets, send by email and similar tools where these would have the effect of exposing an advertisement to a new audience which could potentially include children.</p><p>The reference to &quot;state of technological development&quot; is borrowed from the Data Protection Acts 1998 and 2003 and it is intended to have the effect that the duty to prevent viewing by children will become more stringent as time progresses and access controls become more effective.</p><p>Subsection (3) provides that the offence only apply to audiovisual media services originating in Ireland.  This is done to reflect the country of origin principle in the Audiovisual Media Services Directive, AVMSD, which prevents Ireland from imposing these rules on services originating in other European Economic Area, EEA, jurisdictions.  I had expected that the Department of Health would table its own amendment in similar terms but alas this did not happen.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-09-26a.498" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1436" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="17:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018092600043#VV01300"><p>I support the spirit of what Deputy O'Reilly is trying to do.  I have discussed it with the Minister in some detail and it has been explained to me that for a bunch of what sound like reasonable and material legal reasons it cannot be done in this way.  However, the point raised is incredibly important because one of the things that this Bill does is to try to prevent advertising of alcohol in areas such as sport, particularly with children.  As we know, advertising is moving online and my understanding is that more than 50% of advertising revenue spent in Ireland today is spent online and, therefore, we are going to great efforts to make a difference in terms of billboard advertising near schools and so forth but to miss online advertising is a real problem.  I understand that it could not be brought through this Bill because it requires changes to European legislation and so forth.  While we will not support the amendment as it is, I wholeheartedly agree with the point that Deputy O'Reilly raised, namely, that whatever prohibitions and protections we are bringing in, particularly for young people and children, we must figure out how to bring that into the online space as well as a matter of urgency.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-09-26a.499" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="17:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018092600043#VV01400"><p>Opposition amendments Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive and amendments Nos. 6 and 24, as Deputy O'Reilly outlined, create a framework for age restrictions on alcohol advertising on the Internet.  Like Deputy Donnelly, I fully support the intention of these amendments, as I discussed with Deputy O'Reilly and in the Seanad and as my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, would have said on Committee Stage because one of the primary objectives of this Bill is to delay the initiation of alcohol consumption by children and young people.  I wish to be clear that there is no disagreement between myself and Deputy O'Reilly on the intent of what she is trying to achieve.</p>  <p>  These amendments propose the creation of an offence if a person advertises or causes to be advertised, an alcohol product on an information society service unless all reasonable steps are taken to ensure that the advertising cannot be viewed by children.  An example of what constitutes a reasonable step is whether age verification controls have been used to prevent access by children to an advertisement.  My concern with this approach, which will not be news to the Deputy, is that these amendments use the framework of the Audiovisual Media Services Directive, which is within the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Naughten.  My officials have previously consulted with that Department and the Department of Justice and Equality on this matter because the issue is an important one.  I am informed that the Audiovisual Media Services Directive is a sector-specific directive for television and services that are similar to television and I am informed that the intention of its scope, as would happen with these amendments, to include any audiovisual content on any Internet platform, would cut across several EU directives and other legislation.</p>  <p>  In addition to these legal concerns, there is a difficulty with the enforcement of the proposal.  For example, if it was introduced for websites hosted in Ireland, advertisers could simply move to websites which are not hosted in Ireland in order to avoid the necessity to comply with these proposed restrictions.</p>  <p>  On a practical note, I am unclear as to how effective age verification controls are in terms of their implementation.  If it is a matter of clicking a button to confirm that the viewer is aged 18 or over, children may simply be able to click that button and access the alcohol advertising.</p>  <p>  I fully support the intention of the amendments and I am very willing to work with colleagues across this House and with colleagues in Government to see how Ireland can endeavour to address this and to play a role in addressing it in Europe but according to the advice available to me, it is likely that European legislation will be necessary to address issues of online platforms due to the cross border nature of the services involved.  That is not to say we should not do it, but this vehicle is not the best place for doing so.  This issue needs to be addressed at EU level and for that reason, I do not propose to accept these amendments.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-09-26a.518" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1302" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="17:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018092600046#YY00200"><p>I move amendment No. 4:</p>  <p>     In page 8, line 19, to delete &ldquo;and&rdquo;.</p>  <p>The purpose of amendments Nos. 4 and 5 is to deal with the availability of free alcohol when purchasing another service.  I refer, for example, to a person who gets his or her nails done or goes to the barber or the cinema.  The businesses supplying this alcohol are very often not licensed premises.  They are not governed by the same rules and regulations.  It is shocking that Healthy Ireland has published a survey that found only 16% of women were aware of the link between breast cancer and alcohol consumption.  The national cancer control programme found that 12% of all breast cancers over a decade in Ireland were associated with alcohol consumption.  For these reasons, alcohol given free with a service should be prohibited under this Bill.  A person is often not asked in the hair salon, or wherever it happens to be, if he or she wants a drink.  The person is asked if he or she wants a cup of tea or coffee or a glass of water but is then handed a glass of prosecco.  I have experienced this.  The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that practice ceases.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-09-26a.519" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1319" speakername="Michael Healy-Rae" time="17:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018092600046#YY00300"><p>I take grave exception to this amendment.  I will give an example of what might happen if we take this to its ultimate conclusion.  Hairdressers were mentioned and many people attend them.  Let us take the opening day of a new hairdresser premises.  If people are invited to the launch, and taking this proposal to its ultimate conclusion, it could be wrong to offer a drink to would-be customers of that new business because under this proposal the alcohol would be free and given on the premises.  This is a case of people gone mad with political correctness.  For God's sake, if a person is attending the launch of a new business where somebody wants to treat him or her to a bottle of beer or a glass of wine, what in the name of goodness is wrong with that?  This is the total demonisation of alcohol.  We all want responsible intake of alcohol but what do people actually want to do?  Do they want every public house in the country to close down?  Do we want to shut our small breweries that give much needed employment in each of our counties?</p>  <p>  I am proud that in the county I represent we have small business people who have started up breweries.  I think of Killarney and Dingle.  The highest quality gin and craft beer is being made.  It is a product that is safe and nice for people to taste, be they visitors or locals.  Do we want to close down these businesses?  Do we want to do away with the alcohol industry?  Enough bars and public houses have closed.  I have repeatedly said that the best people to administer the sale of alcohol are the responsible publicans, whether they are people who own public houses or any other licensed premises.  What is being proposed here in respect of giving away free beer, free wine or otherwise concerns something that only happens on certain occasions.  If this is taken to its ultimate conclusion, it will lead to the most serious and stupid situation.</p>  <p>  If somebody wants to treat a person to a drink in a premises on a street, that could be deemed to be wrong and illegal.  That is crazy.</p><p>We are losing the run of ourselves.  I am merely talking common sense.  Every person in this House wants sensible and safe use of alcohol.  Are we saying we want to demonise the industry and to shut it down, which will cost thousands and thousands of jobs?  The hoteliers, publicans and restaurateurs are people I know who are working in their communities, creating much-needed employment.  Those people are looking on in horror at what is going on with this Bill.  They are asking whether politicians have lost the run of themselves completely, and are wondering if we have forgotten from where we come.  We want people to be safe and do not want them to abuse alcohol, but are we saying we do not want them to touch a drop of alcohol again, whether it is for free or whether they have to buy it?  This proposal is crazy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-09-26a.521" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1341" speakername="Michael Fitzmaurice" time="17:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018092600047#ZZ00200"><p>I concur with the previous speaker.  When a business opens it does not ram its offerings down one's throat.  They offer tea, minerals or a drink.  The opening of businesses is a one-time-only occasion.  Licensed premises were referred to.  Those premises are not taking money for the alcohol, but rather are giving drinks for free on opening days.  In most parts of the country - it might be different where some Members live - one will be driving a car home so one will not be drinking.  As has been said previously, there is a link between excessive drink and bad health.  That is also the case for excessive sweets or processed foods, or excess of anything else.  Excess does nobody any favours.  We have almost gone beyond political correctness at this stage, considering some of the proposals put forward.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-09-26a.522" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1347" speakername="Mattie McGrath" time="17:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018092600047#ZZ00300"><p>I am also concerned about this.  Political correctness has gone mad.  I looked at this matter carefully and did not submit any amendments, unlike my colleagues.  I considered it, and the longer the debate went on, and the more the different political groupings ebbed and flowed, changing their minds before the heavy hands of the health spokespersons, the more I wondered about the democracy of it all.  This is certainly ridiculous.  The apple festival was launched to celebrate the proud history of Bulmers cider in Clonmel, County Tipperary, last Saturday evening.  That event will have to be labelled in the future if we dare mentioned cider.  We have gone over the top.  While there is a huge issue with alcohol abuse and misuse, we are going after the wrong people all the time.</p>  <p>  There are off-sales everywhere now; in shops, forecourts of garages and massive off-licences.  I have respect for the National Off-Licence Association, which runs its affairs properly.  However, I have regularly seen the system being abused when youngsters are working behind the counter.  We had to discontinue a festival in a town in Tipperary due to the way young people were able to get alcohol from big shops with other young people behind the counter who were peer pressured, leading to reckless trading.  As Deputy Michael Healy-Rae said, the safest place to consume alcohol, tea, coffee, MiWadi, orange drinks or lemonade is in a respectable public house, where there are measures in place and where there are licences up behind the counters so that members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can come in and check it.  Publicans have to keep their house in order, and 99% of them do that.  However, we are literally closing those places down by virtue of this kind of ridiculous legislation. </p>  <p>  Are we going to put labelling onto meat products, sweets or boxes of Milk Tray?  If we leave out a bottle for Santa Claus will we have to put a warning on it to tell him that he cannot drink it because it might make him sick before he gets back to Lapland?  This is crazy stuff.  The legislation we are passing here is so regressive, so anti-work and anti-business it is frightening.</p>  <p>  Deputy Kelly had a Bill earlier in the year which sought to allow small craft brewers - of which there are many in Tipperary -  to let people taste their products and purchase some of it while visiting the breweries.  I supported that Bill.  However, the same day, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, passed a Bill that would mean people would be punished if they even had a whiff of alcohol, if they even opened a bottle.  This is farcical.  We need joined-up thinking.  Our industries and pubs have served us well throughout the centuries, and have to be supported rather than destroyed.  We have gone over the top with regulation.  We are going to become a nanny state, telling citizens that we cannot do this or that.  There is an illicit and illegal trade already in place in this country, and if there is a hard border after Brexit, goodness knows what will happen.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle knows that better than anyone here.  </p>  <p>  We must have common sense at all times.  I heard my former colleague and good friend, Professor John Crown, on the radio yesterday.  He made the valid point that it is excessive drinking that causes damage to one's health, and we are not doing enough in schools and through the education system to educate people about that.  If anyone here seriously thinks that putting labels on the neck of a bottle will change-----</p></speech>

I go to many functions where free drink is available.  I attend many openings and many football matches.  There is a thing called choice.  I have been a pioneer for the past 40 years or so, but I do not have a problem with drink.  I do not want to drink, but I do not have a problem if other people drink.  People should not be pressurised to take alcohol.  My wife would take the odd glass of wine.  We have been married for 35 years, and I have seen her take perhaps ten glasses of wine in that period.  She takes a glass, and she enjoys it.  People have to take responsibility for their drinking.  If a person goes to a function, drinks and drives home, I hope to God he or she will be stopped by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and arrested.  That is what should be done.</p>  <p>  There is an idea out there that this is a blame game.  Like everything else, people have to start standing up for themselves.  I have heard this for years.  I managed football teams and businesses.  When someone is caught drinking and driving or taking too much drink there is always someone else to blame.  I believe it is time we stood up to that.  The main emphasis here is over-consumption, and my main concern is underage drinking.  If functions are giving out free drink to people who are underage those responsible should be prosecuted.  However, there is too much emphasis placed on blaming people.  In Dundalk and in County Louth there are many distilleries.  I love to visit distilleries.  I do not drink but I love seeing how the drink is manufactured.  It is fantastic.  When I go to these distilleries for a tour the first thing I am offered is a cup of tea or a scone.  They do not push drink into people.   </p>  <p>  We have to learn to say no, to take responsibility, and to stop blaming people.  We have to take the responsibility ourselves.  </p></speech>

This is not a Second Stage debate.  This amendment concerns the removal of the word "and".  I do not want to stifle debate, but this should not be seen as an opportunity for a Second Stage debate.  I know that Deputy Danny Healy-Rae will concentrate on the amendment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-09-26a.533" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1320" speakername="Danny Healy-Rae" time="17:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018092600047#ZZ01400"><p>I have many concerns about how the Bill has progressed, because at the beginning it sought to protect youngsters from drinking too much and to stop alcohol from being too readily available at cheap prices for them.  However, this Bill has gone all over the place, proposing to cover bottles with cancer warnings, among other things.</p><p>This amendment would mean that people could not have a drink without being charged for it.  I want to make a few points on this.</p> <p> Many retrograde things have happened to rural Ireland since I came here.  In rural Ireland, there is a thing called a wake.  People go to wakes and stay with the family for a few hours, and a few drinks are given to the guests.  Are we going to police an event like that, so that a person cannot take a drink at a wake?  In rural Ireland there is also something called a station, where mass is said in a house.  Each house's turn comes around after four or five years.  A few drinks are provided.  However, as the Deputy said, to take a drink or not is a person's choice.  I do not drink but I have nothing against those who do.  The word is "moderation".  This amendment is open to an interpretation whereby opening ceremonies or book launches, where a glass of wine is provided, would be illegal.</p> <p> Rural Ireland has a thing called a ball night at which a locality or a parish celebrates.  People dance and play music and drinks are available that do not have to be paid for.  They are paid for by the people who organise the ball night.  Likewise there are Biddy balls. I do not know if any Members know what a Biddy ball is.</p></speech>

Sadly, we do not have as many of them as we once had.  Are we going to have a situation where garda&iacute; could land at a Biddy ball like the priests would land at house dances long ago, coming in the front door to chase people out the back door and follow them down the road?  Is that what we are going to have?  This is ridiculous, to be honest.  This Parliament has so many serious and important things to do.</p></speech>

Where will the Government get enough garda&iacute; to make sure the law is followed?  Garda&iacute; certainly have enough things to do.  They are very busy without sending them after people who are having a free drink.  This is ridiculous.</p>  <p>  There are other issues around the cancer labelling.  It has been said that it is not in this amendment but I will talk about it, because it is fairly ridiculous and stupid.  It will also be fairly hurtful if it goes through.  It looks to me as though some people have gone stone mad.  Again, a person makes a choice about whether they want to have a drink.  The choice is theirs.  We set out to protect young people and we will certainly do our best, but this Bill is all over the shop.  It is absolutely ridiculous.</p></speech>

Opposition amendments Nos. 4 and 5 from Deputy O'Reilly try to expand the definition of "sell" in the Bill to include "supply for the purpose of promoting the use of another service" and "supply in the purchase of another good or service".  As Deputy O'Reilly knows, the Minister of the day already has the ability to address this matter under section 23 of the Bill.  Section 23 gives the Minister for Health of the day the power to make regulations to address exactly the type of issues being targeted here.  Under section 23, the Minister may make regulations to prohibit or restrict selling alcohol at a reduced price or giving it free of charge on the purchase of another product or service.  I am not sure what product or service would be sold at a wake.</p>  <p>  Regulations may prohibit or restrict the selling of alcohol at a reduced price for a limited period, defined as three days or less, and selling alcohol at a reduced price or giving it free in a manner likely to encourage the consumption of alcohol in a harmful way.</p>  <p>  What Deputy O'Reilly is trying to do is extraordinarily sensible.  She is trying to ensure that the use of alcohol as a promotional tool when trying to sell another event is restricted or prohibited.  I am responding by saying that in my view her amendments are not necessary.  The Minister of the day already has this power under section 23.</p></speech>

One of the key indicators of the level of harm caused by alcohol misuse is alcohol-related presentations at health facilities.  There are three alcohol-related deaths in Ireland every single day.  Alcohol currently places a huge burden on our health service, taking up an estimated 1,500 hospital beds in this country every night.  According to the Health Research Board, HRB, &euro;1.5 billion was spent on hospital discharges in 2012.  This does not include the significant costs incurred by our emergency departments, which often bear the brunt of our excessive alcohol consumption . </p><p>We believe that in any consideration of the Bill or sections thereof the Minister should therefore have regard to the data from the health services relating to alcohol presentations at health facilities, as these can provide us with important routine information on the health harms due to alcohol, as well as the impact on the health services themselves.  I understand that the Minister has included sections related to health and social factors but we believe that the collation of these data is particularly relevant.  Alcohol-related incidents and presentations from alcohol-related illness have a significant cost to our health service in resources, beds and staff.  Given that we are legislating and making a public policy decision on alcohol, we believe that these considerations must be taken into account.</p><p>I urge those Deputies who have an interest in this to think long and hard before they interrupt or try to delay this legislation.  This is an amendment that I have discussed extensively with men and women who are working in our hospitals and are on the front line providing counselling and other services, as well as with those who have suffered from alcohol harm and their families.  I ask anybody who intends to make a contribution to please keep those people in mind.</p></speech>

I had no idea what he was talking about for a very long time, but after a while I got my head around it.  What he meant was this.  There is a bunch of things we do that have consequences, positive and negative.  In the world of economists these are externalities.  The problem is that if they cause harm and no account is taken of that harm, society is unbalanced.  We have not accounted for the negative externalities within public policy.  His view was that wherever possible we should internalise or account for some of the damaging things that happen in our society.  Everyone in the Chamber probably agrees that alcohol-related presentations at emergency departments are a real problem.</p><p>In some cases, people might not have a huge amount of sympathy for those presenting.  In many cases, those who have presented due to alcohol-related mischief are seen before those who were not drinking excessively and who really do need to be seen.  I support the amendment because it is important.  It is an important first step.  We need to understand the data.  This would greatly increase the ability of our clinicians, particularly those working in emergency departments, to be able to show us the evidence.  Then we can legislate and regulate accordingly.</p></speech>

As Deputy Donnelly said, quite often people who need urgent care are displaced because of alcohol overdose and misuse.  It also leads to increased levels of suicide and road traffic accidents.  It is not just the actual alcohol presentation, it is the cause of many other events that lead to people coming to hospital.  This amendment should be accepted.  What our health service most particularly lacks is proper data on many issues.  It would be extremely important that we use this legislation to gather data on alcohol-related harm.</p></speech>

Deputy O'Reilly is entirely correct that the amendment is very sensible.  The Bill already provides in section 11(5) that the Minister should have regard to health-related risks and other societal harms caused by alcohol consumption when determining changes to minimum unit pricing.  We have a variety of systems, including the hospital in-patient enquiry, HIPE, system, National Self-Harm Registry Ireland and the Health Research Board, which can assist in this, as well as the Healthy Ireland survey but the Deputy is entirely correct to highlight this issue.  Alcohol and alcohol-related disease constitute a massive burden on the Irish health service, let alone a massive burden on Irish families and communities throughout the country.  The amendment is sensible and it would be helpful.  I propose to accept it.</p></speech>

There are two main reasons for this.  One is the position of the Irish language in our society and Constitution.  There are many people, and I hope it is a growing number, who live, eat, sleep, dream and go to the pub as Gaeilge.  If we are serious about these public health warnings, which we are, then we must recognise there are many people in our society whose first language is Irish.  It has primacy in our Constitution.  As such, these warnings should be in both languages.</p><p>The second reason is to try to future-proof the Bill from challenge.  As I laid out to the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, on Committee Stage, when labelling for cigarettes was introduced, a High Court case was taken against the State by a teacher who argued he had a right for the warnings to be in Irish and English.  My understanding is he won that court case.  I do not want a situation whereby the labelling happens only in English and a High Court challenge is taken, which the Government loses, thus slowing down implementation of the Bill.</p></speech>

Nowhere else do people feel fit to put these labels on alcohol.  Why do we have to race to the bottom?  We are speaking about putting it in Irish and English when we should not be putting it at all.  It comes back to this thing called common sense.  People know that if they take too much alcohol on a daily, weekly or monthly basis it will be bad for them.  It is the same as sweet cake.  Sweet cake is not bad for people if they take it in moderation but if they take it continuously in the morning, in the middle of the day and at night time they will get overweight and it will be bad for them.  They will probably get diabetes and other medical problems so, therefore, it is bad.  We should have everything in moderation.  I do not see why we should go on this crusade that will give a bad impression of us to the rest of Europe and the world.  People who come here will look at the alcohol products we sell here and we export, and we will be out of step with everybody else in that we will label them.</p>  <p>  A great friend of mine, Michael O'Connor, is 104 years of age.  Thankfully he is still with us and facing into his 105th year.  On many occasions I have asked him what is the secret and if we cannot learn from a man who is 104, we can learn from nobody.  He always looks up at the sky, throws his head back and says "everything in moderation".  It is okay to drink, it is okay to eat and it is okay to do everything, but do it in moderation.</p></speech>

I do not think we have to be labelling our products in any language to educate people to the fact if they do too much of one thing it is bad for them.</p>  <p>  I appreciate that Deputy Donnelly is very genuine in his motives but it is wrong.  Coming back to the industry, it will put us at a disadvantage to everybody else.  People in the respectable drinks industry have worked hard to create employment and build up businesses.  This matter is causing great concern to people in the drinks industry in Ireland who create employment and who have borrowed money from banks to open breweries.  They are involved in the sale of alcohol.  They are not criminals.  They are decent, hard-working respectable people who are giving employment.  They are in every town and area.  They sell alcohol but now are looking at the prospect of being at a disadvantage to the rest of the world because they will have to put these labels on the alcohol.  Not only are they being told to put it in one language but they are being told they will have to put it in two languages.  Why do we not state we will put it in every language there is, including French, Italian and German?  We may as well have nothing on the bottle save a big piece of paper explaining this is a very dangerous concoction that might actually stretch people if they drink too much of it.  For God's sake, we have lost the run of ourselves in here and I mean that.</p></speech>

What surprises me about this issue is that it was necessary to table an amendment because it was not provided for by the Minister, and that the Minister of State, Deputy McHugh, had not suggested to him to deal with this issue.  It should become standard practice where new legislation on signage or labels is introduced that they are done in both official languages.  No other state in the world would introduce national legislation to have an official notification such as this in only one official language.  Perhaps the Minister will explain to us why it was not provided for in the original Bill and why it took an Opposition Deputy to remind him of all of the commitments made by the Taoiseach and Ministers.</p><p>The Minister of State, Deputy McHugh, is always telling us about the Government's love of and commitment to the Irish language.  It makes a difference to people to see any language in everyday use.  It has a major effect on the acceptance of the language as being the ordinary language of dialogue and not just a language of c&uacute;pla focail.</p> <p> I understand the Minister has said there is now a difficulty because of oversight and he would have to go back to Europe to get permission for this.  It demonstrates how serious was this oversight, and I would be interested to hear how the Minister will deal with these three amendments.  I understand there may not be a difficulty with some of them but how will the Minister rectify an oversight on his part?</p></speech>

As I said to him directly, I know he put down these amendments in an effort to improve the Bill with respect to labelling and notification, and not for any other motive, as I saw wrongly attributed to him.  As I already mentioned to Deputy Donnelly, amendment No. 8 relates to the requirement to have the health information on the labels of alcohol products in Irish and English.  I am conscious that in order to achieve the objectives of the Bill, the provisions in it must be workable.  We need to maintain the balance between what is beneficial to our citizens for the protection of their health - this is a piece of public health legislation and a new departure relating to alcohol - and the new obligations being placed on our commercial operators.  The balance is to promote public health in a way that is proportionate.</p><p>We are asking businesses to work with us in changing our products and providing health information for the very first time.  We are moving from a position where today there is no health information on the product to adding six new pieces of information.  I understand this is a new approach and it will bring new burdens for business.  If a requirement is added that information must be in two languages - Deputy Harty's point is valid - we will need different fonts and there is the potential to distort what we are trying to do in putting very clear information out there.</p><p>There is a further practical reality that is the main reason I am not in a position to propose accepting amendment No. 8.  It is a reality referenced by Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.  If we were to make any changes to the requirement for health information on the labels to be in Irish it could delay the passage of the legislation through the Oireachtas and the enactment of the Bill.  It would not affect the labels.  Any additional requirement relating to labels would have to be notified and assessed at an EU level before enactment.</p><p>Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v suggests that either I or perhaps the Government of which I am a part do not care for the Irish language, which he of course knows not to be true.  Nonetheless, in addition to the practical concern I am conscious that we must in a public health Bill ensure that information on the label is clear and effective.  It must be the paramount objective.  A study was commissioned from Am&aacute;rach Research in August 2015 to provide recommendations on how to best communicate critical information through labelling on the risk relating to alcohol consumption.  There must be an evidence base to this and we must ensure this is an effective way of communicating.  The research indicates that the inclusion of the information in another language on labels served to confuse the message being relayed.</p><p>There are practical reasons arising from the EU's standstill period and we would not be able to pass the legislation as a result.  It is something Deputy Donnelly and I have discussed.  I do not propose to accept amendment No. 8.  However, in the interests of compromise and accepting exactly what Deputy Donnelly is trying to do, I propose to accept amendments Nos. 10 and 13.  These are sensible amendments and they require health information to be available in Irish as well as English on notices in licensed premises and on websites where alcohol products are sold online.  I have also discussed with the HSE through my Department's own website, <i>www.askaboutalcohol.ie</i>, and all the relevant information there will also be included in the Irish language.  I genuinely accept the importance of the Irish language and giving it prominence in the discussion.  I propose the compromise would be that it would not be on the labels but on the website and the notices.</p><p>I have done a legal check on Deputy Donnelly's point about previous court cases.  The very clear legal advice available to me is that the case was different because tobacco warnings related to an EU directive and what we are doing tonight is pioneering.</p><p>Amendment No. 14 proposes that data from health services and alcohol-related presentations at health facilities should be taken into account when making regulations on the health warnings and information.  It is Deputy O'Reilly's amendment and the idea is that we would take that into consideration on labels, notices in licensed premises and websites that sell alcohol products.  This amendment is very much the same model she used with regard to the minimum unit pricing discussion we had only a few minutes ago.  It is a sensible amendment and I propose its acceptance.  Therefore, I propose we accept amendments Nos. 10, 13 and 14.  I am not in a position to accept amendment No. 8, with the most important reason being the practicalities involved in getting this legislation passed.  There is also the concern about clarity of messaging on labels.</p></speech>

For example, what the Minister stated here today is that were the European Union to bring in an directive, following his good lead, to the effect that this had to be done across Europe, suddenly the label would become non-effective in Ireland because it would have to be then bilingual.  The directive that forced it on the cigarette packages would force it here.</p>  <p>  Supposing Belgium decided tomorrow to follow the good example of Ireland - as the Minister will be aware, Belgium is a rigidly bilingual society in terms of such matters - the Minister is stating the label would have no effect, that it would put everybody astray and that it would not work because it would be in French and Flemish.  The Minister's own argument does not stand up to any rational scrutiny of what happens in other countries where there is a bilingual situation and where there are two official languages.  It is only in Ireland that the Minister's argument washes as being a cogent one.</p>  <p>  I certainly agree with my colleague that because of the Minister's carelessness in this issue and his attitude, which is that we love the Irish language but will not do anything practical for it, we have no choice because none of us want to hold up this Bill.  I am on the record as saying that we have a major issue with alcohol in this country.  Therefore, we have no choice but to accept that the Minister will not accept the amendment.</p>  <p>  However, to think that the Minister's arguments are cogent, I have to say the more the Minister is effecting them the more he will know they were very weak because many countries have bilingual requirements and they manage to get the message across.</p></speech>

I do not believe it is.  The Irish language is important and we need to take it seriously.  We need to recognise there are people who live through Irish, who think, shop and consume through Irish and they have a right to be warned through their active language.  I must disagree that this is some concept of political correctness.</p>  <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v laid out well the point on the labelling.  I would like to see it on the labelling for all of the right reasons.  However, under no circumstances do I want to hold this Bill up.  Therefore, I will withdraw the amendment.</p>  <p>  As to the legal challenge, I am sure whoever brought in the warnings on the cigarette packets got legal advice as well that they would be fine and that legal advice turned out to be untrue.  We will see.  I hope this time it is correct.  I will withdraw amendment No. 8 regarding the bilingual labelling and acknowledge the Minister is accepting the bilingual requirements for both the website and the signage.</p></speech>

Anything the Minister said certainly does not convince me.  I am listening attentively to what my colleagues are saying.  We have not thought through the enormity of what we are doing here, the implications it will have and what it will mean.</p>  <p>  While I respect Deputies such as Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v who have made a contribution on their viewpoint on the use of the Irish language on the warnings, we are losing sight completely of what we should be doing here.  We are going down a dangerous road with which I could not agree.  Deputy Donnelly is making fair and reasoned arguments but I think they are wrong.  They are ignoring the industry.  I could not agree with it.  The Minister's response is of no comfort to me.</p></speech>
