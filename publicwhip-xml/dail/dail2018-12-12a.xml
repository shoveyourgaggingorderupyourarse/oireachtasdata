What are the Minister's views on the delay between BusConnects phase 2, which relates to the bus spines and new corridors that we, on this side of the House, strongly support, and the implementation of phase 1, which relates to the network changes?</p></reply>
    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-12-12a.13.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018121200003#A00800"><p>As the Deputy is aware BusConnects is one of the flagship investments to be delivered under Project Ireland 2040 and the ten year national development plan, NDP.  The programme is made up of a number of different components, namely, building a new network of improved bus and cycle lanes; redesigning and expanding the network of bus services; introducing simpler fare structures and new ticketing technology; implementing a new bus livery; providing new and improved bus stops and shelters and new park and ride sites; and, importantly, transitioning the entire urban PSO bus fleet to low emission technologies.</p>  <p>  The objective of these proposals under BusConnects is to improve bus journey times that will benefit many millions of passenger journeys each year; provide a bus service that is easier to use and understand; enable more people to travel by bus than ever before; and also provide a network of cycling infrastructure that will enable more people to cycle across the city.</p>  <p>  Each of the components is significant in its own right while collectively they have the potential to transform how we use the bus in Dublin and in the other cities when rolled out there.  The Deputy's question seems to suggest discord where none exists.  All significant investment programmes such as BusConnects are made up of different components which can be progressed at different times and at different speeds.</p>  <p>  With BusConnects Dublin, the National Transport Authority, NTA, has been running the consultation phase on two distinct components, first, the network redesign - this is about configuration of all the bus services that will run for passengers - and, second, the proposed new bus lanes.  These are the dedicated road infrastructure that will form the 16 main corridors into the city on which the bus services, and cycleways, will run.</p>  <p>  We all know of the significant public consultation that has taken place in recent months in relation to the bus network.  There was a huge response to that consultation, with more than 30,000 submissions.  The NTA is currently considering all submissions received with a view to issuing a revised network design for further public consultation in 2019.</p>  <p>  It is envisaged that the implementation of the final network will take place in 2020.  The network redesign can be implemented on the existing road network with some enhancements at key interchange locations which will be provided as we roll out the new network.</p></reply>

Phase 2 puts in place the infrastructure.  We believe it makes more sense to implement phase 1 first, to put in place the corridors, and then change the network.  According to a briefing we received last week by the NTA and Dublin Bus, some of these corridors will not be in place until 2027, the date for the construction completion and implementation of the metro.  What will happen between now and then?  There will be an increases in the bus fleet and a network redesign, about which the Minister and I both had issues, despite our support for the project from the start.  What will happen between 2020 and 2027 as traffic congestion increases in the city and without the corridors to carry it?  What are the Minister's plans for this?</p></speech>

Bus corridors are not the first thing to go in in this situation.  The last major overhaul of the bus network in Dublin was implemented without any infrastructure developments accompanying it.  The network redesign, which is the first thing, can be done in advance of the introduction of the new bus lanes.  This will obviously take time.  A large number of corridors, 16, will be brought in.  It will not all be put in in 2027.  There is a process which will involve many different applications, representations and consultations because they are controversial.  It is not the case that we will plonk them down in 2026-2027, and the gap that the Deputy is suggesting is not the case.</p></speech>

There will be some compulsory purchase orders, which is regrettable but that will happen.  There will be a large amount of public consultation to ensure that the corridors are put in the correct places and convenient to the people involved and the residents who will be affected.  It will be a long process, not a short one, but it is for the convenience of the Deputy's constituents and my own.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-12-12a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1311" speakername="John Lahart" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018121200003#A01300"><p>That is the point - it is a long process.  I would love if the Minster devoted the same energy as he does to traffic safety, which is laudable, into a dynamic intervention into this.  People cannot be encouraged or expected to switch from cars to buses if the bus infrastructure is not in place.</p><p>This speaks to the matter that arises time and again.  I raised it yesterday with respect to the policing of bus corridors and the Minister did not particularly respond on any initiatives.  This is the kind of matter that should keep the Minister and me up at night thinking of solutions for the intermediate term.  It will be ten years before that bus corridor network is filled.  How can we hope to encourage drivers to switch from cars to bus services if there are no corridors in place and if the project is not to be completed until 2027?  That will lead to completely obstacle-free routes, leaving buses as essentially a Luas tram on rubber wheels, but drivers will have to wait for ten years until the entire infrastructure is built.</p> <p> I would like the Minister to take a real leadership role in pushing this on and meeting representatives of the National Transport Authority, NTA, to make it happen as quickly as possible.  We must get the compulsory purchase orders and a couple of eggs will have to be broken to make this omelette but we must get the NTA to push this through.  The Minister should devise some intermediate solutions to encourage drivers to switch from cars to public transport.</p></speech>

He should not be under the impression that nothing will happen with bus corridors in the next decade.  A National Transport Authority-led public consultation on four of its new bus lanes in Dublin started on Wednesday, 14 November, as the Deputy is aware.  It runs until early next year.  The corridors are Clongriffin to the city centre, Swords to the city centre, Blanchardstown to the city centre and Lucan to the city centre.  As I stated, there are to be 16 corridors in total and consultations on the next six will start in January and run until April.  Consultations on the final six will start in February and run until May.  Phasing the consultations will allow for the appropriate level of engagement with property owners and communities along each route.  It is really important that these consultations are given time and space.  Nobody wants to see these bus corridors become invasive or an impediment to people's daily lives.  We want to see as much accord, agreement and consent as possible given to the process, and it will take time.  The idea that they will not happen until 2027 is wrong and the consultation processes are beginning already.  The processes will go on and they will be phased in.  They will not all happen in parallel as that is not necessary.</p></speech>

There were reports in the media that the Government was considering the establishment of a dedicated transport police to deal with crime on public transport and the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport was meet the Minister for Justice and Equality on the matter.  What was the outcome of that and what plans have been outlined?</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-12-12a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018121200004#B00600"><p>I thank the Deputy for putting the question, as the matter is of concern to a large number of Deputies, particularly in the Dublin area.  It is a matter of some angst for people on some modes of transport and less in others.  It is a relevant and well-intentioned question.</p>  <p>  The safety and security of public transport passengers and staff, including arrangements to deal with anti-social behaviour, are important matters that, first and foremost, must be managed by every public transport company in conjunction with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na where appropriate.  Whereas the vast majority of public transport passenger journeys occur without incident, I am concerned to ensure that the necessary arrangements are in place to guarantee the safety of all passengers and staff travelling and working on our bus and rail networks.  Therefore, following representations from the National Bus and Rail Union seeking the establishment of a dedicated police force for public transport, my Department wrote to Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Dublin Bus to seek their views on the issue of anti-social behaviour and ensuring the safety of both passengers and staff.</p>  <p>  In its response, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann outlined a number of measures that the company has taken in an effort to safeguard the security of passengers and staff.  These measures have included the allocation of additional security and supervisory operatives, particularly at night and in certain areas, as well as more resources for centralised closed circuit television, CCTV, monitoring stations.  The company also emphasised that it works closely with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on anti-social behaviour in general and receives the full support of the Garda.  More recently, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has advised that security and supervisory operatives have been allocated, particularly at night, in certain areas and at sensitive times, such as the Christmas period.  In addition, I understand Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has now commenced the deployment of on-board customer service officers on intercity trains; their primary focus will be on customer service but their presence is intended to deter anti-social behaviour and will enable rapid contact with security or An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should this be required.</p>  <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann and Dublin Bus responded that the level of anti-social behaviour is relatively low and noted a declining trend, which is very positive.  Both companies also stressed the strong and close working relationships with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Dublin Bus has advised my Department that it will have enhanced levels of co-operation and engagement with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na over the Christmas period.  The company has highlighted the areas of greatest risk and requested additional support.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-12-12a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1333" speakername="Imelda Munster" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018121200004#B00700"><p>As the Minister is aware, public transport companies are already under-resourced and need additional support from the Government to deal with this.  It is my understanding it costs Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann upwards of &euro;3 million per year to provide security services.  The Minister also knows that security personnel do not have the power of arrest and it is arguable that the presence of garda&iacute; would be a stronger deterrent to would-be criminals or those causing anti-social behaviour.  Currently, transport workers and passengers feel threatened because of a lack of security and the Minister should be aware of recent media reports of an apparent increase in anti-social behaviour.  It is a worry not just for workers but for passengers.  The Minister indicated the Government would look at a new and specific policing unit but has that idea been shelved?  Does the Minister have an update on that?  I have taken on board his response.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-12-12a.26" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018121200004#B00800"><p>The Deputy mentioned the need for additional resources and I have given Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann an extra &euro;115,000, of which I know the Deputy is aware.  That has come from my Department's Vote very late in the year in order to assist with this specific problem.  The additional funding from the Vote will enable Irish Rail to take further measures that can reassure passengers and staff that they will be able to travel and work in safety and peace over the festive season.  Irish Rail has spent &euro;100,000 of this on extra security patrols on evening DART and commuter services between Dublin city centre and Howth, Drogheda, Maynooth, Kildare and Greystones.  These patrols will be in addition to Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann's existing measures to safeguard the travelling public against anti-social behaviour and the company's long-standing strong working relationship with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The remaining &euro;15,000 of the extra funds will be used by Irish Rail to provide additional security personnel at fleet maintenance depots in order to counter the threat of vandalism, including graffiti attacks on trains.</p>  <p>  The issue of anti-social behaviour on the public transport network has come increasingly to the fore over recent months thanks to the Deputy and others and we have responded to it.  I must also thank Mr. Dermot O'Leary of the NBRU, who also brought this to our attention.  We have responded very positively to it because we recognise there is a common interest in looking after both the staff and the passengers.</p></speech>

Is Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann satisfied it is sufficient to bring about an effective deterrent and curb the rise in anti-social behaviour?  Are the unions satisfied that the funding is sufficient?  The Minister should be aware there have been more than 1,000 anti-social behaviour incidents in the past 18 months and the rise in incidence across all statistical areas.  It is something that must be dealt with promptly and effectively.  Are the parties satisfied that the additional funding will help sort out the problem?</p></speech>

We will see what happens and what will be the result.  We are not even over the Christmas period yet so we cannot see the effect it has had.</p><p>They must be pleased with the fact that the Deputy's representations, the trade union's representations, their own representations and our awareness of the fact that appalling things were happening on public transport, made us proactive.  I hope they are happy but of course we are happy to talk to them again if they think there is anything more we can do.  That is not a promise of funding but it is certainly a promise of support, moral or otherwise for what they are doing.</p> <p> I have been in touch with the Minister for Justice and Equality and he has been in touch with the Garda Commissioner in turn and it is being looked at very seriously.

This announcement was accompanied by a statement of the IOC&rsquo;s intention to initiate a full inquiry into the internal governance arrangements of the International Boxing Association, AIBA.  At present, it is my understanding that the IOC has not yet made a final decision on the inclusion of boxing at the 2020 Olympic Games.</p>  <p>  It is important to clarify that international sport organisations, such as the IOC, are independent, autonomous bodies that are responsible for deciding their own operational procedures and competition rules.  No government has a role or function in such decision making.</p>  <p>  As we know, boxing is our most successful Olympic sport.  We have won about 31 medals in the history of the modern Olympics, 16 of which have come in boxing and seven of those were in the last three Olympic Games.  There is no doubt that we have a number of really good prospects for Tokyo so it is critically important that we would have this matter resolved.  My primary concern in this is for the athletes and to give them certainty.  It is very difficult 20 months out from the Olympic Games for an athlete to not know for certain whether their discipline will be included.  I want to do whatever I can do to help ensure that certainty is there for those athletes.</p>  <p>  I am glad that there is excellent collaboration between Sport Ireland and the Irish Athletic Boxing Association, IABA, on this.  I have been in contact with both organisations about this.  I contacted them immediately on 30 November to try to ensure that everything that could possibly be done to help the situation is being done and I am confident that is happening.  I also understand that on the international front, the IOC has prepared eight possible scenarios around what may happen with boxing but this is certainly something that we will continue to work on and something I am confident that our sports agencies, Sport Ireland and the IABA, are doing everything they can about at the moment.</p></speech>

The issue that has arisen is not just about the quality of the sport, it is about the governance of the organisations in question.  In other words, we have governments issuing warrants to the president of the International Boxing Association who, seemingly, has a precarious background.  That is why the IABA has been suspended.</p>  <p>  All of this is happening in a situation where we have some of the best athletes coming up in boxing.  As the Minister of State said himself, it has given our highest return in recent decades in Olympic medals.  It would be a shame going forward, for a sport that anyone in society is able to participate in no matter their creed or financial background, if we did not do enough to get this resolved.  Tokyo 2020 is only around the corner.</p></speech>

These are the people who basically put their lives on hold, in most cases from the time they are very young, to pursue their dream.  To have this level of uncertainty, this relatively close to the Olympics, is just not good enough.  It is something that all of the international boxing associations will have to come together on and to work with the IOC to get resolved because at the centre of this are Irish athletes and athletes from other countries who have worked really hard to get to where they are and are now wondering whether they will actually be in Tokyo or not.</p>  <p>  On the IABA and Sport Ireland, I am confident that they are doing everything they can possibly do and I am quite happy with the level of interaction that we have had on this to date in terms of trying to get it resolved but I am happy to keep the Deputy informed of developments because it is critically important to the entire sporting nation, given our recent successes.  I look at Kellie Harrington's recent success in particular.  Kellie and many others have really great prospects for Tokyo 2020 and we want to ensure they have the best possible preparation in advance of that.</p></speech>

I have two straight questions.  Has the Minister of State spoken to the Irish Athletic Boxing Association?</p>  <p>  When the Minister was in the capital of the US, Washington DC recently - where they have initiated concerns about the president of the International Boxing Association - attending the World Anti Doping Agency conference where he made tremendous deliberations, did he not use the opportunity to speak to representatives of the other political bodies that attended that meeting and ask them what was happening with the international boxing situation?  Given the Minister's remit in this jurisdiction and the manner in which he is always able to put his hand in someone else's pie, will he tell us whether he talked to them about it in America?  That was only two months ago and this issue has been hanging in the balance for over 12 months.  We seem to be getting no progress and the future of Irish boxing is in jeopardy because if we do not get recognition at the Olympics it causes trouble.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-12-12a.47" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" time="10:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018121200005#C01900"><p>I thank Deputy Coppinger for the question.  The question appears to be on the tendering of Bus &Eacute;ireann routes and asks me to make a statement on the matter.  I will respond to the other part of the question later if the Deputy wishes.</p>  <p>  As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I have responsibility for policy and overall funding relating to public transport.  However, I am not involved in the day to day operations of public transport or in public service obligation, PSO, contract arrangements.</p>  <p>  It is a statutory function of the National Transport Authority, under the Dublin Transport Authority Act, 2008, and EU Regulation 1370/2007, to determine the appropriate mix of directly awarded and competitively tendered PSO services.</p>  <p>  In 2015, as part of the bus market opening, the NTA sought expressions of interest from public transport operators to operate bus services on certain routes in the Dublin metropolitan, Dublin commuter and Waterford areas.  This resulted in approximately 10% of PSO services which were operated under direct award by Bus &Eacute;ireann and Dublin Bus being competitively tendered.  As the Deputy is aware, Bus &Eacute;ireann won the contract for delivery of the Waterford services which are expected to commence in March 2019.  Go-Ahead Ireland was announced as the winner of the other competitions, including the Dublin commuter competition for certain commuter routes on the Kildare corridor into Dublin previously operated by Bus &Eacute;ireann.  It is expected that Go-Ahead Ireland will commence operations on the Kildare corridor routes in quarter 2, 2019.</p><p>The competitive tendering that has recently been introduced by the NTA into the bus market is happening at the same time as significant growth in public transport services.  The market opening will therefore not give rise to a reduction in employee numbers or in services by Bus &Eacute;ireann or Dublin Bus as they both need drivers to operate new expanded timetables on their remaining routes.  Of course, these expanded and intensified services by Bus &Eacute;ireann or Dublin Bus will be subvented by the NTA, so the 10% market opening will not result in a corresponding reduction in their PSO subsidy, as might otherwise be expected.<br/><br/><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i><br/><br/>The NTA's current direct award public service obligation, PSO, contract with Bus &Eacute;ireann expires at the end of November 2019.  The NTA is required to follow a statutory process underpinned by both EU and national legislation before the direct award contracts may be renewed.<br/><br/>As part of this process, the NTA launched a public consultation process in early October on the bus services contracts.  This consultation informed the NTA's recent decision on the renewal of the contracts, including in respect of the direct award and competitive tender balance of contracts for Bus &Eacute;ireann.<br/><br/>Regarding the direct award contracts post 2019 in respect of Bus &Eacute;ireann, the NTA has announced it will directly award an equivalent service level that the company has in December 2019, amend that contract in 2021 to reduce it by up to 5% of services and provide the removed services through a separate contract following an open competitive tender process.<br/><br/>It will be open to Bus &Eacute;ireann to tender for these services if it so wishes.<br/><br/>The new direct award contracts proposed by the NTA will provide a guaranteed level of PSO funding to Bus &Eacute;ireann up to 2024.<br/><br/>As the Deputy is aware, the public transport PSO programme represents a significant expenditure of taxpayers' money.  Overall, its funding has increased by some 35% in the past three years.  This year &euro;285 million in funding has been allocated towards funding our PSO services.</p></speech>

Go-Ahead starts its bus drivers on &euro;28,000.  How is one meant to buy a house in this city or any other city in this country on such a wage?  The top rate of pay is &euro;32,000.  That is &euro;14,000 less than a Bus &Eacute;ireann worker could earn after a number of years of service.  There are no break facilities.  Obviously, the Minister thinks it is fine for a bus driver to pull in and eat a sandwich on the side of the road.  In reality, drivers have been leaving the company <i>en masse</i>.  They were not able to take over last week the routes they were meant to take over.  They are working a 12-hours-a-day roster whereas 11 hours is meant to be the maximum.  It just will not work.  We have already seen the Ryanair model fall apart.  I know the chief executive officer is a good friend of the Minister.  There is a revolt by workers and employees of Ryanair against that type of model, and this will not work either.</p></speech>

I have never been in his house and he has never been in mine.  I think I have met him once for a cup of coffee or a light lunch in the past 25 years.  I have met him on other occasions which have been businesslike and nothing else.  I therefore ask the Deputy not to throw across the floor of the House the allegation that the Minister is in some way compromised by friendship.  It is not true.  It is not the case at all.</p>  <p>  I will answer the Deputy's question and some of the things she has said which are just not correct.  She mentioned in her opening remark the privatisation of these companies and routes.  There is no privatisation.  There is an ongoing tendering process, to which she very accurately referred in her initial question but to which she unfortunately did not refer subsequently.  It is a fine tendering process and is not in any way meant to undermine the incumbents, namely Dublin Bus or Bus &Eacute;ireann.  This tendering is for the benefit of the consumers and the passengers and it also benefits the staff.  What Go-Ahead has done is introduce 425 new jobs and a large investment in the Irish economy.  We must welcome this, and Deputy Coppinger should also welcome it.  It is in no way meant to be a privatisation of anything.  No assets are changing hands.  This is just operators tendering for new routes, some of which they are getting, some of which the incumbents are getting.</p></speech>

The NTA does not want Bus &Eacute;ireann to be able to maintain its own routes.  In reality, it is not allowed compete.  What is happening is a fragmenting of the network.  Bus &Eacute;ireann is expected to show a profit despite all the challenges of the NTA increasing licences and curtailing Expressway.  The NTA guidelines are meant to be cognisant of the public service obligation, which does not seem to have been the case with Go-Ahead.  At least with Bus &Eacute;ireann the surplus money is reinvested into the economy; with companies like Go-Ahead, but specifically with Go-Ahead itself, 83% of the company is stock market-owned.  What will happen is that the public service, the taxpayer in effect, will end up subsidising these jobs because many of the workers will have to claim the working family payment.  The Minister has nobbled Dublin Bus as well.  It is only allowed to make a profit of &euro;1 million and must run its fleet on that.  The NTA takes anything above that.  Dublin Bus increases its passengers and generates revenue of &euro;20 million and the NTA takes back &euro;19 million.  How is this allowing the public service in any way to compete?</p>  <p>  The Minister may not be a friend of Mr. O'Leary - I will rephrase that - but he is certainly an admirer and has tweeted very approvingly about the activities of the Ryanair boss, just voted the worst boss in history.  My concern is for workers and commuters, who will not have services when they need them.</p></speech>

Go-Ahead is entering a market and, I hope, doing well because it is accommodating a large and growing number of passengers which it is absolutely essential to accommodate.  Happily, there is room for all, both the incumbent and its competitors and its new operations, in this new environment.

It is a serious and worthy one and is along the lines of what we have already heard about the necessity to protect the staff, which is essential and which I agree is not adequate in all cases.</p><p>As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I have responsibility for policy on and overall funding of public transport.</p><p>The safety and security of Bus &Eacute;ireann staff is a matter first and foremost for Bus &Eacute;ireann in conjunction with, as appropriate, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>Bus &Eacute;ireann has advised that driver security screens are fitted to the entire low-floor single-deck and double-deck bus fleet.</p><p>I am advised that manufacturers currently do not supply a solution for screens on coaches and consequently screens are not fitted to this fleet type.</p><p>I have been assured that the company will continue to review this with coach manufacturers.</p><p>However, their challenge remains safety-related as a result of the significant constraints arising from the design and layout of a coach cab area, the high operating speeds of coaches and the driver's need for a clear and unimpeded view of the coach at high speeds.</p> <p> Bus &Eacute;ireann has further advised that the safety and welfare of employees are key priorities for it, that all assault and anti-social behaviour incidents are fully investigated and followed up with the Garda as required and that any employee involved in an incident is supported by the company through local management and the company welfare scheme.  As already stated, while the vast majority of public transport passenger journeys occur without incident I am concerned to make sure that the necessary arrangements are in place in order to ensure the safety of all passengers and staff travelling and working on our public transport network.</p> <p> As a result, following representations from the NBRU regarding the establishment of a dedicated police force for public transport, my Department wrote to Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, Bus &Eacute;ireann, Dublin Bus and the Railway Safety Advisory Council, RSAC, to seek their views on the issue of anti-social behaviour on our public transport network.  All three companies emphasised their strong and close working relationships with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the context of addressing anti-social behaviour.</p></speech>

There have been four assaults on Bus &Eacute;ireann services in the past couple of weeks.  Until recently, I did not know that Bus &Eacute;ireann does not record assaults unless the worker is absent for more than three days.  A worker could be assaulted but it is not recorded if he or she comes back within two days.  Each assault should be recorded so that there is a proper account of it.</p>  <p>  There is a call for a dedicated Garda transport division that has the ability to arrest anybody who causes criminal damage on a bus or attacks a bus worker.  That is what the bus workers are looking for and that is what the Minister should be seeking.  He mentioned that the Minister for Justice and Equality had met the Garda Commissioner.  What was the outcome of that meeting?  The Minister for Justice and Equality would have to provide funding in respect of extra officers if there was to be a dedicated Garda transport division.  Does the Minister have an answer in that regard?  Is he at least willing to provide funding for certain areas initially and then extend them if necessary?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-12-12a.75" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" time="11:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018121200007#E00300"><p>I think the Minister for Justice and Equality wrote to the Garda Commissioner.  I do not think he met him; I am not sure.  I do not know what the outcome of that was, but I think it was quite recent.  I could find out and come back to the Deputy.  I know it is a matter of some urgency.</p>  <p>  In reply to the question about what is being done, I wrote to the RSAC.  In its response it recommended the establishment of a dedicated unit of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to police the rail network on occasions when the possibility of anti-social behaviour is high.  Bus &Eacute;ireann, in which Deputy Joan Collins is particularly interested, reported that the level of anti-social behaviour was relatively low and noted a declining trend.  That does not make it acceptable for one second.  However, the rate does seem to be coming down.  Some of the measures seem to be having an effect.  Bus &Eacute;ireann confirmed once again that the incidence of assaults and anti-social behaviour is low but that safety and welfare of its staff is a key priority.  Driver security screens are fitted to the entire low-floor single-deck and double-deck bus fleet.</p></speech>

There are safety concerns.  I am sure that the health and safety committee could look at something like that.  Where there is a will there is a way.  If something needs to be done and can be done, it should be done.  Assault screens should be fitted on all public transport to protect workers.  As a stakeholder in these public bodies, it is the least the Minister can do to ensure that workers are safe.</p>  <p>  I would appreciate it if the Minister could come back to me regarding the Garda transport division.  The Minister responded to the NBRU on 26 June.  Six months later we still do not have any clarity on that except for what the Minister has stated, namely, that the RSAC advised on the rail network.  I would be interested to find out more about that.</p></speech>

In addition to what I said about security screens being available on the low-floor single-deck and double-desk bus fleet, I note that according to Bus  &Eacute;ireann all assaults and incidents of anti-social behaviour are fully investigated and followed up with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as required.  Any employee involved in such an incident is supported by the company through local management and the company welfare scheme.  Emergency support for drivers on the road is provided through their 24-hour control centres.  The company has invested in extensive CCTV coverage throughout the bus fleet for the added protection of employees and customers.  Bus &Eacute;ireann has improved customer education with clear signage on buses regarding respect for staff as well as a customer safety video.  An additional conflict management module has been included in Bus &Eacute;ireann's employee training programme to help support employees in difficult situations and improved CCTV coverage has been put in place in the driver's cab area, with consideration of an additional camera over the entrance door fully covering the cab.</p>  <p>  I do not want to make light of this problem.  I agree with the Deputy that it has to be addressed.  It is being addressed.  It has come to the notice of the Garda Commissioner, the Minister for Justice and Equality and me.  I would welcome any further suggestions.</p></speech>

They have a worthy representative speaking on behalf of Donegal today, who will no doubt give me and successive Ministers a difficult time if we do not deliver for Donegal. </p><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 41 together.</p><p>First, I would like to explain that, as Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I have overall responsibility for funding and policy concerning the national roads programme.  However under the Roads Acts the planning, design and operation of individual roads is a matter for the relevant road authority in the case of local and regional roads, or for Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, in conjunction with the relevant local authority in the case of national roads.</p><p>The TEN-T priority improvement projects in Donegal consist of improvements and realignment of three sections of the national road network.  These are the Ballybofey and Stranorlar bypass on the N13 and N15; the N56-N13-N14 Letterkenny to Manorcunningham route;<b></b>and the N14 link between Manorcunningham and Lifford, Strabane and the A5.</p><p>TII has advised my Department of the current status of the projects.  Technical advisors are continuing to develop the schemes through phases 1 to 4 of the project management guidelines.  A number of route options have been identified and it is anticipated that the preferred routes will be presented to the public in early 2019.  The preferred routes will then be brought forward for further design and appraisal during 2019.  The construction timetable is estimated to be in the region of approximately 36 months with an estimated completion date at the end of 2027.  However I would like to stress that any timeframe is dependant on obtaining the necessary consents at various critical stages, including at the route selection, detailed design and tender stages.  Meeting the requirements of the public spending code, obtaining planning consent from An Bord Plean&aacute;la and an adequate capital budget are also critical to delivering the project.</p><p>These TEN-T projects will greatly improve journey times, improve safety and significantly improve local and regional connectivity which will help strengthen economic growth for Donegal.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-12-12a.85" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1289" speakername="Pat Gallagher" time="11:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018121200007#E01100"><p>I welcome the fact that progress is being made, and I realise that first of all a route must be selected.  I would like to think that every opportunity would be given to those who are affected by the construction of the new road.  I refer to Ballybofey and Stranorlar in particular.  In my time in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport we had already decided on a route for a bypass.  It has now moved to the other side of the town.  My concern is that it may be so far from the twin towns of Ballybofey and Stranorlar that it may affect their economic development.</p><p>I would like to think the Minister will pass on my views to the TII and ensure that the selection will not have adverse effects on the town.  The route from Letterkenny to Manorcunningham, which is the Bonagee link, is vital and it is important that those along the route have an input.  After the Manorcunningham to Lifford route is constructed to link up with the A5, it will ensure that through the A5 and M2 there will be a motorway all the way to Dublin.  It is important the Minister makes my views known to the TII and ensure we can progress quickly.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-12-12a.87" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" time="11:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018121200008#F00200"><p>I assure the Deputy I will make his views known to the TII.  I will make sure they are passed on.  He should not underestimate the cost of the project, which is &euro;400 million.  It is split approximately as follows: section 1 from Ballybofey and Stranorlar will cost &euro;115 million; section 2 from Letterkenny to Manorcunningham will cost &euro;99 million; and section 3 from Manorcunningham to Lifford and Strabane, which is the A5 link, will cost &euro;186 million.  These are only estimates and the budget costs will be clear when the projects progress to business case stage.</p>  <p>  The TEN-T projects in Donegal form part of the designated comprehensive network.  The Deputy will be familiar with the TEN-T regulation targets from his time at the European Parliament.  In Donegal, the TEN-T includes the N15 as far as the junction with the N13, the N13 to Letterkenny and onto the Border and the N14.  In June, the European Commission published a proposal for a new regulation for the connecting Europe facility, CEF, which is the funding instrument for the European transport network, to come into effect from 1 January 2021.  The comprehensive cross-Border road link between Dublin, Strabane and Letterkenny is included in the annex to the proposal, meaning the Irish elements of the route could, in principle, apply for CEF funding when the regulation comes into effect.</p></speech>

Whatever the outcome of Brexit, Donegal will be more affected than any other part so it is vital we have a motorway right through to Dublin.  This is not the end of developments in Donegal.  I acknowledge the work being done on the N56 in Mountcharles, Inver, my area of Glenties, Dungloe and around the coast.  It is important there are linkages from the north, west and east of the county into the TEN-Ts as otherwise only one part of the county might benefit.  We want to ensure a proper road structure throughout.  I acknowledge the work done on the N56 and we are grateful to the TII.</p></speech>

It is important to the Deputy and his colleagues that Donegal does not suffer as a result of Brexit but this is in flux.  In these circumstances, the Border areas of Donegal, Monaghan, Cavan and others that have made special pleadings in the House have the right to be looked upon sympathetically and I will do so.</p>  <p>  The Deputy has made a good case.  The situation with TEN-T funding is something upon which we cannot depend but irrespective of the funding mechanism, every opportunity will be taken to access any EU funding that may be available and appropriate for the projects the Deputy has mentioned.  I assure him that the matter will be kept under review and that I will convey his views to the TII.</p></speech>

Investment in the port is a matter for the company and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is examining how it will raise the capital necessary for planned investment.  I understand that the company also intends to appoint a business development and sales manager to promote the port.  Last week, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and Rosslare Europort briefed my Department on the company's plan for strategic development of the port over the coming years.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be interested to know that there is also ongoing engagement between my Department and the port on Brexit.  The efficiency of Ireland's logistics sector has been built up over many years on the basis of the advantages provided under the Single Market.  Brexit has the potential to disrupt this logistics supply chain.  In response, a whole-of-Government approach has been adopted on our key ports and airports through the establishment of an interdepartmental committee.</p>  <p>  The OPW, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Health, supported by my Department and other Departments, are working together with Rosslare Europort to plan to manage and minimise any impacts that may arise at the port as a result of Brexit.  Plans are being developed under both a central case scenario and a no-deal scenario to minimise any future disruption to the port as a result of the UK becoming a third country.  Over the past months, there have been numerous meetings between Rosslare Europort and the individual Departments to identify the requirements for the port and to plan for their establishment.  The port authorities have also met on a couple of occasions with the full interdepartmental committee. </p>  <p>  The Deputy may recall that I visited Rosslare Europort earlier this year at the invitation of my ministerial colleague, Deputy Paul Kehoe, and was briefed by the europort's management on its commercial position.  This was a particularly valuable opportunity for me as Minister to witness the central role that Rosslare Europort plays within the economy of Wexford and the wider south east, and to see at first hand its potential in terms of future development as a vital part of our country&rsquo;s trading infrastructure.</p></speech>

As he and the Department know, I have raised the issue of Rosslare Europort on almost a weekly basis since I came into the D&aacute;il.  It is a source of frustration in Wexford and the south east that the significant potential of the port has not been developed.  In the face of Brexit, and what we are witnessing in the UK where the situation is varying from farce to effective chaos, the situation of Rosslare Europort has become acute.  I understand the OPW is looking at putting in additional facilities.  The manager of Rosslare Europort told Wexford County Council three weeks ago it would take approximately three years to put the facilities in place.  Brexit, which is increasingly looking like a hard Brexit, is happening in less than three months.  This time last year, I asked the Minister to raise the ownership issue when he met the UK Minister with responsibility for transport.  As I understand it, there are no political or economic reasons Rosslare Europort and Fishguard Port cannot be separated.  What it requires is minor legislation in the Parliaments in Dublin and Westminster to separate the company into two different ports.  Rosslare Europort could then act as a stand-alone port.</p></speech>

However, it might also provide opportunities for Rosslare.  The advent of Brexit might or might not provide opportunities.  There will have to be changes in many of the ports and Rosslare will not be immune from them.</p>  <p>  I am sure the Deputy is aware the process of agreeing the future trade relationship between the UK and EU, including Ireland, is at a sensitive stage as we speak.  Clearly the outcome of the process will have implications for this country's ports, notably Rosslare Europort, in view of its position as an import-export trading route to mainland Europe for those businesses that now or in the future may wish to consider alternatives to the use of the UK land bridge, which is a pivotal issue for people in Rosslare.</p><p>Departmental meetings with Rosslare Europort and Irish Rail in the context of Brexit are ongoing.  Most recently, the Department, as the Deputy will know, met the CEO of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and the general manager of the port last week and was briefed on the company's recent consultancy report and its plans for the future strategic development of the port.  Ports are one of the top items on my Department's agenda when it is involved in any talks on Brexit, and Rosslare Europort and Dublin Port would be top of that list.</p></speech>

The concern is that the sword will fall and nothing will have been prepared for that.  If the Minister wants to bring Rosslare Europort up to speed to deal with a hard Brexit where if we lose the UK land bridge either because of issues of legal access or financial constraints regarding its use, the port needs to be expanded along with development of access roads.  The authorities in Dover and Calais have publicly printed plans to deal with a hard Brexit, but Rosslare has not.  The authorities in Dover and Calais are predicting ten mile tailbacks.  Rosslare has no plans in place to deal with that.  The manager in Rosslare Europort was reported in the local newspaper as having told Wexford County Council that the Government's policy is not to invest in ports.  He seemed to be outraged that Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann had to spend its own money on its own port because the Government would not spend on it.  Facilities in Rosslare Europort are required for customs, the Garda and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  It can then make an application to the EU to be upgraded to border inspection port status and then get tier 1 status.</p>  <p>  There is a great deal of work to be done in Rosslare Europort to make it suitable to deal with the impact of Brexit, as the required work has not been done to date.  If we lose access to the UK land bridge for the transport of roll-on, roll-off freight, Rosslare Europort will be the only game in town.  We can send freight through any port in the country but for the movement of perishable, pharmaceutical and agricultural goods transported by the drivers of trucks direct to the Continent, Rosslare will be the only game in town.</p></speech>

All contingencies are being prepared for in the event of Brexit.  It would not be correct to spell all of them out here in public, and I do not believe the Deputy would expect me to do that.  However, he can be rest assured that that includes Rosslare Europort and Dublin Port.</p>  <p>  My Department has been engaging with Rosslare Europort not just about Brexit but also about the land bridge and how that will affect that port as well.  The Irish Maritime Development Office, in conjunction with my Department, has undertaken a study into the use of the UK land bridge by the Irish road transport industry, importers and exporters.  The report, which was published recently, established the volume of traffic currently using the UK as a land bridge to the rest of Europe, the potential consequences that Brexit will have on land bridge usage and the various alternative options that may be viable.  As I said to the Deputy, many of those involved in Rosslare Europort are looking at opportunities as well as the difficulties that will be encountered.</p></speech>

There are two separate sources for funding of cycling infrastructure within my Department.  The tourism development division provides funding for greenway construction while the public transport investment division provides funding to the National Transport Authority, NTA, for the provision of cycling infrastructure, including greenways, within the greater Dublin area and the regional cities of Cork, Waterford, Limerick and Galway.</p>  <p>  I have secured a substantial increase in funding for all forms of cycling and walking infrastructure investment over the coming years. This includes &euro;110 million specifically dedicated to cycling and walking infrastructure in our major urban areas; &euro;135 million for sustainable urban transport measures; and &euro;750 million towards the BusConnects programme in Dublin, which will include the delivery of around 200 km of segregated cycling lanes, where possible.</p>  <p>  I am also providing &euro;53 million to support the development of new greenways up to 2021 in more rural areas, in line with the greenways strategy published earlier this year.</p>  <p>  As can be seen, these are multi-annual capital expenditure programmes which will positively assist with the better development and provision of cycling and walking infrastructure across the State.</p>  <p>  In addition to these infrastructure measures, my Department also provides funding to the NTA in relation to behavioural change programmes and to Cycling Ireland to develop the national cycle training standard Cycle Right, which was first rolled out in January 2017 and is expected to have trained approximately 20,000 primary school students this year.</p>  <p>  In relation to cycling facilities specifically, the NTA has statutory responsibility to secure or provide cycling infrastructure in the State.  I have, therefore, referred the Deputy's question to the NTA for a more detailed reply.</p>  <p>  With regard to the funding provided from my tourism development division, in 2018, &euro;3,650,000 was allocated for greenways.  As there was no open funding call at the time, and there were no new projects commencing this year, this allocation was for ongoing projects that were funded by my Department in previous years.  To date, &euro;3,256,402 of this allocation has been spent in 2018.</p></reply>

Do I take it that the total State investment in greenways and dedicated cycle ways this year across the 30 local authorities is only &euro;3.65 million, which is the equivalent of approximately &euro;100,000 per local authority - it is nothing - and the expenditure is even less?  Can he confirm that is all that has been spent on greenways and cycling infrastructure, despite all the talk of plans for years?  When will we get something delivered in that regard?</p></speech>

The Deputy said derisively that only &euro;3.6 million was allocated this year, but what does he say about the &euro;53 million which is available for greenways from 2019 to 2023?  The current application form for that was issued in August and the application process closed on 30 November 2018.  He should not dismiss that.  The Deputy plucked figures out of the air which are convenient to him but &euro;53 million is the amount that will be given, and that process is already in train.  It is wrong for him to say we have not spent enough this year without acknowledging that &euro;53 million and that there is a commitment to greenways in the Deputy's area as well as others.  It would be far more laudable if he said, "Thank God the Minister is embarking on a great adventure with greenways".  Greenways have been a great success.</p></speech>

Some &euro;285 million in funding has been allocated toward funding our PSO services in 2018.</p>  <p>  International experience indicates that introducing competitive tension into our PSO bus market, that is, a mixture of direct award and then competitively tendered contracts, should allow us to capture potential benefits as regards value in the use of taxpayers' money in securing the provision of PSO services.</p>  <p>  It is well-recognised that good public transport is a key enabler of both social inclusion and economic progress and opening up the bus market forms part of the Government's commitment to improving our public transport system and services.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that neither Dublin Bus nor Bus &Eacute;ireann is being privatised.  Competitive tendering is not privatisation, as nothing is being sold, services are not being deregulated and control remains with the NTA.</p>  <p>  We are placing passengers at the centre of our public transport policy and the recent arrival of Go Ahead into the bus market introduces competitive tendering, not privatisation, and encourages everybody to focus on his or her customer's needs.  It also encourages innovation and improvements to service quality for bus passengers.</p>  <p>  I remind the Deputy that all public transport services, whether they are provided by direct award contracts or through competitive tender, will continue to be regulated by the NTA in order that Leap, free travel pass, real-time information, etc., will all continue to operate on these services and fares will continue to be regulated by NTA.</p>  <p>  The NTA has the statutory responsibility to award PSO contracts and to determine the appropriate mix of directly awarded and competitively tendered PSO services.

The Minister could amend the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008 to stop further competitive tendering so that when this 10% tender won by Go Ahead next goes to tender, serious consideration could be given to the competitive tendering of Bus &Eacute;ireann.  In this case, Bus &Eacute;ireann under bid the Go Ahead company by &euro;3 million, had the staff and had good pay and working conditions.  The assaults on drivers is an aspect of conditions that the company can improve.  Certainly, the Minister can intervene in a way that directs the NTA to change what it is doing.</p>  <p>  The Minister must bear in mind that drivers start at &euro;28,000 in Go Ahead.  Their maximum, at &euro;32,000, is &euro;14,000 less than Dublin Bus drivers earn.  Their conditions are different.

I keep being accused by Members of having some sort of privatisation agenda.  What is happening here is that there has been competitive tendering.  Routes have gone out to tender and, as the Deputy will be aware, the incumbent is entitled to bid for those routes.  The incumbents bid for those routes.  In certain cases, the incumbent, Dublin Bus or Bus &Eacute;ireann, has won those bids.  In others, it has not, but that is what competitive tendering is about.  It is absurd to suggest there is some sort of a privatisation agenda when Dublin Bus or Bus &Eacute;ireann wins the competitive tender.  We only want to do the best for the customer, the taxpayer and the staff.</p></speech>

It is the words used.  The Minister spoke of the "PSO bus market".  We do not have a bus market.  Our public transport service needs to be protected, developed and funded, and needs more buses on routes, which is important as the cuts that have been made since the austerity years.  More buses are needed on our streets.  That determines the thinking behind this and the NTA's thinking as well.  We must get away from thinking of the PSO bus market.</p>  <p>  We must make the point repeatedly that the Government has a public service obligation to provide public transport.  It is crucial to climate change and in trying to get people out of their cars to have a proper, well-funded and well-run public transport system to serve the people of this city and the country.</p></speech>

This allocation will be invested in public transport infrastructure and services, cycling and walking initiatives and other measures designed to reduce our carbon footprint.</p>  <p>  The framework for this significantly enhanced level of funding is of course the national development plan, which outlines a number of significant measures designed to support sustainable mobility.  These measures include BusConnects in all major cities, MetroLink, DART expansion and increased funding for the heavy rail network generally.</p>  <p>  In 2019 we will see expanded PSO bus fleets through the provision of around 65 additional buses to the bus fleet in Dublin alone, while we will also see around 85 older buses replaced by more modern and environmentally friendly buses as part of the bus replacement programme.  This order also represents the last diesel-only order as, from 2019 onwards, the NTA will end the purchase of diesel-only buses for the urban PSO bus fleets.  In support of that move, a comprehensive series of low-emission bus trials has just commenced in Dublin, with support from the green public transport fund and from multiple agencies, including the National Transport Authority, Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann.  It is expected that the trials will conclude in April 2019.  A final report will be produced which will further inform the best lower-emission option, or options, for our PSO services in the greater Dublin area and the regional cities. </p>  <p>  Next year will also see consultations continue on the BusConnects Dublin programme with a second round of public consultation on the proposed new bus network and consultations continuing all through the first half of the year on the proposed new bus and cycle lanes.  BusConnects is a significant programme, with an allocation of &euro;2.4 billion over the lifetime of the national development plan, and will deliver improved journey times and expanded services that will benefit tens of millions of passenger journeys each year.  In 2019, we will also continue to plan for the delivery of MetroLink.</p></speech>

For example, there is a major shortage of rolling stock, which the Minister knows is one of the major reasons we have had chaos, confusion and serious and dangerous overcrowding on the north-side DART and west-side commuter lines.  He dodged key decisions, for example in regard to the equalisation of diesel and petrol and the provision of significant sums for green infrastructure.  Aviation has been a major contributor to carbon emissions over the years, and its contribution is growing.  I noticed Ryanair now asks its passengers to make a contribution to deal with their carbon footprint.  Nonetheless, the Government has not examined the issue of kerosine.  There has been insufficient progress on the rolling out of an electric vehicle network.  On a range of areas, all the Minister has done is mark time; he has done nothing significant.</p></speech>

On electric vehicles, the Deputy is quite right that they have been very disappointing to some extent.  Certainly up to this year, they were very disappointing but the Deputy will be aware that the number is now rocketing.  Admittedly, this is from a low base but the number is rising very fast and we are very optimistic that electric vehicles will become a far more common and successful product.  We are going to buy into them in a big way; we have to.  The incentives we have produced have sent numbers rising very quickly.</p>  <p>  On the other points, the Deputy has not given the Government due credit.  BusConnects, MetroLink, the DART expansion, the work on the Royal Canal and the Dodder, and the greenway from Clontarf, near the Deputy's constituency, to the city centre all involve clean transport.</p></speech>

Meath has a population that is now approaching 250,000.  It is the fastest growing population in the country.  Meath is now one of the most populous counties.  It has the highest number of commuters per capita.  The majority of workers this morning left the county to go to work.  That happens in no other county in the country.  Meath is unique in that regard.  Meath residents commute farther than commuters from any other county, yet Navan is the biggest town in the country without a rail line.  When will the rail line to Meath be built?</p></reply>

I believe it was raised before.  I wish the Deputy well in his new venture.  I welcome the fact that he has not lost sight of the home base while doing what he has to do.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Navan corridor, or M3 corridor, is currently served by a commuter rail service that commences at M3 Parkway and serves Dunboyne before continuing through to Docklands.  The service also allows for interchange with Maynooth line services at Clonsilla.  Importantly, the service also benefits from two park-and-ride sites, with 1,200 parking spaces available at M3 Parkway and 300 at Dunboyne.  These park-and-ride sites broaden the reach of the service and allow for people who might not live in the immediate vicinity of either station to make use of the service.</p>  <p>  In 2016, the NTA published its statutory transport strategy for the greater Dublin area, in which the issue of a rail link to Navan was considered.  The strategy states that based on current population and employment forecasts, the level of travel demand between Navan, Dunshaughlin and various stations to the city centre is insufficient to justify the development of a high-capacity rail link at the current time.  Instead, the strategy proposes an enhanced bus service along the corridor and the development of a bus hub in Navan.  In addition, the strategy also proposes enhanced bus services on the N2 corridor.</p>  <p>  Late last year, Bus &Eacute;ireann announced new services along the M3 corridor, known as the NX service, which starts in Navan and is scheduled to operate every 20 minutes during the day.  While I acknowledge that the introduction of the new service has not been without problems, I believe the provision of an all-day service every 20 minutes operated by double decker coaches does represent a step forward in terms of public transport capacity on the route.</p>  <p>  Meath County Council, in collaboration with the NTA, is currently progressing the development of a bus hub as provided for by the transport strategy.  Importantly, the transport strategy clearly states that the issue of a rail link to Navan should be kept under review, taking into account the scale of new and planned development along the route.  The strategy also clearly states that the corridor previously identified for a Navan rail link should be protected from development.</p></speech>

Anybody using the M3 or roads such as the M50 will know they are chock-a-block from 7 a.m.  If an accident occurs on those roads, the whole system becomes snarled up.  This is a massive difficulty for commuters.  Over the past ten years, we have had one of the lowest levels of expenditure on infrastructure in the European Union, and that has had its effect.  Many are living in commuter hell.  Many businesses are pouring millions of euro down the drain owing to commuters getting stuck in traffic jams.</p><p>This is also hurting people financially.  People living in the west of my county are spending approximately &euro;2,500 per year on tolls in addition to what it costs to run a car in the first instance.  The Minister stated that the demand is not there for the service.  Ten years ago, however, Fine Gael had a plan to build a rail line to Meath.  It took that plan off the table and stated that there was not enough money in the Exchequer to build the line.  Exchequer spending is back to 2008 levels so the money is there and the demand exists.  I ask the Minister to ensure that this key infrastructure is built soon.</p></speech>

Therefore, we must do everything possible to limit the damage through thorough preparations in order to make the country infrastructure-ready, particularly at ports and airports.  We must also make interventions to assist companies to deal with fluctuations in sterling and to diversify and reduce their dependence on the UK market.  Yesterday, I raised here a number of questions with the Taoiseach on our state of preparedness for a no-deal Brexit or even an orderly Brexit, which is what we hope for.  According to the Government's data and that of its agencies, however, too many companies with the potential to suffer the greatest impact remain without Brexit plans or have not engaged sufficiently with the various Brexit-preparedness initiatives.  The AIB Brexit sentiment survey of 1 November indicates that a substantial number of companies have simply not engaged and do not have any Brexit plan.  In fact, the proportion of exporting companies with plans for Brexit is as low as 30%, which must be of huge concern.</p><p>I note the 3,000 applications for positions with Customs and Excise.  Can the Taoiseach say how many customs officials will be in place on 29 March and working at their desks?  The Dutch Government has already hired 1,000 customs officials.  Can the Taoiseach outline the work required on infrastructure at our ports and airports?  I draw his attention to an article published in the <i>Irish Examiner</i>on 28 November 2018 and setting out the content of a leaked memorandum which had been brought to Government by the T&aacute;naiste.  The memorandum warned that a variety of challenges had arisen with the potential to impact on the country's capacity to be Brexit-ready.  The memorandum sets out risks associated with site acquisition, potential lease-break rental options, statutory planning, procurement and construction issues at the ports and airports which will be most affected by Brexit.  Ministers were warned that the scale of the problem facing the State is exceptional.  The memorandum states, &quot;In the case of Brexit, the scale and likely cost of infrastructure required, and the short time frame required to gear up for Brexit are exceptional and fall well beyond the routine demands of the State, especially in the case of our ports.&quot;  The memorandum further warns Ministers of detailed plans on the upgrading of Rosslare Harbour, Dublin Airport and Dublin Port.  Significant issues were identified regarding the capacity of Rosslare to be ready by 29 March 2019.  The memorandum also details specific site issues at Rosslare.</p><p>A number of issues arise.  I will make the same point I made yesterday.  There has been a general tendency on the part of the Government to be coy and to withhold information from the public on contingency planning for Brexit, specifically a no-deal Brexit, on the apparent basis that it would cause undue panic.  I disagree with that view and believe the public should be made fully aware of all the implications of Brexit, irrespective of the scenario that ultimately emerges.  The challenges and lack of preparation for Brexit should be shared with the public in full.  We should not have to rely on the high standard of investigative journalism so evident in the <i>Irish Examiner</i>to make this basic information available.  I ask the Taoiseach to commit to the publication of a detailed plan, including timelines, costs and challenges at our ports and airports, and to publish it without delay.</p></speech>

He is correct to say Brexit, particularly a no-deal Brexit, will be damaging for our economy.  However, it is worth noting the ESRI projections released this morning.  The ESRI states:</p><blockquote>The Irish economy looks set to register another exceptional performance in 2018; employment is growing at 3 per cent with taxation receipts across most headings also experiencing better than expected returns.  The ESRI&rsquo;s latest Quarterly Economic Commentary states that GDP is expected to grow by 8.2 per cent in 2018, followed by 4.2 per cent growth in 2019 [...] Our forecasts for 2019 are subject to the technical assumption that the UK's continued membership in the EU will effectively remain in place after March 2019.  However, the economy faces an unprecedented degree of uncertainty in 2019; the outcome of the Brexit process, combined with the possibility of increased international trade tensions, could have significant implications for the economy&rsquo;s performance in the new year.  In the Commentary, we illustrate how a Brexit scenario, where WTO tariffs would apply, could almost halve the growth outlook in 2019.</blockquote><p>As such, the analysis of the ESRI is that even in the event of a hard Brexit in which World Trade Organization, WTO, tariffs apply, the economy would still grow next year, although the rate of that growth would be slower.  The economy would not go into recession.  It is a very reassuring analysis and projection from the ESRI, but it is something we cannot take for granted.  The ESRI projection that the Irish economy will grow, albeit at a slower rate, is because our economy is so strong that it will continue to grow and not go into recession even in the event of a hard Brexit next year.  Even so, we cannot take anything for granted or assume that the ESRI projections are necessarily correct.</p><p>This morning, I had the privilege to open the new European headquarters of Barclays Bank on the site where the Passport Office used to be located.  the road, the new headquarters of Barclays Bank.  This means that every branch in Europe will now be a branch of Barclays Bank Ireland on Molesworth Street.  The bank is going to employ 400 people when fully staffed and will have a balance sheet of &euro;250 billion based here in Dublin.  This is an example of what is happening in the wider economy.  While there are huge downsides to Brexit, particularly for SMEs and the agrifood sector, money and jobs are also coming into the country because people know Ireland is a good place to do business.  That is because our economy is strong, we have a good education system, a favourable tax regime for companies, pro-enterprise policies and a political consensus in that regard across the House and because we know our position is at the heart of Europe no matter what happens anywhere else.</p></speech>

I have read the ESRI report and am fully aware of our open, foreign direct investment-based economy, which has been successful and effective for 40 years.  Our decision to join the European Union is one about which I have always been enthusiastic as one of the great game-changers historically for Irish society.  Certainly, I would not be complacent about a WTO-type Brexit and I consider that the impact for the agrifood section in particular will be very difficult.  There is no point pretending.  It will be very difficult for the Border counties.  The Government's own economic analysis from the Department of Finance and the Copenhagen report point to severe difficulties for the agrifood sector and the Border counties.  My basic question to the Taoiseach related to the number of customs officials who will be in place by 29 March 2019.  I asked if he would publish a detailed plan outlining the challenges, work to be done, timelines for doing it and the cost of works at Dublin Port, Rosslare Harbour and our airports.</p><p>Will the Taoiseach confirm that the detail and content of the Government memo that was brought by the T&aacute;naiste and revealed in the <i>Irish Examiner</i>on 28 November truly reflects the case?</p></speech>

Generally speaking, IDA firms know what they are doing.  They are the multinationals which invest here in Ireland.  We need to improve preparedness, however, particularly among small and medium enterprises, SMEs, that export to the United Kingdom.  Seminars are available.  They are happening all over the country and assist businesses to become Brexit-ready.  The Deputy will have heard some of the advertisements on the radio prompting people in business to do exactly that.  Customs training is available and we have also made low-cost loans available to business.</p>  <p>  On the Deputy's question about customs officials, we have a panel of 3,000 people who have applied to be customs officials.  A minimum of 200 will be in place in March but that can be increased to a much greater number should we find ourselves in a hard Brexit, no deal scenario. The comparisons with Holland, and with Rotterdam in particular, are not valid.  Rotterdam is a massive port which handles ten times as much trade as our Irish ports, so obviously the numbers in Rotterdam are going to be much greater than those required in Dublin and Rosslare.</p>  <p>  In terms of making information public, we are very happy to give the Deputy full briefings and information through the Brexit stakeholders' group.  We will publish plans, but it must be borne in mind that this situation is still evolving.  Brexit planning happens on two levels.  Most of it is led at a European level from Brussels.  Some 70 notices have been issued already.  The final seminar at European level will only happen on 10 January.  Our domestic preparedness comes in under that.  Any plans we produced now would have changed again by the middle of January.  We will do that.</p></speech>

I spelled out to her the need to ensure that the commitments agreed in last December's joint report by British and EU negotiators are honoured.  That means no hardening of the Border on the island of Ireland, that citizens' rights are protected, and that the Good Friday Agreement is upheld in its entirety.</p>  <p>  In December the Taoiseach said that he had a cast-iron guarantee.  He said that he had "achieved what we sought to achieve" in respect of avoiding a hard border.  He said what we had was "rock solid" and "politically bulletproof".  In the midst of the deepening crisis at Westminster I am afraid to say that those words no longer hold.  On Monday Mrs. May shelved her plan to hold a vote on the withdrawal agreement at Westminster and today she faces a vote of no confidence in her leadership.  That is a matter for herself.  What we need to be concerned with and what is our business is ploughing our furrow.  </p>  <p>  On the concerns around our ports and around investment in them, I am glad that the needs of Rosslare have finally dawned on the Taoiseach.  The need for sectoral planning is unanswerable.  We also now need to look at any prospect of a no deal scenario or crash come March.  I will emphasise that this is not something anybody here, including Sinn F&eacute;in in particular, wants to see.  When I and others asked the Taoiseach yesterday about contingency planning for a crash scenario, he said "preparations involve a number of elements including the hiring of staff such as customs' staff, veterinary inspectors [and] environmental health inspectors".  That is all very well and good but, as we all know, a crash-out Brexit would be catastrophic for our island.  It would rupture our economy, our social fabric, and our peace accords.  The contingency planning required therefore goes well beyond the recruitment of additional officials.  </p>  <p>  I reminded Mrs. May last night that, in the event of a no deal situation arising, it is the strong view of Sinn F&eacute;in that a referendum on unity must be advanced as a matter of urgency and priority.  Of course she disagrees with that because she is a unionist.  That is fair enough, but the Taoiseach is Head of Government here.  He should accept that Irish unity is the logical, sensible option to avoid the calamity of a crash or no deal scenario and everything that would entail for our island in the short and long term.  I put it to the Taoiseach that in a situation in which the Good Friday Agreement is to be disregarded, a crash situation, we need to go back to the agreement and its provisions for a referendum on Irish unity.  Giving the people their say would be the ultimate contingency plan.</p></speech>

I also said that we had to be vigilant and that we would be.  We have been.  I also said that the next step was to turn that joint report we agreed last December into a legally binding withdrawal agreement.  For months and months I heard critics in this House tell me and the Government I lead that we oversold the deal that was made in December.  We did not.  It, including the Irish protocol, was translated faithfully into the legal text of the withdrawal agreement as we promised would happen.  The next step is to secure ratification by Westminster and the European Parliament.  That is still possible.  That is what we are working on now.  We will have a meeting of the European Council on Thursday and Friday.  It will be an opportunity to engage with Prime Minister May and for me to speak to my colleagues.  Indeed I will be taking a call from President Juncker later today to see what assurances we can give the United Kingdom Parliament that might assist it in ratifying the withdrawal agreement.  That cannot mean a change in the substance of that agreement, including the substance of the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, however.  That is what we are going to work towards.</p>  <p>  I do not believe that now is the time for us to start talking about Border polls.  I understand the perspective of the Deputy's party, which is committed to the territorial unity of this island.  That is an aspiration that most of us in this House share but this is not the time to go about it.  There are people in Northern Ireland who know that the backstop is a good deal for them.  That is why it is being supported by business, farmers and many civil society organisations in Northern Ireland.  To now inject a constitutional dimension into this debate would be destructive and disruptive because there are people who are arguing against this agreement precisely because they believe that having special arrangements around regulations for goods somehow weakens the union between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.  We know that is not the case.  There are many special arrangements for Northern Ireland already.  In so many areas, from social policy through to agricultural regulations, Northern Ireland is already different from Great Britain.  Another example is that, before the institutions were brought down, they were seeking autonomy over corporation tax.  Northern Ireland can have differences and still be part of the United Kingdom just as there are differences between all the countries in the European Union.  I really do not believe that stirring up tensions in Northern Ireland or turning this issue into one of orange versus green is at all helpful at this time.</p></speech>

As he well knows, that is something which we have not done.  In fact, considerable and very fruitful efforts have been made to ensure cross-community and cross-party support for a consensus against Brexit in the North.  Brexit is a British Tory invention.  All this disruption and tension is not of our making or of the making of anyone in this House.  It is of the making of the Tories across the water.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach talks about relying on a vote at Westminster and the safe passage of the withdrawal agreement.  That may or may not occur.  Let me emphasise again that I want to see a crash no more than the Taoiseach does.  However, I also want to say to the Taoiseach, as Head of Government with the responsibility to advance Irish national interests and to protect everyone on this island, North and South, east and west, that he now has to plan and prepare for such an unfortunate scenario with eyes wide open.  Rather than evading his responsibilities by talking up disruption or disruptive forces, he needs to look this dilemma squarely in the eye.</p><p>If there is a no-deal Brexit, all bets are off as regards the Good Friday Agreement.  All bets are off in terms of economic prosperity, social cohesion and solidarity.  Rather than advancing this plan as something that is hostile to any of our people, the Taoiseach needs to understand it as an absolute necessity.  In the event of a crash, we need a strong, robust plan B.  The only viable plan B is the removal of the Border &ndash; the removal of the gash across our island.  Has the Taoiseach planned for this contingency?  Are plans under way?  People need to hear reassuring words from him that he is planning in accordance with the Good Friday Agreement to allow people the opportunity to make a call, ultimately, perhaps between the union with Britain and membership of the European Union?</p></speech>

Many young children are living there, looking forward to Santa coming, but before Christmas all those families have been issued with notices to quit.  The landlord is not a small accidental landlord but a businessman with multiple properties.  Yesterday, he told the tenants they were great tenants but said the market dictates the rent.  The ground for eviction is the supposed need for substantial refurbishment.  In reality, the tenants and the landlord know - I  presume everyone here knows this and has seen it happen time and again - that this is yet another renoviction, something that deserves a word for itself now because it is so widespread, with the need for refurbishment used as a pretext to kick out tenants and hike up rents.</p>  <p>  If these tenants are evicted, they will mostly be evicted into homelessness.  The Dublin Renters' Union and Solidarity have been assisting them in preparing to oppose any evictions.  The Anti-Evictions Bill, which we will debate tonight and vote on tomorrow, would stop evictions like this taking place.  Every Deputy will have a choice to take the side of landlords like that or take the side of the tenants.  The vast majority of homelessness is being caused by evictions from the private rented sector and that is just the sharpest end of the conditions that face tenants.  </p>  <p>  Since the Government took office, rents in cities have increased by more than 30%.  Average rent nationally is more than &euro;1,300 a month and when combined with low pay and precarity, one in seven tenants now faces consistent poverty.  The picture, unfortunately, was similar two years ago in January 2017 when we moved our previous Anti-Evictions Bill.  That Bill was defeated by the casting vote of the Ceann Comhairle.  It would have been passed were it not for the votes of the many landlords in this D&aacute;il who voted against it.  If it had been implemented then, 2,000 families who faced eviction in 2017 on the grounds of sale of property would have been protected.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach's Government voted against that Bill.  Two years on, with landlords continuing to use grounds of sale and renovation to evict tenants, will the Government vote against an anti-evictions Bill again?  Will Fianna F&aacute;il sit on the fence and abstain again?  At the very least, does the Taoiseach agree that the one in four Deputies who are landlords should recuse themselves from voting on this Bill because of a clear conflict of interest?  That conflict of interest goes much deeper, of course, than their personal status as landlords.  It is related to the commitment of the establishment parties to the capitalist system and the free market in housing, which allows landlords to profit massively from a crisis facing tenants and others.  It means that tenants such as those on the North Circular Road and all those affected by the housing crisis have no choice but to organise for a ban on evictions, proper rent controls and the building of public and genuinely affordable housing.</p></speech>

Members are able to make the distinction between what is a personal interest and what is a public interest and we all act in the public interest.</p>  <p>  I am not familiar with the particular building about which the Deputy spoke but I acknowledge we need to act once again to strengthen tenants' rights.  Hundreds of thousands of people in Ireland rent the properties in which they live and we have strengthened their rights in recent years, but we need to take further actions, particularly to deal with landlords who abuse the renovation provisions to empty properties and jack-up rents.  </p>  <p>  The rent Bill, providing additional rights to renters and tenants, was approved by Cabinet yesterday.  It has four major provisions: first, the introduction of a rent register so that people can see what rents are being charged in the area in which they live; second, extending the notice-to-quit period so that people who are asked to leave the house that they are renting get much more time to find a new place to rent; third, a legal definition of "substantial renovation" to end renovictions and bogus renovations such as the ones the Deputy described; and, fourth, additional powers for the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, to enforce existing laws and these new laws.  This is legislation the Government is bringing forward and I sincerely hope the Deputy&rsquo;s party will vote for it.  I would welcome an indication from him as to whether he will do so.</p></speech>

Perhaps we could get that first and when the Government publishes its Bill, we will respond to it.  Our Bill proposes to ban evictions on the grounds of sale which would mean, as is the case in many European countries, that sale would have to take place with tenants <i>in situ</i>.  It would ban evictions on the grounds of renovations.  In the case of a landlord saying he or she has to evict because he or she or a family member is moving in, six months' rent would have to be paid in compensation.  Those are the kind of measures needed to guarantee the rights and circumstances of tenants.</p><p>On the question of personal interest versus public interest, does the Taoiseach not see it as significant that 4% of people in society as a whole are landlords?  In this House, and within the Cabinet, 25% are landlords.  Landlords are massively over-represented here.  That is not just a question of personal interest and motivation, although one would be blind to believe those factors do not affect people, but it is a question of ideology.  This Government is a landlords&rsquo; Government.  It is the reason it passed a landlords&rsquo; budget, and the reason it pays lipservice to the idea of tenants and the reason I suspect, despite the Taoiseach saying he has not seen the Bill yet, that it will oppose it.</p><p>The Taoiseach will allow families such as those on North Circular Road to continue to face homelessness and he will turn a blind eye to it while the profits of landlords shoot through the roof.</p></speech>

In those two years, 8,340 people gained employment, a success rate of 25%.  Those who gained full-time employment amounted to 6,111 people or 18% of the total figure, while those who gained part-time employment made up 4% of the total.  When one looks closely and measures the chances of someone gaining full-time employment under JobPath as opposed to of their own accord, the numbers are very interesting.  The most recent figures for 2016 show that JobPath only helped a further 2% of individuals to gain full-time employment.  Figures for people who gain part-time work improve.  Part-time work is often seasonal, precarious and has low wages.  The State often helps to subsidise income through the family income supplement, part-time jobseeker's benefit and jobseeker's allowance.  Why do we continue to pay a private company which has only served to continue the situation of income insecurity for people who the State must subsidise anyway?</p><p>I would like to read an excerpt from a letter I was given in Donegal about a person's experience with a company, People 1st.  He is so intimidated by the service that he wishes to remain anonymous.  It reads:</p><blockquote>I am a client of People 1st and I have found my time there to be a very difficult one.  The advisors put a lot of pressure on me.  I feel extremely stressed, and made feel worthless.  I try very hard to find employment but I can&rsquo;t seem to get any work.  I find my advisor to be very disrespectful, discouraging and not understanding of my circumstances.  Although I have a third level qualification my advisor seems to put across that I am lazy.  I have approached the Manager on a few occasions, regarding my complaints however it is not dealt with.</blockquote><p>The letter aptly describes the direct consequences privatisation of our State services is having on vulnerable people across the country.  The profit-driven model of these private companies applies unnecessary pressure to people.  This should be treated as a State service, yet the Government paid these companies &euro;58.5 million last year.  That is money which could be spent on 500 houses in Donegal, five or six schools, or indeed reinstating social welfare income supports for part-time and seasonal workers to the 2012 levels across the State.  The Government is blinded by the notion of private services being more efficient when the figures clearly show that this is not the case.  Will the Taoiseach shut down JobPath and instead reinvest the money into State services, moving away from the encroaching privatisation of social service provision in this country?</p></speech>

Some 15% of people were unemployed and people were being forced to emigrate again.  We have net migration now, with more Irish citizens coming home than are leaving, and unemployment at approximately 5%.  We will soon reach full employment, the point at which there is a job in Ireland for everyone who genuinely wants one.  We are almost there.  That is enormous progress in only a few years.</p>  <p>  That did not happen by accident.  A remarkable thing about Ireland's economic recovery is that we had jobs growth and a fall in unemployment almost from the start of the recovery.  Most countries would see the economy recover first with jobs coming later and unemployment falling thereafter.  That happened because a decision was taken by the last Government, of which I was a member, with Fine Gael and the Labour Party, to adopt an activist approach to getting people back to work.  That is why the Intreo model was set up and why JobPath was contracted by my constituency colleague, Deputy Burton.  That is why we continue to support the local employment schemes.</p>  <p>  Some people will just find a job on their own but others need help, support, encouragement and training.  That is done through different mechanisms.  Intreo is the in-house service provided by the excellent staff of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection around the country.  JobPath is outsourced because the Department did not have the capacity at the time of mass unemployment to do all the work.  There are also the local employment schemes around the country.  These mechanisms have been successful.  The JobPath model is a payment by results model.  Companies get a registration fee but beyond that they are only paid if the person they are working with enters gainful employment and stays in it for more than three months.</p>  <p>  There is a contract.  Terminating any contract with any company involves significant costs and penalties for the taxpayer.  We are certainly not going to cancel any such contracts.  We are entering a different phase in our economy where we are heading towards full employment so obviously services such as JobPath may not be needed in the future but that is an assessment that the Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty, will have to make.  In future, the focus will be less on people who are unemployed because unemployment is down so far, and more on activating and encouraging into the labour market people who are not on jobseeker's benefit or jobseeker's allowance.</p>  <p>  I encourage anyone who has a complaint to make that complaint to the provider and if he or she is not satisfied with the response, he or she can complain to the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, which will investigate it.  When one looks at the tens or hundreds of thousands of people who have been involved in the various programmes that the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection runs, the percentage of complaints is reassuringly low.</p></speech>

That is welcome.  Despite the Government spending &euro;58.5 million on JobPath last year, it is not creating any significant extra jobs beyond what people are getting themselves.  The data from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection show that.  Those are the figures the Government has.  We spent &euro;58.5 million to have 4% more jobs created.  That is not good value for money to me, and even the Government, having seen how the private sector works, would surely think that is not good value for money and that it does not work.  This system is not working, it has not worked and the Taoiseach should accept that it has not worked.  It will not work in the future either.  People will find jobs if they get the support and the staff are already in the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to help and support those people.  The Government does not need to privatise it so why does it continue to do so?</p></speech>

There are many staff in our Intreo offices around the country.  When unemployment was three times what it is now, the Department and Government did not have the staff.  That is why JobPath was brought in as an additional provider to provide these services to assist people to get into employment.  The context is now changing and we need to use those models in other areas.  We used a similar model with the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, to reduce waiting lists significantly in areas in the public health service where we do not have capacity.</p><p>Waiting lists for hospital procedures on hips, eyes, knees and cataracts and for angiograms have fallen every month for almost a year and half.  They are now lower than they were when the Government came to office because we used the private sector to augment our public services.  It makes sense to do that on occasion.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-12-12a.230" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1371" speakername="Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l" time="12:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018121200016#O00700"><p>Before calling on Members to offer their tributes to our two departed former colleagues, I would like to welcome the families of Paddy Harte and Monica Barnes to the Distinguished Visitors Gallery, including Paddy's widow, Rosaleen; his sons, Paddy, Garrett, Emmett and Jimmy; his daughters Mary, Anne and R&oacute;is&iacute;n; and Jimmy's wife.  So too, is Monica's daughter Sarah and her granddaughter Ailbhe.  You are all very welcome.  This is a sad day for you all but I hope that the support and memories that are shared here in Leinster House will serve to support you as we pay tribute to two much respected and distinguished former Members.</p>  <p>  Paddy Harte often tilled a lonely piece of rugged Donegal furrow in his search for dialogue and lasting peace on our island.  He was a generous public representative and a man of political courage and determination, often going against the political grain to extend the hand of friendship across a divided land.  We often forget how many sacrifices, ideological, philosophical and political had to made in the long barb-strewn path to peace on this troubled land.  Paddy Harte walked a step ahead of history and we owe him a debt of thanks for the courageous use of his role as a legislator to make a real and lasting difference to the lives of Irish men and Irish women.  It is particularly good to see Paddy's son, Jimmy, with us here today.</p>  <p>  Monica Barnes represented D&uacute;n Laoghaire for many years, but also typified a long and distinguished tradition within Fine Gael of social activism and progressive practical steps to better the lives of men, women and children both in her south Dublin constituency and nationally.  I have spoken on a number of occasions this year at events marking 100 years since women's suffrage.  This right was won a mere four generations ago, which is shocking to remember.  The right to place a democratic mark on the ballot paper was won with a struggle not given generously by the men of 1918.  With dignity and tenacity, Monica carried on that struggle to see a fairer, more equal society, not only for women but for all Irish citizens.  Like Paddy, she often argued causes which did not have full or popular support at the time that she served in this Chamber but the strength of her conviction, coupled with the warmth of her personality and willingness to engage with all sides of the House, ensured that she was respected for her views and listened to by all, even those who differed radically with her.  It is a real strength of character to be able to disagree agreeably.  She was a skilled parliamentarian, fighting for many causes.  Personally, I think her greatest testament will be to continue the fight begun in 1918 when Countess Markievicz was elected to the House of Commons in Westminster and took her seat instead in the first D&aacute;il.  That work continues but we remember today Monica's crucial role in the fight for a better Ireland.</p>  <p>  Both Paddy and Monica served this House with distinction and fortitude.  As Ceann Comhairle, I offer my renewed condolences to their families, who should take great comfort in the patriotism shown by both Paddy and Monica.</p></speech>

They both helped us as a country to come to terms with our history and in doing so enabled us to build a better future.</p>  <p>  Paddy Harte was an architect of peace and reconciliation on our island, building bridges across communities.  His lasting achievement is the Island of Ireland Peace Park at Messines, made possible by working with people from different backgrounds, different perspectives and different traditions for a greater good.  It is a reminder of the shared history on our island and a symbol of hope for the future.  Paddy Harte helped us to decommission sectarian views about our history and educated us about how we can remember and commemorate the sacrifices of the past with honour.  It is remarkable that in a political career which spanned 36 years in this House and a short but successful stint as a Minister of State that nobody ever had a bad word to say about him.  He was a gentleman who always saw the good in others, an approach that helped dismantle barriers on both sides of the Border.  If things turned out differently, Paddy Harte might have spent his life as a successful butcher in Donegal but instead he served the people of Donegal north east a different way, by turning his own home into a railway station and always welcoming people who needed help.  Paddy Harte will be remembered as a patriot who reminded us that love of country does not require us to hate anyone else.  It is a lasting legacy.  Today, we remember his wife, Rosaleen, their children, Mary, Paddy, Anne, Jimmy, R&oacute;is&iacute;n, Eithne, Johnny, Garrett and Emmett and their 24 grandchildren and many friends.  Go nd&eacute;ana Dia tr&oacute;caire ar a anam.  N&iacute; bheidh a leith&eacute;id ann ar&iacute;s.</p>  <p>  In recent months, we have also paid tributes in this House to whistleblowers who stood up for the truth at great personal cost.  In many ways, Monica Barnes was a political whistleblower.  She was someone I knew personally and someone who called time on a culture that was, in her words, "bleak, guilt ridden, repressed".  Often she was criticised and sometimes she was harassed but she never wavered.  Monica Barnes led the way with courage and good humour, always polite, always seeking a better way.  She was a fearless campaigner for change in the way she championed women's rights and the way she demanded that care and compassion be shown to people in difficult situations.  She was a pioneer of social liberalism in my own party, a founding member of the Council for the Status of Women, a Senator, a Deputy faithfully representing the people of D&uacute;n Laoghaire and she was an inspiration for many people around the country, in particular young people and young women in Fine Gael and beyond.  </p>  <p>  I feel though that if she were with us here today she would not let us get away with nice tributes without acknowledging that we have still so much more to do.  We have much more to do before we realise her vision for Ireland and we will do that and remember that her courage and determination helped point the way for us.  Today, our sympathies are with her husband Bob, their daughters Sarah and Joanne, her sister Angela and brother Colm, as well as their grandchildren, extended family and friends.  We also remember her beloved son Paul, who sadly predeceased her.  </p>  <p>  Monica's family and friends can be proud of a true political pioneer who helped to make our country a much kinder, more modern and overall better place.  </p>  <p>  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a hanam d&iacute;lis. </p></speech>

Fear l&aacute;ch, l&aacute;idir, agus neamhsple&aacute;ch a bh&iacute; ann.  Thuig s&eacute; t&aacute;bhacht gach traidisi&uacute;n ar an oile&aacute;n seo.  D'oibrigh dian d&iacute;cheallach Domhnach is d&aacute;lach ar son mhuintir Dh&uacute;n na nGall, ar son mhuintir na t&iacute;re seo, agus chun s&iacute;och&aacute;in a chur ar bun ar an oile&aacute;n.</p>  <p>  Paddy Harte has left a lasting mark on Irish politics not only through his work as a Deputy representing the people of Donegal north east but as a builder of bridges.  As Fine Gael spokesperson on Northern Ireland he was a politician who engaged meaningfully with all traditions and people from all backgrounds.  In that respect, he was ahead of his time.  He dedicated much of his life to public service and he was a member of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann from 1961 to 1997, a span that encompassed the worst of the death and destruction in Northern Ireland.</p><p>He was Minister of State in the 1981 to 1982 Government in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, but he was not the type of politician who felt he needed ministerial status to make a contribution.  Paddy made a major contribution through his involvement with the former UDA chief, Mr. Glenn Barr, in promoting the recognition of Irish people who died during World War I, and I believe he will be best remembered for that.  He did this long before it was popular, and for the courage he showed in that regard he deserves our collective acclamation.  His resolve to progress this issue not only recognised the sacrifice that Irish soldiers made in the Great War but also led to the building of the Island of Ireland Peace Park and round tower in Belgium.  The work saw him awarded numerous accolades, including an honorary OBE and an honorary Doctorate of Laws from the National University of Ireland, as well as being named European of the Year in 1998.</p> <p> While he was a stalwart and steadfast member of Fine Gael, he was very much his own man.  Indeed, when violence broke out in Northern Ireland in 1969 he crossed the floor of the House and met the then Taoiseach, Mr. Jack Lynch, to give him his advice and ideas on the unfolding crisis.  It was this type of approach that won Paddy so many admirers on all sides of the House.  A proud Donegal man, an Ulster man and an Irish man, I again extend my condolences to Paddy's wife Rosaleen and his nine children.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam d&iacute;lis.</p> <p> Bean agus polaiteoir faoi leith ab ea Monica Barnes.  B&aacute; dhuine le prionsabail &iacute; a bh&iacute; chun tosaigh maidir le cearta sibhialta ginear&aacute;lta agus cearta sibhialta mn&aacute; na t&iacute;re seo ach go h&aacute;irithe.  Bh&iacute; s&iacute; tuisceanach, cean&uacute;il, agus gn&iacute;omhach in an-chuid feachtas le gl&uacute;inte anuas.  Monica Barnes was a courageous and outspoken voice in Irish politics at a time when progressive voices were few and far between.  She was, in many respects, ahead of her time and always thought outside the box.  She was a very proud feminist and was admired by many.  A co-founder of the Council for the Status of Women in 1973, now the National Women's Council of Ireland, she and Mary Robinson, Gemma Hussey and Nuala Fennell were among the trailblazers for advancing women's rights in the 1970s.  The liberal leadership of Garrett FitzGerald attracted her to Fine Gael and she was elected to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in November 1982.</p> <p> The following year she was one of two Fine Gael Deputies to oppose the wording of the legislation and the insertion of the eighth amendment in the Constitution.  Monica agreed with the advice of the then Attorney General, the late Peter Sutherland.  She was also a committed supporter of the 1986 referendum to remove the ban on divorce.  While the causes dear to her heart did not have much success in the 1980s she was never disheartened and she retained her open and optimistic outlook on life.  Although she advocated with passion for her beliefs she was never dismissive or intolerant of those with whom she disagreed.  I echo the words of the Ceann Comhairle, that she was most agreeable in disagreeing with people.  She was approachable, a very warm person and had a great sense of humour.</p> <p> Fearless yet courteous, she made friends across the political spectrum and the loss of her seat in 1992 was greeted with disappointment by many outside Fine Gael.  She never held ministerial office, although had she been a Deputy in 1994 when the rainbow Government took office it would have been hard to overlook her.  She returned for a final term to represent D&uacute;n Laoghaire in 1997 before retiring in 2002.  Sadly, she lost her son Paul to cancer the following year.  She never lost her commitment to the causes for which she was passionate and was all set to campaign to repeal the eighth amendment earlier this year.  It was not to be, however, and she passed away quietly and suddenly at home three weeks before the day of the referendum.  I have no doubt that she inspired many other women to enter political life.  This year we mark the centenary of women voting for the first time and Monica Barnes's life was a powerful example of what women can achieve in national life.</p> <p> Monica's family's grief can be tempered with pride in her great achievements in public life.  I offer my sincere sympathy and that of my party to her husband Bob, daughters Sarah and Joanne and her wider family, the Fine Gael Party.</p></speech>

On my own behalf and on behalf of Sinn F&eacute;in I extend sincere sympathies to the family and friends of former Teachta Paddy Harte, who passed away last January.  As has been said, Paddy had a lengthy career in the D&aacute;il, serving the people of his beloved Donegal for no less than 36 years from 1961 to 1997.  It is an incredible record.  During that time he served briefly as a Minister of State at the Department of Posts and Telegraphs from 1981 to 1982.  However, quite correctly, it is for his work on peace and reconciliation that Paddy will be best remembered, particularly his work in delivering the Island of Ireland Peace Park in Flanders which opened in 1998 and which commemorates all Irishmen who died during the First World War.  It is a place I was pleased and moved to visit.  It is a tribute to him.</p>  <p>  There is much on which Paddy and I would have disagreed, but I have no doubt that there are also many things on which we would have seen eye to eye.  In any event, his contribution to public life was immense.  I join others in extending sympathy and condolences to his loved ones, his wife Rosaleen, his nine children Mary, Paddy, Anne, Jimmy, R&oacute;is&iacute;n, Eithne, Johnny, Garrett and Emmett - a formidable clan - his other relatives and friends and his wider family and colleagues in Fine Gael.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a hanam d&iacute;lis.</p>  <p>  Ar&iacute;s ar mo shon f&eacute;in agus ar son Sinn F&eacute;in, ba mhaith liom comhbhr&oacute;n a dh&eacute;anamh le clann agus cairde iarTheachta Monica Barnes, a fuair b&aacute;s i m&iacute; Bealtaine.  I also extend deep sympathy and condolences to the family and friends of former Teachta, Monica Barnes, who passed away in May.  On the occasion of her passing I remarked in the House that she had always struck me as a very untypical member of Fine Gael, which was received as one might expect by her fellow members of Fine Gael.  She served in the House for a lengthy period from 1982 to 1992 and again from 1997 to 2002.  She was also briefly a Member of the Seanad in 1982.</p>  <p>  She was undoubtedly one of the most courageous feminist voices of her time and in Irish political history.  She was one of a small number of people who had the foresight, compassion and vision to stand against the eighth amendment when it was first proposed.  I never met Monica Barnes.  I wish I had as I really liked her.  I had great admiration for her, and her record of public service speaks for itself.  I recall as a young woman listening to her, watching her and being moved and inspired by her.  I join with others in extending sympathy and condolences to her husband Bob, her daughters Sarah and Joanne, her siblings, grandchildren, other relatives and friends, as well as her colleagues in Fine Gael.

At first glance, the two might have appeared to be very different people, and they were, but they shared extraordinary values, passionate views on what was right and passionate voices to articulate those views regardless of the opinion of their political party or the consensus.  They stood by what was right.  Those characteristics are truly important in public representatives.</p>  <p>  Paddy Harte could be described as a peacemaker, as the Ceann Comhairle said.  If one were to accord an attribute to any of us, to be called a peacemaker is among the highest accolades one could bestow.</p><p>Paddy was involved in making peace at a very human level.  It was not in broad structural terms; it was in building bridges and reconciling differences.  At his funeral it was said that his greatest legacy was the Island of Ireland Peace Park in Messines, Belgium, which was formally opened on 11 November 1998 by President Mary McAleese, Prince Albert of Belgium and Queen Elizabeth.  This was seen then as a turning point, not only in history but in the relationships between the peoples of these islands.  It was one of the many important steps on the road to real reconciliation.  I am truly delighted to see the members of the Harte family in the Distinguished Visitors' Gallery today.  I may be forgiven for welcoming Jimmy especially.  I know that the Harte family is a hub of community and the open door connection with the surrounding community is an important aspect of the family's very existence.  On behalf of the Labour Party and all my colleagues, I send my condolences, but also my congratulations, to the Harte family for the incredible service that Paddy gave to his community and to his country.</p> <p> I knew Monica Barnes very well.  Again, she was someone who often shared more views with me than with many other Members or with the majority of her own party, certainly in the early days.  I remember one trip I made with two remarkable women.  Monica Barnes, M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn and I went on a trip to Russia.  I am not sure I can actually tell all-----</p></speech>

Maybe there is a transcript worth reading in some liberated archive in Moscow.  On that trip one of the people we met was Valentina Tereshkova, the first woman in space.  I remember that Monica was truly delighted to meet a woman who had been in space.  As others said, Monica was a true feminist who would advance the cause of women always and forever, in every circumstance without fear or favour and, if anybody had a different view, without taking any hostages.</p>  <p>  Monica Barnes and I often shared political platforms and I recall that once in my early political career I very reluctantly gave up my Saturday clinic to do a meeting with women's groups in Dublin.  My co-speaker at this meeting was Monica.  I asked her if she found it difficult to give up her clinic on a Saturday.  I learned then of politics in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  Monica said: "Clinics on a Saturday?  I meet with my constituents by appointment on a Tuesday."</p>  <p>  Politics can be very different but we are certainly the poorer of personalities like Paddy and Monica.  It was a terrible blow to Monica to lose her son, Paul, but she made a remarkable and indelible impression on everybody she met and on the cause of the advancement of women and social progress generally in the State.</p>  <p>  On behalf of the Labour Party, I join with others in extending my condolences but also my congratulations to Bob and the family for the remarkable life and achievements of Monica Barnes.  May Monica Barnes and Paddy Harte both be looking down on us and enjoying the few words of celebratory acknowledgement that we give to them today.</p></speech>

Both of the deceased were a bit before my time and I would not have been that familiar with Paddy's record but it has been very impressive to listen to it recounted here.  I congratulate the Harte family and pay tribute to them for putting up with the travel Paddy would have done up and down from Donegal to here for 30 years.  If I stayed in here for 30 years, my young fellas would absolutely kill me.  The family must be very proud of such a record.  To stick at it for that long shows extraordinary stamina if nothing else.  The Island of Ireland Peace Park in Belgium is an extraordinary achievement for which the family should be very proud.</p>  <p>  I know that Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett will have a lot more to say about Monica Barnes.  I am not sure if I ever met her.  It is quite possible I did because my aunt Janet Kinsella, who was a stalwart of the Fine Gael D&uacute;n Laoghaire branch certainly would have known her and known Deputy Barrett also.  It is very possible I met Monica at family occasions.  As a young fella, up to no good on the streets of D&uacute;n Laoghaire and before I took any great interest in politics, I would have certainly been more than familiar with the names of Barnes, Barrett and Cosgrave as they were emblazoned across the lamp posts of D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  Although I would not have shared the Fine Gael affiliation, and I had many robust debates with my aunt Janet on politics, I was aware of Monica's central role in the fight for women's rights in this country, her opposition to the 1983 wording of the eighth amendment to the Constitution, her support for the right to divorce and her historic role in a broader social movement to achieve rights and equality for women.  With the tremendous changes that have happened with the recent vote to repeal the eighth amendment to the Constitution, we cannot say anything other than we owe a debt of gratitude to trailblazers like Monica Barnes, and many others who are not still with us and who fought against the tide in those early days when it was neither profitable nor popular to do so.  Her family deserve to be very proud of that.  It is sad that she is not here to see the great victory that has been the long-term impact of a struggle that people like Monica Barnes started many years ago.  My sympathy and condolences go to her family.</p></speech>

As a Donegal man it is an honour for me to talk about Paddy Harte.  I met Paddy only once or twice, very briefly, over the years but I served on Donegal County Council with Paddy's son, Jimmy, and we had a good collegial relationship at council level.  While they may not have known him personally everybody who grew up in Donegal knew who Paddy Harte was, and the Harte family name is, synonymous with Fine Gael and with peace building right across the county.  It is a great honour for me to pay tribute, to pass on my condolences to Rosaleen and the family and to have said these few words.</p>  <p>  On behalf of Independents4Change, I would also like to express sympathy to Bob Barnes and his family on the passing of Monica.  I did not know Monica but I have heard of her honourable and very distinguished record through tributes paid in the media and in this House.</p><p>This year's repeal of the eighth amendment is a great tribute to her work and her foresight in opposing the amendment when it came in first.

We offer our sympathies to their families and indeed to the Fine Gael Party, to Monica's daughter and her husband, Bob, and others.  The former Senator and Deputy was described by her daughter, Sarah, as an open and optimistic person and that she most definitely was.  Although she and I had many differing views, I salute her courage and her integrity in standing up for what she believed in with passion and conviction.  To her husband and family I offer our sincere sympathies for their loss.</p>  <p>  I worked with Paddy Harte in television and on radio and listened to his debates.  To the Harte family, his wife Rosaleen, and, of course, the former Senator, Jimmy Harte, with whom I served on the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, I offer our sympathies.  Paddy Harte came in here in 1961 and successfully contested 11 further general elections.  That was no mean achievement.  He was a colourful character and very passionate.  His son, Jimmy, also distinguished himself when he was here and we miss him.  I certainly miss Jimmy's company and his kind advice.</p>  <p>  Paddy was involved in many projects after he retired.  The biggest one of all was the Island of Ireland Peace Park, which was opened by no less than the President of the day, Mary McAleese, Prince Albert of Belgium and Queen Elizabeth.

Mar Sheanad&oacute;ir agus mar Theachta, las s&iacute; soilse do mhn&aacute; sa pholait&iacute;ocht nuair a bh&iacute; s&eacute; an-deacair d&uacute;inn dul chun cinn a dh&eacute;anamh.  Sa seacht m&iacute; &oacute; cailleadh &iacute; t&aacute; c&aacute;cas na mban ag dul &oacute; neart go neart, agus t&aacute; rian agus oidhreacht Mhonica le braith iontu si&uacute;d.</p>  <p>  Monica was a towering figure, a woman who made a difference and left a lasting impression, a fearless advocate.  It is crucial that we remember that she was a fearless advocate in a very different time, in a less kind Ireland, in what was at the time a judgmental Ireland.  It was a completely different place.  But it never deterred her pioneering voice from articulating in a most persuasive way what she believed in.</p>  <p>  On a personal note, I have lost a fellow past pupil from our shared alma mater in the Barony of Farney, namely, St. Louis secondary school in Carrickmacross.  Monica travelled to school from the neighbouring town of Kingscourt, as did many of my school friends when I was a student in St. Louis.  As a young pupil there, I found her inspirational and we were very proud that she was the first past pupil from our school to be elected to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  The last time I spoke to Monica was in &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in on International Women&rsquo;s Day this year, when we took a photo together to mark the fact that we were the two past pupils of St. Louis who were elected to the D&aacute;il.</p>  <p>  When I established the Oireachtas women&rsquo;s parliamentary caucus last year, Monica&rsquo;s campaigning voice was ever present.  More importantly, her belief and support were invaluable and unwavering in reminding us in the caucus that although we may have come far since her days in Leinster House and have increased our representation in the Oireachtas, there is a long way to go.  While we have all lost a dear friend, the greatest tribute we can make to Monica is to continue her pioneering work for women.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a hanam d&iacute;lis.</p>  <p>  On behalf of the Green Party, I wish to extend my deepest sympathy to the family and friends of Paddy Harte.  I concur with the comments made by others.  The President recently spoke of the State's at times selective amnesia but Paddy Harte was never in that category.  In respect of true reconciliation, he was ahead of his time.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam d&iacute;lis.</p></speech>

The main purpose of my few words, however, is to speak about my ex-colleague from D&uacute;n Laoghaire, Monica Barnes.  Monica was just unique in that there was no tradition in how she went about doing things.  We stood together in 1981 and twice in 1982 - three elections in 18 months.  She was eventually elected in November 1982 and served here for that term, until 1987, and served another term up to 1992.  Then she retired.  However, an election came along in 1997 and I decided I would call over to her.  We each had the unique pleasure of living side by side in Arnold Park in a five-seat constituency.  Arnold Park consists of approximately 80 or 90 houses and the residents had two sitting Deputies.</p></speech>

In any event, I called over to her, even though she had retired at that stage, and asked her if she would be interested in standing again.  She said "Okay, I will."  We set about it and she went off on her merry rounds.  I never knew where she was and did not care where she was going because that is the type of candidate she was.  We did not divide up the territory.  She had her own people and, sure enough, she was re-elected.</p>  <p>  It was a unique experience to serve with somebody like that, especially in this day and age of cutthroat politics.  People are always asking each other if they were at this public meeting or if they are attending that funeral.  Monica went her way and I went mine.  There were times, of course, when she would not agree with some of my views on some issues.  However, most of the time I could fully agree with her way of thinking.  It was a unique experience to serve with somebody like that in politics.  It is a lesson to those who are thinking of coming into politics.  They do not have to wear a banner around their necks.  They can enter politics and say what they truly believe.  If a candidate truly believes in something, he or she does not need a manifesto to knock on a door.  People should say what they believe in.  That is what Monica did.  The best tribute I can pay to her is that she is the best example of somebody who stood up and said what she believed.  Sometimes I did not agree with her but most of the time she had a way that I had to agree with her.  I have to admit that as - at that time - a youngish, conservative-type candidate, I learned an awful lot from her.  I learned that I had to be a bit liberal in this country and in this day and age.  I extended my liberalism way beyond where I thought I would.</p>  <p>  Monica made a huge contribution to Irish public life.</p><p>We need people like that, people who can change opinion by truly believing in a way of life.  She is a great loss even though she had retired.  The time I went over to her and asked her if she would come out of retirement, she thought about it and said she would.  Lo and behold she stood and got re-elected.  She was just unique.  Very few people could do that.  She had retired and she said she would stand again.  She went her way and I went my way and she got elected.  People often ask if there is a formula to get elected.  The formula I learned from Monica was to be oneself and say what one truly believes in.  May she rest in peace.</p></speech>

Is m&oacute;r an trua dom freisin comhbhr&oacute;n &oacute; chro&iacute; a dh&eacute;anamh le teaghlach, le cairde agus le comhghleacaithe Monica Barnes.

She was a formidable politician, who fought for women's rights throughout her life.  She was elected to this House in November 1982.  It is easy now, 18 years into the 21st century to forget the Ireland of 1982, 36 years ago, when Monica first entered the D&aacute;il.  Then, she was a shining light within a small group of progressives in a conservative party.</p><p>Monica Barnes became politicised leaving Mass one Sunday in the 1960s.  She bought a copy of <i>Chains of Change</i>a pamphlet published by the Women's Liberation Movement.  She became active in the second wave feminist movement in the late 1960s and 1970s.  She was involved with the Council for the Status of Women and merged feminist politics with party politics when she joined Fine Gael in the early 1970s.  She was one of a number of feminist women who joined the party because of its vision for a just society.</p><p>She was one of two Fine Gael Deputies to vote against inserting the eighth amendment into the Constitution in 1983.  She was quoted in the <i>Sunday Tribune</i>in 1983:</p><blockquote>I decided I could only compromise myself up to a certain point.  Women were the reason I was involved at all. <br /><br />If I kept quiet, as far as I was concerned, I was redundant as a politician.</blockquote><p>She received hate mail and verbal and physical abuse for her stance. </p><p>She supported divorce in 1985.  She regularly spoke on women's rights in the D&aacute;il and was Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights from 1989 to 1992.  In 1992, she famously wanted to put on the D&aacute;il record her opposition to the fact that only party leaders and thus only men were able to make statements on the X case.  On 18 February 1992 the then Taoiseach, Albert Reynolds, stood in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann to outline details on Ireland&rsquo;s injunction of a 14 year old girl.  He was followed by a brief statement from each Opposition leader.  As the Chair called time two Deputies from the backbenches rose to their feet - two of the 13 women who made up a Parliament of 166.  Before both were ruled out of order, Monica Barnes remarked:</p><blockquote>May I comment on behalf of the women of Ireland and the women in this forum who have been excluded from making statements on this issue, that this is a reflection of the exclusion of women in all structures of our society.</blockquote><p>When the Leas-Cheann Comhairle stated it was not a point of order, Madeleine Taylor-Quinn said that it was a protest, but the House moved on.</p><p>In an interview earlier this year Monica cheerfully admitted that Fine Gael&rsquo;s old guard considered her a pain in the behind - I have slightly changed the quote.  She also said: </p><blockquote>I did not get elected to the D&aacute;il after all those years of working for women to sell them out. <br /><br />I had to stand up for women, and for the health and the future of women, that&rsquo;s where I was in 1983.</blockquote><p>In that year she voted against the eighth amendment.  It is appropriate that we recognise her in the year when we repealed it.  She was an outspoken advocate for women's rights and on occasion expressed disappointment and anger over issues dealing with women.</p><p>Speaking in a D&aacute;il committee in November 2001, Monica succinctly summarised her own outlook and role in public life: </p><blockquote>I cannot emphasise enough that this country undermines and denies women's rights and status.  This is not polemic and I am not making a political point.  It is a personal, female perspective.  I speak on behalf of half the population.</blockquote><p>Monica spoke for the marginalised and excluded, often at a time when it was easier to stay silent.  She always spoke her mind.  Her life was dedicated to campaigning and fighting for the rights of those who did not have a voice in the Ireland of the time.</p><p>As was mentioned, she was a member of the Women's Parliamentary Caucus right up to her death.  She had attended and contributed wholeheartedly to the latest meeting held here in the House.</p><p><i>The Irish Times</i>once captured her with a headline that read &quot;Propelled by principle&quot;.  Monica's principles helped to propel this country to a better place.  My deepest sympathies go to her husband Bob, daughter Sarah, granddaughter Ailbhe who is here, daughter Joanne and her extended family.  Is mian liom comhbhr&oacute;n a dh&eacute;anamh lena fear c&eacute;ile Bob, a hin&iacute;onacha Sarah agus Joanne, a garin&iacute;on Ailbhe, agus a teaghlach uilig.

D&eacute;anaim comhbhr&oacute;n le teaghlach uilig Harte agus le teaghlach uilig Barnes as a gcailleadh ollmh&oacute;r.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge both families who are present.  I do not want to go over ground that has already been commented on.  My former colleague Paddy Harte was the standard-bearer for Fine Gael in my constituency for over three decades.  I want to talk about the legacy he has left and impact he had on County Donegal.  I contacted a number of former party stalwarts in the past week to pick up snippets of the extent of his impact and a measure of his contribution over those years.  It came back to his major legacy which was one as a grassroots politician who was very much in touch with his local organisation in the constituency and very much hands on.</p>  <p>  His door was always open and was often opened by Rosaleen and his sons and daughters.  The door was open not just from Monday to Friday, but was also open on Saturday and Sunday.  I believe the door even opened to a constituent one Christmas Day.  While it was a different time that access as a politician shows the type of politics we need to embrace because a politician who is not rubbing shoulder to shoulder with people or being with them is not in tune with their needs.</p><p>I want to acknowledge his contribution and his commitment to the preliminary work done in advance of the signing of the peace agreement in 1998.  He was very hands-on in relation to the Anglo-Irish Agreement and was very much involved in Sunningdale as well.  He took risks as a politician, was ahead of his time and had a major impact.  We are reaping the rewards of his work through the peace dividend we enjoy today.  </p> <p> I also wish to refer to Paddy's oidhreacht, meaning his legacy and heritage, and his wonderful appreciation of all things related to Donegal, Raphoe and the north west.  In later years he spoke in very strong terms about his connections and his upbringing.  His legacy in taking risks is something that we, as politicians, cannot forget.  We must embrace the lessons learned from politicians like him.  He was willing to put the politics of ambition and risk to the fore on behalf of the next generation and worked extraordinarily hard to ensure that people had better opportunities.  He had a deep understanding of difference.  When I was involved in peace and reconciliation work, I saw at first hand his efforts to try to understand both traditions and to bring people with him at a time many were entrenched in their views and positions.  </p> <p> I am also reminded of the insightful old Irish seanfhocal that I came across in Connemara - castar na daoine ar a ch&eacute;ile, ach n&iacute; chastar na cnoic n&aacute; na sl&eacute;ibhte - it is the people who meet together, not the hills and the mountains.  The hills and mountains always drew Paddy Harte back but his overarching ambition was to bring people together through a deeper understanding of one another.  He did that in a way that has left an enormous and rich legacy for the people and politicians who followed him.  </p> <p> I also wish to acknowledge Ms Monica Barnes through the words of my party colleague, former Deputy, Olivia Mitchell.  I did not serve in this House with Ms Barnes but my colleague summed her up for me in three words: passionate, inspirational and generous.  She was generous with her time and displayed an immense generosity of spirit.  As Deputy Mitchell O'Connor said earlier, her passion for social change was unwavering and it was great for her, in her later years, to see the social change for which she fought for so long come to pass.</p> <p> Ba mhaith liom ar&iacute;s mo bhu&iacute;ochas agus m'aitheantas a chur chuig an d&aacute; theaghlach f&aacute; choinne an tiomantas agus an gealltanas thar na blianta at&aacute; imithe thart, go h&aacute;irithe an tiomantas chuig an ch&eacute;ad ghl&uacute;in eile.</p></speech>

Chaith m&eacute; tr&eacute;imhse fhada anseo i gcomhar le Paddy Harte agus Monica Barnes.  Bh&iacute; m&eacute; sa D&aacute;il le Paddy ar feadh 16 bliana agus ar Chomhairle Chontae Dh&uacute;n na nGall leis ar feadh 12 bhliain.  N&iacute; raibh focal searbh idir an bheirt againn thar an tr&eacute;imhse sin.  Bh&iacute; Paddy ar taobh amh&aacute;in agus mise ar an taobh eile, ach bh&iacute; caidreamh iontach eadrainn.  Nuair a th&aacute;inig muid isteach anseo, bh&iacute;omar anseo mar Chonallaigh - seachas mar bhaill d'Fhianna F&aacute;il n&oacute; Fine Gael - chun &aacute;r gcuid oibre a dh&eacute;anamh thar cionn na daoine i nD&uacute;n na nGall a chuir muid anseo.  Bh&iacute; ainm Paddy Harte fite fuaite le s&iacute;och&aacute;in agus athmhuintearas, i bhfad sular cuireadh a leith&eacute;id ar bun go foirme&aacute;lta.  Bh&iacute; Monica Barnes ag pl&eacute; le cearta na mban ag an am c&eacute;anna.</p>  <p>  Paddy Harte was a great friend and a great Donegal representative for many years.  I am delighted to acknowledge the presence of his wife, Rosaleen and his children, Paddy Jnr, Mary, Anne, R&oacute;is&iacute;n, Garrett, Emmet, Eithne, and Johnny and not forgetting the former Senator, Jimmy Harte.  I am sure I speak for everyone when I wish Jimmy continued progress and good health.  </p>  <p>  Paddy Harte was first elected in 1961 and held his seat until 1997.  Therefore, for a short period in his later years here, he was father of the House.  He took over from the late Neil Blaney, who died in 1995 and was highly respected.  Not alone did he represent north-east Donegal, he also had the distinction of representing all of Donegal.  Those of us who are old enough will remember that he was elected to represent the great constituency of Donegal in 1977.  I was youngish at the time and not yet a member of the council.  I remember meeting him at the Butt Hall at that famous count in 1977.  I served with him on the council from 1979 until 1991.  As I said in Irish earlier, there was never a sharp word between us through all of those years, which is the way it should be.  I came with one party flag and Paddy Harte came with another but when we came to Dublin, we wore the Donegal jersey with pride and carried the Donegal flag.  Of course, working together as Deputies makes us stronger.</p>  <p>  Paddy Harte can be described as a committed politician, an advocate of justice and fairness and a true Donegal man.  He never missed an opportunity to put issues affecting Donegal forward over the years and to make the case for further investment in our native county.  I do not know what he would have to say now if he had to abide by the two-minute, seven-minute or ten-minute rule.  One did not have to respect it in those days-----</p></speech>

He was always known in this House for his good counsel and advice.  He was one for reaching out to others to advance different causes, not only in Leinster House but in practical ways and on many different occasions.</p>  <p>  Paddy Harte, in both politics and private life, will be remembered for highlighting the importance of co-existence.  He grew up and lived by the Border during the difficult years but he reached out.  He was reaching out to unionists in Northern Ireland long before it became popular to do so.   He took many risks over the years and promoted peace on the island of Ireland.  As many have said, this was demonstrated by the opening of Island of Ireland Peace Park at Messines.  He did not just turn up on the famous day when it was opened by the President of Ireland, Mary McAleese, the Queen of England and the King of Belgium.  He had been working on that project for years prior to the opening day.  He initiated F&Aacute;S schemes through which people went out to Messines to build that monument.  I was very honoured to be there as well on that famous day.  </p>  <p>  I must acknowledge Paddy Harte on a personal level, on my own behalf and that of my wife and her sister, whom he visited on many occasions over the years.  That may not have been popular either.  No one can say a bad word about the Harte family or Paddy Harte in my house or my wife's house.  We will never, ever forget him.  He went on radio one day and defended us when others thought it would be difficult to defend us.  He said that he was not defending the indefensible, but defending the defensible.  I was ever so grateful to him for that.  </p>  <p>  Paddy Harte leaves behind him a legacy that will stand the test of time and that will be favourably recorded when history is written.  He always believed in sharing and had a great understanding of our joint heritage and history, which is as it should be.</p><p>He leaves a legacy of which Rosaleen, his family, his extended family and his grandchildren will be proud in the years to come.<br/><br/>&Oacute; thaobh Monica Barnes d'oibrigh m&eacute; anseo l&eacute;i chomh maith agus is cuimhin liom bean a d'oibrigh go dian agus go d&iacute;cheall do chearta ban.

I am sure the pride they have in her is enhanced by what they have heard from her former colleagues and political representatives.</p>  <p>  From my county, I welcome the family of the late Paddy Harte: his dear wife and Rosaleen and his nine children, Jimmy, Paddy, Garrett, Mary, Anne, R&oacute;is&iacute;n, Eithne, Johnny and Emmet.  There is no doubt that Paddy gave tremendous service to the constituency of Donegal North-East, serving from 1961 to 1997.  It is clear from his family taking up that baton that Paddy's strong ethos of public service is carried on in his family, whether through politics, involvement in the media or a commitment to local community.</p>  <p>  When I was growing up in Donegal and becoming politically conscious, Paddy Harte was one of the big names in the county, along with former Deputies Hugh Conaghan, Neil Blaney, the Coughlans, Jim McDaid and, of course, Deputy Gallagher.  My grandfather, Willie Bradley from Dunree, an active party canvasser, knew him and canvassed for him.  I am not sure how he would feel about his grandson, as a Fianna F&aacute;il Deputy, paying tribute to Paddy Harte.  On my first occasion in the D&aacute;il, as a sixth-class primary school student on a school tour from Donegal, Paddy was the Deputy who hosted us, and I remember well meeting him at the front of Leinster House and being introduced by my principal, Sarah McDermott.  The event was set up by a local councillor, Bernard McGuinness, who was working alongside him that day.  I am not sure whether they always worked as hand in glove as they did on that occasion, but there is no doubt they did at that time.  I remember it well and it was a tremendous experience which awakened and developed my interest in politics from that time on.</p>  <p>  Having survived so many years in politics, particularly in Donegal politics, which is not easy, Paddy was not without craft.  I remember one winter's night when I was still in school, a knock came to our front door, and it was Paddy Harte, who was apparently lost although I am not sure where he was going.  We had a small, old-style country pub and shop that has since closed, and the next house over the road was another McConalogues', which happened to be a pub also.  It was linked to Fine Gael and Paddy used to go there but he managed to get himself lost that night and rocked up to the door wondering where the other McConalogue pub was.  The conclusion in the McConalogue household that night was that it was a cute move by Paddy to see whether my mother still held any links to her father's Fine Gael allegiances.  He was innocently given directions to the pub down the road and was none the wiser as to the main mission we had concluded he was on.</p>  <p>  Paddy served at a time when politics was quite different, before social media.  The commitment level was just as high but in a different way from now.  Deputy Boyd Barrett mentioned the trip up and down to Donegal and, although the road is difficult now, when Paddy was doing it, prior to all the bypasses that were built in the past number of years, whether in Carrickmacross, Castleblayney or Ardee, it was certainly a much more arduous journey.</p>  <p>  His great contribution was the development of the Island of Ireland Peace Park in West Flanders, and its opening a year after Paddy finished working as a politician in 1998 was a strong commitment of his which displayed the type of politician he was, working closely with Glen Barr in achieving it.  He was very much ahead of his time in his acknowledging the role and memory of the many Irish people who had died in the First World War.</p>  <p>  For a man who spent 35 years in politics, he very much enjoyed his retirement and did not give any outward display of missing politics.  On the occasions I met him, he seemed interested in history and his pastimes, and heavily involved with his family.  He continued to be outgoing and happy, and I know it was important to him and his family that his last days were spent in Lifford hospital, to which he had a strong affinity and commitment over the years.  Notwithstanding his great legacy of 35 years as a politicians and his strong work on behalf of the people of Donegal, it was clear at his funeral that his greatest legacy was that of his nine children and 24 grandchildren.  The pride which they all showed in him that day was representative of the pride he in turn had in all of them, and it is great to have them in attendance today.

It is my misfortune that I did not get to know him properly but, given the words that have been expressed, it is clear he was a great son, husband, father, grandfather and a tremendous asset to the country and politics.  I share in the expressions of sympathy to his family, who are present.</p>  <p>  As a D&uacute;n Laoghaire Deputy who has done clinics every Saturday for the past decade, for which I hope I am not taking a retrograde step, it is with great pride that I pay tribute to the late Monica Barnes, who was a real trailblazer.  When I consider what a privilege it is for me to be sitting as a Member of the House, I know I am here because of the great work and courage of women like Monica Barnes who came before me and laid down the strong foundations for us to be here today.</p>  <p>  Monica was always admired in the house in which I grew up, which was also full of strong, liberal women who outnumbered my father on many occasions.  Owing to her party and the woman she was in principle, she was greatly respected and honoured not only in my house but in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  When Monica was first elected to the House in 1982 to represent the people of D&uacute;n Laoghaire, she also represented women the length and breadth of the island.  She represented us all with fire, dignity and grace.  She was committed to the idea of a fair and just society, and used her time in this House and the Seanad to advance women's rights in Ireland in all forms.  She was the forerunner of the wonderful, strong, articulate, capable women who sit in the Oireachtas today.  The women of Ireland have a duty and onus to keep that flag flying, whether in equal pay, healthcare, childcare or many other areas where Monica started the journey.</p>  <p>  Monica did the work she did in the House and outside of it because she believed it was the right thing to do.  She stood her ground and fought for what she believed to be right.  It may not have been the easy route to take many a time, but she made no apology for it, and her strong legacy lives on.  My hope, which I hope is shared by all of us, is that history will never forget the great courage, compassion and wisdom of this great lady, and that we in the House can be inspired by her strong determination to do justice to those who elect us.  I express my strong sympathy to Monica's family, who are in attendance.</p></speech>

The committee's report was published last week and contains two options.  The first option would replace Article 41.2 with the following wording:</p><blockquote>The State recognises that home and family life gives to society a support without which the common good cannot be achieved.  The State shall endeavour to support persons caring for others within the home as may be determined by law.</blockquote><p>This wording is in line with the previous recommendation of the task force set up in the Taoiseach's Department in 2016.  The second option recommended postponing any referendum on the matter until the Government formally consulted with the public perhaps through the Citizens' Assembly.  Given the deliberations of the joint committee, will the Taoiseach confirm that the Government will bring forward legislation seeking to amend the Constitution in line with the recommendations contained within the first option of the committee&rsquo;s report?</p></speech>

If we can have that consensus, or if the consensus is secured, and provided the Attorney General's advice is favourable on the implications and interpretations of any new wording we put into our Constitution, that would enable us to legislate in the first quarter of next year before a referendum using the wording the Deputy quoted.  It requires consideration by the Attorney General and by Cabinet first.</p></speech>

I understand the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, has sought Cabinet approval for measures to strengthen the powers of the Residential Tenancy Board.  We welcome the proposed extension of notice to quit periods but the Taoiseach needs to understand that this measure will prove fruitless unless the legislation contains the Focus Ireland anti-homeless amendment to end evictions of tenants in buy-to-let properties being sold or repossessed.  Time and again the Taoiseach has shied away from delivering the solutions needed to end the ever-increasing number of families experiencing homelessness.  Despite the tea and sympathy approach the Taoiseach takes these are real people, including children who will carry the scar of homelessness for the rest of their lives.  Today we learn that homeless families living in hotels are to be unceremoniously kicked out for Christmas Eve and Christmas Day.  I have raised this issue before with the Taoiseach and he told me it would not happen, and not to panic.  He cited, I think, the papal visit and other occasions.  It is happening and today Elaine Wall bravely spoke up for her three children.  I hope the Taoiseach heard her.  How many families will be affected by the closure of hotels over Christmas and what measures have he and the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government put in place to make sure these children have somewhere to sleep at Christmas time?</p></speech>

He stated:</p><blockquote>All departments have already examined the legislation that will be required for no deal.  Priority will be attached in the new year to giving this legislation D&aacute;il and Seanad time.  Political support across the D&aacute;il will be necessary to do this. Some measures have to be kept confidential at this stage in the national interest.</blockquote><p>It is apparent that the current withdrawal deal is facing real difficulties.  Most commentators in Britain believe that it has no prospect of passing in the House of Commons.  Will the Government publish the list of legislation that will be passed in the event of there being no deal and a disorderly exit at the end of March?  We have a window over the Christmas recess for those of us in opposition to scrutinise and give detailed consideration to those sets of Bills if they are to come before us early in the new year, as the T&aacute;naiste has indicated.  Will the Taoiseach commit to giving party leaders a briefing on the secret Bills as the T&aacute;naiste refers to them and the detail of the administrative preparations going on now to avoid a hard border and maintain the supply chains needed in this economy?</p></speech>

John White is prohibited from leaving Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates, UAE.  I have raised this matter on previous occasions with the Taoiseach and with Deputy Flanagan when he was Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.  John has been working in the Middle East for almost 30 years as a building contractor and because of debts owed to him, he was unable to meet financial commitments, was brought to court and sentenced to five years.  On appeal that was reduced to 18 months.  He served 18 months and was due to be released on 15 August 2014 but when he went to the courts to collect his passport he was informed that one of the companies had taken a civil case against him and he got another sentence of three years.  He is now out of prison but has no passport and is unable to return to his young family.  He is in poor physical health, although he has improved somewhat.  Will the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade investigate the possibility of issuing a temporary passport to John so that he can return to his family for Christmas?  Will the Taoiseach ask the Minister to provide an immediate update to John's deeply distressed and devastated family?</p></speech>

Unfortunately, issuing a temporary or full passport would not solve the problem.  He would not be allowed to leave the UAE.  It is not a question of having a passport or not, it is a question of whether the UAE authorities would allow him to leave and at present they will not.  I have written to Sheikh Khalifa about it and may have the opportunity to raise it personally with him at the EU-Arab summit in February.</p></speech>

That was in response to a question I put on cystic fibrosis.  It applies now in respect of pembrolizumab.  What progress has been made since Vicky Phelan came in here with &Aacute;ine Morgan and Tracey Brennan who are in their 30s and 40s and told Deputies and Senators that they feel they are too young to die and they want equal access to pembrolizumab which has played a huge part in shrinking the tumours of other women?</p>  <p>  Women whose tests were messed up by the State are getting access but unfortunately the women who did not have their tests messed up cannot get access.</p><p>We are talking about a small number.  Could the Taoiseach now tell us that these women will be able to access the drug and that doctors should be allowed to prescribe whatever they feel is effective, and has proven to be effective, for other patients without waiting two years for a licence to be made available for its use for cervical cancer?  Is it not time this country looked at bringing drug companies under public control so that they do not profiteer at people's expense?</p></speech>

The HSE's medicines management programme has developed a proposal that would allow women who might benefit from the drug to have the drug prescribed and reimbursed, regardless of whether they were caught up in the CervicalCheck audit.  Discussions are under way with the company and, ultimately, it will require the agreement of the company and the co-operation of the clinicians to do that.</p></speech>

Some affected homeowners from my constituency in Dublin Rathdown are currently outside Leinster House, marking another year with no movement from the Government on this issue.</p>  <p>  When I raised the matter with the Taoiseach in October, he said that the Minister of State, Deputy English, was examining proposals and he admitted that there must be an understanding of the extent of the defects across the country so that such proposals could be drawn up.  Has the Government made any moves towards investigating the extent of the latent defects in residential housing, with a view to drawing up a plan for practical State reliefs along the lines recommended in the Safe as Houses report and the Green Party motion on building standards or are the homeowners to remain abandoned by the Government?</p></speech>

The primary difficulty in all of this is that if the State, in effect the taxpayer, were to take on the liability for repairing defects in private homes and buildings, the costs could run into many billions of euro, which would then have to be taken out of other budgets, whether for social housing, health or through massive tax increases or action on climate change.

It is incredible that I have to again raise the Rosalie unit in Castlerea, County Roscommon.  I want the Taoiseach to respond this time if he can because the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, cannot provide any more information.  Elected members and the families of the patients were given assurances that there would be no interference or movement of patients from the unit.  Incredibly, as we speak, every attempt is being made to move a lady from the unit.  She has mild mental health issues and she was getting all the care she needed there but she is being moved to a private nursing home where she will not have the same level of care.  I appeal to the Taoiseach to call off the proposed move.  Could he stick to his promise that the review will go ahead in January and at least leave matters as they stand until that is done?  It is not fair to those people or their families.  I will not accept the same old answer again.  I would like the Taoiseach to respond on the basis that when he was Minister for Health, a letter issued from his Department, as I pointed out previously, saying that the unit would not be closed.</p></speech>

Since the programme for Government commitment was made, the budget has literally ballooned and has gone from &euro;700 million five years ago to well in excess of &euro;1 billion.  Part of that is the rolling out of 7-7 care and then 24-7 care, on which there has been significant progress.</p></speech>

As the Taoiseach will know, given his profession, it is an acute illness of the lungs which causes breathing problems and leads to other ailments.  To get through daily life, sufferers incur enormous costs due to the need for oxygen machines and medical prescriptions which do not qualify under the medical card.  Will the Government recognise this illness as a long-term illness and, in so doing, allow people to get medical cards?  I believe it can be done without imposing extra costs on the Department of Health.</p></speech>

I want to raise the issue of JobPath and its privatisation through the two companies, Turas Nua and Seetec.  After years of requests, we have finally got damning statistics relating to the privatisation of that service.  The figures were given to the Committee of Public Accounts in recent weeks and they show that 190,000 citizens have been referred to those two companies at a staggering cost of &euro;149 million.  The most damning statistic is that of the 190,000 people referred, only 17,100 have been in sustained employment for over 12 months.  Does the Taoiseach view it as value for money that &euro;149 million has been spent and 17,100 jobs sustained?  Given those damning statistics, will he immediately stop the referral of people to Seetec and Turas Nua?</p></speech>

If one examines the statistics, and I have not done so, although I will take a look at them, what one has to compare with is the counterfactual - that is, with those who were not referred to JobPath or Intreo - to see if there is a difference as to whether they were able to hold onto sustained employment or not.</p></speech>

All of them were coming with a deep concern, particularly in the context of Brexit.  There is a commitment in the programme for Government to continue to fund these agencies and to make sure the Border corridor is not adversely affected by Brexit.  These groups are extremely concerned about how they are going to survive into the future.  Basically, their ask is that we put a plan in place.  Both Governments need to come together and come up with a short-term plan, not a long-term plan, with funding and resources to ensure this area of the island, which will be most adversely affected by Brexit, and these agencies have an assurance they will get the kind of funding and resources they need so they can work into the future.  I would like a commitment from the Taoiseach that he will work with counterparts in the British Government to come up with a solution so a project can be put forward and funding delivered for these communities.</p></speech>

In order to achieve that objective, repairs or alterations have to be done to a house in many cases.  There is a scheme of State grants for alterations in those circumstances and there has been increased provision for this lately, which I welcome.  Unfortunately, there are serious defects in the administration of this scheme and how it is operated by various local authorities.  It is extremely slow and tedious and it operates unevenly between one local authority and another.  What we are proposing is a system which would bring uniformity to this area and would enable these grants to be processed much more speedily and efficiently.</p>  <p>  It is a humane measure.  It would enable people who are ill or elderly and who wish to live with their own family, or their family members, to get the grant so the patient or elderly person could move into the accommodation as quickly as possible, certainly much more quickly than at present.  I urge the Government to adopt the Bill.  Deputy O'Rourke will explain how it will operate.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-12-12a.342" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1324" speakername="Frank O'Rourke" time="14:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018121200025#X01600"><p>I welcome the opportunity to introduce the Bill with my colleague, Deputy O'Dea.  The thinking behind this, as Deputy O'Dea outlined, is to make the system more efficient and effective and to have it operate evenly across all counties with a universal approach.  At the moment people are unnecessarily delayed in nursing homes and hospitals due to the amount of time needed to process and approve grants, which take approximately six months on average across all local authorities.  We know people who are elderly or ill are more comfortable and independent when living in their own home, and this is about making the process more efficient.</p>  <p>  Our proposal, which we hope is accepted by other parties, is that when an application is made, it is put forward to the local authority with an occupational therapist's report, whether from the community or the hospital, with a proposal from a registered builder or architect, and accompanied by two quotations.  When all that is furnished to the local authority with proof of the person's income and proof they have paid the local property tax, all of which are part of the current process, a decision would be made on the application within a month in order to give some continuity and efficiency to the system.  This is very important for the applicant, who will know they are being approved for the grant and what level of funding is approved.  In addition, it obviously helps the process by preventing unnecessary delays in regard to bed-blocking in hospitals and nursing homes.  It also gives some certainty to people making the application as to when they will get back into their own home.</p><p>This is hugely important for those involved.  They need to have this work done on their homes.  It can be a difficult and traumatic time for them and it is very sensitive for families.</p> <p> This is an important Bill.  The funding is in place in local authorities so no additional cost will be imposed.  It is about making the system more transparent, efficient and effective and helping those in need to get meaningful and timely access to the funding.  We do not propose any major changes to the current process, we propose only to make it more efficient and pragmatic.  I hope we get the support of the House for the Bill.  It is end-user driven and that is who it seeks to help.  It seeks to provide easier access to decisions and outcomes.  No additional cost will be imposed on applicants who are already engaging with the occupational therapist in the community or hospital setting.  As such, applicants get the recommendations from professionals who are registered and tax compliant.  The proposed legislation is therefore above board and in keeping with the current system and seeks simply to create efficiencies.</p></speech>

The origins of the Bill lie in the concerns of the cancer care community.  There is growing concern among clinicians who see the effects of false claims due to a lack of regulation in the area.  There are no adequate safeguards in place to address unproven and, at times, dangerous suggested cures or treatments which are pushed on those who receive cancer diagnoses.  The Bill proposes provisions to prosecute those who are making large sums of money by peddling things they claim can cure cancer when there is no evidence to support those claims.  These people are selling treatments which, at best, have no effect whatsoever but which at their worst increase pain and suffering and often hasten death.  It is not the patient who will be found at fault under the proposals in the Bill, rather it will be those who profit from promoting products of dubious or dangerous composition or efficacy.  Anyone who advertises a treatment or therapy that has been proven to be effective will be exempt from prosecution under the Bill.  Likewise, doctors, nurses and others working in the field of oncology or cancer care will be exempt also.  Similarly, patient access to clinical trials will not be affected, nor will emerging research and study in the fields of cancer research, clinical care or treatment.</p><p>Many medical professionals have been calling for this legislation for some time as they have watched patients pursue pathways that can seriously interfere with their medical treatment.  There is no end to the sad and frightening stories oncologists, nurses, families, patients and dieticians working in this area have to tell.  RT&Eacute;'s &quot;Prime Time&quot; with Conor Wilson did great work to expose some of these practices in a special programme which aired some weeks ago.  It was an excellent example of public service broadcasting in the truest sense, notwithstanding the deeply upsetting narrative.  It is for the people we may know who are going through cancer treatment and the people we have lost that this Bill is presented to the House.  I urge the Opposition to support the Bill and I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to introduce it.</p></speech>

We have seen enormous improvements in cancer care in Ireland over the past few decades with the result that more people with cancer now survive than die.  We will continue to see improvements in that regard as screening and prevention improve and as we make improvements to our cancer care centres.  However, I share the real concern about the exploitation of many people who are sick with cancer by those offering cures and treatments which do not work along with various other false health claims.  They do so for profit and abuse immensely vulnerable people.  As such, the legislation is timely and I welcome the fact that it is on First Stage today.</p></speech>

On Thursday afternoon, we will focus on the multi-annual financial framework and follow that work with a discussion on external relations in the evening.  On Friday, the meeting will begin with a discussion of citizen consultation on the future of Europe followed by an exchange on the Single Market.  The euro summit will take place at lunchtime.  Other issues to be discussed include migration, the challenge posed by large-scale disinformation, the fight against racism, xenophobia and climate change.  I will focus my remarks today on the Single Market, migration, disinformation and external relations as well as on the euro summit.  The Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, will speak about the other European Council issues in greater detail in her statement.  However, I will turn first to Brexit, which we will also discuss in Brussels on Thursday in Article 50 format.</p>  <p>  The UK Government has postponed the planned vote on the withdrawal agreement in the House of Commons and there have been further developments this morning within the Conservative Party.  As I said before, the withdrawal agreement, of which the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, including the backstop, is an integral part, has been endorsed by the European Union and agreed with the UK Government.  Therefore, it carries the support of 28 Governments.  It is the result of over 20 months of complicated technical negotiations and represents a carefully balanced compromise among 28 states.  It is the best possible deal to protect the European Union's interests and those of the United Kingdom to ensure an orderly withdrawal and it cannot be renegotiated.  The European Union and the 27 member states are united on this.  We should not forget that the backstop is not just an Irish issue.  It is there to prevent the emergency of a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland but it is also there to protect the Single Market and ensure that an open Irish border does not become a back door to the European Union.  As such, it is a European issue too.</p>  <p>  We should recall that a UK-wide backstop rather than a Northern Ireland specific one was included at the request of the UK Government.  It is important to bear in mind that the United Kingdom took the decision to leave the European Union and thereafter the UK Government set out a number of red lines, including no customs union, no Single Market, no free movement of people and no recognition of the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the European Union.  The agreement we reached was achieved, working around the constraints, by drawing around the UK's red lines.  The European Union has always stated that if the United Kingdom's approach to the future relationship evolves and the red lines are erased, we will be willing to take that into account in the negotiations on the future relationship treaty in accordance, of course, with our guidelines and based on the balance between rights and obligations.</p><p>I hope that the withdrawal agreement will be ratified by the UK Parliament and the European Parliament in due course, but the Government, in close co-operation with the EU, is continuing its work to prepare for all possible outcomes including the central case scenario and the no-deal scenario.  We are accelerating the recruitment of customs officers and veterinary health inspectors and we are developing infrastructure in ports and enabling legislation.  We will be as ready as we can be for all eventualities.  Whatever happens, Ireland will remain at the heart of the European Union, the eurozone and the Single Market in the common European home we helped to build.<br/><br/>Four times in our nation's history we have travelled a different path from that of Britain: when we became independent and founded the Free State; when we declared a republic; when we floated the punt; and when we joined the euro without the United Kingdom.  On each occasion there were risks, challenges, opportunities and a transition period, but on each occasion we emerged stronger and wealthier.  That will be the case again.  <br/><br/>My final remark on Brexit is to recognise the noteworthy contrast between the political situation here in Dublin and that in London.  Both the United Kingdom and Ireland are faced with existential threats because of Brexit.  However, we have a degree of political stability and a degree of consensus across the House.  That makes our country a much better place and puts it in a much stronger position as these negotiations continue.<br/><br/>The Single Market, which marks its 25th anniversary this year, is one of the great achievements of the Union.  It has brought about increased employment, increased trade and greater competition and higher living standards for our citizens.  It has also given us, as European citizens, the freedom to work or study anywhere in the Union.  Its further development is essential to ensure Europe's continued competitiveness on the world stage.  This is a priority for Ireland as a trading country.  We have been working closely with like-minded partners to ensure a high level of political ambition with a particular focus on unlocking the Single Market's full potential in the areas of digitalisation and trade in services.  Our approach is informed by the work led by the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Humphreys, in conjunction with her counterparts in Finland, Denmark and the Czech Republic.  Last month, they launched a report commissioned from Copenhagen Economics entitled Making EU Trade in Services Work for All.<br/><br/>This meeting of the European Council also provides a timely opportunity to reflect on the implementation of the comprehensive approach to migration agreed at the June Council meeting.  Europe can only respond effectively to large migratory flows by working together and I support the three-pronged approach we agreed in June.  These three prongs are: securing our external borders, strengthening co-operation with countries of transit and origin, and dealing with the management of migrants within the EU on the basis of solidarity.  The European Union needs an asylum system that can respond effectively to large-scale migratory movements, both legal and illegal.  We are engaged in efforts to reform the common European asylum system.  Discussions on controlled centres and disembarkation platforms have taken place in recent months.  As I have stated previously, we would only seek to progress these initiatives if we were satisfied that they would be fully compliant with our obligations under international law.  We continue to co-operate closely with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR, and the International Organization for Migration to this end.<br/><br/>Collaboration with these organisations is also an important part of our efforts to support our African partners both through Irish Aid and the EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa.  We have pledged &euro;15 million for this purpose.  This is the third highest contribution <i>per capita</i>in the European Union.  The global compact on migration, which was signed at Marrakesh earlier this week - with the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, representing the Irish Government - reflects the need for co-operation at a global level without dictating how states should determine their own policies.  It is regrettable that some EU member states did not participate in the compact.  I hope they will revisit this decision in the future.<br/><br/>Following our discussions at the June Council meeting, the Commission will present its action plan against disinformation.  I fully support the efforts to see off this evolving threat.  It is important that we work together to counter disinformation activities that threaten our shared democracy.  The plan sets out four things we must do, namely: improve detection, analysis and exposure of disinformation; strengthen co-operation to enable a more cohesive response; engage with industry; and raise public awareness and support quality media and journalism.  It is essential that the electoral process is safeguarded from inappropriate online interference and manipulation and that we respect international law and fundamental rights.  The open policy forum held in Dublin Castle on 6 December examined some of the issues related to this including the regulation of transparency of online political advertising.  The EU must act in a co-ordinated and comprehensive way and I look forward to discussing this further with EU partners.<br/><br/>On external relations, we will discuss preparations for the summit between the European Union and the Arab League, which is scheduled to take place in Cairo in February.  Recent developments in Russia and Ukraine are also likely to be discussed.  The Government is gravely concerned about the increasing militarisation of Crimea and the Sea of Azov.  We support calls for all sides to de-escalate the situation.  Ireland is unwavering in its support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity and we do not recognise Russia's annexation of Crimea.  As part of our efforts to develop relations with Ukraine, we will open an embassy there as part of the Global Ireland 2025 initiative.  I firmly believe that unity at EU level must continue to be the cornerstone of our approach to Russia.  The EU is at its strongest when it speaks with one voice and I will emphasise this in my engagement with European partners.<br/><br/>We will also have an exchange on the fight against racism, xenophobia and anti-Semitism.  Ireland fully supports the ongoing efforts in this area, including the Council's declaration on 6 December on the fight against anti-Semitism.  All states share a duty to work towards achieving societies that are free of inequality, repression and discrimination in accordance with their international obligations.<br/><br/>The focus of our discussions at the euro summit will be on strengthening and deepening economic and monetary union.  The summit is expected to endorse the positive outcome of negotiations among Finance Ministers in recent months.  These negotiations recently saw agreement reached on the reform of the European Stability Mechanism, ESM, which will now have additional responsibilities in the areas of crisis prevention and resolution in the eurozone and in advancing banking union.  I welcome these positive developments which mark a further step in the development of economic and monetary union and which will serve to strengthen the resilience of our banking system and the overall stability of the eurozone.  I expect that some will also want to discuss the possibility of a budgetary instrument for the eurozone as part of the multi-annual financial framework.  This is a proposal which we are open to considering.<br/><br/>I look forward to reporting back to the House next week on 19 December on the outcome of these meetings.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-12-12a.365" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1224" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018121200027#Z00200"><p>According to current legislation, Brexit will take effect in 107 days.  The deal on the table was reached after two years of tortuous and repetitive negotiations.  It is a deal which reflects the commitments made by both the United Kingdom and the European Union to Ireland from late 2016 onwards.  It is a good deal for all involved.  It would allow for an orderly transition period, reduce the short-term economic damage and allow time to develop a long-term model for co-operation.  Regardless of how good it is, a deal which will not or cannot be ratified ultimately becomes inoperable and worthless.</p>  <p>  In the nearly three weeks since the deal was agreed we have all witnessed an escalating political crisis in London.   It was the intention of the UK Government to hold a vote last night.  There is no prospect of another vote being scheduled for some time.  There are many scenarios but unfortunately there is no clarity.  While Prime Minister May works to salvage the current deal she is confronted with a political class which has descended into open warfare between angry factions. Today&rsquo;s no confidence motion is only the latest outbreak from members of a fundamentalist group in her own party who seem to be determined to destroy all around them rather than ever compromise.  Their extreme Europhobia has developed over 40 years and it will not respond to evidence or reason.</p>  <p>  It would be wonderful to be able to dismiss what is happening in London as a sideshow but we cannot do so.  Ireland and Europe are directly affected.  Regardless of whether Prime Minister May survives today, the core blockage to any deal remains.  There is an overwhelming majority of MPs standing against the withdrawal agreement but there is no route to a majority for any alternative course of action.</p><p>The only thing which is clear is that no one has the faintest idea what the course of Brexit will be in the coming weeks and months and potentially for much longer than that.  With the exception of the fundamentalist fringe of the Conservative Party and, unfortunately, the DUP, all accept the idea of a guaranteed open Border in Ireland but they do not agree on the wider issue of the UK's relationship with the European Union.  The fact is that this is at its core.  It is not about negotiations with the European Union; it is about a debate within British politics and society over which we have little or no influence.  This period of growing chaos and uncertainty is not one we can assume will come to a halt by 29 March.  Regardless of whether the deal is ratified, and there is still hope that this may happen because of the damage which any alternative will cause, the risk of a no deal outcome has risen dramatically.  Circumstances have changed and we must respond accordingly.  Ireland is now in a period of heightened danger for our economy and for a political settlement which has been a beacon of light in our modern history.  This is not a crisis of our making but it is a crisis which we all have an urgent duty to which to respond.</p> <p> Let nobody be in any doubt, every single piece of evidence suggests that the impact of Brexit is under way and may escalate significantly.  Far more worryingly, the evidence also shows that Ireland is nowhere near ready for many of the outcomes which have become far more likely in recent days.  While past research has shown the medium-term and long-term impact of different Brexit scenarios this morning&rsquo;s quarterly economic review includes a study of the impact in 2019.  Using a very conservative approach, it states that a no deal outcome will reduce GNP growth by roughly 1.4%.  That is a loss of &euro;3.5 billion in only the eight months following Brexit.  The shock will initially be concentrated in the trading sector but will, according to the report, be transmitted through that sector to the wider economy.  This carries with it an immediate knock-on impact on public finances.  While we have requested that the Minister for Finance publish details of the impact of a no deal scenario, a rough estimate shows that a hole of at least &euro;1 billion will open in the budget figures for next year and this will escalate in subsequent years.  The Government&rsquo;s budget assumes an orderly Brexit, with a lengthy withdrawal period and no sudden shifts in policy.  Two months after the budget his assumption is simply no longer valid.  In fact, things could get much worse than this forecast suggests because it does not factor in a major devaluation of sterling or administrative chaos in the move to new systems.</p> <p> According to the Central Bank and others, the impact of Brexit is already here.  The bank&rsquo;s latest report has identified evidence of trade with the United Kingdom being hit and causing a slowdown in expectations.  My colleagues from Border constituencies, in particular, are reporting that companies are already struggling from lost competitiveness and heightened uncertainty.  Consumer confidence has been hit and there is a growing sense of unease and even fear about what lies ahead.</p> <p> Analysis by State agencies suggests that sterling devaluation is the biggest threat to many exporters, especially Irish-owned companies.  Some 47% say they face serious difficulties as a result of the exchange rate reached this week, with most of the remaining firms facing serious difficulties if the exchange rate falls a further 10%.  The hit to Irish business from Brexit-related devaluation is deep.  Since David Cameron announced the date for the referendum in 2016, sterling has fallen by 25% against the euro.  It really does not matter how efficient or dynamic one's business is, a 25% loss of competitiveness is enormous and is an existential threat.</p> <p> Brexit has been a core political issue for my party since before the referendum was held.  In the past two years I, as well as our spokespeople, Deputies Donnelly and Chambers, have regularly pushed the Government on levels of preparation.  The only response has been to claim that everything is fine.  Unfortunately, the evidence suggests preparations which are incomplete and some of which are really only starting at the very last minute.  With little more than 100 days to go, it is no achievement to be citing the numbers of companies seeking basic information or the number of applications received for jobs.  We cannot afford a repeat of what we have seen from the Government in so many other policy areas where spin about activity levels is used to cover up the lack of action on the ground.</p> <p> The facts published by Government show that only a minority of impacted companies have preparations in place.  Few have currency hedging strategies.  Few have begun procedures for essential freight travel registrations.  Minor grant schemes are helping a minority of companies in small but important ways.  However, significant funding for cashflow disruption, tackling loss of competitiveness and diversification has not been distributed.  The short-term loan scheme has allocated only 5% of its funding while the long-term loan scheme will not have distributed a single euro by next March.  The Government itself does not appear to be anywhere near the needed level of preparedness.  </p> <p> The Taoiseach yesterday mentioned a series of actions which are required for a no deal scenario, none of which has had funding allocated or legislation published.  The situation is that Ireland is facing a major threat and great uncertainty.  This poses a direct challenge to everyone in this House as to how we react.  Business as usual is not acceptable.</p> <p> Can we show our ability to put the national interest ahead of party interests?  As things stand, the first period of the agreement, which allowed the formation of this Government, is ending.  My party entered this agreement in 2016 because it was the only way of being true to what we had promised our voters while also fulfilling the basic democratic responsibility on any parliament to form a government.  In spite of many provocations and difficulties, we have honoured our commitments.  This has included refusing to respond to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s attempts over recent months to find an excuse to increase instability and undermine his own Government.  There has been no talk from us about oiling printers or careless talk about elections in the middle of sensitive negotiations.  This is why in October we took the unprecedented decision to state that we would not support an election until some certainty on Brexit had been reached at earliest.  No one can now seriously question that our decision then was the right one for Ireland.  This has ensured that we have been able to proceed with a detailed review of the implementation of the confidence and supply agreement.  We refused to move straight to a negotiation and insisted on a deep review in critical areas, including health, housing, education, Brexit and public finances.  Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s participants in this review have detailed the outcomes for me and these have been reported to our parliamentary party.  The review has unfortunately confirmed a complacency and lack of urgency in government.  There is no understanding that the public has a right to be concerned at near-systematic failures to deliver on housing, health and many other issues.   Equally there has been an attempt to stonewall us regarding basic information about fiscal reserves.</p> <p> While the Taoiseach has announced that there is no problem with an unfunded &euro;3 billion tax give-away, his Minister for Finance will not justify this claim.  The chronic deficit in delivery, the failure to understand public concerns, and the increased politicisation of public funding points to the need for a new Government.  In normal times, there would be no issue.  An election now would be the right thing for our country.  However, these are not normal times and Ireland is immediately confronted with one of the biggest threats for many decades.  It is a threat which is not just of a short-term nature; it impacts on the core economic, social and political future of this island.</p> <p> To replace this Government would require a lengthy election campaign and most likely a lengthy period of Government formation.  In 2016, this entire process took four months to complete.  Fianna F&aacute;il is determined that the political chaos we see in London will not be allowed to spread to Ireland.  We simply do not believe that the national interest could in any way be served by taking up to four months during next year to schedule and hold an election campaign and then form a government.  With business and communities already fearful about the impact of Brexit and with Ireland manifestly not ready for many of the potential outcomes, how could it possibly be in the national interest to have extended political uncertainty next year?</p><p>This is why Fianna F&aacute;il will extend a guarantee that Government will be able to operate throughout 2019.  This will allow the introduction of any emergency legislation and budgets, as well as the full end of year budget and associated legislation.  This will in turn allow the holding of an election early in the following year.  Free of Brexit uncertainty, there can be an election about the need for a new approach to housing, ending systematic political failures in health and addressing the needs of people who want a Government that understands their concerns.  This decision has been reached reluctantly but it is unavoidable.</p> <p> We have all seen in Northern Ireland what happens when political parties undermine the functioning of government at a moment of critical risk.  Northern Ireland's position has suffered dramatically from political game-playing and the absence of a democratic voice.  The majority in Northern Ireland and in the Northern Ireland Assembly want to remain and also support the current deal.  The absence of the Assembly and Executive has empowered people who believe the opposite.  In the next few weeks we will seek to finalise as much as possible critical concerns which have been the focus of the review.  Specifically, these are actions required to minimise the impact of a no-deal Brexit; the chronic under-delivery of commitments in health, housing and supports for children; the likely and potential state of public finances in 2019 and 2020; and the unacceptable politicisation of public spending through the sidelining of expert agencies in funding decisions in areas such as culture, rural affairs, local development and research.  If the Government shows good faith, this can be completed quickly.  Of course, we cannot guarantee that the Government will not undermine itself and stumble out of office, but it is receiving a guarantee of stability unprecedented for a minority government in its situation.  If we could have a new Government in days then we would be able to act differently but it will take a process of months and Ireland does not have months in which it can indulge in putting politics before the people's interests.</p> <p> Tomorrow morning, I will meet colleagues from throughout the European Union, including eight members of the European Council.  I will tell them that Ireland will be a stable and reliable partner for them in the months ahead.  The contagion of political chaos will not spread here from London.  There is a clear majority in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann which will ensure stability and the national interest will be put first.</p></speech>

Bravo, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin.  Well done.  That is some kind of stability, as described by the soldiers of destiny.</p>  <p>  However, I will go on to more prosaic matters, which might be less provocative and upsetting to the delicate souls on the Fianna F&aacute;il benches.  The European Council will meet to discuss the shambles that is Brexit.  Once again, the Council must remain resolute in its view that the withdrawal agreement that has been negotiated in good faith between Britain and the EU, including the Irish protocol in particular, cannot be renegotiated, diluted and picked apart in any way, shape or form.  I made the point previously that any type of Brexit will represent a very bad day for Ireland, North and South.  The withdrawal agreement cannot, and will not, change that.  Even it is ultimately agreed, as the least worst option, it will still be a bad day for our country.  It is by no means perfect and the political declaration relating to the future relationship remains aspirational.</p>  <p>  However, it must be acknowledged that the withdrawal agreement on offer mitigates against some of the worst aspects of Brexit.  The so-called backstop is a mechanism to reduce the damage caused by Brexit and nothing more.  It is not a panacea for all of Brexit's ills.  It is an insurance policy that ensures there will be no hardening of the Border on our island and that the interests of citizens in the north, the majority of whom voted against Brexit, will be protected.  It is a means of recognising in some small way the democratic will of the majority of the people of the North who voted to remain in the European Union.  The four pro-remain parties in the North - Sinn F&eacute;in, the SDLP, the Alliance party and the Green Party - which represent the majority, believe there is no such thing as a good Brexit.  We accept that the majority of ordinary people across the island and those in business and in civic society do not want Brexit, and that we have a shared responsibility to protect jobs, our economic stability and people's livelihoods.  That is essential.  In contrast, the DUP does not speak for the people of the North on Brexit; we do.</p></speech>

We have been clear in stating that the Government&rsquo;s approach to negotiations had to be guided by the fact that citizens in the North voted to remain and that democratic verdict had to be respected.  We are glad that has been the case, for the most part, and I have acknowledged the work of the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and, more importantly, Irish officials on that, as well as the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee.  I am happy to do that again.</p><p>We are now at the end of the negotiating process and the outcome is far from clear.  On Monday, the British Prime Minister shelved her plan for a &quot;meaningful vote&quot; because it was clear that it was going to be defeated by a substantial margin.  That and the overnight machinations in London heightened the prospect of a no-deal scenario or crash scenario.  No one here wants that but it is now a distinct possibility which needs to be faced up to, not accepted as an inevitability or <i>fait accompli</i>but a prospect that needs to be met.  In the absence of the withdrawal agreement and the backstop contained therein, there is no way of guaranteeing no return to a hard border.  On the contrary, there will be an automatic hardening of the Border.  Citizens' rights will automatically be undermined and the Good Friday Agreement automatically sabotaged.</p><p>I have repeatedly made it clear to Theresa May - and I put this to the Taoiseach here yesterday and again today - that in the event of a crash-out Brexit, or a no-deal scenario, we in Sinn F&eacute;in believe it will be necessary to put the constitutional future of the North to the people in a unity referendum.  I firmly believe it is time for the Taoiseach to take up that position.  If the people of the North are to be disregarded in this process, then they must have their say.  This is a reasonable position which I believe all parties here should support.  Uniting our country would end the need for a backstop definitively and permanently.  As the Taoiseach rightly pointed out earlier, the Border in Ireland is no longer simply a problem for us but a European problem, not least, as he said, because it presents a real and present danger to the integrity of the beloved Single Market.  The debate about Irish unity is well under way regardless of what position the Taoiseach might adopt but it is time to accept that Irish unity is now the logical and sensible option to put an end to this messing once and for all.</p><p>Deputy Pearse Doherty and I spoke to Ms Theresa May last night and reminded her again that in the absence of an agreement, a unity referendum must be called as a matter of urgency.  I also told her that the basic protections contained in the backstop are non-negotiable and cannot be unpicked or diluted.  The British Government signed up to an agreement last December to protect the Good Friday Agreement, to avoid a hard border and to put in place a legally enforceable backstop.  That agreement must be honoured, even in the midst of the madness at Westminster.</p> <p> The current position of some in the Conservative Party and the DUP is reckless and irresponsible.  We need a deal that recognises the unique circumstances that present for our island.  This is critical to safeguard investment and to protect jobs, trade, the integrity of the peace process and our citizens' rights.  This is what is required.  Nothing short of this is acceptable.  The Taoiseach and the Government must stand firm on that point and the EU must remain true to its word that without an agreed, legally enforceable backstop, there will be no withdrawal agreement.</p> <p> I hope the Taoiseach will bring that message to Brussels tomorrow and I hope he will consider, perhaps quietly away from this Chamber, the necessity to look to the prospect of a crash and all of the long-term damage that presents and begin planning the pathway for constitutional transition because it is surely upon us.</p></speech>

These include maintaining cross-Border co-operation, supporting the all-island economy and protecting the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts.  It will do this by ensuring that the North essentially remains in the customs union and large elements of the Single Market.  This is not ideal and the Taoiseach will accept that the best solution for Ireland is no Brexit and the entire island remaining in the EU.</p>  <p>  The issue for Westminster is that large elements of the backstop would apply to Britain as well.  It would also mean more checks between Britain and the North and this would essentially mean Britain effectively remaining in elements of the customs union.  This is the reason the hard right in the Tory Party wants the backstop dropped.  We have all heard the clamour from some on the hard right of the Tory Party, and the DUP, for the backstop to be dropped.  Can the Taoiseach assure this House, the people of this State and the remaining people on the island of Ireland that the terms of the backstop are non-negotiable?</p>  <p>  The EU Council will be under pressure to give some leeway to Prime Minister, Theresa May.  While she is seeking clarifications, the message that must go out from the European Union and the Irish Government is that there cannot be any renegotiation on the terms of the backstop or the agreement that has been reached, which was voted on and passed by this House.  A backstop that is temporary cannot be a backstop.  The best way for those in Britain who are concerned about the backstop to ensure it is not temporary is for Britain to remain in the customs union and elements of the Single Market.  This is a matter for them and they have to face up to that reality.</p>  <p>  Last weekend, one Tory MP threatened to starve Ireland unless the backstop is changed.  Yesterday, an unnamed Tory MP said that the Irish need to know their place.  We know our place.  Ireland's place, North and South, is in the European Union.  As stated by Teachta McDonald, in the event of a hard crash by Britain from the European Union - Sinn F&eacute;in does not want to countenance a hard crash but it is somewhat outside of the control of politicians in Ireland - we will have to plan for every eventuality.  In my view, and as indicated by the opinion polls, an increasing number of people in the North want a united Ireland in that scenario, such that there will be a responsibility on the Government to prepare for such an eventuality.  No amount of hand wringing and statements that this cannot happen can take away from that reality.  Nobody wants a hard crash.  We all want a deal passed by the House of Commons and put in place but if that does not happen, then every eventuality has to be examined.  </p>  <p>  The people of this State cannot have confidence in what we heard from the T&aacute;naiste and the Taoiseach in respect of a no-deal Brexit or a hard crash.  We are not hearing of any preparation and people, farmers and businesses are concerned.  For example, companies in the south east that export to Britain, employ large numbers of people, and are affected by the currency fluctuations, and that would be affected disastrously if there was a hard Brexit, are also concerned.  It is not only people in the North but people across the island of Ireland who will be affected.  There can be no negotiation downwards on what has been agreed.  A hard Brexit will result in a drop of between 4% and 7% in GDP for the South and potentially the loss of thousands of jobs.  </p>  <p>  Collectively, we have all got behind getting a solution for Ireland.  We all want a deal that protects Ireland from the worst effects of Brexit.  We all accept that Brexit is not good, that there is no good outcome and no good Brexit.  We all want a deal to be put in place that will avoid a hardening of the Border and protect the Good Friday Agreement but some in Britain do not want this to happen, will attack the backstop and have no difficulty using Ireland as collateral to get their Brexit through.  On behalf of the people we represent, that cannot happen.  The people of the North, and this island, need these basic protections fully protected.  My message for the Taoiseach is that there can be no renegotiation of those basic protections that collectively we have secured for the people of our island.</p></speech>

Every year, workers, businesses and consumers have to adjust to new ways of working.  Some jobs decline and new occupations emerge.  Businesses and workers have to adapt.  The downside is that technology is voracious in its appetite for energy and too reliant on fossil fuels which have caused climate change and the destruction of the natural world.  All of these challenges mean that the work of Government is never done.  Government is needed to provide leadership on climate action, job security and the just transition that the planet now requires.  Governments cannot stand still.  The same applies to the EU Council.</p><p>When the Council meets on Thursday, one member state, the United Kingdom, will project its turmoil onto the other 27 members, as it has done periodically throughout its membership.  Sometimes, the UK's disruptive influence has been beneficial in shaking up or confronting bureaucracy and giving the EU more urgency on trade with the wider world.  On other occasions, such as now, the UK's influence is just disruptive.  In her statement this morning, the Prime Minister, Mrs. Theresa May, said:</p><blockquote>The people want us to focus on the other vital issues that matter to them, including building a stronger economy, delivering first class public services and the homes that families need.  These are the public's priorities.</blockquote><p>Mrs May was speaking about the British people but the same is true of the Irish people and people of every nation across the EU.  There is no doubt that future generations in the UK will look back at the lost years when Brexit caused a lack of progress on so many important fronts.</p><p> As the Taoiseach said, the EU Council agenda is wide.  To what extent has dealing with Brexit slowed down, distracted or impeded the progress of the EU on the pressing issues I have mentioned?  On the substantive issues of the Council meeting, this will be the first discussion of the 2021-27 multi-annual financial framework, MFF, for the EU.  I recall the detailed discussions at the conclusion of the last MFF.  First, are all background papers and projections being prepared on the basis that the UK will definitely be out of the Union by 2021 or are separate scenarios being drawn up that would include either a UK contribution to the EU budget or even a scenario based on UK full membership should a second referendum be held in the United Kingdom?  Second, to what extent does this seven-year framework involve a stronger social pillar?</p> <p> Throughout Europe we have witnessed the rise of far right, nationalists and populists feeding on people&rsquo;s insecurities.  Many of those insecurities relate to precarious work, unaffordable housing and weakened public services.  The far right has scapegoated migrants and asylum seekers, but European socialist and labour parties know that the problem is largely to do with inequalities created and maintained by the economy.  What will change in the next seven-year EU spending framework to address these issues and support jobs and people's living conditions in a way that is genuinely fairer?</p> <p> The Council will discuss the Single Market.  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, has said we have only 12 years left to take decisive action to prevent the worst climate change scenarios becoming a reality.  To what extent is the EU Council deliberating on Single Market reforms that will make our economies more ecologically sustainable, with the radical reduction in emissions and fossil fuel use which is now manifestly required?  It is amazing to think that this will be the last full seven-year spending cycle in which we will be able to do the heavy lifting on climate action.  Within 12 years it will be too late.  What changes are planned for the Single Market in that context?</p> <p> The Council will also discuss migration.  In that regard, the Labour Party supports the UN's global migration pact as the foundation of a humane and principled approach to dealing with global migration.  Does the Government support the UN migration pact?  Regarding Ireland's specific concerns under this topic, can the Taoiseach guarantee that every EU Head of Government has received or will receive tomorrow a written briefing on the common travel area so they are all clear about the free movement of people and workers between Ireland and the UK, which will continue regardless of the Brexit outcome and in parallel with EU migration policy?</p> <p> The Council will discuss external relations.  In preparation for the summit with the League of Arab States scheduled for 25 February 2019 what consideration has been given to the idea, which I have mentioned more than once in this House, of a Marshall plan for Europe's neighbourhood?  There is instability and conflict in many Arab states, including Syria, Iraq, Libya, Egypt, Lebanon, Palestine, Sudan and Yemen.  This instability is driving migration to Europe, as well as promoting radicalisation.  Investment and stability are needed in all these countries.  Will the Council discuss meaningful European assistance and investment in Arab countries in Europe&rsquo;s neighbourhood on its border?  We now have evidence of Russian involvement in online disinformation, seeking to manipulate elections and referenda.  What concrete actions will be discussed by the Council to safeguard our democracies?  I welcome the Taoiseach referring to these issues in his statement.  What will be changed before the May European elections to mitigate any such interference?</p> <p> EU leaders will also discuss the reform of the Economic and Monetary Union, EMU.  Based on the papers made available, this appears to be tinkering with the euro currency rather than making any significant progress.  I note in particular that while a stabilisation function was discussed including, most importantly, an unemployment insurance scheme, there has not been agreement on this.  Why not?  It was clear ten years ago that the euro monetary union was radically incomplete.  Do we have to wait for yet another ten years and another economic crisis before measures are taken to ensure greater social protections are built into monetary union?  It could act to automatically counterbalance unemployment during periods of recession.  Will the Taoiseach commit to supporting an EU-wide unemployment insurance scheme?</p> <p> Finally, the EU 27 leaders will meet on Thursday to discuss Brexit, in the absence of Prime Minister May.  Mr. Donald Tusk and President Jean-Claude Juncker have made it clear that the legal text of the withdrawal agreement, including the Irish border backstop, will not be reopened.  This is vital.  When I met my colleagues from the Party of European Socialists last weekend, I was reassured by the detailed information available to them and by the level of understanding and solidarity for Ireland shown by socialist Prime Ministers and leaders from across the EU.  Will the Taoiseach guarantee that no legal changes will be made that weakens the backstop, including in any legal text contained in side letters, annexes or letters of understanding?</p> <p> The Council of 27 will also discuss the possibility of a no-deal scenario.  The Northern Ireland energy regulator has acknowledged that there is insufficient capacity in Northern Ireland to generate electricity to meet its needs.  Northern Ireland needs the all-island energy market.  It is no exaggeration to say that the lights could go out in Northern Ireland if there is a no-deal scenario.  I listened to the absolute bunkum of the some of the Tories when they spoke about floating barges with batteries.  What they are saying about the reality facing people on this island and in Britain is mind-boggling and beyond imagination.  The all-island energy issue is included in the withdrawal agreement but, without that agreement, what provision is being made for a rapid redeployment of energy into Northern Ireland in a hard Brexit scenario?  Ireland cannot make bilateral agreements with the UK to restore it.  I discussed this with Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efčovič, the EU energy Commissioner.  This is an EU competence.  Even if we wanted to, we could not agree a detailed arrangement with the UK so we need to be making those preparations now.</p> <p> Can the Taoiseach assure us that plans are being made to put in place quickly a single issue agreement between the UK and the EU to mitigate the worst harm from a no-deal scenario, which could come about in a little over 100 days?</p><p>Similarly, it is in our vital interest that the all-island agriculture and food safety zone is preserved, but this is much more complicated.  What specific preparations are being made to preserve this in the event of no deal?  I asked these questions of the Taoiseach earlier today and he undertook to give Members a briefing in the context of the stakeholders' meeting.  That is not good enough right now.  Parties in the House that supported a united position over the last two years and who have argued along with our colleagues across Europe need to be fully involved in understanding what is being done in the event of a scenario coming to pass that none of us want, which is a hard exit by Britain from the EU.</p> <p> British politics is in a state of flux.  In my judgment it is likely that Theresa May will survive the challenge to her leadership tonight, who knows, but it is unlikely that the withdrawal agreement will survive a vote in Parliament.  I hear the Taoiseach being optimistic again.  Right now he is in a minority of one in that optimism, but who knows.  There is a real risk that a no-deal scenario will come to pass.  I have said to the Taoiseach before that there is now a real risk that must be prepared for.  A no-deal scenario would be a disaster for us.  The Government must resist that pressure, which will inevitably grow as we reach the cliff edge.</p> <p> It is a real possibility that the UK will, in the end, hold a second referendum to choose between the withdrawal agreement on the table, and the status quo.  According to several surveys, the UK public's desire for a second vote has grown and public appetite for Brexit has declined as it has become unclear what replacement is to be voted on.  I hope the EU is ready to support the remain argument.</p> <p> Ireland received real concessions when we needed them after a rejected treaty vote in the State.  There is every reason for the EU to show understanding, flexibility and responsiveness to the concerns of the UK right now.  Without any compromise on the fundamental principles around issues such as the free movement of people and workers within the Single Market, there is room for clearer, better regulation to be spelled out.  What was offered to the previous Prime Minister, David Cameron, needs to be offered again and better explained.  If those real concerns were addressed there is a real prospect of a second people's vote not only taking place but also-----</p></speech>

Its members have played with the fires of xenophobic nationalism, of anti-immigrant sentiment, of nostalgia for some imagined historical imperial glory and whatever else motivates these rather strange people in the Tory Party.  They are tearing themselves apart currently.  Frankly I am not sorry to see them do so given the dangerous politics they play with and the damage that successive Tory governments have done to working class people in the United Kingdom.</p>  <p>  One hopeful sign from this mess is when Theresa May starts talking about the real possibility of a united Ireland.  Even though she desperately wishes to avert it and while others speak of "my precious union" one has to acknowledge the possibility of a united Ireland.  It is time for us to take it very seriously.  While all of us would prefer some sort of resolution to prevail in the situation, if it does not prevail and Britain crashing out of the EU is on the agenda, then it seems that the issue of a united Ireland also comes very seriously onto the agenda.  It has to be completely unthinkable for us to consider for even one moment the possibility of a border being erected for any reason by anybody in that context.  This is not just the possibility that the Tories or the DUP might wish to erect a border in the circumstances of a hard Brexit: the European Union might insist on it to protect its precious Single Market.  The Tories want to protect the precious union and the EU leaders want to protect their precious market.  Ireland's position has to be to insist that from no direction and for no reason are we willing to accept or co-operate with the installation of a border between the North and the South.  We should argue publicly that in the circumstance where that might become a possibility or threatened from any direction the people north and south of this island should have the right to express their will democratically in a referendum on Irish unity.  Democracy and a commitment to the unity of the island should require that.</p>  <p>  Another interesting aspect of the currently unfolding debacle in the Tory Party, members of which are quite happy to tear each other part, is that the one thing the Tories are capable of uniting on is their fear of a Corbyn government and their fear of a left wing government.  This is the reason Theresa May will survive politically, if she does.  As much as they are taking lumps out of each other they want to stop at any costs the possibility of a left wing Government.  It is worth considering the significance of that, especially given the events unfolding in France at the moment.  Among other considerations that would have been discussed at the European Council, the upheaval and elemental social explosion taking place in France is a welcome counter blast to the rotten politics that have been played out in the Brexit debate and it has been a very welcome counterblast to the terrifying development of the rotten rise of extreme forms of nationalism and the far right taking place all over Europe.</p>  <p>  Although the yellow vest movement is somewhat incoherent, and while there are certainly some dodgy elements operating in certain places, overwhelmingly this is a mass movement of the poor, the dispossessed and the working people who are angry at social and economic inequality and the misguided, unfair and unjust priorities of the Macron government.  These priorities were best characterised by the attempt by the Macron government to on the one hand get rid of a wealth tax and reduce taxes on the rich, and at the same time unload the cost of that measure onto the poor in the form of regressive taxes under an apparently environmental guise that would hit the less well-off.  This is at the base of the yellow vest explosion.  As I said earlier, there are some far right elements in certain places trying to take advantage of this and turn it in a nasty right wing direction but overwhelmingly one can see in the pictures of the protesters that faces are black, white, north African men and women.  The demands they make are for economic and social justice, for an end to precarious work and for fairness in how the tax system works.</p><p>The anger over those issues runs right across Europe and into this country and elsewhere.  In respect of the revolt that is taking place, there are now protestors in Iraq wearing the yellow vests.  In Egypt, where I note this conference referred to in the Council is taking place and where the al-Sisi dictatorship is digging the grave of the Arab Spring, they have banned the sale of yellow vests out of fear that on the anniversary of the Arab Spring, the Arab masses might take to the streets wearing them.  There is an internationalism - the internationalism of the poor, the downtrodden, the vulnerable taking to the streets and demanding economic and social justice.  That is something we should consider strongly for this country, the world and Europe, as the counterblast to the rotten Tories and the far right.</p></speech>

This is one of the largest countries in Europe and a massive tide of protest is taking place.  The yellow vest movement is an inspirational revolt by working people and the poor against the President of the rich, Emmanuel Macron, and his policies.  The protests show that these policies can be challenged.  Austerity has wreaked havoc in French society.  The struggle to make ends meet is now an epidemic.  The Socialist Party and our sister organisation, Gauche R&eacute;volutionnaire, support these movements against anti-working class policies.</p><p>I refer to some quotes from people taking part in the protests.  A young restaurant worker on the minimum wage said, &quot;I did not eat yesterday or at last night's dinner.&quot;  Another said, &quot;We yellow vests represent the poor of France, those with modest or low incomes who are being crushed.&quot;  Another said, &quot;I am here for all those people left crying by the 15th of each month because they have gone into the red.&quot;  That is what has happened because of austerity policies in France and across the EU.  The movements have seen blockades, militant occupations and weekly protests in every major town and city.  There has been important industrial action as well.  Protests involving young people, school students, university students have been met with vicious and brutal state repression, exemplified by the shocking images on social media of more than 140 young people forced to kneel in front of the police with their arms behind their backs, their only crime protesting outside their school.  That is children and that is what is being done by Macron and his police force.  This protest movement has also linked with environmental protests and movements against violence against women, which we witnessed the weekend before last.  The policies of Macron's terror regime are being imposed across Europe and the globe.  As has been mentioned, the sale of yellow vests has been banned in Egypt in case there is contagion.  The mood that exists in France exists in many other countries in Europe, including Ireland.</p><p>When elected in May 2017, Macron was the shiny new face of neoliberalism.  The Taoiseach went out of his way to emulate him and fell head over heels to bask in his radiance - Trudeau, Macron, Varadkar, etc.  There is a warning here for the Taoiseach.  Support for Macron has plummeted and he is now one of the most hated presidents in French history.  This is a millionaire former banker who represents a system built on maintaining inequality and undermining living standards of working class people in the interests of profit.  One yellow vest protestor correctly characterised the concessions Macron was forced to make, when he came out of hiding after a week, as putting plasters on a third-degree burn.  They know much more can be won.  The idea of <i>tous ensemble</i>, everyone together, has become the sentiment in French society and there is great willingness to fight and to get organised.  We need action committees to be brought together from workplaces, schools and the yellow vest protests to discuss and to organise this struggle and campaign.  As we saw in May 50 years ago, due to its economic power and its traditions, the organised working class and trade union movement in France has a crucial role to play.  The day of action on 14 December called by the General Confederation of Labour, CGT, is a step forward.  A 24-hour general strike is needed to put a stop to the Macron government and to force him to go much further.  A system run for private profit means the further squeezing of living standards.  It is essential that this movement unites all working class people of all colours, regardless of background.  Any racist or anti-immigrant sentiment needs to be stood against.  To make these demands a reality, a government of the working class that ends the rule of the CAC 40, major banks and industries that dominate the French economy, the parasites whom Macron represents, is needed.  They should be taken out of the private ownership of profiteers and placed in public ownership under democratic control of working people in an economy planned for the needs of the majority, not run for economic elites.  A struggle for a socialist France can open a struggle for a socialist Europe, uniting working class people in opposition to the rule of the bosses and the EU that represents them.</p><p>I want to take up the situation with regard to Brexit.  We should remind ourselves that the 2016 referendum for withdrawal from Europe was another manifestation of the widespread alienation from political parties that have pushed neoliberal policies for three decades.  The majority of those who voted for Brexit were angry at years of austerity that resulted in falling living standards and cuts in public services.  They were fed up of being told that the pain must be shared when their pockets were being picked to bail out the banks.  Now Theresa May has pulled back on a vote for the draft Brexit agreement at the eleventh hour and faces the sack herself. Solidarity-PBP and the Socialist Party understand and share the anger of ordinary people across Europe.  France is in turmoil.  The Brexit deal is stuck for related reasons.  The system simply cannot deliver for working people and it cannot deliver democratic rights either.  Anger and alienation are widespread and unexpected referendum results and burning barricades in Paris are simply a manifestation of this.</p><p>During the referendum campaign, the RMT rail workers union in Britain and the Northern Ireland Public Service Alliance, NIPSA, the public sector union in the North, both took principled positions of opposition to the EU in favour of a left alternative.  These unions have shown the way and if the trade unions were now to bring their combined weight behind a movement for a new Europe organised in the interests of the 99%, millions of people could be mobilised across these islands and across Europe.  It is not just a question of the trade unions organising to protect jobs and terms and conditions of working people.  The union movement in Ireland has a proud record of uniting working class people, Catholic and Protestant, and has a historic responsibility to act now with resolution in the interests of working people across the island.  The unions must mobilise to counter any measures that result in an increase in sectarian division in the North and there must be no hardening of borders North, South, east or west.</p></speech>

Migration is to be discussed at the Council under the heading of implementation of the comprehensive approach to migration.  Does that comprehensive approach include the increasing securitisation agenda when it comes to migration?  It is undermining and certainly threatening the EU aid budget.  There is a fear of considerable funding going to the securitisation agenda.  The "fortress Europe" image is damaging to the founding principles of the EU.  There is undeniable hypocrisy in President Tusk's recent statement following the Salzburg summit, when he said that we may not agree on everything but we agree that the main goal is stemming illegal migration to Europe.  EU policies and the actions of certain countries created the reasons people are migrating.  I refer to issues such as arms sales, tax measures and unfair trade treaties.  They are the factors keeping those countries impoverished, which leads to migration.  Europe will talk about tackling the root causes of migration but it is much easier to put up barriers.  That also loses sight of the fact that there is far more internal migration within Africa than there is outward migration from Africa.  President Tusk also spoke about co-operation with third countries.  If we look at some of them, however, Libya is a failed state, while Turkey has a questionable human rights agenda.</p>  <p>  Preparation for the upcoming summit with the League of Arab States is also on the Council agenda.  Yemen has to be the main item of that summit.  The conflict going on since 2011 is a seven-year conflict in a country that had so many challenges even without a war.  This war is not about Yemen.  It is a power struggle between Saudi Arabia, backed by the US, and what they see as Iranian influence and support for the Houthi rebels.</p><p>While the peace talks are happening, there has been very little condemnation of the war, the attacks on civilians, the starvation and the malnutrition.  We know about the lucrative arms deals.  French contractors delivered &euro;2 billion worth of equipment to Saudi Arabia.  In the first half of 2017 arms sales from the UK to Saudi Arabia came to &euro;1.25 billion.  While Germany has stopped selling arms to that conflict, there are questions over its motives, as the arms industry is not as vital to Germany's GDP as it is to that of France and the UK.</p> <p> It appears that the EU's economic relationship with Saudi Arabia is more important.  Given the wealth among the Arab countries, surely they have a moral obligation to stop fuelling a conflict that has such consequences for the population and to step up humanitarian aid.  It is reckoned that more than 60% of deaths in Yemen were caused by Saudi airstrikes.</p> <p> South Sudan has experienced nearly five years of civil war with 50% of the population in need of humanitarian aid and millions of people displaced.  It is now on its 12th peace deal which is very fragile.  There is a role for the international community, including the EU, to ensure that this peace deal lasts.  The EU can play a role with those who are genuinely committed to reconciliation and sustainable peace.  Ireland has been very forthcoming in giving vital aid.  More challenging and equally vital is Ireland working through the EU to ensure the peace holds.</p> <p> Regardless of the views and our relationship with the Spanish Government, there is support for Catalan independence.  Two Catalan civil society leaders, seven Catalan politicians, including a former speaker of the parliament, and others are in exile across Europe.  While it is an internal matter the EU could be more proactive in trying to prevent an escalation of unrest in one of its member countries.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-12-12a.408" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1259" speakername="Clare Daly" time="15:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018121200034#GG00200"><p>There is a certain irony that <i>Time </i>magazine's person of the year announced yesterday are journalists when there has not been a single mention of the increasingly precarious situation facing Julian Assange.  The Government has a responsibility to raise this case in the upcoming European Council.  In a fortnight Assange will have spent his seventh Christmas trapped in the Ecuadorian embassy in London.  For six and a half years he has been corralled there by the British Government and refused safe passage to asylum to Ecuador.  He is now an Ecuadorian citizen and still the British Government refuses to let him leave in safety.  The threats to his life and health grow bigger every day.</p><p>Since the election of President Moreno in Ecuador last year, Julian Assange's presence in the Ecuadorian embassy has grown increasingly precarious.  President Moreno has described Assange as a stone in his shoe.  The former president, Mr. Correa, has said that President Moreno would throw Assange out following the first pressure from the United States, which is exactly what we are seeing.  In November the US Department of Justice accidentally revealed the existence of sealed criminal charges against Assange in a document filed in a New York court.  That document read:</p><blockquote>The complaint...and arrest warrant...would need to remain sealed until Assange is arrested in connection with the charges in the criminal complaint and can therefore no longer evade or avoid arrest and extradition in this matter.</blockquote><p>We must remember that this threat of extradition to the US and a lifetime of solitary confinement or worse hang over Julian Assange because he had the audacity to commit acts of actual journalism.  He had the audacity to refuse to become just another stenographer of the powerful like so many of his colleagues because he made available information that threatened the United States' imperial project, information that upset the liberal consensus of Western good guys and the big bad others that we hear about so much, information that was raw, genuine and direct from the source and not spoon-fed by spokespersons or laundered by PR.</p><p>He is now facing criminal charges in the United States because in 2010 he published the collateral murder video which showed US forces gunning down 12 civilians, including two journalists, in an airstrike and laughing about it.  He is facing criminal charges and a lifetime in solitary confinement in a supermax prison because a few months later WikiLeaks published the Afghan war logs, followed by the Iraq war logs, the biggest leak in the history of the United States military.  The Iraq war logs proved that the US Government had covered up 15,000 civilian deaths in Iraq and the US authorities had failed to investigate hundreds of cases of abuse, torture, rape and even murder by Iraqi police and soldiers who killed hundreds of unarmed civilians some of them pregnant women for the crime of approaching checkpoints.</p><p>In light of Assange's contribution to journalism, it is grim and shocking how easily the United States along with its allies in the UK have manipulated both left and right wing mainstream opinion in regard to his character and his work.  We have had a relentless propaganda campaign over the years resulting in the apparently universally recognised idea in the mainstream that his detention is really not something to worry about.  It is regarded as not being that important because it is suggested he is unstable, irresponsible, creepy etc. which is exactly why I am raising it today.  Human rights do not depend on character references.</p><p>The world's media were rightly up in arms over the horrific murder of Jamal Khashoggi on the basis that state-backed attacks on dissident journalists represent a red line that should never be crossed.  I agree with that.  However, if Assange is ever talked about in these days it is never in the context of his arbitrary detention and rather in the context of the smears against his character, which is absolute hypocrisy when we see the outcry at the treatment of Jamal Khashoggi and so on.  A journalist has been arbitrarily detained for six and a half years with no apparent discomfort from any section of the establishment anywhere.  I again ask the Government to raise this case before this man dies inside that embassy.  If they get him out he faces a lifetime in solitary confinement in America.</p><p>In the context of journalists, there is hypocrisy between how we raise the case of Jamal Khashoggi while at the same time refusing to countenance arms boycotts on Saudi Arabia as it slaughters and starves innocent Yemeni civilians.  That has gone on for three years and suddenly now following that murder everybody in Europe wants to talk about it.  They did not care about it when thousands of Yemeni people were being killed - yesterday the media quoted a figure of 60,000.  I appeal to the Government to speak up before it is too late for Julian Assange.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-12-12a.409" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1355" speakername="Mick Wallace" time="15:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018121200034#GG00300"><p>Last Thursday we discussed legislation introduced by Senator Colette Kelleher on family reunification for refugees.  Before we could even start debating it, we were told the Government would not provide a money message for it.  I am concerned that the Government would take such an approach.  Migration is on the agenda for this week's European Council meeting.  The background notes strike a celebratory tone.  The main infographic has a caption which boasts that EU support for Libyan coastguards is paying off.  It has trained 237 coastguard officers and has rescued 13,185 people up to 30 August, a 190% increase over 2017.</p><p>Operation Sophia is a military blockade of the Mediterranean which is forcing people who are fleeing wars, famine and economic conditions to remain trapped in brutal and inhumane conditions in Libya.  The root causes of the flight of these people are the economic and foreign policies of the global north.  Only two weeks ago in the D&aacute;il the Minister of State at the Department of Defence confirmed that it was a military mission.  The root causes will not be addressed by the &euro;2.5 billion in aid funding, the Common Security and Defence Policy missions or by partnering with authorities in already destabilised countries to stop people crossing their borders.</p><p>The global north needs to recognise that the aid narrative is based on the falsehood that EU countries become rich because of their own brilliance, hard work and good institutions, and now reach out across the chasm to give generously of its surplus to poor countries, helping them up the development ladder.  The anthropologist Jason Hickel has just written a wonderful book, <i>The Divide</i>.  I suggest people read it for Christmas.  He has written:</p><blockquote>This story presupposes a fundamental disjuncture between the wealth of rich nations and the poverty of poor ones, as if the two have nothing at all to do with one another, either historically or today.<br /><br />Nothing could be further from the truth.<br /><br />In reality, the aid that the North gives to the South is vastly outstripped by financial resources that flow the other direction, in the form of interest on external debt, profit repatriation, illicit financial flows and so on.  In fact, for every dollar of aid that the North gives to the South, the South loses up to $24 in net outflows because of how the global economy is structured.  The South is a net creditor to the North.  Poor countries are effectively developing rich countries, not the other way around.</blockquote><p>Hickel's remarks are based on research published in 2017 by the US-based Global Financial Integrity and the centre for applied research at the Norwegian School of Economics.  It is the most comprehensive assessment of resource transfers ever undertaken and it puts Ireland at the centre of the crisis in the global south.  If we look at all the years since 1980, net outflows add up to a mad total of $16.3 trillion.  That is how much money has been drained out of the global south over the past few decades.  One of the central ways in which this transfer of wealth from the poor to the rich has been executed is through illicit tax flows through tax havens, of which Ireland is one.<br/><br/>It is not Common Security and Defence Policy missions but stopping the flow of arms into the global south that will address one of the root causes of people fleeing war and instability.  In South Sudan, for instance, English, Ukrainian, Israeli and Emirates firms are on record as having sold arms to both sides in the dreadful war there.  The annual report from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute finds that global arms sales have increased by 2.5% since 2016 and the top 100 arms manufacturers sold $398 billion worth of arms in 2017.  Of these sales, 57% were made by US companies while western European companies accounted for 23.8%.  This effectively means that 81% of weapons sales by the biggest 100 global companies were based in NATO countries.  The West produces the armaments that heighten conflicts from northern Africa to central Asia.  America, France, the UK, Germany, Italy, Bulgaria, Spain, Belgium, Poland, Romania, the Czech Republic, Norway, Switzerland, Finland and Greece have all profited by fuelling the war on the people of Yemen, where up to 14 million are at risk of starvation.  The situation in Yemen is horrific and we have stayed silent on it.  We do not send peacekeeping missions to Yemen.  We send our politicians to shake hands and do business with men who are using famine as a weapon of war.  <br/><br/>Neither will the root causes be addressed by sending the Naval Service on a military mission to the Mediterranean to help Libyan militias to capture refugees and bring them back to sites of torture and rape.  The stories coming out of the detention centres there are nothing short of shocking.  Most of the detained are in Tripoli and the fighting has kicked off again with opposition militias, many of whom are being backed by the UN.  They are fighting for control of the north west of the country.  M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res and its partner SOS M&eacute;diterran&eacute;e have been forced by the Italian state and other European governments to terminate operation by its search and rescue vessel, the<i>Aquarius</i>.  The EU wants the people who are trying to escape the mayhem we have created for them to rot in detention or drown in the ocean.  The EU describes this as a plan that is paying off.  We should raise our voice and challenge this because it is terrible.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-12-12a.412" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1347" speakername="Mattie McGrath" time="15:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018121200035#HH00300"><p>Indeed I am, in the spirit of Christmas and the spirit of the acclamation that Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin made to the nation in the course of this pre-European Council meeting debate.  As the singer Johnny Logan would say, "What's another year?"  What is five minutes in the context of another year?  It is nothing.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach is imithe now but almost every time that a meeting of the European Council has taken place in the last year, it has been preceded by one crisis or another.  It has been a very rocky and bumpy road.  However, the crisis engulfing the politics and Parliament of the United Kingdom now appears to be genuinely chaotic and looks set to confirm our worst fears in terms of the negative impact of a hard Brexit.  It is astonishing.  Management of the crisis, if it was ever real, is now slipping out of all control and that is quite apparent to one and all.  Despite her determination and resilience, Mrs. May is, to all intents and purposes, a lame duck Prime Minister who appears likely to become yet another victim of Tory party infighting over Europe.  It is a sad spectacle to watch as the uncertainty around the effects on our economy and many other economies grows.  </p>  <p>  Mrs. May postponed the vote on the withdrawal agreement in Westminster because she simply could not generate the support required for what almost everyone agrees is a deeply problematic arrangement.  It is unfair to members of the UK Parliament to expect them to sign up to and support an agreement that locks them into a backstop arrangement from which they cannot extract themselves.  As we know, our nearest neighbours are a very proud people whose ancestors conquered the world and developed the British Empire.  Pride, which is one of the seven deadly sins, is a big part of the problem here.  The British want to be proud and to borrow a phrase, they want to make England great again.  It seems that the backstop issue is one where politics, as the art of the possible and of compromise, is destined to fail.  Is m&oacute;r an trua an rud sin.  It is very sad.  </p>  <p>  The British Prime Minister said that she would go back to the EU and seek further clarification on the legal nature of the backstop protocol but before she even landed in Brussels, the door was slammed in her face by Mr. Juncker which is a real pity.  While I must recognise and acknowledge the support we have received from our EU colleagues, I am suspicious of it at the same time.  The support is certainly there and the agreement, on which I was briefed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, when it was finalised, is very good for Northern Ireland.  Indeed, it is quite a good agreement for the Republic of Ireland too.  While we must acknowledge that, we must also ask, at what price?  What will we be expected to deliver afterwards, when and if there is a crash-out Brexit?  There is serious uncertainty about the impact of a crash-out Brexit on our lives and our economy.  This is especially true with regard to rural Ireland and the agricultural sector which exports so much of its produce to the United Kingdom.  </p>  <p>  The EU's approach is giving fuel to those elements of the UK political class who have their faces set against any constructive deal.  Closing the door in Mrs. May's face before she had even gotten off the plane was not constructive; she should have been embraced.  This has been going on from the very start.  There has been no empathy for or understanding of the British position.  Neither has there been any examination or in depth analysis of the reasons for the Brexit vote.  We all know that there were many reasons for that vote, with immigration being only one.  Other reasons include a lack of autonomy and a sense of being governed from afar by big brother, as well as of being neglected.  Neglect by the EU was demonstrated during our financial crisis with the so-called bail out, which I described as a clean out.  I voted against it because the EU charged us 6% while the IMF loaned us money at less than 3%.  In the meantime, we face unimaginable consequences if a hard Brexit or no deal scenario comes to pass.  People are so fearful, especially those who have invested heavily in businesses.  There are many fears with regard to job security too.  </p>  <p>  Added to this crisis, the European Council must also deal with the continuing difficulties with Italy and the ongoing rows about budgetary oversight.  The Italian people and their leaders are simply not prepared to take threats about punitive financial penalties lying down and nor should they.  They have seen what happened to us and to other member states like Greece in the past.  Youth unemployment in Italy is over 30%, which is staggering.  The population is expected to face declining living standards, lowered prospects for upward mobility and high unemployment.  This is the next crisis.  The hard men in Brussels might not get away with their tough talk so easily when it comes to the Italians.  Yet again, the EU leadership is adopting a hardline approach to this issue which is astonishing the Italian people.  It is also antagonising them.  They are starting to look over their shoulders and to understand why the British voted for Brexit.  As I said, the Italian people and their leaders are not prepared to take threats about punitive financial penalties lying down.</p>  <p>  These issues point to massive levels of disruption up ahead.</p><p>We know that if the UK economy is hit, we will suffer badly.  As I always say, if England catches a cold, we get the flu.  The UK is our nearest trading partner.  Many Irish people live there and many of our businesses are intertwined.  If Italy enters a severe debt crisis, the entire European economy will suffer major damage.  That these two scenarios look more likely than ever is deeply concerning to my constituents, throughout Tipperary from Carrick-on-Suir, Clonmel and Cashel to Thurles, Roscrea, Templemore and Nenagh, including the farming community.  There is already an astonishing crisis in the beef industry and many other farming sectors.  It is shocking.</p> <p> I could not finish without saying something about the uncaring attitude at EU level towards the persecution of Christians, as well as Muslim and other minorities, in the Middle East.  Yemen was mentioned, where there is an atrocious war.  I recently visited the Middle East and the situation there is shocking.  Countries such as France and England export massive amounts of weapons to countries in the region, thereby helping to heap destruction on men, women and children.  The war in Yemen is savage war.  I have tried on several occasions - since I first went there 2011 - to have a meaningful debate in the House about the persecution of Christians and other minorities in Middle Eastern countries such as Yemen.  I have received no support and there is no appetite across all the parties.  They are able to unify for everything else.  They unified for months to repeal the eighth amendment to the Constitution and to rush legislation through the House, but there has been no debate on this issue.  They have turned a blind eye to it because we might offend someone in Europe.  It is outrageous but I thank the Ceann Comhairle who allowed four of us, Deputies O'Keeffe, Grealish, me and one other, to engage in a Topical Issue debate on Holy Thursday evening a couple of years ago.  That is all we got.  Were it not for the Ceann Comhairle, we would have got nothing.</p> <p> The parties have turned a blind eye to this issue in order to be the good boys and girls of Europe and to salute the EU.  When it says "Jump", the parties ask "How high?"  The Minister of State has done all the jumping, the box-ticking and the tours of European capitals, and she has received support for the country, which must be recognised, but at what price was it?  C&eacute;n costas a bh&iacute; leis sin?  That is my worry.  What is going on behind closed doors and to what are we signed up?  We signed up to the UN declaration on migrants this week.  What else have we signed up to or exposed ourselves to without any debate in Parliament?</p> <p> The media also have a role to play, and I extol them to be more investigative and energetic in talking about these issues and the lack of debate on them in Parliament.  Last week, the decks were able to be cleared of any business to ensure a horrific abortion Bill could be rushed over the line.  There was co-operation from all the parties.  Even expressions of sympathy for Fine Gael's former Taoiseach, the late Liam Cosgrave, were pulled from the agenda to accommodate the unified parties in ensuring the Bill's passage.  The Fianna F&aacute;il Party propped up Fine Gael on that issue more than anything else, against the wishes of its members as voted for at its Ard-Fheis, and now it seems there will be another year of the confidence and supply agreement.</p> <p> Most people want rid of Theresa May because of the appalling way that housing, agriculture, children etc. have been neglected.</p></speech>

After 45 years of membership of the EU, the UK is leaving on 29 March next, after which it will have third-country status.  That is the current position although things may change.  The UK electorate was not told the truth during the referendum campaign.  The debate was ugly and nasty, at times, and centred around immigration, which is now one of the major global issues.  A false scenario was presented to the electorate, and the UK public and Members of Parliament have only recently become aware of the reality that exists.  The British Prime Minister recently explained the hard facts of the situation, which has led to her difficulties in getting approval in Parliament for the withdrawal agreement.  If nothing else, Theresa May is resilient and tenacious, and we await developments in that regard in London this evening.</p>  <p>  I note the comments made by the leader of Fianna F&aacute;il, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, earlier.  Providing political stability to the country at this dangerous time is welcome.  Irish businesses are doubtless becoming exercised about Brexit, as are the wider public.  It was a difficult decision for Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin to embark on the road he outlined for us earlier, and it will cause difficulties within our party, but it is in the national interest.  When one compares what is happening in UK politics with what is happening here, there is a significant contrast.  In general, people will welcome the political stability he has offered.</p>  <p>  I listened to a great speech by a former British Prime Minister, John Major, in Dublin yesterday.  He is such a sensible, pragmatic man and politician.  One of the main concerns in his address was the future of Anglo-Irish relations.  If the UK is no longer in the European Union, it is clear there will be less opportunity for interaction with Ministers from both jurisdictions to discuss the major issues of the day.  He outlined many other concerns but that was one of which we must be conscious.</p>  <p>  The major issue is to prepare for a hard Brexit.  We need to be prepared for Britain crashing out of the European Union, that is, a disorderly Brexit.  I note that the Cabinet mandated all Departments yesterday to give full priority to activating their plans for a no-deal or disorderly Brexit.  We need to prepare for the no-deal scenario.  There was some discussion in the House earlier on the legislation which the Oireachtas will have to pass in preparation.  It needs to be addressed quickly and considered over the Christmas recess with a view to dealing with the situation in the new year.  It will be necessary to hire customs officers, vets and food and safety inspectors for our ports and airports, a matter which I assume the Government is dealing with as we speak.  Businesses need to be fully aware of the situation.  Many other issues will be discussed at the European Council meeting, including the multi-annual financial framework.  I hope that cap can be protected, as I have previously told the Minister of State.  Migration is also an important issue, and it is probably one of the reasons that Brexit is happening.  I hope that practical measures can be taken to deal with the major issue of migration, which affects Europe and the rest of the world.</p></speech>

It indirectly relates to the European Council because it seems the Council will concern nothing but the nature of politics in France, Italy and, most of all, Britain.  How we engage in politics, however, is part of the discussion.</p>  <p>  Before I entered the Chamber, I was working in the bowels of the Joint Committee on Climate Action and, therefore, I did not hear Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin's speech, but he had the good courtesy to approach me to inform me of his decision.  It is only good courtesy of me to contribute with honesty because I had also spoken to him in private about the issue last week.</p><p>We happened to have a Green Party office party upstairs in a pub while the Fine Gael national executive moved in downstairs.  The two met briefly and we chatted about our political situation.  I did not expect this D&aacute;il to run through the next budget.  I thought it would go after Brexit had been done.  As I said yesterday at a public meeting on the 100th anniversary of the First D&aacute;il, we have done a good job in this D&aacute;il over the past two and a half to three years.  It seems like only yesterday the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, was a mere slip of a new backbencher.  I did not think we would last this long or that she would last this long.  Collectively, it has been better that we did this.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-12-12a.420" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1294" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="16:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018121200037#KK00300"><p>I would prefer us to use this next year wisely and not do the same as we did over the past three years.  We have been strong in our approach to the Brexit process.  We worked for consensus and were strong not because there was a confidence and supply agreement between Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael but because there was widespread agreement here on the broad strategy and tactics applied.  On the fundamental issue of whether there is a backstop agreement, there has not been a dissenting voice in this House.</p>  <p>  The chaos in the UK political system, in both the Labour and the Conservative Parties, on this issue has given us strength in a way that is unimaginable in our historic relationship with the neighbouring isle.  We should be very careful not to antagonise what must be a sense of absolute dismay within the UK at how its system is not coping with this real challenge.  We should stand up for, and insist on, a certain honesty over there that the Irish backstop is not the key dividing issue.  It was used by various sides, particularly the UK Treasury and Chancellor of the Exchequer, to get a soft economic Brexit, a customs arrangement of some sort to assist British business in what was always going to be a difficult situation.  The political situation in Northern Ireland somewhat set up that opportunity but to then turn it around and say it is all about the backstop is a slightly dishonest approach.  Without any disrespect to the people over there, who do not need to be lectured to, we should hold that line and demand that the Labour and the Conservative Parties do not distort the reality of what is happening.</p>  <p>  Somebody used a metaphor during the week for the role of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, saying he has to be careful not to be like Colonel Nicholson in "The Bridge On the River Kwai".  People may remember the film about the British officers imprisoned by the Japanese and building the Burma rail line, and the bridge across the river.  It was fraught and there were all sorts of difficulties and tensions.  When eventually the bridge is built the British officer leading the prisoners feels great pride but when he realises that his allies are about to blow it up he has a sense that he does not want them to do that.  If we feel this deal or withdrawal agreement that we have constructed, like a two year bridge construction job, is the be all and end all, our protecting it would be a bit like Colonel Nicholson in not wanting it to be blown up.  If it has to go, it has to go.</p>  <p>  We work very closely with our party in the UK and it wants a second vote, as do our colleagues in the North.  We should not stand in the way of that through pride in the construction of the withdrawal agreement.  We do not play a role because it is a golden rule of referenda to leave other countries to hold their debate.  This issue, however, might be slightly different and break that rule because we are being dragged into it in a way that is not quite honest or true.  That gives us a certain license to clarify the truth should it come to a second vote and I hope it will because I hope Britain does not leave.  It fundamentally weakens our union, our relationship with the neighbouring island and if there is a possibility of that being reconsidered by the British people I hope that arrives.  </p>  <p>  I have friends on the Brexit side and I have quizzed them to try to understand why.  They would not be Deputy Boyd Barrett's friends on the socialist side, they are from the business side although there was socialist support for Brexit two or three years ago.  The business argument is strange because it saying that Europe and the West in general are in decline and it asks why it would hitch itself to a declining global institution when development is occurring in India and China and elsewhere.  Fintan O'Toole wrote a brilliant article last week on the historical mythology behind some of this thinking.  I think it almost goes back to the Elizabethan era when Francis Drake and others were out on the high seas.  They had to have this ability to do trade deals and to act in that way on the global stage.  That is where their thinking comes from.  It is deeply flawed because global trade and the globalised model will not work on a privateer basis.  We need to reconstruct globalisation towards sustainability in every way and towards sustainability in social and environmental policy.  </p>  <p>  It was interesting that in his contribution today the Taoiseach referred to another issue for discussion at the Council, the implementation of the Services Directive, the radical scaling up of that project to deliver greater competitiveness and economic growth.  He referred to the Copenhagen Economics report, Making EU Trade in Services Work for All.  I briefly availed of the chance to try to read some of that document before speaking.  To my mind, it did not address this issue.  I do not get a strong sense from it or in anything I have heard from the Taoiseach that the economic model has to change, that it has to be for all.  The rise in right wing, nationalist and populist sentiment in Europe is because we do not have that collective care for how an ultra-competitive, ultra-productive and ultra-growth-orientated globalised economy can look after all.  It does not look after all.  That has to change.</p>  <p>  Further on in his speech the Taoiseach referred to disinformation and the role of political operators or Facebook and others as being on the agenda for discussion.  Deputy Naughton and I happened to be in the House of Commons the week before last attending a committee hearing on disinformation and the regulation of Facebook.  I asked Facebook whether it would apply the General Data Protection Regulation, GDPR, in all its global operations and it said it would, that it is the new standard.  That connects with the Brexit issue.  No matter what Britain does, in this critical area of digital services and in every aspect of the digital revolution, Facebook will apply GDPR standards, and effectively the European Court of Justice will remain the arbiter of disputes in that area, as will EU legislation because that is increasingly the one global standard.  We have to be careful.  Where do we stand on the regulation of Facebook and the new digital services economy?  We have to stand for workers' rights and better pay.  We do not stand for the American growth-at-all-costs and greed-is-good model.  That old economic model is dead and gone.  We need a new and different one. </p>  <p>  To come full circle, we should apply that thinking in the year ahead of us, start thinking and doing things differently and try to achieve the same consensus on some issues that we achieved consensus on the Brexit negotiations so that we have strength in the development of our economy in every way.</p><p>I will give some examples of where we should apply that.  We can refer to it in our discussions on the European Council.  First, in our budget approach we should heed what Seamus Coffey said last week, which we all know has validity to it and is worth attention.  Before having another budget we should make sure that it is not just the usual election budget where we buy votes either with tax cuts or with spending as that is not the key priority for us.  Could we achieve consensus on that in the future?</p> <p> Could we also take what we are doing in the Joint Committee on Climate Action, which we know is central to where the economy has to go?  We know that by the end of next year under European Union governance rules we must have a national energy and climate action plan that is fit for the following ten and 20 years.  Could we work in consensus on a revised national development plan that delivers some of the objectives of decarbonisation that we seek.</p> <p> One could broaden it out as there is a range of different areas where people might seek consensus.  When Pope Francis was here the Taoiseach mentioned a new covenant between church and State.  Could we in a safe space, in a synodal way, without the understandable confrontation we have seen in the past six months in terms of the abortion issue, bring people from churches and none together to work collaboratively in a broader way, much as we did recently with the Citizens' Assembly and other debates, to consider issues such as the role of religion in the education system or in the health system?  I say that having attended my own local parish meeting the other night which asked the exact same question.  It is happening from the ground up so why would we not try to do it from the top down at the same time?  That would make this country a very interesting place because some of the values in such a forum might inform a more social, caring and environmentally sustainable economy.</p> <p> We have not answered those hard questions in the past three years.  We have not said how we will fund third level education.  Neither have we said how we will fund the media.  There are so many different areas where we are failing and where what we are doing is not working.  To return to my central point, we should go to Brussels this week somewhat proud, first of the solidarity our European colleagues have shown to us.  I was at a meeting yesterday and I mind an image which came to me.  It would be akin to Wolfe Tone sailing to Bantry Bay and instead of facing a storm him reaching it on a sunny day.  Europe came to our aid in this time in a way that was real.  It came home to us that solidarity with our European colleagues can deliver real strength.  We should thank them for that.  We should not antagonise, look down on, demean or get into a slagging war with the UK no matter what the 50 Tory MPs on the nationalist side say, which is very antagonistic towards us.  We should not rise to that.  We should retain our close relationships and good friendships with the likes of John Major and so many others in that party and in the Labour Party, despite the lack of leadership we are seeing in that quarter and the blame it puts on the Irish backstop, which beggars belief as a political analysis of the political issues they face.</p> <p> We are established 100 years and we need to think about what we will do in the next year in an innovative way.  Deputy Boyd Barrett and I were part of the debate yesterday.  I thought it was a useful discussion.  We should bring that thinking into this Chamber and for however long next year as we would do the State some service.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-12-12a.422" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1337" speakername="Helen McEntee" time="16:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018121200038#LL00200"><p>I thank Deputies for their statements in advance of the December European Council.  The Taoiseach already spoke in some detail about expectations for the Article 50 meeting on Brexit, the euro summit, and several items for discussion tomorrow and Friday.  That includes the multi-annual financial framework, which I will go into in more detail in due course, the Single Market, migration, security and defence, and external relations, as well as the fight against racism and xenophobia, disinformation, and climate change.</p>  <p>  As the Taoiseach mentioned, I will speak about the other issues on the agenda of the European Council, in particular the multi-annual financial framework, and preparations for the next strategic agenda, including the outcome of the citizens' dialogues and consultations on the future of Europe.  We will have a chance for further questions next week.  I have taken many of the suggestions and statements that were made on board ahead to the meeting.</p>  <p>  On the next multi-annual financial framework, which is to cover the period from 2021 to 2027, the House will recall that the June European Council invited the Council and the European Parliament to examine the Commission proposals in a comprehensive manner and as soon as possible.  At the European Council this week, leaders will review the progress that has been made on this by the Austrian Presidency in the negotiations over the past six months.  While this is the first time the leaders will meet and have a detailed discussion, this has been ongoing within the General Affairs Council, which I attend, and also the finance committee, the agriculture committee and all of the other various bodies for almost two years.  I expect that leaders will call on the incoming Romanian Presidency to advance the next phase of the negotiations with a view to reaching agreement at the European Council in autumn 2019.</p>  <p>  The European project has helped to transform Ireland from one of the least developed member states when we joined, to one of the more prosperous today.  We all recognise how we have benefitted from membership of the EU and it is important to use that experience to help shape the debate on the future of Europe and what our priorities should be.  The post-2020 MFF comes at a time of change and adjustment for the EU.  Long-term challenges such as economic competitiveness and climate change, emerging challenges to international trade and access to the Single Market, as well as international challenges, such as migration, security and terrorism have become more pronounced.  The departure of the UK will also cause short and longer-term practical challenges for the MFF, the most obvious being a smaller budget that might entail member states paying more.</p>  <p>  With Ireland's growing prosperity, we have moved from being a net beneficiary to a net contributor to the EU budget.  Recognising how we have benefitted in the past, we are open to contributing more, provided that it meets European added value objectives.  From Ireland's perspective, as Deputies have already outlined, it is important that current policies with demonstrated value continue to be properly supported.  The CAP remains a particular priority for Ireland.  Expenditure in the area of agriculture helps support 44 million jobs across the EU, while contributing to food security and safety, rural sustainability and environmental standards.</p>  <p>  Cohesion is a traditional policy that is also important in helping member states to unlock their economic potential, which will benefit all of us in the long run.  As a country that has benefitted from cohesion in the past we see that other newer or smaller member states which join should benefit in the same way.</p>  <p>  In particular, I welcome the emphasis on other policies which function well, such as ERASMUS+, the Connecting Europe Facility, Horizon, which supports research and development, and the PEACE+ and INTERREG programmes which are part of the cross-Border community initiatives.  I believe that budgets for such fundamental areas should be protected and we hope that they will be.  We also acknowledge the concerns of our partners and support investment in evolving priorities including migration, climate change, digital transformation and security and defence, which again must bring added European value.</p>  <p>  In terms of the strategic agenda, a meeting will take place in Sibiu next May where leaders will also discuss the main outcomes of the citizens' consultations that have been taking place across the Union.  This initiative has encouraged people in all member states to have their say on the future shape and direction of the European Union.  I was joined by the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste last November when we launched our own citizens' dialogue on the future of Europe in Trinity College Dublin.  I then hosted a series of regional dialogues in Galway, Cork, Donegal, Meath, and Dublin, culminating in an event in the Royal Hospital Kilmainham on Europe Day.  A future of Europe website was also set up to raise public awareness and to help people to engage in the overall debate.  We also travelled to various universities.  Many of the institutions such as the European Movement Ireland, the Institute of International and European Affairs, IIEA, the Commission and the Parliament have all hosted their own series of events, including ones for industry and sector representative groups.</p>  <p>  Our citizens' dialogues were characterised by strong positivity about the EU and Ireland's role within it.  For the future, our citizens want to see the EU continue to do what it does well, by supporting programmes that deliver concrete benefits for all, such as the Common Agricultural Policy and ERASMUS+.  In Ireland, Horizon 2020 has been especially beneficial.</p>  <p>  It was clear that we should continue to focus on implementing practical measures that improve the lives of our citizens, such as the completion of the Single Market, especially in services, and the full implementation of the digital Single Market.  As Mark Rutte said recently, if we implemented fully the Single Market in the area of goods and services we could add &euro;1 trillion to the overall budget of the European Union, which would have a positive impact on the economy of all member states.</p>  <p>  Our citizens also want the EU to focus on current challenges including climate change, migration, terrorism, cybersecurity and cross-border crime; and to maintain the principle of subsidiarity by ensuring that decisions are taken at the appropriate level.  Yesterday at the General Affairs Council we had a discussion over lunch on subsidiarity.  At the outset the Commissioner said not to ask him to explain what subsidiarity means, because it means different things to different people.</p><p>Throughout the dialogues, what was very interesting was that some people felt Europe interfered too much, particularly in the context of legislation in areas such as agriculture, the environment and small and medium enterprises, whereas others they felt it did not interfere enough, and still others felt it should be more involved in social issues.  The question is how we make it work and how we ensure the Union is strong while, at the same time, ensuring that people feel it is democratic.</p> <p> A number of proposals have been forward in the context of ensuring further scrutiny of legislation and building on the REFIT programme, which is ongoing.  There are proposals to ensure more transparency with regard to legislation and to make sure it is fit for purpose.  There is also the question of ensuring that people are connected from the ground up, particularly by means of proposals whereby local authorities within each member state would have greater connectivity and access to the European Parliament and the Commission.  This gets to the heart of some of the issues raised by Deputy Boyd Barrett in that people would feel that their issues and concerns at local level are also being raised at European level.</p> <p> An overarching theme in the citizens' dialogues was the need to ensure fairness in an increasingly competitive world, that is, fairness between member states, fairness in education and employment opportunities and fairness between generations.  Citizens want to tackle social exclusion and they want stronger interventions at European level in combating discrimination, integrating migrants and improving access to services.  they also want more investment in young people in the context of education, training and innovation.  I welcome the Commission's proposal to double the amount spent on young people.  Citizens want the EU to be a global leader in tackling climate change, with incentives for the transition to renewable energies, along with more protection for rural landscapes and a concerted effort to close the rural-urban divide.</p> <p> On external relations, citizens believe that the EU has a moral imperative to do more for countries to the south and east and to promote education and empowerment in Africa.  They also believe globalisation should not be allowed to proceed at the expense of human rights.</p> <p> It is clear that citizens want the EU to engage better and to explain and communicate its policies and overall objectives.  We learned that the Union needs to reaffirm its relevance in the daily lives of its citizens and that this needs to be constant, not just at a time of crisis or change.  During the dialogues, I announced &euro;100,000 worth of funding to support individuals, groups and organisations in projects aiming to communicate European issues.  Similar funding was given out last year and it will be announced again early next year to allow community groups and organisations to apply.</p> <p> The citizens' dialogue process in Ireland has been of invaluable assistance in creating the vision of an attractive EU that citizens can trust and support.  I am grateful to everyone who responded to our call to get involved.  I was pleased to launch the report on the process in October.  It is available for anybody to read.  Along with other member states, we have provided a report to the Commission, which has compiled a composite report for presentation to the European Council this week.  The intention is that this will guide leaders as they work to identify key priorities in advance of the informal summit that will take place in Sibiu next May.  At that meeting, leaders will prepare the strategic agenda for the EU from 2019 to 2024, with a view to agreeing it at the European Council in June 2019.</p> <p> The European Council is expected to take note of the Commission proposal for a long-term climate strategy for the EU and to invite the Council to prepare for discussions early next year.  This is, of course, a very important issue and we will participate actively in discussions.</p> <p> The agenda for the December European Council covers a wide range of issues.  As the Taoiseach made clear, Brexit remains very much a priority for the Government and we will use every opportunity at this critical time to ensure that our interests are protected.  At the same time, we will continue to play a constructive role on the issues which are of significant concern to our partners and the EU as a whole.  I thank Deputies for their attention and for their remarks.  I look forward to the discussion we will have during questions next week.</p></speech>

The legislation was enacted in July and families are waiting anxiously due to the dilemma they face regarding the registration of their children at birth.  They have been waiting now for six months.  I have put down questions on the matter regularly only to receive a standard reply from the Minister for Health to the effect that it is going through a process having regard to Parts 2, 3 and 9 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015.  The Minister says he intends to have Parts 2 and 3 of the Act commenced as soon as possible.  We are waiting for issues relating to Part 9 to be sorted out also.  Just last week, the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection said the provisions will not be implemented now until some time in 2019.  A lot of people are very frustrated by this as they feel it is being put on the long finger and that there is no real will or urgency to bring the legislation over the line.  I have received an email from LGBT Ireland to say its representatives had met with a senior civil servant from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to discuss the outstanding matter of Part 9 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 and that the outcome of the said meeting had been disappointing and unexpected with officials advising there were technical errors in the provisions as drafted.  It is now proposed to correct these errors by way of amendments on Committee Stage of the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Bill 2017.  This lengthy process will push the commencement date into 2019.</p>  <p>  I have been a Member of the D&aacute;il for seven years and I have seen how there is no problem for the Government when it wants to bring in Bills dealing with technical issues.  Given that the errors referred to here are technical, there should be no problem introducing without debate amendments to deal with them by agreement with all parties.  That is what I want to hear this evening.  Why is there no urgency about this?  I ask the Minister of State to explain how technical these issues are and how difficult it will be to bring forward amendments on Committee Stage of the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Bill 2017.  Many people are interested to know what the status of the legislation is and how quickly the Government wants to proceed with it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-12-12a.432" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1272" speakername="Pat Breen" time="16:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018121200040#SS00400"><p>I thank Deputy Joan Collins for raising the matter and acknowledge her special interest in the subject on behalf of her constituents.  It is important that she raises these issues.  I apologise on behalf of the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, who is attending the Seanad and cannot take the issue herself.</p>  <p>  This is a complex issue.  Certain sections of Part 9 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 provide for the registration and re-registration the birth of a donor-conceived child and, in particular, make possible the registration of details of "parent" as well as of "mother" and "father" where required, which is something all Members agree with.  The current position is that these sections need to be amended to correct technical errors and have yet to be commenced.  It is Minister's intention to make the necessary amendments on Committee Stage of the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Bill 2017.  Commencement of the provisions is also dependent on commencement of Parts 2 and 3 of the 2015 Act, which is the responsibility of the Minister for Health.</p>  <p>  The Children and Family Relationships (Amendment) Act 2018 was enacted on 24 July 2018.  It was introduced to correct typographical and technical errors in and facilitate the subsequent commencement of Parts 2 and 3 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015.  As such, this is a complex matter with issues overlapping where one Act must move with the other.  There are important administrative and operational arrangements to be put in place to facilitate the implementation of Parts 2 and 3, including the establishment of a national donor-conceived persons register and the appointment of authorised persons under the Act.  The Minister understands it is the intention of the Minister for Health that Parts 2 and 3 of the 2015 Act will be commenced as soon as possible.  While I do not have a date to hand, I will be meeting the Minister for Health later and will ask him to communicate directly with Deputy Joan Collins in this regard.  In order to progress the commencement of the relevant Parts, officials from the General Register Office, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and the Department of Health are working together to ensure that the appropriate legislative, regulatory, and operational mechanisms are in put place to allow for the earliest possible commencement of all relevant legislation to facilitate birth registration of donor-conceived children.  Collaboration is ongoing between the three bodies.</p>  <p>  The Minister is aware of the impact this issue is having on affected families.  The Deputy outlined those on behalf of her own constituents in Dublin.  The Minister acknowledges in particular the position of same-sex female couples wishing to have the second partner registered as "parent" and the pressing need to proceed with commencement as soon as possible.  The Deputy has been working on this for some time and I understand where she is coming from on it.  I will ensure that both line Ministers are aware of the matters she has raised in the House this evening.</p></speech>

This parent says that she and her wife have been together since 2003.  They married in 2009 under UK legislation.  They both made the decision to have their first child in 2013.  They both attended appointments.  She was there when their daughter was born and through the sleepless nights and first steps.  However, per the State, only her wife is a parent.  In 2015, she was pregnant during the marriage equality referendum and endured all of the horrible comments about LGBTQ families but she was hopeful that the Children and Families Relationship (Amendment) Act would be progressed.  For all that it seemed to be rushed through, in September when her son was born, there was still no movement on the commencement of the Act and once again she and her wife had to deal with the inconvenience, expense and annoyance of swearing an affidavit that he had only one parent to get a birth certificate or passport.</p> <p> She says that problems arise when they have to travel to England.  They are going over to England to see her grandparents.  There is a lot of hassle.  All of these families have the same experience.  I understand that commencing this Act is complex and involves amending legislation but it could be moved along much more quickly with the parts put in place.  Even if a date could be set, we could tell people that this is going to happen by this date or as close as possible to it.  People feel a bit lost in the legislative process.</p></speech>

As the Deputy has rightly pointed out, there are stories of parents in similar situations and this needs to be dealt with.  This is complex and there are technical issues involved.  It is important to get this right to ensure that there are no problems afterwards, that it is good legislation, and that the technical difficulties, including both parents being recognised not only when they are a father and mother, are dealt with.  These are harrowing stories.  We know that other couples all over the country have similar stories.  By raising this issue in the Chamber this afternoon, the Deputy has highlighted the issue again and has put it on the record of the D&aacute;il.  Through my work as Minister of State in the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, I will certainly ensure that the officials from the General Register Office, GRO, my Department, and the Department of Health will ensure that the appropriate legislative, regulatory and operational mechanisms are put into place as quickly as possible.  We are at the end of the year now, but I hope this will be done in 2019.  I cannot give the Deputy a date but I can emphasise the urgency of the issue raised by her both to Ministers and the GRO.  I know where she is coming from.</p></speech>

It is my hope that we can discuss this issue without accusations regarding motivation coming into the debate.  My colleague, Deputy Fitzmaurice, and I have raised this issue because there is anxiety about the implications for Ireland of becoming a signatory, as I understand we have done, to the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration, which was adopted this week at the UN intergovernmental conference which took place in Morocco.  In response to a recent parliamentary question, I was told that the compact is "non-binding and respectful of national sovereignty".  I was also told that this is happening "against a background where individual States cannot address challenges relating to migration alone.  For example, cross-border efforts are essential if human smuggling and trafficking is to be reduced."</p>  <p>However, on foot of a parliamentary question I tabled to the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, last July, we know that there has not been a single conviction for human trafficking under the provisions of our own Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008, despite the fact that there were two prosecutions under the relevant section of the Act in 2016 and four prosecutions in 2017.  If we cannot get our own house in order with respect to trafficking and people smuggling, what hope do we have of addressing the world's people trafficking problems?  As I said, there are great concerns about this.  I am raising this issue in a non-adversarial way because we are concerned.  Since 2012, a total of 101 prosecutions have been issued under the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008.  The vast majority of these prosecutions relate to offences under the section of the Act covering child trafficking and pornography, which we also have to cover.  While on the one hand it is very encouraging, I cannot fail to be concerned about the fact that only 48 convictions have emerged from the process since 2012.</p></speech>

Public representatives across the country have been inundated with emails and phone calls from people who are concerned about the compact.  There was a ferocious debate between two candidates for the leadership of Angela Merkel's party in Germany.  There is concern in other countries.  Some of the stuff out there may not be accurate.  I do not know.  I would have thought, however, that there would have been statements or a debate in the D&aacute;il on such an issue before the Government would sign this compact with other countries.  Perhaps I am wrong on the procedure but I would have expected a debate in the D&aacute;il.  I would like to hear the Minister of State's thoughts on the matter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-12-12a.439" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1277" speakername="David Stanton" time="16:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018121200041#TT00500"><p>I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality who unfortunately cannot be here.  He sends his apologies.  I sincerely thank the Deputies for raising this important topical matter.  I am happy to provide some background and context to the global compact on safe, orderly and regular migration.</p><p>As has been said, the Minister has just returned from the intergovernmental signing conference for the compact in Marrakesh, where more than 140 UN member states were represented, most by senior ministers or Heads of State.  This debate is an opportunity to clear up some misconceptions about the compact being pushed by some politicians - though thankfully none here - for obvious political ends and, in particular, by users of social media.  Ireland has been closely involved in the development of the global compact on migration and, alongside Jordan, Ireland co-facilitated the 2016 New York declaration on refugees and migrants, a direct precursor to the compact.</p><p>It is clear that mass migration across the world cannot be managed by one country alone.  Migration is a global issue, which requires global co-operation.  The global compact on migration, agreed this week by a significant majority of UN member states in Marrakesh, is a legally non-binding document that looks at migration from a global perspective.  While non-binding, it provides a framework for co-operation between states.  The compact is grounded in values of state sovereignty, responsibility sharing, non-discrimination and human rights, and recognises that a co-operative approach is needed to optimise the overall benefits of migration, while addressing its risks and challenges for individuals and communities in countries of origin, transit and</p><p>destination.  The global compact places state sovereignty at its heart, meaning that it respects the rights of all countries to control their borders and retain control of their migration policy.</p><p>Despite the narrative being put forward by opponents of the compact in recent days, agreeing it will not negatively influence Ireland or our migration policy.  I will clear up some misconceptions on this issue.  The compact will not grant the same rights to migrants as Irish nationals.  It will not remove the distinction between legal and illegal migrants; rather it reinforces this distinction.  The compact will not make criticising migration a crime, as some have claimed.  It simply places an importance on combatting xenophobia and racism.  I believe we all agree on the importance of that.  The compact will not infringe on Ireland's ability to operate its own migration policy.</p><p>While it is regrettable that some countries have decided to not participate at this time, and that the compact has become a kind of <i>cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre</i>for far right parties in some countries, Ireland supports the objective of the compact.  It provides a framework for co-operation through which Ireland can work with other countries on ensuring that legal migration, when it does occur, is as safe as possible and beneficial to all.</p></speech>

I have spoken to him about this.  As I said, while on the one hand what the Minister of State said is encouraging, I cannot fail to be concerned about the fact that only 48 convictions have emerged from the process since 2012.  I do not want to be alarmist about this and I hope that what I say will not be taken out of context.</p><p>It is now clear that the Governments of the United States, Australia, Austria, the Czech Republic, the Dominican Republic, Hungary, Latvia, Poland and Slovakia have all pulled out of the UN migration pact process.  While I have listened to the Minister of State's reassurances, I must ask why those countries have pulled out.  I want answers.  What do those states see or know that we do not see or know?  The most important issue, however, is the total lack of engagement with the people or with this House.  Surely such a decision should be debated here.</p> <p> I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing us to raise this matter.  I thank the Minister of State for the clarity.  I look forward to engaging in this process that is ongoing and ensuring that it does what it says on the tin.  I am concerned about why those countries pulled out of the process if they were supposed to be happy with it.</p></speech>

The CDU had a heated and protracted debate on this issue even though Angela Merkel is very much in favour of supporting migrants.  There is a fear about why Austria and many other countries have pulled out of the process.  Many politicians, as outlined by the Minister of State, have probably supported this for political gain.  The issue of migration would not account for massive political gains for Germany or the CDU, even though many members would be in favour of supporting migrants.  There is a concern among journalists, which has been expressed, and among the ordinary people about the impact of what is happening.  No one is saying that every country would not play its part in helping migrants but there is a fear particularly among the media that they will be shut down.  I welcome the Minister of State's comments.</p></speech>

I hope I was clear on that.  We cannot be responsible for what other countries have decided to do or not to do.  That is their business but we have been engaged in this process for quite some time.  It does not infringe on our sovereignty in any way.  It clarifies certain issues and helps us to work with other countries on this massive global issue.  No country can deal with this problem on its own.</p>  <p>  We know that countries in Africa, the Middle East and Europe are still recovering from the effects of the migration crisis of 2015 and 2016.  The lessons we learned then should serve us as a reminder of the need to address migration in a co-operative and comprehensive manner and the dangers we face when we do not.  Ireland has a long history of migration.  More than 17% of Irish nationals live abroad.  In recent years, Ireland has become a country of inward migration and the contribution of migrants from all parts of the world held drive our economy from our health sector to our growing tech sector and everything in between.  The compact recognises the contribution of these people and works to optimise the benefits of migration for countries of origin, countries of destination, for migrants and their families and for the receiving communities.</p>  <p>  I stress again the non-legally binding nature of the compact and its valuable role as a framework through which we can better co-operate globally on migration.  Migration is an issue that is not going away.  It is up to us to define how we respond to and manage it.  I would welcome further debate on this issue in the House and at the various committees.</p>  <p>  I have taken note of Deputy Mattie McGrath's concern about trafficking, an issue on which I would welcome a debate.  I would also welcome Deputies' views on it.  I thank the Deputies for raising this issue and I hope I have brought some clarity to the matter.  We are available at any time if they have further queries on the issue.</p></speech>

I am glad the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, is taking it.  Unfortunately, existing respite services across Cavan and Monaghan for persons with disabilities - both children and adults - are totally inadequate.  Not enough resources are being devoted to this critical area, which is extremely important for many individuals and their families.  There are not enough centres or enough personnel working in the existing centres.  The services are underfunded, under-resourced and the personnel in them are working under great pressure.</p>  <p>  I know many people who have family members accessing those services.  Even though they would be disappointed with the limited time they get the opportunity to leave a son, a daughter or a sibling in those centres, the message I have heard at all times emphasises the respect the families have for the facilities and the personnel working in the centres.  One gentleman told me today that he and his wife have wonderful respect for the services and the personnel who deliver the services, when they are available.  The gentleman in question is of pension age.  He  and his wife have an adult child with a disability.  On a number of occasions, their proposed respite was cancelled.  The same person had hospital appointments to coincide with the respite period that was proposed for their child.  It is very difficult for families when respite care that is promised for a certain number of weeks or for a few days is cancelled.  The family member, who is the carer at home 99% of the time, may have a hospital appointment away from Cavan or Monaghan, usually in Dublin.  This creates serious problems and literally a crises for such families when proposed respite is cancelled.</p>  <p>  There are only three centres across Cavan and Monaghan delivering these services.  One of those is the Annalee View respite care centre in Cootehill, County Cavan.  Families who have loved ones who gone there for respite have told me they very much appreciate the commitment, hard work and professionalism of the staff at the centre, but they are not able to access it as they should be able to do so.  There have been cancellations.  There is no provision in Cavan-Monaghan for managing a crisis.  If a crisis arises for some families, that entails cancellations of services and respite for other people.</p>  <p>  A gentleman read a letter to me earlier.  He stated that, in 2005, I had been given a reply by the HSE in respect of a question on the need to improve services.  He reminded me that the level of services available in 2005 was much better than at present.  Even at that time, the Department of Health and the HSE recognised that there was an immediate need to improve and extend the level of services available.  There is an urgent need to ensure that adequate resources are provided to ensure that there is an increase in personnel delivering those critical services and that there are also extensions to the existing centres or new centres developed.</p>  <p>  I referred to the Annalee View respite care centre in Cootehill, which offers services for both adults and children.  Some people have suggested that children and adult services should be separate.  However, regardless of the architecture in the delivery of services, we need a proper levels of services to ensure that those people are given that respite when they need it.</p></speech>

I thank the Deputy for raising it and for giving me the opportunity to outline the position regarding the provision of respite services in counties Cavan and Monaghan.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s ongoing priority is the safeguarding of vulnerable people in the care of the health service.  We are committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives.  The need for increased respite services is acknowledged and the HSE continues to work with all service providers to explore various ways of responding to this need in line with the budget available.  As part of its ongoing service provision, this year the HSE will provide more than 182,000 respite nights and 42,500 day respite sessions to families in need right across the country.</p>  <p>  There has been a significant improvement in respite services this year.</p><p>An additional &euro;10 million was provided this year to fund 12 new respite houses.  That is one in each HSE CHO area and an additional three houses in the greater Dublin area to respond to the very high demand for respite from this area.  These additional houses are providing additional respite for families who need it.  Ten houses have opened to date, with the remaining two opening shortly.  When fully operational, this will provide 19,000 extra overnights and 2,520 home sharing nights annually.  Some &euro;2 million of that extra money is being targeted at alternative respite services.  These are practical and important solutions, extended day services, summer camps and Saturday clubs.  They are making a difference to families right across the country.</p> <p> In the context of respite services within Cavan-Monaghan disability services, I am informed by the HSE that Steadfast House has the capacity to provide 1,008 adult respite beds per year.  Annalee View Respite Centre, which the Deputy mentioned, has the capacity to provide 910 adult respite beds per year, while St. Christopher&rsquo;s Disability Centre provides, on average, 730 adult respite beds per year.  Annalee View Respite Centre, Cootehill, County Cavan, can accommodate five service users at a time.  Respite services in Annalee were recently restricted due to the needs of one person.  However, the restriction is now lifted and the service has returned to normal capacity.  The number of adult service users continually increases as service users transfer from child to adult services.  This impacts on the level of respite existing service users receive.  A number of service users have associated mobility needs which mean they can only access downstairs bedrooms.  This affects the level of respite they receive.  We are acutely aware that families need support to care for their loved ones and, therefore, Government is committed to providing a range of accessible respite care supports for people with a disability and their families.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-12-12a.453" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1270" speakername="Brendan Smith" time="17:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018121200043#VV00200"><p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  I am glad that the restriction due to the particular needs of the one person he refers to has been lifted and that the service has now returned to normal capacity.  Normal capacity is under capacity and that is the bottom line.  When the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, met a delegation, along with me, he conceded that there is currently a deficit for respite services for persons with a disability in the Cavan-Monaghan area.  Many of those parents across the area, as well as siblings, are very undemanding people.  They are understanding that there may, at times, be a cancellation due to a crisis arising for some other family.  Far too often, in the past few years, cancellations have been a regular feature in the delivery of the service.  It is not acceptable and the people who speak to me are people who understand that services will not be as good as we would all like them to be.  They only demand a very basic level of service.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State quite rightly refers, as the HSE indicated in written correspondence too, to the growing demand.  As people leave the children's services and become young adults, an increasing number of people need these services.  Parents, by definition, get older.  Many parents ring me or come to see me at the weekend who are really worried about the long-term facilities and services that will be available for their loved one.  There is no reason, as a society or a country, we should not provide a basic, decent level of service, which is critical for many vulnerable people.  I ask the Minister of State to bring back to his colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, the urgent need to ensure that additional investment is put in place in the Cavan-Monaghan disability services and that we have a reasonable service.  Nobody is looking for an extravagant service.  We are looking for a very basic service.  The hard-working, decent people I speak to, who give so much love, care and attention to their family on a 24-hour basis demand very little.  The least we could do as a society and an Oireachtas is provide a decent level of respite services for those people.</p></speech>

I acknowledge that it is not just his right to raise this issue but his duty as a public representative.  Our duty as a collective is to be there to be the voice of these families who do not have the time for the kind of advocacy they wish to do because they are caring full time.  Respite is a basic fundamental service that any society should be in a position to provide, never mind a modern, progressive society such as we in Ireland thankfully are.  The challenge is to continue to keep that focus on that vulnerable cohort and to ensure that we provide the necessary supports to families who need that respite.  While we provide 182,000 respite nights a year, that is all well and good and it is to be acknowledged - I do not think anybody disputes how welcome it is - it clearly it is not enough because of the growing demand across both child and adult services, especially adult, with children moving into them.  I will take what the Deputy said back.  I welcome the airing that he has given to this issue.  I, as a public representative, share his concern and wish to see the service greatly enhanced by all of us working together for the year ahead.  I will take on board everything the Deputy has said and be sure to add my voice to that.  I will speak with the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, to continue with the development of this service and its provision for those who need it.</p></speech>

The availability of orphan drugs has come to my attention and has been mentioned many times in this House recently.  Orphan drugs are drugs specifically designed to diagnose or prevent life-threatening or chronically debilitating rare diseases.  An increasingly common issue in Ireland is that drugs fail to secure reimbursement from the HSE.  Many of these drugs are available around Europe.  In most cases, Ireland is the only country that does not have these drugs available.  While not every orphan drug proposed to the State would represent a workable agreement, there are growing discrepancies in availability and barriers to providing the latest medicines available to cure these rare diseases.</p>  <p>  While there has been a rare disease plan in place in Ireland since 2014, and the Joint Committee on Health has been dealing with this regularly, there appears to be a breakdown in communications.  It is caught between two stools.  The HSE has statutory responsibility for the pricing of medicines.  However, the HSE is governed by a policy set by the Government through the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013.  The drugs seem to be falling through these two cracks and one does not seem to know how to handle the other.  A framework exists whereby the State and industry agree a timeframe but unfortunately we are left with a slow, cumbersome situation.  The child who may have a difficult diagnosis or who has a disease who is waiting to be cured could unfortunately have passed away by the time the medicine is made available, which is difficult for the family, especially if it is a child.</p>  <p>  Will the Minister of State look at this again and whether the process of making these drugs available could be more streamlined if they are suitable?  They should not go through this protracted and drawn-out process whereby the child or person might be diagnosed today and the drug may not be made available for a couple of years.  The only way to deal with a particular diagnosis is to give care and attention efficiently and quickly.  It is important that we have a fast-track approach to this issue.  A number of issues have been debated over a period in this House.  Different drugs have become available around Europe but not here in Ireland.  That must be addressed.  We should be on the same playing field as everybody else.  If somebody gets sick in Ireland and the drug has to be available here, that person should not have to go elsewhere to avail of it or to cure the illness he or she may have.  Could the system be changed to make it more user-friendly so that the process of this drug being approved and reimbursed by the HSE and Government can be fast-tracked to make sure that the person who requires this medicine can get it when he or she wants it?</p></speech>

I appreciate that a rare disease diagnosis places enormous stress on patients and their families and, as Deputy Deering is aware, access to potentially beneficial medicines for the treatment of rare diseases is extremely important for patients and their families.</p><p>I want to assure Deputy Deering that the Minister for Health works tirelessly to address issues around access for patients to new and innovative medicines.  The Oireachtas has put in place a robust legal framework in the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013, which gives statutory powers to the HSE to assess and make decisions on the reimbursement of medicines, taking account of a range of objective factors and expert opinion, as appropriate.  The Act specifies the criteria to be applied in the making of reimbursement decisions, to include the clinical and cost effectiveness of the product, the opportunity cost and the impact on resources that are available to the HSE.</p> <p> While the 2013 Health Act does not include provision for a specific rule set when assessing orphan drugs, the HSE and the NCPE seek to take into account issues such as patient numbers and the nature of the condition to be treated when evaluating these medicines. The criteria that apply to the evaluation process allow sufficient scope for the HSE to take on board the particular circumstances that pertain to orphan drugs.  In reaching its decision, the HSE will examine all the relevant evidence and will take into account such expert opinions and recommendations that are appropriate, including from the NCPE.</p> <p> The Deputy rightly identifies that increasingly drugs are being developed to target rare conditions and that these drugs often come with very high list prices.  In that respect, the HSE is required under the Act to have regard to the funding challenges that these drugs represent.  It does this by drawing on the criteria contained in the Health Act, including the potential or actual budget impact of the drug in question and the cost effectiveness of meeting health needs by supplying a particular item rather than providing other health services.  These are difficult decisions but recognise the core challenges of the availability of finite resources in the face of ever competing demands.  Since the signing of the four year framework agreement on the supply and pricing of medicines in 2016, a significant number of orphan drugs have been reimbursed by the State.</p> <p> Notwithstanding the challenges which orphan drugs present and the fact that the HSE and NCPE are mindful of these issues when assessing orphan medicinal products, a number of changes have been introduced to address those challenges.  In June 2018, a technology review committee for rare diseases was established.  This committee is now operational and has already completed work in relation to orphan products.  As well as examining the methodologies for assessing orphan drugs, it will also consider the views of patients, caregivers and examine the wider issues surrounding health technology assessments.  In addition, the composition of the HSE drugs group is being expanded to include two representatives from the National Patients Forum and more clinical expertise in the area of rare disease.  Both of these measures are intended to provide greater balance and transparency to the assessment process as a whole.  </p> <p> The challenge of accessing innovative medicines at affordable prices is one shared by most, if not all, developed countries.  It is estimated that in the region of 45 new molecules are due to receive market authorisation in Europe each year over the next five years. It is in this high-tech space, including orphan drugs, that the greatest challenges will arise in the years ahead.  A significant development in Ireland&rsquo;s international agenda was joining the BeNeluxA initiative on pharmaceutical policy in June 2018.  This collaboration will support the Government's objective of co-operating with other European countries to identify workable solutions in an increasingly challenging environment to secure timely access for patients to new medicines, including orphan medicines, in an affordable and sustainable way.</p></speech>

I welcome the initiatives commenced this year, in particular the review committee established in June but it is important a timeline is put in place for completion and publication of that review.</p>  <p>  It is also important that these drugs are affordable and that the State is not in hock to, or taken advantage of by, the large pharmaceutical companies.  Crucially, the people who need these drugs need them now because they may not be around in two years' time when they become available.  </p>  <p>  As I said, it is important the initiative announced earlier in the year is progressed more quickly such that if a new disease is identified and an adult or child needs drugs that will be of huge benefit to them, they can access them.  I ask the Minister of State to ensure that a timeframe is set for completion of that initiative such that the process can be more efficient going forward.</p></speech>

There always will be tension between the State as the purchaser of important drugs and the giant pharmaceutical companies producing and supplying them, often for lottery type amounts of money.  The State has to ensure affordability not only in terms of fiscal governance but to ensure they are available to everybody who needs them.  If we pay over the odds for any particular drug we would limit the number of people who can avail of them.  Notwithstanding those challenges, the Deputy has asked that we be more prescient in our timelines and I will pass on his request to the Minister.</p></speech>

The report revealed that 32% of the 75,000 calls it received last year were in regard to eviction notices.  The previous year, 2016, eviction notices accounted for 14% of calls to Threshold.  Calls regarding eviction notices have more than doubled in one year.  According to Threshold in Ireland, and in Europe generally, the private rental sector is the leading source of homelessness through evictions, legal and illegal.  According to Focus Ireland, 69% of homeless people report that their last stable home was in the private rental sector.  It is sheer insanity in the midst of the greatest housing crisis in the history of this State to allow the flow of evictions from the private rental sector to continue without a serious attempt to stem the flow.  This Bill represents a serious attempt to stem the flow.</p>  <p>  The 2017 report also reveals that the most common type of eviction notice references sale of property as the grounds for eviction and that there has been an increase in the number of eviction notices reported to Threshold in 2017 which reference renovation of property as the grounds for eviction.  Half of all eviction notices dealt with by Threshold in 2017 were evictions on the grounds of renovation or sale of property.  If this Bill were passed it would prevent all of these evictions.  During Leaders' Question today the Taoiseach said the Bill we are discussing tonight is too extreme.</p><p>However, a ban on the sale of property as grounds for eviction is not uncommon in continental Europe.  It is legal in Germany, Sweden, Denmark and the Netherlands.  I do not see landlords doing a runner out of Sweden or the Netherlands because a ban on evictions on the grounds of sale of property is the law of the land.  There is a great deal of scaremongering on that issue.  It is not these governments that are extreme on this issue but the Government of which the Minister is a part and which is presided over by the Taoiseach.  It is extreme in allowing evictions to continue at this rate at a time of record homelessness.</p> <p> Last night, I visited tenants at 539 North Circular Road.  As explained by my colleague, Deputy Paul Murphy, on Leaders' Questions earlier, tenants in this 16-apartment building were issued with notices to quit at the end of October and face eviction at the beginning of January.  The landlord, a Mr. James Anderson, has been a director or shareholder of no less than seven current or former companies with share capital of up to &euro;1 million in one case.</p></speech>

This landlord is trying to evict families with children at Christmas on the grounds of renovation.  Who is extreme?  Is it the parties in the D&aacute;il that would ban this practice or the parties that allow it to happen under the law?</p><p>I will list some of the key changes provided for in the Bill and comment briefly on some of them, aside from the two changes I have already outlined.  The Bill would, first, ban the sale of property as a ground for eviction and, second, ban renovation as a ground for eviction.  Third, in the case of a landlord wishing to evict to move a family member into the property, the Bill requires the landlord to compensate the tenant by way of six months back rent.  Fourth, the Bill unambiguously extends tenant rights to students and affords them full tenant rights under the law.  Fifth, in the event of a bank or receiver taking over a property with a tenant <i>in situ</i>the bank or receiver shall have full landlord responsibilities and the tenant will retain full tenant rights.  Sixth, the Bill affords tenants full tenant rights after two months, as opposed to the current requirement of six months.  Seventh, the Bill would remove the danger zone for tenants which allows evictions when a tenancy expires by rolling over Part 4 tenancies into a new tenancy arrangement.</p><p>With regard to the family member issue, 52% of such cases appealed to the RTB last year were found to be invalid.  The provision in the Bill is an attempt to weed out bogus and illegal evictions of this type.  The provision relating to banks and receivers will be of particular interest to tenants in the 12,732 buy-to-let properties identified by the Central Bank as being in long-term mortgage arrears of two years or more.  As regards students being accorded tenant rights, this will apply to both privately-owned and publicly-owned student accommodation and will end the situation where public authorities such as State funded universities have been excluded under the legislation.</p><p>Earlier, the Taoiseach took issue with Solidarity's call for landlords to recuse themselves from voting on this issue.  Some 15 Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies, 14 Fine Gael Deputies, four members of the Cabinet and five Ministers of State are declared landlords.  In society in general, 5% of the population are landlords.  The proportion of landlords in the D&aacute;il is far greater, particularly among the ranks of the Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael parties.  The Taoiseach stated that those Deputies would not be guided by their vested interests in how they vote.  I will not comment on that.  The commitment of Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael to the capitalist market is probably a greater factor than the individual property interests of their Deputies.  However, two years ago, in January 2017, the D&aacute;il voted on Solidarity's anti-eviction Bill of 2016.  The vote was tied - I believe it was 51 for and 51 against - and the Bill was defeated with the casting vote of the Ceann Comhairle.  It is a fact that if Deputies who are landlords had recused themselves from that division the Bill would have passed Second Stage.  It is also a fact that if the Bill had passed all five Stages in 2017 a large number of the evictions carried out in the interim would have been illegal, most of them would have been prevented and the number of homeless people would be far lower than it is today.  We make no apology for repeating our call for Deputies who are landlords not to vote on this Bill on Thursday.</p><p>The Taoiseach stated on &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; that the housing crisis keeps him awake at night, and the Government tells us it plans to bring forward legislation on these issues.  It will introduce a rent register, extend eviction notice periods, provide a legal definition of substantial refurbishment and give increased powers to the RTB.  I welcome any change the Government makes that improves the lot of tenants by one iota, whether it is under pressure from the emerging housing protest movement or from public opinion.  However, these changes do not ban evictions or strike at the root of evictions.  They will not stop many of them either.  If Members wish to stop evictions, they will vote to ban them.  As a result, they must vote for this Bill.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-12-12a.468" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1238" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="17:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018121200045#XX00600"><p>I will start by referring to what the Taoiseach stated earlier and the use of the term "extreme".  This has become a familiar trope of the Taoiseach when referring to the socialist left and our policies.  It is part of a wider, quite worrying, narrative that is taking hold in the mainstream political establishment across Europe, which says there are extremists on the right and extremists on the left and then the nice, sensible, pragmatic centre.  An issue such as this tests that narrative in a concrete way and refutes it in the strongest terms.</p>  <p>  For Elaine, who I have mentioned here previously but whose case is still on my desk, the situation is extreme.  It is now past the date when she must leave her house.  The landlord is evicting her and her four children on the ground of sale.  She is now overholding.  Although she did not have legal grounds to appeal she appealed just to delay the process because she had nowhere to go.  Now, days before Christmas, she is faced with having to overhold or put herself and her four children into homelessness.  It is worth pointing out what homelessness will mean for Elaine.  She has been pleading with the local authority and the various agencies and bodies to try to find a solution.  She does not want to overhold or to be in a confrontation with her landlord, who has told her he is going to the District Court to take out a summons to evict her.</p></speech>
