However, I have concerns about the fact that capital gains tax will not be applied to any uplift in the value of property acquired by funds if they hold that property for five years.  This will allow a huge amount of Exchequer revenue to go uncollected.  I gave examples last night, including that of the commercial office sector in Dublin which saw an uplift in property prices last year of 22.4%.  Since mid-2012, residential property prices have increased by 42% in the capital and by an average of 32% outside it from the end of 2013 to date.  Notwithstanding the major uplift in the value of property, capital gains tax, at 33%, will not be charged if the funds hold the properties for five years.  The proposed five-year window will allow funds to leave town tax-free and with huge gains even earlier than would have been allowed had they bought in this window under section 604A of the Taxes (Consolidation) Act.  Section 604A allows for capital tax-free gains on Irish property bought between December 2001 and 31 December 2014 if held for a period of seven years.  Furthermore, the proposed five-year holding period provided for in the Finance Bill is open ended.  While I opposed it when it was introduced and while it is seriously flawed, led to price inflation and is criticised all round for continuing too long, it is at least the case with section 604A that it allows for the gradual application of capital gains tax where property is held for longer than seven years.  The new proposal in the Finance Bill makes no provision for the gradual application of capital gains tax.</p>  <p>  I have serious reservations about the threshold of 25% which the Government has put in place in respect of the measure.  A minimum of 25% of a fund's portfolio must consist of Irish domiciled property.  My concern is that the threshold could lead to funds diluting their holdings with other business assets or international property resulting in their not meeting the threshold and, thus, avoiding tax.  That would mean losses for the Irish public.  For example, a fund with 30% of its portfolio consisting of property holdings might take in an asset which is not property such as a French airline, with the result that the property proportion would fall to perhaps 24%.  Therefore, there would be no payment of withholding tax whatsoever.  If one looks at these funds, one sees that a number of them have the ability to do this.  Some of them have substantial Irish property holdings, but they also have holdings in companies such as Virgin, which means that they could dilute the property component.  A number of the funds which are domiciled here have significant holdings of property in other jurisdictions.  It is a concern we need to tease out.</p>  <p>  I am not sure if the confusion about section 110 has been caused deliberately, but section 110 and qualified investor alternative investment funds are two completely separate structures, as the Minister of State and his officials know.  It is important to say this because sometimes they are rolled into one.  Section 110 does not deal with the funds industry.  It is a separate section and I welcome it.  I am glad that the Government has taken my advice about the removal of the proposed marked-to-market measure in the original Government amendment.  It is welcome that it was proposed in the way it was.  It was a good move by the Minister and his officials to allow us and others to suggest changes.  These changes will take effect in the Finance Bill.  However, I will wait to see if there is substance to the new amendment.  I am aware of intense lobbying on the amendment and the one relating to the funds industry and very dubious as to whether the people concerned have the national interest at heart.  Through freedom of information requests, I have seen the correspondence between Department of Finance officials and the industry on the structure of the amendments.  It is the same group of lawyers and accountants who saw the opportunity provided by section 110 and funds to help their foreign clients to avoid billions in Irish taxes in return for a couple of million of euro in fees.  I am always very concerned when someone goes to the poacher for advice on these matters.  I do not question the Department's integrity on this issue or that of its officials and we will tease it out in more detail on Committee Stage.  I am also conscious that the Government has included an expected yield of only &euro;50 million from both measures, which leaves further questions as to whether there are more loopholes in them.</p><p>Overall, the move is to be welcomed. </p> <p> The Bill gives people who have engaged in tax evasion until 1 May 2017 to get their houses in order and allows them to make a voluntary disclosure regarding tax evasion involving offshore income or assets.  That entitles them to mitigated penalties and to avoid criminal prosecutions by coming forward to Revenue voluntarily.  We now have the information to catch these people, but we are letting them put their hands up and not face prosecution if they come forward sooner rather than later.  That is not the type of enforcement or punishment we should be considering for this type of tax evasion.  The deadline is set in the context of extra information that Revenue has at its disposal from closer co-operation and worldwide information exchanges on the tax affairs of Irish individuals in foreign jurisdictions.  The deadline is in advance of the greater clampdown on offshore assets next year by the Revenue Commissioners.  I question the accommodating approach for people who have broken the law.</p> <p> With regard to the deadline of 1 May, I request that the Government remove the option for mitigated penalties and no criminal prosecutions by ending any option for preferential treatment and pursue people with the full rigours of the law, in particular in light of the extra information the Revenue Commissioners now have at their disposal.  We no longer need people to come forward and make declarations because we now have co-operation with other jurisdictions to capture people.  Disturbingly, there was no question of the full rigours of the law not being imposed last week on an individual who engaged in a peaceful protest at the age of 15, yet the full rigours of the law will not be used when it comes to tax avoiders in the State, unlike other criminals who get amnesty after amnesty and chance after chance to put up their hands, admit they were bold boys and girls and carry on.</p> <p> Brexit seems to be the magic word in the Finance Bill, in that it appears in the Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il cheat sheets.  We have been told that this is a Brexit-proof budget and there is not enough Brexit-proofing in the budget.  It is one of the most obvious sham fights we have to put up with.  It is connected to my earlier point.  Fianna F&aacute;il did not even produce an alternative budget so we have no idea what it wants in the Finance Bill regarding Brexit-proofing.  The only idea it has is that a Minister should be appointed to deal with the issue.</p> <p> If we need to include provisions on Brexit in the Finance Bill, let us do so and have a real and genuine debate because the issue affects everybody.  If one came from out of town and read this Bill, would one notice Brexit was an issue and Ireland could be seriously impacted as a result?  One would not because the budget is no more Brexit-proofed than any other.  One of the major concerns we have are Border communities and cross-Border trade.  There are no extra supports for cross-Border trade or institutions in the Bill - it is hollow on these issues.</p> <p> Two of the most questionable measures which must be classified as a zombie initiatives are SARP and the living city initiative.  The SARP scheme is a scheme about which I am deeply uncomfortable.  Some people have quietly derided the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor, for her plan to introduce a tax break for high earning immigrants, yet I am sure the same people would be out in force to support the continued existence of the SARP scheme.  It was due to expire in 2014.  At that point it had failed to create the jobs we were told it would.  A small number of very wealthy people got a tax break and nothing else changed.  A review was held by the usual suspects, like IBEC and KPMG, and they made submissions stating that it was a great idea.  It was extended.  It is still not working, but it will be extended again. </p> <p> In 2014, 302 people benefitted to the tune of &euro;5.9 million from the scheme, 43 of whom earned salaries in excess of &euro;375,000.  We were told that 124 jobs were created as a result.  That means every year the State is paying &euro;47,580 to create these jobs.  We would be better off employing those people; it would be cheaper and we would not be providing &euro;5.9 million of a tax break to people who are extremely wealthy.  This scheme was dreamt up by accountants to allow very wealthy people to pay less tax.  There is no way to verify any of the jobs that have been created as a result and it should be allowed to die a graceful death.</p> <p> I would like to raise other issues in the Bill on Second Stage, but will not have the opportunity to do so because of the time.  My colleagues will speak on some of the issues, including the living cities initiative, capital acquisitions tax, the dwelling house exemption and section 46 of the Bill which, it is to be hoped, will clamp down on the abuse by certain chicken farmers of the flat VAT rate available for farmers.  We will deal with these issues in greater detail on Committee Stage.</p></speech>

It is absurd to have tagged as family friendly policies a start time of 12 noon and a finish time of 12 midnight.  I hope this is a permanent change of heart by Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il, and that the D&aacute;il can start, like most people in work, at a convenient time in the morning and allow people to get home at a reasonable time in the evening.  I am very pleased to be here.</p>  <p>  What struck me on reading the Finance Bill was the question of what the Irish tax system, the Bill and Donald Trump have in common?  In our tax system we have built up a very complex structure which allows the Donald Trumps of the world, if they can afford accountants, lawyers and time to interact with the Department of Finance and various other avenues, to develop a system whereby it is perfectly legitimate for people with very high incomes and significant levels of assets and profitable enterprises to effectively avoid, or in the case of tax losses to indefinitely postpone, the payment of due taxes.  </p>  <p>  I raised this issue during the discussions of the of the Committee on Budgetary Oversight.  We examined a number of elements of the tax code.  The State is losing out on billions of euro in tax revenues thanks to the boom time losses, built up by banks and developers, that ordinary PAYE taxpayers paid for.  They got the country out of the state of collapse that Fianna F&aacute;il, unfortunately, let it fall into.</p>  <p>  The Revenue Commissioners have confirmed to me that the financial services and construction sectors managed to avoid &euro;1.24 billion in taxes in 2014, the most recent year for which data is available.  We will have the 2015 data shortly; the revenue Commissioners and Minister might confirm when we will have those figures.  An extraordinary amount of tax losses have built up in our system.  We have accumulated losses in all sectors of over &euro;15 billion, in the financial services sector of over &euro;9 billion and in the construction sector of over &euro;400 million.  </p>  <p>  When a 12.5% rate, or even half of that, is applied, one gets an idea of how it is possible to utilise these losses indefinitely so that people who crashed and were bailed out by taxpayers who covered their losses can still carry losses forward when they return to profitable activity.  They have been able to avail of &euro;1.24 billion in tax not paid in 2014 by utilising the significant losses they accumulated during the property crash to offset tax on the profits they are now recording.  This is perfectly legal.  It is an arrangement that is entirely within our tax laws. </p>  <p>  The construction and financial sectors are sitting on combined losses of over &euro;129 billion.  Major tax losses were built up by companies in sectors, in particular financial institutions, that the taxpayer bailed out at enormous expense and sacrifice.  This brings me back to our friend, Mr Trump.  People may recall that he has declined, as part of the debate during the US presidential election, to make known his tax returns.</p><p>What is known, from various filings, is that he arranged his affairs, arising from tax losses in companies that made such losses, in such a way that it was agreed that for many years, this multi-billionaire in effect paid no tax at all.  Ireland has its own Donald Trumps.  We need to be conscious of this when it comes to taxation.  We need to look at and examine the matter.  We need to get a detailed report from the Revenue Commissioners on it.  My proposal has been and was at the time of the Apple tax debate that we look at introducing a minimum effective tax rate, whereby any profitable company would be forced to pay a certain amount in tax, even where it was carrying massive tax losses from previous years.  Once profits go above a certain level, even though a company has losses, it has to begin to pay at the corporation tax rate on profits above a certain level.  Years ago I got former Deputy Brian Cowen and the late Brian Lenihan to agree to bring forward a minimum effective tax rate on income tax in the tax system.  That is how it works.  At a time when we need corporation tax receipts, we can work out a structure that would enable us to ensure capital investment - a particular example is third level education - and what would be more appropriate than the additional taxes garnered from a change in the system that would actually go towards funding and revitalising the third level education sector in terms of capital and current expenditure.  Ultimately, that would provide an enormous return for these companies which they are looking for and seeking qualified graduates from the education system to work in their businesses and enterprises.</p> <p> The D&aacute;il has to discuss the issue of taxation generally.  The Committee on Budgetary Oversight was a good exercise in at least starting a detailed conversation on the budget.  Globally, the system of taxation is changing and Ireland has to develop a critical plan to have a fair and equitable corporation tax structure, while maintaining, as it is is entitled to do, the 12.5% rate.  We need an effective minimum corporation tax rate because we cannot have a headline rate of 12.5% which, through various devices, is whittled away to almost nothing.  In the light of the current debate on international tax developments, we will not be able to do this anymore.  All of us who have been involved and worked in business, including family businesses, understand that in a business one needs to invest.  Capital investment needs to be recognised in the tax code.  We all know that legitimate business expenses need to be recognised in the tax code, but we cannot have a situation where some businesses, either by arrangement or the use of offshore companies and devices, are able to give the two fingers to the rest of us, particularly those in the PAYE system.  That does not actually do anything to generate additional enterprise in Ireland.  We know that we need to concentrate on small to medium enterprises, SMEs, and developing employment in indigenous businesses, as well as welcoming foreign direct investment.  We have taken some of these approaches to income tax following lots of revelations through the decades and they have been successful.  I urge my colleagues to look at this issue in order to obtain very detailed information on the enormous burden of losses in the tax system.</p> <p> I now turn to section 54 of the Bill.  I recognise the good intentions of the Revenue Commissioners in addressing what has been a very difficult and murky area with which to deal, but, as drafted and constructed, section 54 provides for an amnesty with regard to times and penalties for tax defaulters who are using offshore and overseas tax havens to avoid paying their taxes legitimately due in Ireland.  I know from my professional background that very few people like paying taxes, but they will pay their taxes which are legitimately due to fund the kind of society that provides the education system, the health system and all of the other services that are needed in the public good, yet there is a small but consistent group of people who are operating offshore to avoid paying tax, while others are paying.  In section 54 the implementation date is to be delayed until 1 May 2017.  We know that all of the accounting and law firms are constantly in and out of the Department of Finance - we understand this dialogue is important - but the delayed implementation date gives tax defaulters seven months notice, a period in which they can pay up in Ireland or rearrange their financial affairs to stay one step ahead of the tax man and woman.  I thought that the hallmark of Fianna F&aacute;il support for the Government was fairness, but I do not see anything particularly fair about this measure.  The Labour Party will seek to bring the date forward to ensure tax defaulters will pay the tax due in the same way that those in the PAYE system have to pay their taxes.  There will have to be very detailed discussions on the proposals made by the Minister to ascertain why he is taking such a softly-softly approach to defaulters with overseas assets and offshore income streams.</p> <p> We know that numbers of Irish people and firms were referenced in the Panama papers published earlier this year.  We also know from previous reports and the tribunals that consistently there have been small but significant numbers of Irish people and firms who have used offshore devices to avoid or mitigate their taxes due.  One can see it when somebody is talking about a business and there is a little footnote on the company being registered in Vanuatu or some other exotic location.  You say to yourself, "I wonder what that is about," and it is mostly about avoiding tax.  With the development of the Committee on Budgetary Oversight and other committees, we have an opportunity to look at how we might reform the system in order that people will not cause a scandal and serious loss of revenue to the Exchequer by organising their affairs offshore.  The Revenue Commissioners are going to take very welcome action, but it should be taken as quickly as possible.  In its alternative budget the Labour Party proposed a beefing up in the fight against tax defaulters, particularly those using offshore mechanisms.  Perhaps Revenue and the Minister for Finance might explain whether the Government has obtained additional access to information in the Panama papers on Irish people and companies resident offshore for tax purposes.  Revenue might care to share that information with us on Committee Stage.</p> <p> The Labour Party welcomes the proposals made in the Bill to provide for the payment of tax on property and income held in various property structures, especially real estate investment trusts, REITs.  The public has been extremely upset at the idea, rightly so, that certain vulture funds are able to buy Irish assets cheaply following the crash and have, through various structures, been largely exempt from taxation.  This was the subject of detailed discussion and recommendations made by the Committee on Budgetary Oversight prior to the budget.  The committee, as well as the finance committee, will want to receive a full account of how the proposals will affect these companies.</p><p>It is wrong that we should allow them to continue now that the property market is recovering.  In many cases, they will be selling off their interests relatively quickly, that is, looking to flip properties within a three to five year period, because many of them, in effect, are hedge funds.  We need to know the Minister's thinking on this and what he sees as the future for some of these vulture funds.  The ones which are long-term property-holding asset companies, which are becoming, if one likes, professional landlords, perhaps owned by pension funds that hold the pension funds of workers, which is a potential development on the Irish property scene about which the Minister has spoken, would be an important part of a serious expansion of the supply of housing in Ireland.</p> <p> We have been critical of the help-to-buy scheme, but I welcome the sensible reduction of the loan-to-value rule from 80% to 70%.  If someone is buying a house for &euro;400,000, he or she would have had to take out an 80% mortgage, or &euro;320,000, to qualify for the scheme.  It might not sound it to many in this Chamber, but that is a big mortgage.  Reducing the loan-to-value requirement to 70% reduces the mortgage required to &euro;280,000.  This is still a big mortgage, but psychologically it is below the &euro;300,000 level and so the move is sensible.</p> <p>  I have had correspondence, as I am sure other Deputies have had, from people who were affected by the 80% rule and I think the reduction to 70% will benefit them.  Others, however, are affected by the commencement date.  I am sure the Minister and his officials are aware that there has been a number of queries about it.  The 19 July refers to the mortgage draw-down date, which is not the same as the date contracts are signed, and my understanding is that the applicable date is the date of draw-down of the first set of funds.  Will the Minister clarify the situation?  We must remember that for those buying the house, as anyone would know if they were to go around Dublin at the weekend, the relevant date is also that on which they enter into contracts with builders and suppliers.  The Minister estimates this scheme will cost approximately &euro;50 million.  Given that the purpose of the proposal is to encourage, help and enable people to buy homes, I would suggest the rules be amended to give the benefit to those buying a home as early as possible.  There seems to be an anomaly between those involved in self-builds and those who are buying a home.</p> <p> Budget 2017 underlines the absolute dependence of the Government on Fianna F&aacute;il.  One thing that is extraordinary about the budget is the lack of focus on Brexit.  Brexit is probably the biggest challenge to Ireland since the disastrous bank collapse Fianna F&aacute;il presided over and the collapse of the construction industry, and we all know how dreadfully painful and difficult the recovery has been.  We increasingly hear reference to a hard Brexit, but we do not have a person on Mr. Barnier's team yet.  The Taoiseach told me yesterday that there were 300 applications or so to work in that section in the Commission.  While the Taoiseach was certain a couple of weeks ago that there would be a senior Irish official on that team, he has been unable to say who is that official.  It seems from the Taoiseach's reply yesterday that, hopefully, some senior Irish officials will get into the group, but it means that we are very squeezed as a country.  There is a lack of focus on what will happen to small and medium-sized businesses and on the complications for ordinary retail businesses that import from the UK as well as the consequences of the disastrous fall in the value of sterling.</p> <p> Budget 2017 was predicated on a sterling exchange rate of approximately 85 pence to the euro.  We know now that sterling has gone above 90 pence to the euro and is hovering about that at the moment.  Given that the budget figures were prepared in that context and the volume of trade between Ireland and the UK, have the numbers been run to account for the change in the value of sterling?  The difference could mean big changes for the country.</p> <p> I have a question for the Minister and Revenue about tax avoidance by a small group of very rich people whose children can be gifted houses and valuable apartments ranging from &euro;250,000 to &euro;1 million and more.  If someone has five or six children, it can be done five or six times.  The impact of these transfers is that the child, often an adult child or someone coming into adulthood, is able to avoid inheritance tax and the family is able to avoid any element of gift or capital transfer taxes.  I have spoken to the Minister about this on a number of occasions and he has indicated to me that he has discussed this with Revenue.  I understood that he hoped to do something to close off the loophole, which only very wealthy people are able to use, but I do not see it in the legislation and am wondering what happened.</p> <p> I have previously commented on the Minister's reference to cutting the debt-to-GDP ratio well below the 60% level required by the EU to 45% and the setting aside of a rainy day fund, if the economy allows it, after 2018.  The wisdom of that approach, particularly the rainy day fund, has to be questioned.  The country needs a massive upgrade in capital investment.  People in urban areas know it and people in rural areas know it just as strongly.  The country has been starved of capital investment because of the crash and is now facing the complex challenges of Brexit.  It is, therefore, difficult to understand the economic logic of not seeking to bring forward and increase capital investment.  However, there is to be a review of the capital investment programme early next year.</p> <p> It would be useful to get an update on where we are on funding from the European Investment Bank, particularly in critical areas such as education infrastructure and housing.  I meet small and large-scale business people frequently.  Clearly, the critical thing, which is great from our point of view, for a multinational corporation bringing foreign direct investment to Ireland is that it does not have to draw down or access credit in Ireland.  However, a local small, medium or large business, by and large, has to use Irish banks, unless it is a State organisation, such as the ESB, which can access funds on the international markets.</p><p>Small and medium-sized building firms continue to experience serious difficulties in accessing funds when they seek to build a small housing development or apartment block.  The banks tell us they are sitting on money which they cannot lend because many of these builders have impaired credit histories.  If we do not address this problem, we will not achieve the required level of house building.  A medium-sized building company which wishes to build a small block of 20 apartments needs to access a credit structure that funds the entire development, rather than one or two apartments.  Similarly, modern building processes mean services and so forth must all be provided at the same time.  As such, a builder seeking to build a small housing development must be certain about having access to a pipeline of significant funding to commence and finish the development, thereby allowing people who are in a position to buy or rent a new home to do so.  </p> <p> On behalf of the Labour Party, I wrote to the Governor of the Central Bank about the deposit rules for home buyers.  I have also spoken to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, about the issue.  Many couples in their late 20s or 30s with two or three children are unable to obtain a mortgage but are paying more to rent a family sized home than they would have to pay for a mortgage.  This is particularly true in Dublin.  The Central Bank rules for mortgage lending do not take account of the fact that such couples have been paying large monthly rents for long periods.  While the Central Bank rules are correctly focused on ensuring home buyers have the discipline to meet the mortgage commitments they enter into, many families paying large rents are not in a position to save significant amounts.  If they were to buy a new home, they would receive some help under the new scheme provided for in the Bill, provided they could find the other element of the deposit.  On the other hand, if they want to buy a second-hand house, as many people do, because they have an established family and their children are attending school in a particular area, they are not eligible for the grant.  This is deeply unfair.  </p> <p> The D&aacute;il, collectively, must get the Central Bank to review its rules.  If a person has been paying rent for a long period and meeting his or her commitments over two, three or five years, the established practice is to take this into account when considering his or her creditworthiness as part of the loan approval process.  Banks want to know that the person buying a house will meet his or her repayment commitments.  There is nothing in the budget for couples who have been paying a large rent for two, three or five years, have children at school and can only buy a second-hand home because the only properties available in the locality are second-hand.  This is the case in large parts of Dublin and other large cities.  These young families are the backbone of communities, the people who commit to local schools and facilities.  The D&aacute;il, collectively, must have a stronger voice in order that the Central Bank will recognise the social implications of not being able to buy a house and having to rent until retirement age.  These issues have not featured in the debate thus far.  It has been the custom in Ireland for generations that people take on a mortgage when they are younger and later use the equity to help their children to make a start when they are young adults. </p> <p> In simply talking about houses and the construction sector we are at serious risk of overlooking the social impact of the discrimination against renters in the budget.  The dilemma faced by people renting has been completely ignored.  Some couples who are renting may have two, one and a half or one job between them and want a family home.  There will be plenty of scope on Committee Stage to do something for this group of people.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-10-26a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1308" speakername="Paul Murphy" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016102600007#E00200"><p>The Finance Bill confirms the nature of the budget.  It is a right-wing budget written for builders, landlords and the wealthy and to allow Ireland to continue to operate as a tax haven, with only token measures included to try to cover this up.  We heard much from the Fianna F&aacute;il Party during budget week and again this week about having a tempering effect on the Fine Gael Party - this is, apparently, what political parties now aspire to, as we saw in the case of the Labour Party in the previous Government - and taking the worst edges off what would have been a very bad budget.  We see this in black and white in the Finance Bill which has again been written for the 1% and has Fianna F&aacute;il's fingerprints all over it.</p>  <p>  The clearest example of the nature of the Finance Bill is in its approach to housing.  It is utterly incoherent on the issue, apart from its one common thread of assisting builders and landlords, as opposed to those in a housing crisis.  The Government, finally, gave us figures recently for the numbers of social housing completions this year.  With well over 100,000 families on housing waiting lists, 117 social houses have been built directly by local authorities so far this year, with a further 120 built by housing associations.  A total of 237 properties have been built this year.  These figures come after five years when the previous Government built the lowest number of new houses in the history of the State.  We heard promises and commitments over an extended period, not last week or last month, that a new approach would be taken by the Government.  We have been promised changes in housing provision for some time, but nothing has been done to provide social housing.  This is the only way the crisis will be addressed, yet the budget did not contain anything beyond minimal measures.  The additional 1,500 houses provided for are a drop in the ocean.  </p>  <p>  We should contrast this with the two main thrusts of the Finance Bill, namely, a builder's grant dressed up as a first-time buyer's tax rebate and new tax breaks and an extension of existing tax breaks for landlords.  These measures paint an accurate picture of the Government's approach of relying solely on the private sector and the free market and the idea that somehow incentivising them with further profits will resolve the housing crisis.  This approach has been tried over and over again and has failed.  </p>  <p>  From where did the idea of the first-time buyer's tax rebate or builder's grant come?  It was instructive to listen to the Minister for Finance speaking on the "Six One" news programme on the day of the budget.  When he was asked how he knew the tax rebate would boost supply he stated Mr. Tom Parlon and the Construction Industry Federation had assured him that it would.</p><p>He was then asked whether this was not going to drive up prices and put money in the pockets of developers, which it is.  He said the building industry, the builders and Tom Parlon in particular had assured him this will be effective and builders will move to build affordable houses.  Therefore, the lobby organisation that represents big developers in this country goes to the Government and the Minister, Deputy Noonan, and says it wants a grant transferred via a tax rebate for first-time buyers - a grant to builders - and promises they will not just take it as profits but will actually build more homes, and the Minister Deputy Noonan says it is fine and allocates &euro;50 million to pay for it.  It is incredible.<br/><br/>The reality of what will happen is that it will not make any difference to making affordable housing available for people and it will just push up house prices.  The high threshold of &euro;600,000 means it will push up house prices more than if it had been capped at a lower rate of, say, &euro;200,000, which is the maximum many workers could afford.  An interesting element of this is how, while it is supposedly to incentivise developers to get involved in building new houses on the basis of increasing prices, it is also available for self-build homes up to &euro;600,000.  If someone builds a home on their own land or their family's land for &euro;600,000, that is not a new starter home, it is a mansion.  It is clearly Fine Gael playing to a certain core constituency.<br/><br/>Davy has already projected - accurately, I would say - that the 5% rebate will add 2% to house prices next year so they will increase by 7% rather than 5%.  Even in terms of the new 70% loan to value ratio, the big winners are the builders.  To the extent that those who buy homes get any benefit whatsoever, it is massively skewed towards those on higher incomes who, therefore, are able to both afford the higher value homes, up to &euro;400,000 and then going up to &euro;600,000, and have paid enough tax in previous years to benefit from the rebate.  Even Colm McCarthy, a right-wing economist, has said that for a joint income, this is at the upper limit of the Irish income distribution, and for a single income, this is a grant to the very highest earners in the country.  The core approach of the Government in dealing with the housing crisis is to try to drive up the prices of starter homes.  Incidentally, the Minister, Deputy Noonan, bemoaned the fact there are no starter homes whereas, until recently, he was telling us that NAMA was assisting in the building of starter homes in the State.  That is the core strategy of the Government.<br/><br/>There was an excellent article by Lorcan Sirr in <i>The Sunday Times</i>where he spoke about the absolute incoherence of the approach of the Government.  On the one hand, it is pushing up house prices and helping to make them unaffordable for first-time buyers, and the fact the Government is incentivising this with more tax breaks, while simultaneously handing out first-time buyer rebates, shows how incoherent its policy is.  While there are first-time buyer rebates on one side, the other arm of the Government strategy is more tax breaks for landlords that will result in an increase in the buy-to-let sector that will drive up house prices further, therefore putting homes even further out of the reach of people.<br/><br/>Let us take a look at the measures for landlords provided for in the budget.  There is an extension of the living city initiative, which was previously only available to owner-occupiers but is now available to landlords.  The relief per home is capped but there is no limit on the number of homes for which a landlord can claim the relief, so it has the potential to cost a lot of money.  Most importantly, in section 15, full interest deductibility in respect of rented residential property will be restored over a five-year period by way of 5% annual increments.  That is a big extension of tax breaks for landlords.  It was one of the main demands made by landlord lobby groups to the Committee on Housing and Homelessness and it shows the power of landlord lobbying and the influence of that sector, which is not surprising given more than 20% of Deputies are landlords, so they get a sympathetic ear.<br/><br/>The pretext is that of boosting supply and stopping landlords from exiting the market, which is apparently the big fear.  We have argued and it has been confirmed that landlords are not exiting the market despite all the scaremongering to that effect designed to get them extra tax breaks.  Actually, as Lorcan Sirr pointed out, the sector has expanded from 319,000 tenancies at the end of last year to 324,000 in mid-2016.  The number of landlords also increased in the 20 months to June 2016.  The stock of rental properties in Dublin has risen by 54% since the first quarter of 2011.  Despite this, the Government is incentivising buy-to-lets again at a time when there is a huge hangover of buy-to-lets in arrears from before the crash, covering up the fact that Ulster Bank has just sold some 2,000 buy-to-lets in long-term arrears to Cerberus vulture fund and AIB is reported to be planning to sell off close to &euro;2 billion worth of buy-to-lets in arrears to other vulture funds.<br/><br/>The 5% increase in relief will not make much difference to people in long-term arrears.  Instead, that money would be much better spent in having State-owned banks like AIB write down the buy-to-lets in arrears and take them into public ownership for public housing.  Instead, it is standing by while thousands of buy-to-let tenants stand to be evicted.<br/><br/>We have been here before in terms breaks for builders and landlords.  Section 23 was obviously part of a smorgasbord of billions of euro of property-related tax breaks that blew up the property bubble and led to a banking and property crash.  It did not work in terms of resolving housing needs for ordinary people.  It is not going to work now and the same problems are being developed.<br/><br/>The Finance Bill contains tax breaks for businesses and for corporate executives.  The context is definitely the post-Brexit scenario and the Government has engaged in a race to the bottom with the City of London in a post-Brexit attempt to attract finance capital and corporate executives, who will add extremely little in terms of real economic activity to this society.  There is an extension of the special assignee relief programme to 2020.  Section 10, which deals with foreign earnings deductions, a tax break for Irish corporate executives working overseas, has been extended until the end of 2020, with the addition of Colombia and Pakistan as relevant states, and with the number of required days to be spent in a relevant state reduced from 40 to 30.<br/><br/>Section 25 refers to a so-called entrepreneurs relief through a cut in capital gains tax on sales of businesses from 20% to 10%.  This is exactly the cut demanded by IBEC, which wanted it cut to 10% in order to explicitly compete with Britain in the context of Brexit.  Watch this space, because IBEC also wanted an increase in the lifetime limit from &euro;1 million to &euro;15 million.  It was left at &euro;1 million in this budget but the Minister has promised to review it in the future and I would not be surprised if IBEC gets what it wants.<br/><br/>Other tax breaks for the wealthy include section 13, which prevents certain tax avoidance opportunities in regard to personal retirement savings accounts.  The question has to be asked why a standard fund threshold is so high at &euro;2 million.  It is no wonder the cost of tax reliefs on private pensions runs into billions.<br/><br/>It is also interesting to look at the whittling away of the high income individuals restriction.  This was introduced in 2006-07 and tightened in 2011, and is an attempt to reduce the ability of the wealthy to reduce their tax liability to almost nothing through the utilisation of tax breaks.  It was designed to ensure there was an effective income tax rate of at least 30% but that has been whittled away by the introduction of new tax reliefs which have not been added to the list of those that are included for the purpose of that calculation.  This budget goes even further because, as well as not adding, for example, the special assignee relief programme or the living city initiative, it goes out of its way to take a previously counted tax break off the list in that section 19 takes the employment and investment incentive off the list.<br/><br/>There is a return to government by tax break, through policies that only benefit the rich and misallocate resources away from public services and away from working class people.</p><p><i>11 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p> <p>A TASC report from 2012 put it extremely well. It states:</p><blockquote>The winners are those who have sufficient funds or borrowing capacity to invest in a tax-incentivised scheme.  And the winners are those individuals and companies who know how to exploit our tax rates and tax breaks &ndash; those who can pay accountants and tax advisers to save them money.<br /><br />The losers are the rest of us.  The losers are those who lack the income or funds to avail of tax breaks.  The losers are those paying more in other taxes, such as VAT, to compensate for the revenue foregone through tax breaks.  The losers are those bearing the brunt of public spending cuts imposed to pay for tax breaks: children, the elderly, the sick and the vulnerable.</blockquote><p>The same is true once again.  To cover it all up, there are tokenistic anti-tax avoidance measures.<br/><br/>The crackdown on section 110 arrangements is to be welcomed but the question to be answered concerns why it is anticipated that so little will be raised from it.  The figure is only &euro;50 million although some estimate that, by taking on the section 110 arrangements alone, one could raise at least an extra &euro;1 billion.  With regard to section 54, the question remains as to why there are penalty mitigation arrangements for tax defaulters at all.<br/><br/>The other big items - the need to close the double Irish in advance of 2020 and the need to close the knowledge development box - are simply not touched, despite the fact that the closure of the knowledge development box, for example, would result in a gain of almost enough to pay for pay equality for all public sector workers.</p></speech>

Its ability to do this on a consistent and ongoing basis is truly staggering.  It is even more staggering considering that policies of giving tax breaks and incentives to landlords and developers precipitated the greatest economic crisis this State has ever seen.  Here we are again, and the party is up to the same tricks and employing the same misguided, dangerous economic policies that precipitated the crisis in the first place.  I do not believe my saying this is in any way rhetorical or an exaggeration; in fact, I do not believe one could exaggerate the extent of the stupidity of these policies and the sort of political amnesia required to pursue them given what happened to this country.  It is really quite staggering in its proportions.</p>  <p>  In broad terms, it is absolutely accurate to state the budget gave crumbs to working people and a bonanza to developers and landlords.  The famous fiscal space of &euro;1.2 billion was divided up such that it left but crumbs for the majority of ordinary people and for the public services that desperately need a considerable boost in investment and funding.  In so far as some of that money was divided up across Departments and used for the miserable little tax break on the universal social charge, all the services and ordinary workers got were crumbs.  The biggest winners, by a very long margin, were the developers and landlords.</p>  <p>  When I go through the detail of the Finance Bill and link it to the budget as a whole, I estimate that at least &euro;0.5 billion, or more, of the overall fiscal space was given to landlords and developers.  Not all of it is in this Finance Bill.  Quite a lot of it is on the expenditure side.  Between the jigs and reels pertaining to tax and expenditure, however, the landlords and developers had a bonanza.  There is broad evidence to confirm that.  Some &euro;110 million was provided to private landlords in the form of the housing assistance payment scheme, and &euro;137 million was provided in the form of the rental allowance scheme.  Some &euro;200 million was provided in infrastructure grants to private developers for building private, for-profit housing.  Of course, &euro;50 million was provided through the help-to-buy scheme, as referred to in this Bill.  In addition, the interest deductibility section involves another handout to the landlords.  The tax break for renting rooms is another tax break for landlords.  We will proceed to discuss the other aspects.  In broad terms, all the incentives referred to amount to in excess of &euro;0.5 billion for landlords and developers.  This is shocking.</p>  <p>  Contrast that with what workers got through the miserable 0.5% reduction in the universal social charge burden.  This means that someone earning &euro;19,000 gets &euro;1.92 more per week, which is not even the price of a cup of coffee.  That is what the lowest-paid workers got.  Someone earning &euro;30,000, a little below the average, gets an additional &euro;2.94 per week.  These are the crumbs that were given to workers, although &euro;0.5 billion, or more, was given in subsidies, grants and tax breaks to the landlords and developers.  It is truly shocking.</p>  <p>  Aside from what was given and how the fiscal space was divvied up, the other big story of this Finance Bill, the budget generally and successive budgets is the manner in which Fine Gael has fought relentlessly to protect the most profitable corporations in this country, which are mostly multinationals, to isolate them from having to pay their fair share of tax.  According to EUROSTAT, living standards in this country are 15% below the European average.  They dropped by 10% during the period of austerity.  It should not be a surprise that, according to EUROSTAT, our living standards are on par with those of Greece, Portugal and Spain, all the countries that got absolutely crucified during the austerity imposed by the fiscal boot boys or austerity boot boys of the troika.  During the very same period, profits of the corporations have gone through the roof.  Apart from a brief dip in 2008 itself, profits have consistently risen, jumping an incredible 44% between 2014 and 2015.  National household wealth, net wealth after debts are stripped out, has jumped by approximately &euro;100 billion since 2012 but ordinary people's living standards have been slaughtered, dropping by a full 40%.</p>  <p>  The statistics and evidence are absolutely clear.  Consider what has happened under Fine Gael and the Labour Party.  I shall refer to some of the really ironic comments I heard from Deputy Joan Burton earlier on the need for an effective corporation tax rate, which apparently she is now proposing.  This is a Labour Party proposal.  I actually had to rub my ears when I heard Deputy Burton say that earlier.</p><p>Strangely enough, we have been proposing in every single budget for the last five years that we impose a minimum effective corporation tax rate and just make corporations pay the 12.5%.  The wealthiest multinationals pay on average about 6%.  The vulture funds pay less than 1%.  We said this to Deputies Joan Burton and Brendan Howlin and the former Deputy, Eamon Gilmore, for the last five or six years, but they absolutely stonewalled us, accused us of engaging in fantasy politics and told us this was nonsense and that there was no money.  &quot;There is no pot of gold&quot; was the famous expression.  Now, suddenly, in opposition, Deputy Joan Burton apparently has discovered that we should have a minimum effective corporation tax rate and, incredibly, is even credited with making this suggestion in recent media coverage.  I remind people that we have been arguing trenchantly for this for five years, saying we need to consider the effective rate.  This has been against the stonewalling of the Department of Finance, which recycled the nonsense we got from the Government that our effective corporation tax rate - how many different figures did we have? - hovered around 11.9% or was 10%-odd when it absolutely was not, a fact exposed by the European Commission in the case of Apple.  God knows what else will come out when the European Commission investigates several other companies that have engaged in billions worth of such tax avoidance with the collusion of successive Governments led by Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael.  No serious moves are being made to do anything about this when they could be made easily.  In any case, 12.5% is a miserable rate of tax, far below what ordinary workers must pay, but there is no move to do anything about it.  All the Government has to do is impose the 12.5% on the top line figure of corporations' profits before deductions and allowances are accounted for.<br/><br/>Regarding the distribution statistics, I could not get the 2014 figures because I cannot work the Revenue website at all, but the statistics for 2011 show a total of &euro;39 billion of deductions and allowances each year, which have probably shot up considerably since then.  That is &euro;39 billion worth of tax loopholes.  Those are the vulture funds.  That is Apple, Facebook, LinkedIn and God knows what else syphoning billions and billions out of the tax system with the collusion of successive Governments and the Department of Finance telling us again and again that the corporations are paying an effective rate.  The Department is playing accounting games and engaging in trickery with public representatives trying to get to the bottom of what is a massive, obscene tax evasion scandal in this tax haven that is Ireland.  Then we get a budget that just carries on with more of this stuff.<br/><br/>Interest deductibility has not been commented on much.  Comments have already been made about the help-to-buy scheme.  I repeat that already, within days of the announcement of the rent-to-buy scheme, property developers have increased prices by &euro;30,000 and &euro;40,000.  <i>TheJournal.ie</i>did a very good report showing that a particular developer, Kingscroft Properties in Delgany, has raised the price of a three-bedroom semi-detached house from &euro;395,000 to &euro;427,000, and a five-bedroom detached house from &euro;575,000 to &euro;620,000 since the budget.  That is what is happening: an absolute boon to developers and, in the case of landlords, this interest deductibility.  People really need to know this stuff.  Ordinary people cannot go into banks and ask to borrow &euro;10 million to buy an estate.  They would be told to take a hike.  They cannot even get mortgages.  However, a rich person with millions who wants to invest in, speculate on and profiteer from property can go into a bank and borrow &euro;10 million or &euro;15 million, buy an estate or whatever and then get a tax break on 75% of the annual interest payments on that loan which will give him or her massive profits, whether the estate bought is sold or rented.  Before this budget, the figure was 75%.  It is now proposed to ramp it up so that 80% of the interest repayment can be tax-deductible, and that will go to 100%.  This is just a license for the greedy developers and speculators to profiteer on a massive scale and pay literally not a cent of tax.  It is unbelievable.  Meanwhile, ordinary people are hammered.<br/><br/>The special assignee relief programme, SARP, tax break has been maintained for high-flying executives to pay less tax because apparently we need them so much to come here and teach us how to engage in tax evasion.  That is what we are doing.  We are giving them a tax break so they can come over here and engage in massive tax evasion in this country.  It is unbelievable.<br/><br/>Brexit and its impact were mentioned.  I will finish on this point.  Why is Brexit negatively impacting on the Irish economy?  It is because of currency speculation.  It is the speculators who are affecting the value of the British currency, which is negatively impacting on our economy.  Would any Government, seeing this, not want to do something about currency speculation and speculation generally?  Would it not therefore enthusiastically support the proposal for a financial transactions tax to impose at least some tax and some disincentive on these speculators?  No.  We fight trenchantly against the financial transactions tax to facilitate more of these people coming to the IFSC so they can use Ireland as a hub to engage in speculation all across Europe and all across the world, destabilising economies.  You could not make this stuff up.  There is much more detail to go through on Committee Stage, but this is shocking.  It is dangerous, unfair and unjust, and there is no vision for a fairer distribution of wealth and income in this country.  Quite the opposite: it is more about concentrating the wealth in the hands of the greediest minority, which has banjaxed this economy over recent years.</p></speech>

The section refers to &quot;penalties for deliberately or carelessly making incorrect returns&quot; and defines &quot;offshore matters&quot; to include relevant accounts, income and gains, relevant property situated and any other &quot;income, gains, accounts or assets&quot; arising or held in a country or territory other than the State.  The amendments to the principal Act withdraw from 1 May 2017 the penalty mitigation arrangements currently available to tax defaulters holding accounts and assets offshore.  The chairperson of the Revenue Commissioners, Mr. Niall Cody, indicated in a recent interview with <i>The Sunday Business Post</i>that the practice of people mitigating penalties and avoiding criminal prosecutions by making voluntary disclosures on untaxed income when tax evasion has taken place is finally being brought to an end.  Of course, commitments like this have been made again and again over recent decades and yet tax scandals such as those revealed in the Luxembourg leaks and the Panama papers continue to enrage compliant taxpayers and all citizens in Ireland and throughout the OECD.</p><p>The sums involved in offshore tax evasion continue to be vast, and the Revenue Commissioners report that almost &euro;3 billion in additional tax, interest and penalties has been recovered for the State through Revenue's investigations into offshore evasion.  However, several commentators, including the distinguished <i>Sunday Independent</i>journalist, Mr. Gene Kerrigan, have rightly queried the rationale for so-called &quot;penalty mitigation arrangements&quot; for tax defaulters referred to in section 54.  There were never such arrangements for PAYE workers, compliant small business and farming or the compliant self-employed.  PAYE workers in particular have had no choice but to meet their income tax obligations in real time over the past six decades, since the PAYE system began.</p><p>Therefore, is there one law and Finance Bill for the people who control the country and Parliament and another for the mass of hardworking families and individuals?  A reading of many of the Bill's provisions would suggest that the people who own the country eventually write our finance Bills.<br/><br/>Why is this provision delayed until 1 May 2017?  Why are the super-wealthy allowed another future deadline to get their tax liabilities in order or indeed to move assets and accounts through further Finance Act loopholes into more untaxed havens?  I put questions like this to the first Minister for Finance I addressed across the floor of this House, the former Minister and Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern.  He sanctioned a second tax amnesty in the early 1990s which was supposed to bring all tax due on tax evaded and offshore assets back to the Exchequer.  Of course, vast sums continued to be placed outside the remit of our Revenue Commissioners as financialisation of assets grew exponentially down to the crash of 2008.  Now eight years later, Part 6 of this Bill is trying to close the stable door once again.<br/><br/>Hopefully, section 55 on changes to the publication of the names of tax defaulters will act to throw further light on defaulters who have failed to pay a settlement sum.  However, our constituents rightly ask why the amendments in section 54 do not at the latest commence from the passage of this Bill through the Oireachtas.<br/><br/>There were lengthy discussions at the D&aacute;il Committee on Budgetary Oversight, of which I am a member, about the avoidance of massive amounts of corporation tax by the misuse of section 110 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  Using the device of a profit-participating note, PPN, vulture funds, often based in a foreign tax jurisdiction, lent their Irish subsidiaries funds to buy bad loans of property in Ireland.  The profit-participating notes were repaid from revenue before tax thus almost eliminating all Irish tax owed by the Irish subsidiary vulture funds.  Hopefully, section 21 will now begin to address this section 110 scam which has cost the Irish Exchequer so dearly.  Section 21 lays down that the coupon in profit-participating notes will not be deductible in calculating the profits of the specified property business unless the PPN is paid to: an individual or company paying corporation tax; an Irish or EEA pension fund; or an EEA citizen or company who will pay tax on receipt of the interest, provided that the payment of the coupon to the EEA citizen or company is not for tax avoidance purposes.<br/><br/>I also welcome section 21(a)(i) which reduces the period within which a company intending to use section 110 of the 1997 Act must inform Revenue within eight weeks of acquiring qualifying assets of &euro;10 million.<br/><br/>There has also been a widespread welcome for section 22 which inserts a new Chapter 1B to Part 27 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  The new chapter provides that Irish real estate funds, IREFs, must deduct a 20% withholding tax on certain property distributions to beneficiaries who are not within the charge of Irish tax, out of profits arising from the funds' Irish land, although certain categories of investors such as pension funds, life assurance companies and other collective investment undertakings are excluded.  Section 22 seems to apply to all funds currently in the Irish property market and if so, this is a positive step by the Government.  Perhaps the Minister will clarify in his response that section 22 is indeed retrospective in terms of existing vulture funds.<br/><br/>Hopefully, economists like David McWilliams who have been critical of vulture funds' virtual tax-free status are correct when they predict that the introduction of this withholding tax will lead to a fall in the price of commercial property in Ireland and a resulting fall in soaring rents and costs.<br/><br/>I note that Irish real estate funds are defined as investment vehicles where 25% of the value of the vehicle is composed of Irish real estate assets.  Have the Minister and Revenue any estimate of the losses to the Exchequer owing to the lack of a withholding tax over the past six or seven years and the likely tax amounts that will accrue to the State from the new tax in 2017?  Has he any similar information on the widespread misuse of section 110 of the 1997 Act?<br/><br/>Why did the Minister not move, as he said in last night's speech, to &quot;ensure that the Irish tax base is appropriately protected&quot; in his earlier budgets?  After all, I believe this is his seventh budget.  He might also tell us how he will ensure that the section 110 regime is maintained for what his speech referred to as &quot;bona fide securitisations&quot;.  I welcome, of course, that section 21, amending section 110, applies to profits arising from the holding of financial assets based on Irish land and property in the account period from 6 September 2016 and does not permit the section 110 companies to revalue or &quot;mark to market&quot; their assets at that date.<br/><br/>On the issues of section 110, the withholding tax and the performance of vulture funds generally, I commend a number of colleagues in the House who have done outstanding work in investigating this matter.  In particular, I commend Deputies Donnelly, Pearse Doherty and Boyd Barrett, who repeatedly brought some of these issues before the House.<br/><br/>Of course, one of the biggest responses by constituents has been to section 8 which inserts into the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 the provision of an income tax rebate which will be available to first-time purchasers of newly built homes.  On 19 July 2016, the new Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Coveney, launched Rebuilding Ireland - an Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness.  At the time he spoke of assistance for first-time buyers and the deposits needed, given the extortionate rents being charged, particularly in the cities.<br/><br/>On budget day the details were announced that a rebate of 5% of the property value, up to a maximum of &euro;20,000, would be paid as an income tax rebate on income tax paid over the previous four years.  The rebate would apply only to new builds and self-builds on a property up to a maximum value of &euro;600,000.  A mortgage of at least 80% was, at the time, required for eligibility.  This, of course, has now been reduced to 70% as the Central Bank was concerned that first-time buyers would take on too much debt.  Given that the mortgages are limited at a 3.5 times LTI ratio, surely this now means that the rebate to be given has just been largely negated by the need to have a higher level of deposit, which does not seem to make sense.<br/><br/>In 2015, of the 38,000 new houses sold just 760 were purchased by first-time buyers.  A number of young constituents some with families have bought new homes in the past three to six months in Dublin Bay North.  The building of our north and south fringe estates in Dublin city and Fingal has finally recommenced in the past year.  Thankfully, much-needed homes are at last being supplied by developers in that region and hard-pressed young families and individuals have desperately managed to cobble together a deposit and move into their new homes in recent months.  However, they will derive no benefit from section 8 and have fairly asked that the tax rebate should apply to all taxpayers who bought their first new home in the 2016 tax year.  Perhaps the Minister might consider this given the depths of the housing crisis.<br/><br/>Many housing agencies and advocates have queried the impact of this demand-side section 8 instrument and whether it will simply result in even higher prices for the still very limited supply of new homes in the Dublin region and other urban areas.  Just 75 new social housing units were actually built in 2015 and only 117 new builds have been constructed by local authorities in the first half of 2016.  The vast majority of the 13,000 social housing units that were delivered in 2015 were brought forward through the HAP scheme and the private rented market.  Section 8 is, therefore, very unlikely to ease the appalling levels of homelessness and rack-renting in the Irish housing market.<br/><br/>The latest available figures from the end of August show that there were 4,248 homeless adults across the country with 2,950 of these in Dublin.  At that time, there were also 1,151 families in homeless accommodation across the country with 2,263 children.  A total of 998 of these families and 2,012 of these children are homeless in Dublin, including a large number from my constituency.  Of course, we also have the hidden homeless that the Acting Chairman would know about so well.  On one October night recently, 169 people were engaged with Dublin's Housing First Service.  RTE's &quot;Prime Time&quot; estimated that the number on waiting lists for social housing nationally jumped by 2% in the past four months from 135,832 to 139,359, an increase of over 3,500.  The Dublin City Council housing list hit a new peak recently with 44,034 people waiting to be rehoused and there are 9,522 families and individuals waiting for social housing for between five and ten years.<br/><br/>The inevitable corollary to these appalling housing list figures is the shocking situation outlined by <i>daft.ie</i>last August which shows that the average monthly rent nationwide is at its highest level on record with rents rising almost 4% in the second quarter of 2016.  In Dublin, the annual rate of rent inflation was 11.1% and rents in the capital are now 5.2% higher than their previous peak in early 2008.<br/><br/>The litany of these awful figures on the housing needs of our constituents will not be remotely addressed by section 8 of this Bill or the other inducements for landlords to which I will refer briefly.  Rebuilding Ireland and the earlier housing plans brought forward in the time that the Minister, Deputy Noonan, has held the finance portfolio are a feeble response to a desperate crisis.  The deeply ideological position taken by the Ministers, Deputies Noonan and Coveney, of the complete reliance, through HAP and other Finance Bill measures, on the private sector has caused profound suffering for tens of thousands of Irish citizens and their children.</p><p>The fact that the hard right has been in charge of our Government for the last six years has created and exacerbated a desperate situation.  The Acting Chairman will know that even in 2011 we had a housing crisis, but we now have a worse one.</p> <p> It is clear that Governor Philip Lane of the Central Bank, in letters to colleagues in this House, is extremely dubious of the efficacy of a demand-side measure like section 8.  Governor Lane seems to rightly feel that only a greater level of construction of new homes can restore the totally dysfunctional Irish housing market.  As I remarked several times at the Committee on Budgetary Oversight, Governor Lane and his predecessor Patrick Honohan have to take a lot of the blame for the current housing impasse.  Their macroprudential rules are singularly unhelpful to first-time buyers.  Hard-working, dual-income young couples inform me that they pay rents of &euro;1,300 to &euro;1,500 a month, or more, and could just as well be paying a mortgage.  However, because of Governor Lane&rsquo;s macroprudential rules, they just cannot get a deposit together to buy in most areas of the Dublin Bay North constituency.  Hopefully, section 8 will offer some hope to these families but a fundamental revision of the Central Bank macroprudential rules must result from the review to be announced next month.  We look forward to discussing that in this House and at the Committee on Budgetary Oversight.</p> <p> Many constituents have asked whether additional tax expenditures should be incurred through support for landlords.  At the Committee on Budgetary Oversight, I have repeatedly raised the whole issue of tax expenditures.  When one looks through this budget, there is a list of those expenditures in sections 14, 15, 16, 17 and so on which this House has not been given any costing.  We receive a kind of vague costing of parts of the budget for some of them, but the basic figures needed to be able to frame and shape a budget, particularly in terms of tax expenditures, are not available to us.  Anybody coming to the House with legislation to spend taxpayers money or to not collect taxpayers money should come with a fairly precise costing of the expenditure that will result from it.  That is not the case at the moment.</p> <p> While section 12, which amends section 216A of the 1997 Act by expanding the exemption from income tax from &euro;12,000 to &euro;14,000 for 2017 for people letting a room in their private residence, may assist in providing much-needed accommodation for students and single people, other new reliefs are more questionable.  For example, section 15 provides for full-interest deductibility in respect of rented residential property in the 1997 Act to be restored over a five-year period by means of 5% annual increments, with 75% to 80% applying to interest accruing after 1 January  2017.  Likewise, outside the Fine Gael Party, many citizens have asked why threshold A is being increased from &euro;280,000 to &euro;310,000 for gifts and inheritances taken after 12 October 2016.  It is no wonder that many of the 700,000 Irish citizens who rent and have to rent a home may clearly conclude that Minister Noonan and the Fine Gael Party care only for the rights of landlords and property owners, as exemplified by budget 2017 and the Finance Bill before us.</p> <p> The Ministers, Deputies Noonan and Coveney, could have used this budget and the Finance Bill to gear up the local authorities in terms of planning and construction staff by expanding them and by going back to an era that the Acting Chairman will remember in the 1980s and before when we were building, for the most part, very fine estates across this city and other cities in the country.  It would finance the local authorities to use compulsory purchase orders to take the land and build large, social, multi-agency tenure, affordable houses and apartments for our constituents.  They chose not to do so and will be judged on this matter in the general election.</p> <p> Before I pass over to my colleague, I would like to raise the issue that a number of constituents have brought to our attention about section 86 of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act, which allows parents to gift properties to their children without paying tax, once the child has lived in the property for three years and goes on to live there for another six years.  The distinguished journalist, Mr. Ken Foxe has done outstanding work on this.  It is said that the tax loss from this tax expenditure is something in the order of &euro;120 million a year.  In other words, for certain very rich people who can buy houses for &euro;1 million plus for their children and gift them, inheritance tax simply does not arise.  I would like to know whether this is the case.  A number of my constituents have taken Mr. Foxe's articles and brought them to my attention.  Is that the case?  What are we going to do about it and what can we do about it on Committee Stage?</p></speech>

Bu&iacute;ochas le Dia go bhfuil an rud seo ag dul amach chucu.  T&aacute;im bu&iacute;och as ucht na deise caint faoin mBille Airgeadais.  I have to agree with my colleague Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett that it is unjust, unfair and an absolute waste of a golden opportunity.  We were all elected to look at matters in a different way.  I have repeatedly said in this Chamber that we were not asked to reduce taxes.  It is an insult to have a debate around the budget as to how to deal with a fiscal space in terms of a tiny reduction in the USC which put a euro or two into workers' pockets, as opposed to looking at the fiscal space and the other uncollected taxes that we require in order to provide services.</p><p>The week before last at the Committee of Public Accounts, the Department of Social Protection made a presentation on its budget, which is, I think, &euro;19.7 billion or &euro;19.9 billion.  In the course of that debate, it was established that for the figures available in 2014, 40% of this country would be living in poverty without social welfare payments.  Yet, the debate around social welfare is not that 40% of the social welfare comes directly from the Social Insurance Fund and the other 60% from our taxes but it is around fraud in social welfare, even though that occupies a minute part of the social welfare budget.</p><p>I brought in a newspaper into the meeting and I have brought it with me again today, and I am coming back to the Finance Bill in terms of tax evasion.  I have here the local paper,<i>Connacht Tribune</i>, with a headline referring to a crackdown on fraudsters and an article mentioning actual garda&iacute; on the street stopping cars and trucks in Galway to curb social welfare fraud and tax evasion.  Of course, that is for the ordinary person.  We are talking about hundreds of thousands of euro there, or a million or two at a maximum.  We compare that to the massive tax evasion that is being referred to by those of us proudly on the left and those in Sinn F&eacute;in who have highlighted the issue.  My colleague, Deputy Broughan, has paid tribute to the three Deputies in particular who have highlighted the misuse of section 110 and other tax loopholes.  It is from that type of new politics on this side of the House that the debate has slightly changed and has focused the Government's attention in a minimal way on dealing with tax evasion, somehow trying to change the d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht into what will make us a more equal country and stopping what Deputy Burton referred to when she said that we &quot;reluctantly&quot; pay tax.  I proudly pay tax.  Anybody I know proudly pays tax, but what we are looking for in return are services.  We are looking for a health service and for housing.</p><p>That takes me directly to the Finance Bill itself and to section 8 on the grant for first-time buyers.  Just about every economist in the country has said that this will add to the price of houses.  They have already been quoted.  Davy stockbrokers has revised upwards its growth forecast.  It expects house prices to grow at a rate of 7% rather than 5%.  In the rental sector, the secure rents campaign has come together, made up of five unions and the Uplift online campaign, and is absolutely begging the Government to interfere in the rental market because the prices and the rents are rising by up to 40%.  Again, there are absolutely no measures in this Finance Bill to deal with that, which is bad enough, because there are no simple solutions.  However, I would have expected a debate about the housing crisis and the rise in rents that are just astronomical.  Before taking Galway as an example, I will give an up-to-date figure from Savills.  Almost a million people, or to be precise, 856,100 people, are now relying utterly on the private rental sector.  That is 856,100 people with absolutely no security of tenure and with rents going up on a daily basis.</p><p>I want to mention research by Dr. Padraic Kenna in Ollscoil na h&Eacute;ireann, Gaillimh.  He pointed out the rate of evictions for non-payment of rent is higher than that of evictions for non-payment of mortgage.  While mortgage arrears are certainly in crisis, evictions for rent arrears are higher and more acute but there is absolutely nothing in the Bill to deal with them.</p> <p> Not alone this, but the measures will actually worsen the housing crisis, if this is possible.  I do not stand here to give a doomsday scenario, I stand here on the basis of experience, having been elected to Galway City Council in 1999 and having watched the waiting list increase month on month and year on year.  The reason for this is each Government, be it Fianna F&aacute;il, the PDs, Fine Gael or the Labour Party, has been utterly reliant on the private market, which got us into the mess in the first place.  We have a false debate about those on the left not supporting the private market.  There is a role for the private market, but not free reign.</p> <p> I will take Galway as a microcosm of the country with regard to the latest housing quarterly report issued at the end of October.  I use these figures not to be parochial but to make a point as to how the housing crisis is getting worse and worse despite the Rebuilding Ireland document and the roadshow, to which I refer as a circus, travelling the country with the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney.  Prior to this we had the former Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, with the same type of bombastic rhetoric, not dealing with the problem or even analysing it.  If we look at Galway, the last time a social house was built in Galway was 2009.  Yes, there have been houses under the voluntary schemes, but the last time we had a direct build was 2009.</p> <p> We are now in 2016 and no house was built this year.  Next year there is a plan for 14 houses as part of an overall scheme of approximately 60 houses.  Permission was given under Part VIII in my time for those houses.  The question must be asked as to why they have not been built.  I understand that somewhere between Galway City Council and the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government lies the truth.  It seems the Department has told the city council to go back and look again at whether more houses can be built on the site and we have a delay for some reason.  I would have expected a Minister to ask the city council to tell him or her what land it has zoned residential, precisely where the land is, what planning permissions are extant on it and what needs to be done, with the local authority, to build the houses.  This would be a practical approach.</p> <p> Without a social housing build we will have a housing crisis.  Yes, we need the private market, as I have said, but we need direct build by the city council of a mixture of houses.  This was done in the past, which is why we kept the housing crisis at bay until such time as we stopped it and took the councils out of it.  Under the guise of rhetoric, the Minister and the Government state there is a massive social housing build.  There is not.  The budget gives &euro;110 million to the housing assistance payment scheme, &euro;137 million to rent allowance and &euro;200 million for infrastructural projects, which really means we will ask private developers to do us a favour and take over and build on the land we zoned residential and bought when the market was booming.  The Finance Bill, under various measures including the first-time buyer grant which is a direct benefit to the landlord, will once again rely utterly on the private market, which caused the problem in the first place.</p> <p> In Galway city as we speak, 4,720 households are on the waiting list.  There is much talk about Dublin.  At a conservative estimate, the 4,720 households in Galway mean that somewhere between 13,000 and 15,000 people in a city of 72,000 have been on a waiting list for a house since 2002.  We are told the only game in town is the housing assistance payment and in the budget a phenomenal figure was added to what was already there to fund the housing assistance payment.  What this means for the ordinary people listening and watching is they are taken off the waiting list and put into a private house with no security of accommodation.  They move at the whim of the landlord from the east to the west of the city, they move their children from school, and they have all of the other consequences of the lack of tenure and security.</p> <p> Even worse than this, we use limited staff resources to administer it in Galway.  The only delay on rolling it out is due to the lack of staff.  When people go on the housing assistance payment scheme they are taken off the waiting list.  What is going on is a massaging of waiting list figures and a failure to deal with the housing crisis.  Rather than having a housing waiting list we will have a huge transfer list.  Nobody in the Government has looked at the equity or legal basis of this, nor how somebody in receipt of a housing assistance payment might get priority to go into a local authority house when a landlord sells a house.</p> <p> According to the quarterly report, 36 families are staying in for profit hotels or hostels and various other bed and breakfasts throughout Galway city.  There are 32 such families at any given time in Galway city.  When they turn up, and rightly so, to declare themselves homeless at the city council offices, the staff are under pressure to house them.  When an empty local authority house becomes vacant the chances are they might get it because of the pressure.  Therefore, complete inequality is built into the service between those who have been waiting patiently since 2002 and those who get into difficulty, and our hearts go out to them, who turn up homeless.  We have a complete mess regarding a just and equitable allocation scheme.</p> <p> A measure of the difficulty is seen in the rent a room scheme, which has increased to &euro;14,000.  One would imagine that at some stage we would think rationally and logically and state how will we bring in a budget to help reduce the housing crisis, bring in public transport, and look at long-term unemployment and indigenous industry, which is equally as important as foreign direct investment.  However, we seem to go down the road all of the time of tinkering with the system and when the Government is forced by the Opposition to do something it does so in the most minimal of ways.  For example, with regard to section 54, it is giving a break until 1 May which, significantly, is workers' day.  The Government is giving the big tax evaders a break, and introducing it on workers' day, 1 May 2017.  If this is not ironic I do not know what is.  I take this opportunity, without any hesitation, to use my voice to say this is a most unequal budget and I will not support the Finance Bill, although it has some good measures to which I referred in a previous speech and I will return to them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-10-26a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1313" speakername="Noel Grealish" time="11:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016102600013#L00200"><p>I am delighted to have an opportunity to speak on the Finance Bill 2016.  I welcome many of the elements of the budget which the Finance Bill will bring into effect, including the reduction in the rate of USC, which is one of the most hated taxes ever introduced in the country.  Some people are giving out about the help to buy scheme, but we have to do something to try to get young people into the housing market.  I hope this will give some comfort to people who want to live in their houses.  Every Deputy in the House has young couples coming to them telling them they are just not able to get a mortgage to buy a house.  When houses are available they go to their parents and grandparents.  I hope this will play a role and they will be able to get on the property market.</p>  <p>  The rent a room relief scheme is very good for Galway in particular, where we have NUI Galway and GMIT, which are two great colleges which bring in approximately 25,000 students a year to our city.  Every year, there is a scramble for accommodation.  In one house there could be up to five or six students in one room.  I hope with the increase in the threshold it will make more rooms available to students in Galway city in particular.</p><p>I acknowledge that in other cities with colleges accommodation needs to be provided for students.  If it is not provided, the colleges will be unable to take in students who must have a place in which to stay.  Students are significant spenders within cities.  They pay a great of money for food and digs and socialising, which are all part of the experience of going to college.</p> <p> The Minister for Social Protection is talking about introducing a dole payment scheme for the self-employed.  They always pay their taxes at the end of the year, but they have always been left aside.  Many of them had no work during the downturn and they were not in receipt of social protection payments.  I hope something will come from that proposal.  I welcome the small reduction in income tax for the self-employed and the &euro;5 increase in pensions.  It is small, but it is a step in the right direction.  I hope it will be increased by much more in the next budget.</p> <p> While these positive elements of the budget go some distance along the road, there is a long way to go before we will have anything like fair play for the squeezed middle class.  They made the most sacrifices and carried the greatest burden of the economic collapse.  They did not cause the problem, yet they were asked to pick up the bill and endure the pain time after time in the past decade.  They carried the country on their backs to the stage where there is a recovery in progress.  They could also be called "The Forgotten Middle", as they have been hammered on  all sides by taxes and charges.  They are not earning enough to be comfortable, but their income is in excess of the threshold at which they could benefit from the State supports normally offered to those who are struggling.  There is a disturbing lack of support for them and many thousands are struggling just to make ends meet.  In almost all cases, the squeezed middle are both cash poor and time poor.  Middle income earners still pay more in tax than they did seven years ago.  As the Irish Tax Institute confirms, workers only have to earn &euro;33,800 a year before paying half of every euro earned above that figure in direct taxes.  If they are lucky enough to receive a &euro;10 a week increase in pay, before they can even blink an eye, income tax, the USC and PRSI have grabbed almost half of it, leaving them with little more than a fiver.</p> <p> The people in the middle have huge costs in dealing with endless bills for child care and property tax, as well as ever increasing insurance premiums.  We all know by how much they have increased in recent years and continue to do so.  The House is trying to address the issue and I hope we will find a solution to the problem.  It is possible that the price of fuel will increase,which will, in turn, increase the cost of getting to work.  All this is in addition to the financial burden of sending their children to school and then to third level.  Many are not renewing their health insurance policies because they view it as a cost that they can cut from their stretched budgets, meaning that the State will bear a greater burden if they fall ill.  I hope they will not.  It is sad that, in some cases, pay day is greeted with relief rather than joy - relief that they have managed to again stagger through the last few days of another month with the remaining meagre few euro from their previous wage packet.  The relief is short-lived, of course, as their wages are hoovered up in the following few days by bills for electricity, heating, child care and all of the other regular demands.  An unforeseen bill such as a medical expense or a school contribution request is greeted with panic.  The wheel keeps turning, month after month, with little relief in sight.  The people concerned deserve a little fair play.  They did not cause the economic downturn, but they have been asked to pay the most.</p> <p> The measures included in the Bill are only a tiny step in the right direction.  I urge the Government to take steps in the future to bring a measure of fairness to the people caught in the middle who are paying for everything and benefiting from almost nothing.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-10-26a.27" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1319" speakername="Michael Healy-Rae" time="11:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016102600014#M00200"><p>I too appreciate the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this important Bill which will implement the changes contained in the budget.  I refer, first, to the USC and the fact that when it was introduced during the financial crisis, we were told it would be a temporary tax.  The charge is crippling all workers who have put their shoulders to the wheel to try to turn the economy around.  While the proposed changes are welcome, this is only the start.  We want to see a sustained attempt to do what should be done, which is to eliminate the charge.  It was a temporary, emergency tax at the time it was introduced and will have to be examined in future budgets because that is what people want and expect.</p>  <p>  On the increases in pension and other social welfare payments, one question is being asked continuously.  If a budget measure is being introduced to increase taxation, it can be done before midnight on budget day, but social welfare recipients are being told that they have to wait until next March for the increases in their payments to be made.  That is unfair on those who are struggling with high increased insurance costs, other charges for health care and day-to-day living expenses.  They are genuinely finding it difficult to manage.</p>  <p>  Deputy Noel Grealish referred to the squeezed middle.  Recently, I was approached by a young garda who had graduated from the Garda College in Templemore and had been deployed in Dublin city.  He told me straight to my face that he could not afford to be a garda in Dublin.  When accommodation costs and the fact that he is away from home are taken into account, with the reduced money for which garda&iacute; are working, he said, "I cannot afford to be a guard anymore."  It was an awful statement for a young person to come out with.  It highlights how tight and how tough some people are finding it.  </p>  <p>  With regard to the self-employed, it is of tremendous importance that people who create employment have the opportunity to avail of State assistance if their business gets into trouble.  This has happened through no fault of their own and there was nothing available for them.  Even if they had savings, they would only have lasted so long.  I have always felt strongly about this issue.</p>  <p>  Revenue and the Department examined the equalisation of the rebate on diesel and petrol when drafting the budget.  I am glad that it has been desisted from at this time, but in future budgets any attempt to equalise the rebate would have absolutely massive negative consequences for the economy because the rebate would not be equalised downwards to the cost of diesel.  In other words, the price of diesel would increase at the pump to the same price as petrol.  This would have knock-on negative effects on all aspects of our lives and be detrimental to the haulage industry and everybody involved in the delivery of goods.  All costs would increase because of the proposed measure.  I want to ensure the people who were dreaming it up will not consider it again because it would not make sense.</p>  <p>  I refer to housing.  In case anybody says I have a vested interest, I am involved in the business in a small way and want to declare this in case anybody accuses me of anything afterwards.  Helping young people to get on the property ladder is of massive importance because young couples want to get out of rented accommodation and do not want to spend the rest of their lives renting.  Other European countries have a model whereby people rent all of their lives, but young Irish families want to have their own homes and security of tenure and be able to pass them on to future generations.  I welcome some of the measures proposed, but the one elephant in the room when it comes to property is the unused buildings in towns and villages.  There are unused properties with shop units downstairs and living accommodation upstairs in every town and village.  Every incentive that could be brought forward to ensure investors and others willing to purchase them should be encouraged, whether it be through tax rebates or the provision of grant assistance.  Whatever help is provided would breathe new life into communities.  Many villages are dead.</p></speech>

I am not doing this in any political point scoring manner and I accept previous Governments were equally culpable in this regard.  It is about the legacy issue of how the State dealt with child sex abuse in national day schools.  The State fought against any idea of culpability for that until Louise O'Keeffe won a major breakthrough case in the European Court of Human Rights in 2014.  The Taoiseach will be familiar with that case.</p><p>The State's response to that European Court of Human Rights judgment has been a significant failure, leaving much to be desired, however.  The State introduced an <i>ex gratia</i>payment scheme but, in many respects, the limits were too low.  The prior complaint expedient that was inserted effectively debarred many from seeking justice.  Only seven settlements so far have been reached out of 210 cases, with the remainder still going through the courts.</p><p>Recently, I met a victim who has been involved in this situation for some time.  He was the victim of horrific abuse at the hands of a Christian Brother in a school.  The abuser was subsequently convicted in this and other abuse cases.  There are a number of other victims out there at the moment.  The man in question has been up and down through the courts and the religious orders but has received no compensation or a cent from the State.</p><p>Many of the people in question discontinued their cases when the Supreme Court ruled the State did not have an obligation.  Recently, the High Court stated it will not uphold their rights to pursue their cases again in law.  In his ruling, Mr. Justice Max Barrett said, &quot;[But] the Irish people, with their great and proper sense of justice, may well conclude that the path of rightness in this matter should lead ultimately to a different end&quot;.  He added, &quot;As an Irishman, I would respectfully agree&quot;.</p><p>Essentially what has gone on is unacceptable.  After the Ryan report, the Taoiseach then said the response of the State should &quot;draw together all the generosity, sensitivity and compassion that should have been shown to survivors when they were children&quot;.  He went on to say Ireland should become a world leader in reconciliation and reparation.  According to the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Richard Bruton, in a parliamentary reply, there are 210 cases.  By any objective standard, that is a finite number.  Either through the criminal injuries tribunal or some other method, I implore the Taoiseach - I am willing to be open and responsive - to get a mechanism to ensure the victim I met, as well as others, will be properly and duly responded to by the State.</p></speech>

I remember meeting Louise O'Keeffe with the then Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan.  There was a huge file on the case, leaving aside her courage in pursuing her case in the European court.</p>  <p>  I do not know how many victims of sexual abuse there have been over the years in the primary school system.  It is no more than the secondary school system, I assume.  We had the redress scheme, the case of all the Magdalenes - not that there was sexual abuse in the vast majority of cases - and the mother and baby home report which will come before the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  We will have to see what that means.</p>  <p>  I cannot recall all the details of the file in this case.  Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin's asked if something can be done about this.  I have no idea of the scale of what might be involved.  I need to read the detail of the file and the legal outcomes.</p>  <p>  People who were abused have to live with that for all of their lives.  It is a horrific issue to have to contend with every waking moment.  I do not want to go beyond that.  To commit to something that I do not have the full facts or details about would not be appropriate on the floor of the D&aacute;il.  The sexual abuse of children is a horrific crime.  Those who perpetrate such crimes, if they are still around, should be brought before justice.  To go back the distance involved here would present an enormous scale and challenge.  Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin has made a point.  I will have to look at the scale of what might be involved to answer his question on whether anything might be possible.  I do not want to give a commitment without focussing on the potential scale of what is involved.</p></speech>

There is a sense there is a finite number which can be dealt with.  As late as this summer, some of these victims were threatened with legal costs.  From the victims' perspective, the State is adversarial the whole way through, even where convictions have been secured against the abusers.  By any objective yardstick or analysis of it, particularly given that a 17-judge European court made it clear the State was liable, there is a sense the State is welching on its liability in trying to circumvent it.  It is not being holistic, generous or following through in the spirit which most Members would have thought would have been the order of the day.</p>  <p>  I know the Taoiseach is very busy, but I am raising this in a non-political way.  Every Member will agree we need to look afresh at the cases involved and we, as a State, should be approaching this far differently than we have been.  The State has been too punitive and too adversarial against the individuals concerned.  The individuals in question have been to hell and back.</p></speech>

That is 210 cases before the courts.  However, we have no idea of the numbers who might wish to come forward to say they were sexually abused in school X or Y by teacher or person X or Y.  We have no idea of the scale of that.</p><p>When the State dealt with the Louise O'Keeffe case on 28 January 2014, when the judgment was issued, it made awards both in respect of pecuniary and non-pecuniary damages, costs and expenses.  It also agreed in December 2014 that out-of-court settlements will be offered to those extant cases of school child sexual abuse being brought against the State where the cases came within the terms of the European Court of Human Rights judgment and satisfied the Statute of Limitations.  In that regard, the State Claims Agency, which manages such cases on behalf of the State, has made settlement offers which have been accepted in six cases.  In July 2015, the Government approved proposals to offer <i>ex gratia</i>payments of up to a maximum of &euro;84,000 to those who initiated legal proceedings in such cases against the State, but who subsequently discontinued their claims against the State and where, similarly, the circumstances of the claims came within the terms of the European Court of Human Rights judgment, and where the claims were not statute barred prior to the proceedings being discontinued.  I will follow through on the Deputy's question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-10-26a.34" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1330" speakername="Gerry Adams" time="12:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016102600016#O00100"><p>On Monday the First and deputy First Ministers, Ms Arlene Foster and Mr. Martin McGuinness, with the First Minister of Scotland, Ms Nicola Sturgeon, and the First Minister of Wales, Mr. Carwyn Jones, met the British Prime Minister, Ms Theresa May, in London.  It was the first meeting of the Joint Ministerial Committee in almost two years.  All of those involved demanded that be fully involved in the British Government's negotiations in leaving the European Union.  However, it is clear that the British Government has no intention of allowing this to happen.  Instead, the leaders were offered access to the Tory Government's Brexit Minister.  Downing Street officials were busy warning against any attempt by Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to undermine the British Government's position.  The British Government's approach is to negotiate Brexit in its entirely for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland without any recognition of the "Remain" vote in Scotland and Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  What happens in Scotland is a matter for its people and what happens in the North is our business.  In their joint letter to the British Prime Minister on 1 August the First and the Deputy First Ministers outlined their agreed key priorities, which included the cross-Border movement of people, goods and services; trading costs; business competitiveness; certainty in the draw-down of funding and support for the agrifood sector.  The Taoiseach is well aware that the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in hold opposite positions on Brexit, but this should not be used as an excuse by the Irish Government to resile from its responsibilities to the people of the Six Counties.  It must be remembered that the DUP is formally opposed to the Good Friday Agreement, but as we all know, the Agreement must be upheld and advanced.  The DUP knows this and that it also applies to the "Remain" vote in the North.  The role and responsibilit of the Irish Government, as co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, must be to defend the integrity of the Agreement and ensure the "Remain" vote is respected and upheld.  </p>  <p>  Some in this Chamber have complained about the absence of concern on the part of the British Government about how Brexit will impact on Ireland.  There is nothing new in the current British stance: it was always thus.  Wolfe Tone would hardly be surprised.  We should not spend too much time blowing hot air about Perfidious Albion.  What we need to do is get our own house in order.  It is vital that the Irish Government have an informed strategy for how our national interests will be protected and this means having an all-island vision.  I cannot say often enough that what we need is a 32-county vision.  Does the Taoiseach agree that the all-Ireland civic dialogue should identify and charter a course to ensure the whole island will remain within the European Union?</p>  <p>  I have written twice to the Taoiseach's Department to ask what bodies and organisations have been invited to participate in the dialogue, but I have not received a reply.  Will the Taoiseach tell us how often the all-Ireland civic dialogue will be convened and whether it will meet in different parts of the country, including the North?</p></speech>

We are well aware of the fact that we are a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement.  That is the very point I have been making for quite some time.  For all of the leaders I have met at European level, the first point of contact for their interest in this country is the protection of the peace process and all that it brings with it.  Our priorities are citizens, the economy, job retention, the Border area, not returning to a hard border, the common travel area, the peace process and all that goes with it.  </p><p>The Deputy will be aware that I have made it perfectly clear that we should have an all-island conversation.  It will take place next Wednesday, although it will be disrupted a little owing to the recall of the D&aacute;il.  Be that as it may, it is important that we hear all voices on the entire island of Ireland, including of those in the South who export to the North and <i>vice versa</i>, on issues such as cross-Border activities and activities east and west between Ireland and the United Kingdom which, as the Deputy will be aware, represent a figure of over &euro;1 billion in trade every week.  </p><p>The civic forum will meet on Wednesday and I understand approximately 300 invitations have been issued.  I will publish the list of all those who have been invited to attend.  It will be the first in a series of meetings to be held.  There will also be meetings to discuss individual sectors, be it the agriculture sector, the hospitality sector, the financial sector and so on.  All sectors must be conversed with and heard in order that we will know exactly what we are talking about.  The Deputy will be aware that I have instructed every Minister to engage directly with his or her counterpart in Northern Ireland before the North-South Ministerial Council meets on 18 November.  I hope that, following the comments made by the First and the Deputy First Ministers on Downing Street which I noted with great care, the focus will be on reaching an agreed position in the Northern Ireland Executive on the priorities for Northern Ireland.  That will be difficult, politically, but that is what politics is about.  The DUP has a particular view on the vote and every other party has a different one.  It is the bringing of these two positions together in the interests of the people of Northern Ireland that concerns me.  In so far as that is concerned, I hope the first meeting of the civic forum next Wednesday which, as I said, will be the first in a series of meetings will bring about cohesion and a real focus on people's concerns, anxieties and fears arising from the many comments made on the nature of what Britain will look for, be it a hard Brexit, a soft Brexit, removal from the Single Market, the customs union and so on, all of which will bring their own challenges.  We cannot, however, decide on what we need to negotiate on until we know what Britain is looking for.  The British Prime Minister has clarified that she will trigger Article 50 before the end of March, but long before then we will have to have a detailed analysis of the contingencies that might have to be played out.  </p><p>I will publish the list of those who have been invited to attend the civic forum.  I expect Deputy Gerry Adams to attend on Wednesday, too.</p></speech>

I would like to ask him about the reports that the Irish Government has reached an agreement with the British Government on immigration controls at Irish ports and airports.  This is my fourth attempt to get an answer to this question.  I should caution the Taoiseach that I have written to the Ceann Comhairle under Standing Order 44A about his refusal to respond and that anything he might say could be written down and used in evidence against him.</p></speech>

In this regard, it was stated: "Our focus is to strengthen the external border of the common travel area, building on the strong collaboration of our Irish partners."  In other words, the British Government is claiming that, with the agreement of the Irish Government, it will move the front line of its immigration controls to Ireland.  That is not viable.  The T&aacute;naiste has been reported as saying there is nothing surprising about this.  For his part, the Taoiseach has said nothing.  Will he comment and make a public statement on the matter today?</p></speech>

It worked well when the two countries were outside the European Union and has worked well with both inside it.  It has been untested with one and one out.  There is a strong belief we can retain it.  On not having a hard border, we have made it clear that we do not want to see a return to customs posts in the traditional manner that led to all sorts of incident, including smuggling and much more serious life and death matters, as Deputy is well aware.</p>  <p>  The Deputy asked if we had an agreement with the British Government on the use of Irish ports.  We do not have an agreement because we do not yet know whether the British Government is looking for a hard exit from the customs union and the Single Market and controls at its own borders or something else.  We must wait until such time as it decides to say what it is looking for.  Ireland will remain a member of the European Union.  If, for instance, the United Kingdom removes itself from the customs union, it will lead to a serious challenge in terms of the imposition tariffs by the World Trade Organization.  If it removes itself from the Single Market and tries to control its own borders, it will not have access to the Single Market without the freedom of movement of people.  These are all challenges.  I hope that answers the Deputy's question.  If he has taken it down to be used in evidence against me, he can use it again.</p></speech>

Did I say "taxpayers"?  Sorry, I meant to say wealthy people who are abusing our tax laws in some cases or, in other cases, engaging in outright tax evasion.  In the first group, wealthy people are using a loophole to transfer wealth to their children without paying inheritance tax.  They are using the dwelling house exemption section 86 relief which was introduced in 2000.  Under section 86, second and, in some cases, third and fourth homes are being bought for children, often for more than &euro;1 million.  The children live in these homes for a period and can then inherit them tax free when their parents die.  Ordinary people do not have that choice and must pay inheritance tax at 33%.  In many cases, families have to sell off their family homes to pay inheritance tax.  The abuse of the scheme has been of concern to Revenue for years.  It was expected the loophole would be closed in budget 2017 but it was not.  The Minister has said he is considering the issue.  What is there to consider?  It is a loophole and as such one closes it.  The opportunity is still there but I have read through the Finance Bill and it is not even mentioned.  I was also amazed to see tax evaders use offshore companies.  People who have already been identified by Revenue have been sent a friendly letter warning them and giving them six months to get their tax affairs in order.  Why is that?  Any ordinary taxpayer who owes money to Revenue is told he or she must pay upfront and over a period of time.</p>  <p>  Why is there such reluctance on the part of the political establishment to make very profitable companies and wealthy individuals pay tax in this country?  I want the Taoiseach to explain to the people of Ireland why the opportunity is not being taken in the Finance Bill 2016 to close the tax rule on the dwelling house exemption in respect of the section 86 relief.</p></speech>

I have often raised issues in regard to Bills and they are never taken on board.  I wanted to raise this in the Chamber with the Taoiseach to ensure that it is dealt with.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, admitted recently that the tax provision was being exploited by wealthy people.  Tax experts say well-heeled people are now gifting houses worth &euro;1 million or more to their children and using the inheritance tax exemption to avoid tax.  As well as avoiding tax, many of those exploiting the dwelling house exemption are renting out their properties, which breaks the rules attaching to the relief.  This information comes from Susan Murphy of Make My Will Solicitors who says the last few years have seen a large increase in the number of section 86 claims.  Last year, approximately 741 people claimed the exemption, which number was up from almost 500 in 2012.  They are blatantly abusing this tax scheme.  I ask the Government side to ensure that any amendment I put down is supported and to support my position in relation to evasion by wealthy companies in respect of moneys owed to the State.</p></speech>

This was a strategy for community inclusion.  I agree that there are people in institutions who should not be there and who should be integrated into our community.  However, there were 72 institutions which were, in fact, living breathing communities.  The example I give today is St. Mary of the Angels in Beaufort, County Kerry, which provides an excellent service, as did the other 71 centres.  In Kerry, we also had Glebe Lodge in Castleisland and Kerry Cheshire Home in Killarney.  My problem with the report is that it is closing these facilities down.  These facilities were centres of excellence for dealing with people with intellectual and physical disabilities.  I refer to people who have profound disabilities and who are incapable of living in communities.  Their parents and carers realise this but the institutions are no longer taking in new residents with these disabilities.  What is the answer for the young parents of today who have children for whom they are not able to cater at home?  There is no place for them to go while we are closing down centres of excellence.</p></speech>

However, the Minister of State, Deputy McGrath, said the HSE had met public representatives and was clear in stating that St. Mary of the Angels will close over time.  My problem is that we do not want it to close.  It is doing excellent work.  With 4,000 people living in the 72 communities covered by the report, it is proposed to ensure that there will be no further admissions and no further need for congregated settings.  If nobody is being taken in, that is, in effect, to close every one of those facilities down.  What is going to happen to young people who need somewhere to go because they cannot be kept at home?  I want the Taoiseach and the Minister of State to come to Kerry to look at St. Mary of the Angels as an example of the service being provided to these people.  I ask them to then go on a forum like Radio Kerry to explain to mothers, fathers and relatives why these people are going to see their excellent facilities closed down.  I appreciate that when the report was compiled, it was done in good faith and with good reason.  However, the message here is that one shoe does not fit all sizes.  This is a retrograde step.</p></speech>

The Time to Move On from Congregated Settings report found that there were a number of people still experiencing institutional living conditions which were not right in this day and age.  Good progress has been made.  In 2008, 4,000 people resided in congregated settings whereas in September 2014, that number was approximately 3,200.  Today, the figure is under 2,225.  The Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, announced funding of &euro;20 million in June for the HSE to move people out of congregated settings and that funding will be used to relocate approximately 165 people living in 14 institutions nationally.</p>  <p>  The focus here has to be on the person concerned, as Deputy Healy-Rae is well aware.  With regard to St. Mary of the Angels, it is important to say that there is no imminent closure involved here.  The HSE is consulting with the families and local communities to find the best solution for each individual.  I understand that the St. John of God services have acknowledged that communications could and should have been better in this regard so that everybody knew what was involved.  It is important, however, to point out that it is the policy of Government and the HSE to move on from congregated settings in the best interests of individuals and to do so in a planned and phased manner.</p>  <p>  On 18 September, a family forum meeting took place.  Discussions were held around HIQA inspections and decongregation and concerns were raised.  Many family members were concerned that their relatives would not be suitable for community living.  Some attendees said not enough information was given to them around the decongregation policy.  Assurances were given that this was being done on a phased basis through the use of what was termed "community transition plans" and that it would only apply if it improved the quality of life of the individual.  It was agreed that a family representative group would be set up and a meeting arranged with the senior management of the St. John of God services in Kerry.  On 28 September, family members of all service users on the campus were contacted on an individual basis and reassurance was provided to them that they would be consulted fully and involved in any changes relating to their family members currently living in St. Mary of the Angels.</p><p>On 5 October, representatives of St. John of God services and the HSE disability services met the family representative group to discuss the concerns that had been outlined by family members.  Representatives also met public representatives on 17 October to brief the group on the time to move out of conjugated settings.  Notwithstanding these actions, St. John of God said that there were deficiencies.</p> <p> There are currently 77 adults with intellectual disabilities residing on the campus.  Of these, 17 are accommodated in an old-style ward.  It is not suitable in this day and age and does not meet national standards for residential accommodation.  It is understood that they will not be the first people to move out, but that they may move to more suitable accommodation within the campus.  The Deputy can take it that there will be far more discussion and engagement with everybody before anything is done in respect of any individual.</p></speech>

While he said the closure of St. Mary of the Angels is not imminent, he has not said it will not close.  The truth is that if people are no longer being taken in, by natural progression through death and the passage of time the buildings will become empty and the service will not continue to do what it has done in the past, namely, provide excellent care.  Where are these people supposed to go?</p>  <p>  Living in what the Taoiseach calls communities outside of congregated settings is not suitable for all people.  The Taoiseach knows in his own constituency that there are young people with profound disabilities who are incapable of having suitable accommodation provided for them in a village, town or other setting.  They need to be in what I would call a centre of excellence.  I want it to be recognised that the 72 centres or homes - call them whatever one likes - and the carers, managers and workers in these facilities has given excellent care over the years.  We are now breaking that system up.  Why are we doing that?  </p>  <p>  We are taking for granted that this report is excellent, right and perfect.  It is not.  It is not addressing the problems people in the future who will have profound physical and mental disabilities will face.  We need to have a proper place for them to go to.  We are breaking up that system for no good reason.</p></speech>

That is not to decry the service given by the staff in settings over the years.  There have been difficulties in some institutions, including one notable case in the West some time ago.</p>  <p>  There are people are currently living in institutions like this who can benefit from moving back into their communities where services are provided for them.  As the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, has pointed out, there are some places in Dublin where staff have moved with them.  The change and quality of life is much better for those people.</p>  <p>  I assure the Deputy that every one of the individuals in the institution has a caseworker.  Nothing will be done without full consultation.  As every public representative knows, when very good home care packages are provided, irrespective of the scale of challenge a person faces, it is better for people to be with their own families, in their own communities, and have services provided for them.</p>  <p>  Some people have an extreme range of issues and some may find accommodation on the existing campus.  As I said, there is no immediate or imminent closure of this institution.  There will be proper, full and thorough consultation in the interests of each of the individuals concerned before any decision is made.</p></speech>

The key issue is implementation of these proposals.  Notwithstanding that, there are still over 2,000 children in emergency accommodation and 135,000 people on the social housing waiting list.  There are media reports today that up to 10,000 homes lie idle in rural towns, up to 3,200 of which are within Dublin's commuter belt which encompasses Kildare and Louth.</p>  <p>  The Heritage Council is calling for the living city initiative that is currently confined to parts of Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Kilkenny, Waterford and Galway to be extended.  Has the Government any plans to extend this initiative?  Are there any additional plans to acquire the large number of empty houses that could be used to deal with the homeless and housing crisis?</p></speech>

It dealt with everything from rough sleepers to homelessness in all its forms, and focused on the supply of houses to deal with the catch-up situation which followed the collapse of the construction sector a number of years ago.</p>  <p>  The Minister introduced a scheme for reconstruction and there are opportunities for people who have houses that are not habitable to renovate them, lease them for a five-year period and then reacquire them.  There are quite a number of opportunities within the housing programme to deal with stock that is idle or needs to be repaired or properties that are void, because of one reason or another, to be bought by local authorities.</p>  <p>  As housing units come on stream and are repaired and made habitable, many people turn them down because they are not close enough to where they are living or not suitable for their needs.  This is a problem, but one that is being addressed as one of the pillars of the housing programme.</p></speech>

Worryingly, media reports from Monday and yesterday reported that although progress has been made, it is nowhere near what was promised.  There are serious concerns about the pace of reform in our maternity services and the inadequate level of resources.  Since 2011 maternity services in the State have been marred by investigations of maternal and child mortality in many of our hospitals.  In the west, two senior experts in midwifery work who were recruited to improve maternity services after the death of Savita Halappanavar have resigned only two years after taking up their jobs. </p>  <p>  Some of the experts involved have said four new adequately staffed and fully resourced maternity hospitals are needed to address the growing level of risk associated with giving birth in our hospitals.  Next Friday marks the fourth anniversary of the death of Savita Halappanavar in University Hospital Galway.  Some four years on from this tragedy, there are still major concerns.  In light of these developments, will the Government honour its commitments in A Programme for a Partnership Government in respect of funding and implementing the national maternity strategy?</p></speech>

The national maternity strategy recognises that in recent years there has been a lot of pressure on the services provided as a result of the increase in the number of births.  There are reports on that, which also take into account staff recruitment and retention, relatively low levels of obstetricians and midwives, the rising costs of services, insurance coverage and litigation, adverse incident investigations, increasing levels of clinical interventions and significant infrastructural deficits.  While the birth rate has decreased since 2009, the most recent birth figure of approximately 66,000 remains higher than pre-2005 levels.</p>  <p>  The National Maternity Hospital on Holles Street is to move to St. Vincent's Hospital.  That matter is being progressed.  Some difficulties in terms of governance have arisen, which I hope can be addressed.</p><p>Increased funding is anticipated to be available to the Department of Health under the Government's six year capital programme 2016-21 and as Members know, developments are proposed for the relocation of the Rotunda Hospital to Connolly Memorial Hospital, the Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital to Saint James' Hospital and the University Maternity Hospital Limerick to the University Hospital Limerick campus.</p></speech>

Just yesterday we were informed there was going to be another spike in the high costs of home and motor insurance.  The Government is dragging its feet on this issue.  Measures have to be introduced as soon as possible to tackle this and to stop the culture of bogus claims that are causing the costs of premiums to rise continuously.  Some people are making a career from bogus claims and I would like the insurance companies to examine this situation.  The attitude of insurance companies is ridiculous in not challenging claims because it may cost them more to take on the claimant than if they just paid out.  I ask the Taoiseach and his Ministers to look at the situation, to see if they could bring the insurance companies in to let them know they have to challenges cases if there is local knowledge or proof that a person is involved in a bogus claim.  I do not care if the payout is &euro;30,000 and if the cost to the company is &euro;40,000 to prove that it is bogus.  They should prove that the claims are bogus, should stop those claims-----</p></speech>

The programme for Government includes references to efficient, transparent health services but the governance and the recruitment processes of senior hospital management within the trusts has been anything but over the last number of months.  Many acting CEOs have been recruited without proper governance or management practice.   I am asking, as I have asked the Minister for Health, whether the recruitment process will be made transparent.  According to the Minister for Health, in a reply to a parliamentary question from me, this would improve "pending the enactment of legislation".  Is that going to happen or is it the Government's intention to put this on a statutory basis?</p></speech>

It has been home to 6,000 souls, 800 of whom are unaccompanied minors, in other words, children.  There is very deep concern for everybody in that refugee camp, but particularly for children, as they are moved from Calais and dispersed to other parts of France.  To our very great credit, many Irish people have visited the area and worked directly with the refugees in Calais.  To our eternal shame, the State and the Taoiseach's Government have not honoured the spirit or requirements of what we need to do for these refugees.  I put it to the Taoiseach that we must act collectively, immediately and in a unified fashion to do what we can to secure the safety of these child refugees especially.  I ask the Taoiseach if we can have a debate on the matter in the D&aacute;il.  Can he, as Head of Government, commit to acting quickly on this matter? Can he commit that the State can relocate-----</p></speech>

We are not part of the protocol with regard to the migration.  The Government did decide to take 4,000 migrants by relocation and resettlement.  There have been difficulties for all countries in this situation, particularly for Italy.  The matter is now moving under the direction of Minister of State with responsibility for equality, immigration and integration, Deputy Stanton.  His officials were in Greece this week to look at the question of taking 200 unaccompanied children here.  The officials will report back to Minister of State, Deputy Stanton on that.  If the business committee can make an agreement to arrange a discussion about this serious topic we would be very happy to accommodate the debate as Deputy McDonald has asked.</p></speech>

Is d&oacute;cha gurbh &eacute; an t-iom&aacute;na&iacute; ab fhearr a bh&iacute; riamh ann i gContae Laoise.  Tuigeann c&aacute;ch &eacute; sin.</p>  <p>  On my behalf and that of my party, Fianna F&aacute;il, I welcome the Lalor family to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and express our deepest sympathy to them on the death of their father, Paddy, who passed away at the end of last July at the age of 90.  He was born the year the Fianna F&aacute;il party was founded, so his destiny was sealed in many ways.  He spent most of his life as an active and dedicated public figure and a member of our party.  He was a dynamic public representative who not only strived to serve his constituents of Laois-Offaly but also sought to put forward the best interests of the country when he served as Minister and as a Member of the European Parliament.  It is important that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann recognises the significant contribution he has made to Irish politics.</p>  <p>  Again, I welcome the Lalor family to Leinster House, in particular, Frances, Helen, Veronica and Joe, their spouses, and, of course, Paddy's grandchildren and wider family.  Paddy first and foremost was a family man.  He loved his family greatly and his community in Laois.  He lived a long and fruitful life and was at all times concerned with helping and looking after others.  He was a member of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, the local credit union and the Tidy Towns committee.</p>  <p>  He was deeply connected to his cultural roots and, as I stated earlier, he was an outstanding hurler.  He was very involved in both Gaelic football and hurling and was probably one of Laois's greatest hurlers.  He played in the All-Ireland hurling final for Laois in 1949, when they were unfortunately beaten by Tipperary.  He was a dual player with his native Abbeyleix and widely regarded as one of the O'Moore county's more skilful players.  He had a national hurling league top 20 goal scoring record which has still not been beaten.  He scored hundreds of points in the league even though he was not a designated free taker.  So good was he that he gained recognition when he was selected on the Laois hurling team of the millennium in 1999.  He was a competitive, fun loving and engaged man who brought the competitiveness in his sporting career to his long and dedicated political career.</p>  <p>  He was a Deputy from 1961 to 1981, Minister for Posts and Telegraphs from 1969 to 1970 and Minister for Industry and Commerce from 1970 to 1973.  He was of the generation of visionaries who led this country into the European Union and opened up new horizons and vistas for the Irish people.  He served as Chief Whip to the then Taoiseach, Jack Lynch, in the 1977 to 1979 Government, when, in a turbulent time, both internally and within the D&aacute;il, he brought his generosity of spirit.  He was known as a uniter of people and as one who could reach out to all the various sides and bring people together.  He worked extremely diligently in the role and was a loyal and dedicated believer in Jack Lynch and the work he did as Taoiseach.  Paddy later went on to represent Leinster in the European Parliament from 1979 to 1994.  He was a committed European who, I think, would be appalled at how events have taken shape with Brexit and so on.</p>  <p>  We acknowledge his strong work ethic and his sense of his very basic civic and patriotic duty to his local community and his country.  His late wife, Myra, who was a great support to him, passed away in 2014.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a hanam d&iacute;lis.  Together, with their family, they made a distinctive contribution to public life in their native county and their country.  His family can be proud of the enormous legacy he has left in the many families and homes throughout his constituency and in terms of public policy in this country, something from which many generations to follow will benefit.</p></speech>

It has all been said by Deputy Martin.  I sympathise with them on behalf of my party on the loss of Paddy Lalor.  I remember him very well.  Not many of the current D&aacute;il will remember him during his time as a Deputy.  It will come to them all in due course and someone will stand up somewhere sometime and pay whatever tribute he or she may wish.  I remember Paddy sitting in the seat the Chief Whip currently occupies at a time of great challenge within the party.  He always had a quizzical look on his face, as if to say, "What is going to come next?"</p>  <p>  I agree with Deputy Martin that he was a person who loved life.  He was a popular Deputy and Minister and someone who was genuinely interested in the affairs of his constituency and people and he relayed that through to Government, which I suppose is what democracy is about.</p>  <p>  Deputy Martin mentioned Paddy's hurling exploits.  Paddy brought that sort of capacity to his general political work.  A person would not want to take him on without being clear as to what to do next.  Paddy was a talented athlete and represented the O'Moore county well.  When he finished his playing days, he took up public service and he was genuinely interested in the well-being of his constituents.  While things were not as strong economically as they might be, he still represented the people of Laois strongly.  He was a Vice-President of the European Parliament.  It was new for Ireland to send its members to the European Parliament after 1979 and the tales of exploits and engagements in and outside that Parliament were always a source of both amusement and intrigue when they were brought back to the D&aacute;il.  While he was many miles away in Brussels, his focus was always on Laois.  Paddy's family are able to say with pride that their dad represented his people exceptionally well in the constituency, throughout the country and beyond.  Whatever differences people might have in political parties, we can always say that Paddy Lalor, for one, as the male head of their family, did a first class job in speaking out for his people and in carrying out representation in this Chamber.</p>  <p>  One of Paddy's opening remarks in Irish was to extend a f&aacute;ilte U&iacute; Cheallaigh to the visitor and he would ask me occasionally, "Did I say that properly?"  I used to say to him, "Paddy, it is no bother to you".  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam d&iacute;lis.</p></speech>

Deputy Martin has paid elegant tribute to Paddy Lalor as has the Taoiseach.  On my own behalf and that of Sinn F&eacute;in, I extend sincere and heartfelt sympathy to the family and loved ones of the former Teachta, Paddy Lalor, following his passing in late July.  I also extend condolences to Fianna F&aacute;il.</p>  <p>  I did not know Paddy personally but I have heard of his exploits both as a politician and as a GAA man and it is clear he excelled at both.</p><p><i>1 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p> <p>As has been noted, Paddy Lalor was a member of the Laois team that reached the all-Ireland hurling final in 1949, the year after I was born.  His was the last Laois team to have reached an all-Ireland final so Laois and Antrim have much in common in that regard.  Laois were beaten soundly by Tipperary on the day that was in it.  Although Paddy Lalor did not get his hands on the Liam McCarthy Cup, he enjoyed county championship success with the Abbeyleix GAA Club.  His talent on the pitch was recognised when he was named on the Laois hurling team of the millennium in 1999.  My good friend, Snitchy Ferguson, another stalwart of the GAA, always tells me that hurlers are sound and I am sure that applied to Paddy Lalor. </p> <p> Paddy Lalor served as a Teachta D&aacute;la for two decades representing Laoighis-Offaly.  He also served as a Cabinet Minister in the Departments of Posts and Telegraphs and Industry and Commerce and as a Minister of State.  He was a Member of the European Parliament for 15 years and served as its vice-president from 1982 until 1987.  He had a long and distinguished career in public office.</p> <p> Given the day that is in it, I am sure Paddy's children are also thinking of their mother, Myra, who passed in 2014.  I extend my sympathies to Paddy's children, Joe, Frances, Helen and Veronica, his grandchildren, friends and relatives and his colleagues in the Fianna F&aacute;il Party and Cumann L&uacute;thchleas Gael.

Being a fellow midlander from a neighbouring constituency, I knew Paddy well.  He had a relative living near Mullingar who belonged to a different party - he soldiered with me - and Paddy and I used to a joke about it.  Paddy was a wily and dedicated public representative for people in Laoighis-Offaly whom he represented with great distinction for more than 33 years, which is a fantastic feat in such a competitive constituency.</p>  <p>  Paddy Lalor was always grounded and maintained close contact with his roots.  As Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin stated, he was involved in many voluntary and community organisations.  He was steeped in the GAA and, as Deputy Martin also pointed out, he was no mean hurler.  As I often said, Paddy was well able to take care of himself and when he gave a hit, his opponent felt it.  He also had tremendous skill and technique and represented his native county for a long number of years.  He later became deeply involved in the administrative side of the GAA.</p>  <p>  Paddy held a number of important ministerial positions, namely, Minister for Posts and Telegraph and Minister for Industry and Commerce, and served as Chief Whip in the 1977-79 Government under the late Taoiseach, Jack Lynch.  His election to that important position demonstrated his affability and steeliness, two qualities that are required for such an important Government position.  Paddy subsequently became an MEP for the constituency of Leinster and it was in that role that I interacted most with him.  I recall, for example, having discussions with him on Bord na M&oacute;na and agricultural matters, which were always to the fore.  Paddy also held the prestigious position of vice-president of the European Parliament for a period.</p>  <p>  Paddy Lalor was a man of the people who served people very well.  To his family, who are present, including his son, Joe, and daughters, Frances, Helen and Veronica, as well as the wider family circle, I convey again, on behalf of the Labour Party, our sincerest sympathies.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam d&iacute;lis. </p></speech>

I am in a unique position as I succeeded Paddy as the Fianna F&aacute;il Deputy in the Laois constituency.  When Paddy served the constituency, it was known as Laoighis-Offaly but in recent times the name has changed to Laois.</p>  <p>  I want to speak about the man I knew.  I looked up to, admired and respected Paddy Lalor, who always showed great interest in people and asked how they were getting along.  He was a people's man.  He was also straight and upfront and one always knew where one stood with him, as Deputies no doubt agree, judging from the comments of previous speakers.</p>  <p>  Paddy Lalor had a positive outlook.  This is very important for people in public life and it stood him well throughout his political career, from his election to Laois County Council and subsequently to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and the European Parliament, to his appointment as a Government Minister and Member and vice-president of the European Parliament.  He was one of the few people who never lost an election, an achievement that is testimony to how well he was respected at local level.  While a Member of the European Parliament, Paddy always had a very good working relationship with MEPs from Northern Ireland and often travelled back and forth to Brussels with them.</p>  <p>  One of the proudest moments in Paddy Lalor's political career was when Irish people voted in a referendum to join what we now describe as the European Union.  As a Government Minister at the time, he had campaigned strongly in favour of membership of the European Economic Community.  Paddy will always be remembered in Laois as the Minister for Industry and Commerce who helped bring many IDA jobs to the county.</p>  <p>  Paddy was a great sportsman, having played senior hurling and football for his county, and his keen interest in sport remained with him until the end.  He attended his last inter-county championship football game in O'Moore Park, Portlaoise, earlier this year.</p>  <p>  Paddy Lalor worked tirelessly for the Fianna F&aacute;il Party and built up a strong cumann structure in County Laois, which survives and remains as strong as ever.  I am very grateful to him for that.  We are all very pleased that Paddy attended the launch of our general election campaign in Laois earlier this year.  It may not be well known that he was the Fianna F&aacute;il national director of elections for the 1987 general election, in which Fianna F&aacute;il won 81 seats, the highest number ever achieved by the party in its 90-year history or by any political party since the foundation of the State.</p>  <p>  I convey to Paddy Lalor's family a personal apology from the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charlie Flanagan, who would have liked to have been present but is attending to official business.</p>  <p>  Paddy Lalor was a great family man.  I should place on record a family connection with Paddy as my brother, Leo, is married to his eldest daughter.  Our families have a strong connection and I am happy to see everybody here today.  His son, Joe, and daughters, Frances, Helen and Veronica, loved, admired and looked up to their father and were very proud of the man who was known in family circles as "Pops".  I have no doubt Paddy and Myra are smiling down on us from heaven as we express our sympathies.  Thank you Paddy for a great life.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam d&iacute;lis. </p></speech>

I acknowledge and pay tribute to them too because family members who give up their space and time are the unsung heroes of many of us who serve in public life.  Paddy's late wife, Myra, and other family members allowed him to be the representative he became.  We are now in the position of paying tribute to his long and distinguished career, not only in Laois and the constituency of Laoighis-Offaly, but also as a member of Government and one of the first representatives sent by the D&aacute;il to the European Parliament and subsequently elected to the Parliament by the public.</p>  <p>  During my formative years, Paddy Lalor was a senior figure in the Fianna F&aacute;il organisation in Laoighis-Offaly and he remained in a senior position for a long time.  After his retirement, he remained very involved in and committed to his community and constituency and, primarily, the party we have the privilege to represent when we go before the people. </p>  <p>  Paddy Lalor served with my late father and I record my family's appreciation for his commitment and dedication to the Fianna F&aacute;il Party and Laoighis-Offaly constituency.  He set a standard that has been followed by others and it has been a great privilege to follow in his footsteps as a public representative.  It is with great pride and fondness that we remember his commitment as a public representative.</p>  <p>  We also acknowledge other aspects of Paddy's character which helped him represent people in the way he did.</p><p>There was the teak toughness that was learned on the fields of County Laois.  As near neighbours and competitors, to which Deputy Willie Penrose alluded, when you were hit by a Laois man, you felt it.  He had a great appreciation of the GAA and the GAA fraternity and was most praiseworthy of his neighbour's success when the county won all-Ireland titles in the 1980s, at the expense of Laois, it might be said.  They were a fine team and, were it not for Offaly's advancement, I have no doubt that they would have been the ones to take the accolades at the time.  He acknowledged this and supported them as if they were his own.</p> <p> I again thank Paddy's family for their commitment to him and, as has been said by previous speakers more eminent than me, they can be hugely proud of his achievements and efforts.  Long may he be remembered.  I have no doubt that we will see to it that that is the case because the constituency is all the better for him having represented it.</p></speech>

I had the great privilege of knowing Paddy Lalor for 30 years or more.  Deputy Se&aacute;n Fleming has alluded to the 1987 general election when he was director of elections and responsible, for better or worse, for adding me to the ticket in Kildare South.</p>  <p>  I thank the Lalor family because, by being here, they give us the opportunity to reflect on the contribution their father made at constituency, national and European level.  As other speakers said, they can be hugely proud of the fact that he made a real difference to the lives of people in the constituency, the country and Europe.  That is something very few people have the opportunity to do.  I very much regret the fact that I was out of the country at the time his death.  I will remember him, first and foremost, as a family man.  Nobody knows better than they that he and Myra were at the centre of that great family.  I remember him as a warm, likeable and admirable gentleman.  For my part, it was a privilege to know him and a privilege to call him a friend.</p></speech>

The committee will oversee the overall Government response, including both the economic impact and the negotiations at EU level and with the Administrations in London and Belfast.  It will continue to meet on a regular basis to deal with Brexit-related issues.</p>  <p>  Brexit has been a matter of regular and detailed consideration by the Government for some time, both in advance of the UK EU referendum and since.  Since 23 June, seven memoranda have been submitted to the Government on the matter.  Most recently, the Government discussed the action taken to date to prepare for Brexit, including, in particular, priority concerns for this country: the economy and trade; the peace process and Northern Ireland; the common travel area; and the future of the European Union.  The Government also approved a range of further actions to ensure Ireland would be fully prepared for the difficult negotiations ahead.</p>  <p>  There is ongoing close political and official engagement, including with the British Government, Northern Ireland and EU member states and institutions, on issues arising from Brexit.  The Government has engaged in extensive contacts with our EU partners.  In the aftermath of the referendum, I have had meetings with the British Prime Minister, Ms Theresa May, in London; the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, in Berlin; the French President, Francois Hollande, in Dublin and the European Council President, Mr. Donald Tusk, in Dublin.  Most recently, on 12 October, I welcomed the European Commission&rsquo;s chief Brexit negotiator, Mr. Michel Barnier, to Government Buildings, where we discussed Brexit in detail.  Mr. Barnier, together with senior team members, also had meetings with the T&aacute;naiste, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs and senior officials.  I have also taken the opportunity, on the margins of recent EU summits, to raise our concerns with the President of the European Council, Mr. Jean-Claude Juncker, and other EU leaders.  Other Ministers, including, of course, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, are continually raising and explaining our concerns to our partners.</p>  <p>  The annual summit of Secretaries General with UK Permanent Secretaries took place in London on 5 and 6 October.  This well established annual forum served as a valuable vehicle for discussion and exploration of the implications of Brexit, in addition to providing for consideration of the broad areas of co-operation under the joint work programme.  The Government also continues to work closely with the Northern Ireland Executive and the First Minister and the deputy First Minister, including, in particular, through the North-South Ministerial Council, which will meet in Armagh on 18 November.</p>  <p>  The invitations to attend the conference on 2 November launching the all-island civic dialogue issued last week.  Invitations have been extended to a broad range of civic society groups, trade unions, business groups, non-governmental organisations and representatives from political parties.  The event will also be streamed live on the Internet.  Further information will be sent to attendees in the coming days.</p></reply>

I acknowledge that the Taoiseach was very active during the Brexit campaign and that he has been in contact with our partners within the European Union.  However, as I said, what we have to do is get our own house in order.  I am concerned that we may restrain ourselves in thinking within the context of what is happening in this State.</p><p>Given the age of the State and the length of time for which the parties have been in power, that is a very understandable position to take.  Partitionism is writ large among the policy-makers and others within the establishment.</p> <p> This is an opportunity to think island-wide and not just talk about the matter.  We have an opportunity to do something concrete about it for all our sakes, not just in pursuit of Irish unity but also because it is proper to protect and defend all interests across the island of Ireland.  This is particularly so because the people of the North voted to remain in the European Union.  Those in the North with whom I have been in contact, MLAs, MPs and the MEP Martina Anderson, are all in contact with people who are constitutionally for the Union and are really concerned about the economic and other consequences of the Brexit strategy.</p> <p> There are also major concerns about the continued provision of EU funding for cross-Border projects.  The European Union stopped the funding projects.  The British Government has given assurances on funding only for the period up to 2017.  As the Taoiseach knows, there are 17 ready-to-go projects in Border counties, worth approximately &euro;120 million.  These are issues that need to be raised.  Has he raised them within the European Union or with the British Government?</p> <p> I finally got an answer to a certain question, for which I thank the Taoiseach.  The question was on whether there was an agreement between the British and Irish Governments to have British immigration controls at Irish ports and airports.  The British Government claims there is such an agreement, while the Taoiseach has said there is not.  Has this been an issue for discussion?  Is there a putative agreement being discussed at official level that has yet to receive political consideration or approval?</p> <p> There is an argument for co-operation between all of the parties here on these matters.  The Taoiseach may not want to disclose his hand in an open forum like this, but surely, in meetings with the other leaders, he could indicate in detail the substance of the discussions taking place between officials from his office and the British Government.  Was this issue covered?  There is a complete contradiction between what the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. Brokenshire, said and what the Taoiseach has now said.</p> <p> With regard to the specific dialogue taking place, we urged the Government initially to ensure it embraced all sectors and parts of the island.  That is why I was and remain keen to see the invitation list which we still have not received.  We actually made a written submission - I do not know whether other parties did so - to the Government and said the scope of the dialogue should be twofold.  First, it should be to facilitate an inclusive process of open policy debate and inform the Government's medium-term political and policy response to the British Government's Brexit plans.  We said this should form the basis of a Government Green Paper for wider public consultation.  Second, we proposed that the authorities should agree on a policy framework that would shape the future strategic direction of the Government.  We should set out a practical vision and an implementation plan that could form the basis of a Government White Paper.  Does the Taoiseach agree with this approach?  He accepts that Irish society as a whole will be affected by Brexit.  Therefore, there needs to be an inclusive approach.  It must include the education sector, students' representatives, the business sector, the churches, trade unions, farming organisations, people living in rural areas, sports bodies, human rights bodies, victims' groups and the various migrant organisations.  I firmly believe we are not focusing enough on the possibilities and the necessity of having an all-island approach.  One would be surprised by how welcome such an a process would be within the Unionist community in the North.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-10-26a.122" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1224" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="13:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016102600023#V00200"><p>My question was on whether specific steps had been taken to allow negotiations between Ireland and Britain on Brexit.  As the Taoiseach knows, this is complex enough.  In essence, when Article 50 is triggered, there will be a process of exiting the European Union.  Mr. Michel Barnier, in representing the European Commission, seems to believe that is the first part.  The question of the replacement, or the subsequent relationship between Britain and the European Union, follows after that.  In the meantime, there is contact between Dublin and London.  There is an urgent need for a genuine framing of the issues pertaining to the British-Irish relationship and the North-South relationship, as it applies to people, goods and services.  It is of considerable concern that we are not really much more beyond public statements on all sides, with Brussels and London talking up a hard Brexit.  A hard Brexit would have very significant, serious and damaging repercussions for Ireland.</p>  <p>  We are facing a deep economic and social threat.  I read the reports and analysis of the Department of Finance on sectoral and economic exposure to Brexit.  I refer to the effect on the pharmachemical and traditional manufacturing sectors, for example.  It is concluded that the impact on the traditional manufacturing sector, SMEs in particular, will be worse felt in rural areas, or outside Dublin.  I am not talking about the fall in the value of sterling.  This phenomenon is separate from the devaluation of sterling.  The impact on jobs will be particularly severe outside Dublin, particularly for SMEs.  It is extremely serious, which is why I believe provision, even a contingency provision, should have been made for Brexit in the budget.  In every budget from now on there should be contingency funding put aside in order that we would have some resources and reserves in place.   It would be the cautious and wise thing to do and I am surprised it was not done in the budget for next year.</p>  <p>  The Department of Finance's analysis which has been available to the Government for quite some time is downbeat about what will happen if there is a hard Brexit.  We could be doing more to support our footprint overseas in order to create more markets and diversify market strengths in areas outside Britain.  Our embassies should be strengthened and we should consider where we can open additional offices for Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland.  We are very stretched across the entire process.  When Britain leaves the European Union, our membership will be much different and that means a different diplomatic focus.  It means that we will have to consider new alliances and develop stronger relationships with other countries across the European Union.  Our diplomatic footprint, therefore, needs to be strengthened.</p>  <p>  I welcome the civic dialogue forum.  I suggested it when the group of party leaders met originally.  It should be a listening exercise.  We should listen as much as possible, as opposed to having a series of set-piece speeches.  We can all make speeches, but it would be very useful if we were to listen to what community and business groups, employers, etc., had to say and their concerns and potential solutions, North and South.  We could also hear about the cross-Border economic piece.</p>  <p>  Will the number of meetings in the North-South structures increase?  The First Minister, Ms Arlene Foster, said Brexit would be discussed only through the existing North-South structures.  One would imagine, therefore, that there would have to be more North-South Ministerial Council meetings.</p><p>Will there be an increase in the number of these meetings?  Has the Taoiseach established a dedicated group to work purely on the North-South dimension of the Brexit negotiations?</p></speech>

It is not about grandstanding by political parties across the entire island.  That is why, in an all-island sense, people will have their opportunities to come along and say their piece.  However, it is not just a one-day event.  There will be a follow-through with sectoral areas both North and South so that we get that true voice to which Deputy Martin referred.</p>  <p>  Traditional manufacturing and small and medium enterprises here are a real focus of where the Government must be.  To that extent, the budget contained a number of measures in respect of Enterprise Ireland, extra staff, extra facilities and a capacity to consider where new markets can apply because that is what will have to happen here.  There are programmes, as the Deputy is aware, such as the LEAN programmes, market diversification, innovation and management development and so on, and there are so many very bright young people who are well able to make a break into new markets for different products and firms here.  Clearly, this is a major priority for Government, our citizens, our economy, our jobs and our links with Northern Ireland, the UK and beyond to Europe.</p>  <p>  Deputy Martin is quite right that while the challenges ahead are unknown, at least if we knew at this stage what Britain's ask will be, we could focus on that.  It seems as if the Prime Minister has made it clear that the UK does not seek any kind of Norwegian system or a Swiss system, but a bespoke British requirement.  In the update she gave to the other leaders at the European Council meeting, she said she would like to see the exit process be professional and well managed and said that would be of benefit to both Europe and to Britain.  Obviously, there will be discussions and negotiation about that.  I will arrange for a briefing for Deputies Martin and Adams and anybody else by the senior officials here, who will give the Deputies the details of what they have been discussing with permanent secretaries across the water.  They cannot get into too much detail because the Government has not made its decision.  As the weeks go on, arising from the civic dialogue and the North-South Ministerial Council, we will have a wealth of information on which we can begin to focus.  However, really and truly, until the Prime Minister moves and triggers Article 50, we will not be in a position to say what the definitive position is of the British Government.  President Juncker, President Tusk and everybody else have made it clear that there will not be any formal negotiation until that happens.  Michel Barnier will be around to everybody in the meantime.  The Minister of State, Deputy Dara Murphy, has been meeting all his counterparts.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Flanagan, has the same requirement as all Ministers at a European level to make direct contact so that people understand in the first instance from a European perspective the importance of the peace process, the connections between Ireland and Britain and so on.  I will see that Deputies Martin and Adams are briefed at the-----</p></speech>

I hope I am not speaking out of class here, but the Taoiseach's comments in that meeting in which he recognised that we need to create a national movement were exactly right.  If we are to achieve the scale of change to which we are due to sign up later this week - I hope, on Thursday - regarding the Paris Agreement, the scale of the change we need to make is so immense that we really need first and foremost to get our people to understand and get behind it.  We need to do this as set out in the partnership document for Government by engaging in a completely different way with the people by putting the question to them as to how they can help and get involved.</p>  <p>  Further to that meeting last night, there was one item that was not discussed, which I want to have the chance to reiterate.  It is very important, and I would be interested to hear the Taoiseach's views on it.  I refer to the carrying out of what is set out in the programme for Government document when it states that part of this dialogue must involve the media not just reporting on the events, but also using new, innovative, online and other creative techniques to be part of the debate so that they too start to get a different and better understanding as to how the story we will tell to create this national movement for action on climate change will take place.  I am interested to hear the Taoiseach's views as to whether he thinks it makes sense to engage not just as a reporter, but also as a participant in a way, in the variety of different dialogues I believe we need to take place as part of a national climate dialogue.</p>  <p>  I think the understanding coming from the environmental movement that presented last night is that it needs a special steering group at the centre of government, not just one involving Government, but also possibly the NESC secretariat, the climate expert group and the people involved in the national planning framework and in the review of the capital plan.  Does the Taoiseach agree that such an approach, which does not rely on just one Department that may not have the resources either in budget or staff terms to manage the scale of the dialogue we need to take place, is needed?  I am interested to hear his thoughts, further to the presentations made last night, as to how such an organisational structure needs to be got right first, with a view to living out - which is a good articulation in the programme for a partnership Government - how a different sort of national conversation needs to take place on these sorts of critical long-term strategic issues for the State.</p></speech>

In its report the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned that the world is ill-prepared for the risks arising from a changing climate.  It also warned that many states could expect more frequent storms and flooding.  That certainly has been the experience here.  We are all very familiar with what happened particularly in the Shannon river catchment area, where homes were totally destroyed by floodwaters.  The same thing happened in my constituency, in Louth, particularly in Dundalk.  I have maintained contact with the families involved since, and they face a winter filled with dread.  They are angry, they are concerned and they tell me that flood defences have not been constructed and that their homes and businesses have no more protection now than they had last year.  I therefore ask the Taoiseach to outline the Government's proposal for this coming winter and winter 2017 and whether local authorities have been allocated additional interim funding to undertake preventative work until the CFRAM flood defences are complete.  Many of these will not be complete - in fact, to my knowledge, very few of them will be complete - before midsummer of next year.</p>  <p>  This week the world entered a new era of climate change reality.  We are told that the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has reached a symbolic threshold of 400 parts per million across the globe.  In this context it is imperative that the Paris Agreement, which commits countries to keeping temperature rises to well below 2&deg; Celsius, enter into force.</p><p>The Minister, Deputy Naughten, has said he wants to secure D&aacute;il ratification of the Paris agreement before the next UN global summit on climate change to be held in November.  How confident is the Taoiseach that can be achieved?  Is the Government committed to the full implementation of the Paris agreement?</p></speech>

An additional &euro;5.14 billion was announced in the summer Economic Statement to deal with transport, housing, broadband, health, education and flood defences.  Some &euro;4.6 billion will be allocated for capital expenditure next year.</p>  <p>  Deputy Adams should have a conversation with the Minister of State, Deputy Canney.  He is dealing extensively with the progress being made in respect of flood relief works and flood prevention across the entire country.  As the Deputy will be aware, the previous Government put in place the CFRAM study and has allocated a serious amount of money in coming years to deal with Cork, Galway and many other places where flooding has occurred or is likely to occur.</p>  <p>  We are also looking at a scheme to deal with the relocation of people from a small number of houses that have been flooded for the past number of years and where it is no longer possible to live.  I believe this applied in the 1980s where a number of houses in south Galway were flooded badly because turloughs became blocked or whatever.  If the Deputy engages with the Minister of State, Deputy Canney, he can give an update on the progress in respect of each of those.</p>  <p>  I again thank Deputy Eamon Ryan for the contributions by the different members of the delegation who appeared before the Cabinet sub-committee yesterday.  I found their contributions succinct, accurate, well delivered and very thoughtful.  After the delegation left we discussed the question of the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment dealing with his mitigation programme which he will launch reasonably soon.  We also looked at the question the Deputy raised at the meeting in regard to having a structure to draw in agencies, organisations and individuals to deal with this.  One system is the Cabinet sub-committee, itself, but I do not think I would have the opportunity to be available at all times to bring those different groups and organisations together.  I will engage with the Minister, Deputy Naughten, to see what he is proposing.  Perhaps the Cabinet sub-committee could be a conduit to assist in that work.</p>  <p>  In respect of media coverage, the Deputy will be aware of allegations of the Government using the media as a tool for itself in promoting its own cause.  There is a delicate balance in having interest from media in explaining to people what they can do in their communities, organisations and homes to build that national understanding the Deputy rightly spoke of.  When people involve themselves in some of these activities, small as they may be, they feel they are playing an important part in what is now a global phenomenon.</p>  <p>  Clearly, the extent of the diminution of the Arctic icecap this year is further evidence of climate change on the move.  One of the boats that sailed through the Northwest Passage did so in three months.  Ten years ago it took the same boat two years to get through; so the change is remarkable.</p>  <p>  This is obviously an issue for us.  We have got a reasonably good deal from Commissioner Ca&ntilde;ete.  The challenges here between 2020 and 2030 will be exceptional even given the credits we will be allocated on various issues.  We need to return to the matter on a pretty constant basis.</p>  <p>  I assure the Deputies that the Ministers and their officials are working really well and strongly from a technical point of view in dealing with Brussels.  We cannot get approval for our deal unless we get consent from others and that will not be easy.</p></speech>

It was clear from the presentation given to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment yesterday that we are nowhere near doing what we need to do.  We will not meet any of our renewables targets.  We will be one of only two countries in Europe to fail to meet emissions reduction targets; we are heading in the other direction.  There was an acknowledgement at yesterday's committee meeting that we are not even doing the additional measures that would slightly reduce that gap.  I asked the officials at the meeting to outline the scale of those additional measures.  It would be something like 50,000 additional electric vehicles in the next few years at a time when the existing owners of electric vehicles will say they cannot find a working plug-in station.</p>  <p>  When it comes to flood prevention, the scale of change we need to make involves taking hundreds of thousands of acres of Coillte forest land and turning it into a flood protection zone and a carbon sink rather than a lumber forest development, which is viable, or changing completely not just all these big and very expensive engineering measures we are considering along the Shannon and other rivers, but actually considering soft land use measures such as using our bogs in a completely different way, which would also have the advantage of carbon storage.</p>  <p>  To win over the people for the scale of the change I believe is necessary if we are serious about implementing the Paris agreement, we cannot use the old consultation way of coming with top-down solutions.  We need to flip it and ask people for help and try to engender the understanding that I hold to be central and true that it is a better economic model when we work with nature.  When we go in this low carbon direction, it is the best possible future for our country.</p>  <p>  I mentioned the media's involvement because it was referred to in the Government's documents as the nature of this new engagement and consultation process.  I cite the example of the commemoration of the centenary of the foundation of the State in 1916 where media partners played a part, not just as being involved as reporters, but also in helping events happen and bringing new online techniques to allow people to engage.  As we said last night, this has to be a very big creative process.</p>  <p>  It also needs to involve the Departments of Transport, Tourism and Sport, Agriculture, Food and the Marine and others as well as the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  I agree that one might think that the Cabinet sub-committee is an obvious place.  However, I suggest that it might be a sub-committee to that committee.  If the process is important in how people are engaged, it has to start with some sort of steering group that also brings in some outside people who would not typically be at a Cabinet sub-committee.  By all means it can report to that Cabinet sub-committee, but it should be set up as a separate entity to do that.  It should be given adequate budget and real freedom to be innovative and creative to win our people over to the sense that we will have a better future with lower carbon.</p></speech>

However, I met the people in Cloonlara, County Clare, last year and that village does not have defences in place.  Teachta Quinlivan just reminded me that on the banks of the Shannon in Limerick city they got two rows of breeze blocks.  Homes in Mount Hamilton in Dundalk were destroyed.  I met representatives of the local authority this week and was advised that no defences will be put in place this year.  The residents are living in dread, as are people living along the Flurry River in Ballymascanlon.  The Taoiseach was there and saw the damage and the corrosive, awful debilitating stress caused by the floods.</p>  <p>  I ask the Taoiseach to confirm if local authorities have been allocated additional interim funding to undertake preventive work until CFRAM flood defences are complete, which will not happen before impending flooding this year.</p></speech>

We have evidence, obviously, of people wanting to participate in improving the environmental situation here, farmers with carbon footprint in respect of dairy or beef or whatever.  It is a case of people being well informed about the small measures they can take to help and of the changes communities and public buildings can make in terms of insulation, solar panels, wind energy, where appropriate, and so on.</p>  <p>  Ireland really had four conditions.</p><p>The first condition was that our annual compliance targets from 2021 to 2030 be determined using a realistic starting point which would reflect the reality of the end point in 2020, and not based on the assumption that we have reached our minus 20% target.  The second condition was an express recognition of our constrained investment capacity over a number of years.  Given the state of the economy because of the collapse, it was not possible for Ireland to invest in the way that it should.  That included the time that the troika was here and all of that.  That meant that we could not meet our 2020 targets.  The third condition was<b></b>an express recognition of the low-mitigation potential of agriculture, which constitutes 40% of Ireland's non-emissions trading system emissions.  We have a profile that is very similar to New Zealand's.  Very few other countries have that kind of profile.  Another condition is to be allowed to use the net afforestation for land use, land-use change, and forestry, LULUCF credits, which constitutes about 10% of annual emissions.  It is important to note that that estimate for our forestation was based on the rules of directive 529, which apply up to 2020.  These are areas that we are going to have to work very hard on to reach where we want to be between 2021 and 2030.  We will have some saving grace starting off if we can start in 2021 instead of 2020.<br/><br/>Deputy Adams referred to flooding in particular locations around the country.  Clearly these are physical requirement to be dealt with to try to hold back the force of nature when it happens.  As the Deputy knows, when the Corrib, the Lee or the Shannon floods, it is virtually impossible to deal with it unless long-term preparations are made.  They have proven to be a success in Clonmel, down in Fermoy and other locations, where despite very heavy rains and strong floods, the defences put in place have succeeded.  These are things that have to be analysed.  The engineering has to be gotten right.  We have to have the resources to go and provide for the defences.  Whether it is in small villages or towns, it applies right across the country.  Last year, we set up a specific organisation dealing with the Shannon, which is now at chief executive level now rather than just participation level.  The Minister of State, Deputy Canney, met with that group again recently.  They have made significant headway on looking at what might be done given the very low level of descent of the Shannon over a very long distance, which is the principal cause of lateral flooding when lakes back up and the capacity is not there to take the water away in the way that people might imagine.  These are points that are the focus of the Minister of State, Deputy Canney, at the moment.  I suggest that Deputy Adams might have a conversation with him.</p></speech>

We are both island people, we are both partitioned and our nearest neighbours make claims on our sovereignty and so on.  As I understand it, Cyprus has a special relationship with the EU.  I wonder if the Taoiseach had the opportunity to tease any of that out.  In our own situation, we have proposed that a special committee be established under the auspices of the North-South Ministerial Council to harmonise and maximise all-Ireland co-operation.  We have also proposed the establishment of a border economic development zone to harmonise trade and maximise returns for Border businesses.  We have argued for additional investment in the A5 and the Narrow Water Bridge to be matched by the Northern Executive.  I am looking to learn from the situation in Cyprus.  Was the Taoiseach able to develop any dialogue with the president which would help us as we face into the challenges in the time ahead?</p></speech>

I know him well.  Sometimes the seating arrangements are such that I sit beside him at some of these meetings.  I have discussed the question of northern Cyprus with him on many occasions.  He is well-acquainted with the situation here in so far as the Border is concerned.  We discussed last week what is going to happen in terms of his negotiations with Turkey in respect of northern Cyprus and the kind of situation that will arise in terms of borders, cross-border activity, movement of people and so on.  We had a bit of a discussion about that.  Clearly, he has made good progress with his counterparts.  They are hopeful that, after very many years, the situation in Cyprus could be regularised.  However, it is too soon to confirm that.</p>  <p>  As we are both members of the same political grouping within the European Parliament, I also have occasion to meet him in that regard.  He is well aware of the assistance that Europe has been making available to Ireland in our peace process.  I discussed that with him as well as the relevance and the value of European support for cross-border communities, particularly fragile communities that are, as the Deputy often points out, coming out of a conflict situation after many years and need to be able to continue in peace.  My most recent conversation with him was in &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in when he called to see President Higgins and we had a brief discussion there about his hopes for the future discussions that he is having with the Turkish representatives on finally bringing the long-running divide of Cyprus to a conclusion.  There are a number of similarities.  He is interested in any progress that Ireland makes and we have an ongoing contact in that regard.</p></speech>

Is there space for more co-operation between society and Government here with other states such as Cyprus?  Perhaps the Government here prefers to deal with the British Government.

It includes Scotland, Northern Ireland, Wales, the Republic of Ireland, the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man and so on.  That is a useful forum for discussing some things.  One of the issues that was raised at the last meeting was the fact that some of the islands' allegiance is not to Downing Street or the European Parliament, but to the crown.  If one proceeds down that line, what is the right of any of the Channel Islands if they do not agree with an arrangement?  I am not sure that there is either a constitutional or legal response to that.  It is a useful forum and it is going to meet again fairly soon.  As Brexit begins to proceed it will become a source of even more focus from all of those states.  It is attended by the First Minister and deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland, the First Minister from Scotland, the First Minister from Wales, myself and whoever can from the British Government.  It gives that sort of north, south, east and west engagement at a political level.  I find it to be a useful forum.  If it was necessary, it could meet once a quarter during this period.  That might be possible.  It is a matter for the executive to decide whether it would be worthwhile doing that or not.  I am all for co-operation.  Clearly, Scotland is in a different position to Wales and Wales is in a different position to Northern Ireland in the way they voted on Brexit.</p><p><i>2 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p> <p>However, it is the totality of the vote that the British Government states is the decision.  Given that Brexit is now irreversible we must deal with the consequences of the decision of the electorate.  In this sense we are preparing all of these strategies and various contingencies.  Until such time as we are clear what it is we must negotiate with the British Government we will get on with our business of looking after our citizens, our economy, our jobs, the issues of credit, new markets for our exporters abroad and greater assistance for Enterprise Ireland, which continues to be a strong advocate for investment in the country.  Yesterday, the Government approved a process of competing for the European Banking Authority and the European Medicines Agency to be located in Ireland.  We have as good a chance as anybody else.  These things are all there to be won, because they will make decisions to move and they want to know to where they will move.  This collaboration is always important and we will continue it.</p></speech>

It began on Thursday afternoon with a substantial discussion about the complex issue of migration, which remains, quite rightly, a priority for the Union.  The evening session focused predominantly on external relations, specifically the situation in Syria and our strategic relationship with Russia.  On Friday, we discussed a number of trade issues, including the proposed comprehensive economic and trade agreement with Canada, commonly called CETA, as well as TTIP, the EU-Japan Free Trade Agreement, trade defence instruments and, more broadly, EU trade policy.  A range of other global and economic issues were also agreed, as set out in the European Council conclusions.</p><p>In addition to the formal agenda, there were three substantive information points.  The first of these was an update from Prime Minister Rutte on developments in the Netherlands since the referendum there on the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement, DCFTA, with Ukraine as well as developments on the MH17 investigations.  The second was a presentation by Prime Minister Fico on follow up to the roadmap agreed at the Bratislava summit in September, which set out a plan for future work on the renewal of Europe.  The third was a brief intervention from Prime Minister May on developments on Brexit.  I have asked the Minister of State, Deputy Murphy, to touch on elements of the Russia discussion in his wrap-up remarks.  I will address the other agenda items.</p><p>I will start by updating the House on Prime Minister May&rsquo;s intervention, as I know the EU-UK relationship is of particular interest to the House.  This was her first meeting of the European Council since becoming UK Prime Minister and President Donald Tusk welcomed her to the meeting.  In her remarks, the Prime Minister confirmed that the UK decision to leave the EU is irreversible and that it will trigger Article 50 by the end of March 2017.  She was very clear that until the Article 50 negotiations are conducted the UK intends to remain a full and active member of the European Union and to fulfil all of its obligations and responsibilities as a member state.  As envisaged, there was no discussion of the issue at this meeting.  However, President Tusk took the opportunity to reiterate the principles agreed by the 27 EU Heads of State and Government in June, that there will be no negotiations until Article 50 is triggered by the UK, and that access to the Single Market is linked to acceptance of the four freedoms.</p><p>I had informal exchanges with a number of my EU counterparts, including Prime Minister May, as well as Commission President Juncker, in the margins of the meeting.  During these exchanges, I emphasised, as I do at every opportunity, Ireland's very particular concerns arising from Brexit, specifically the impact on the economy, jobs in the Republic and Northern Ireland, the peace process, citizenship issues, the common travel area and Border issues and the interconnectedness of our economies.</p><p>Responding to the migration crisis effectively and humanely remains, quite rightly, a top priority for the Union.  Clearly, many problems remain, particularly in the central Mediterranean.  Significant progress has been made, for example, in managing the inflow of irregular migrants through our relations with third countries.  At the meeting on Thursday, the Commission gave a detailed presentation on the latest developments, and progress on the various measures already agreed.  Many of these are having a positive impact.  Most notable is the significant decrease in the number of people travelling the eastern Mediterranean route, where there has been a 98% drop in arrivals since the EU-Turkey statement was agreed in March.  There was a constructive discussion about restoring the Schengen Agreement because of this progress.  Although Ireland does not participate in Schengen, we recognise its value to the EU overall and we are supportive of the progress being made.</p><p>There was also a presentation by High Representative Mogherini on the migration compacts.  These are proposed agreements between the EU and third countries, such as Niger and others in Africa, as part of the Commission's partnership framework.  These compacts are born out of the understanding that we have to address the root causes of the migration crisis and not just its effects, and aim at bringing coherence between external policies and development policies.  They are being worked on with a number of African countries in the first instance.  Ireland is particularly involved in discussions about Ethiopia, which is a key partner of Irish Aid.  In this context, Ireland is also a supporter of progress on the external investment plan in order to boost investments and job creation in the partner countries.</p><p>Despite our position on the far western edge of Europe, and our non-participation in certain justice and home affairs measures under Protocol 21 of the treaties, we continue to contribute to the EU response to the challenges posed by migration.  Since May 2015 Defence Forces and Naval Service personnel have rescued over 14,300 migrants from the Mediterranean.  The <i>LE Samuel Beckett</i>began patrols on 2 October and continues to play a vital role in this regard.  I commend the members of the Naval Service and Defence Forces for the service they provide.  They are a credit to our flag and our nation and we thank them for their service.</p><p>We are also playing our part in terms of our humanitarian assistance.  We have provided over &euro;42 million in response to the Syria crisis since 2011, and we have pledged a further &euro;20 million in 2016.  It is important to recall the Government&rsquo;s decision to opt in to the EU measures on resettlement and relocation and to take up to 4,000 people in need of international protection.  There has been good progress on the resettlement of refugees from outside the Union under the direction of the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton.  To date, 500 have arrived in Ireland and we are on course to meet our 2016 target of 520 by the end of the year.  There is no facility for taking refugees directly from within Syria.  We are working with the UNHCR-Ied programme, which is currently focused on resettling refugees from the camps in Lebanon, and the programme is moving ahead.  The Government has announced we will admit an additional 260 refugees on resettlement from Lebanon next spring, and a further pledge for 2017 is under active consideration.</p><p>On relocation, that is taking asylum seekers who have already arrived in Greece and Italy, progress has been very slow.  This has been the case for all countries for a variety of reasons outside of our control.  However, progress is at last beginning to be made and 69 people have now come to Ireland from Greece.  We are building on this progress and it is anticipated that by the end of the year we will have accepted up to 400 people through the relocation pledge.  The intention thereafter is to sustain the pace of intake throughout 2017 at the levels required to allow Ireland to meets its commitments within the timeframe envisaged by the programme.</p><p>The migration crisis is born out of instability across the north African and Middle East regions and in that regard the horrendous war in Syria remains a central factor.  There was a lengthy discussion about the situation there, and the European Council was unanimous in its condemnation of the attacks by Syria and its allies, notably Russia, on Aleppo.  It is a war crime to attack a hospital.  It is a breach of international law not to protect civilian life and not to allow unimpeded access to humanitarian aid.  Atrocities on all three fronts have occurred in Aleppo.  We called for an end to these atrocities, for unhindered humanitarian access to be provided, and for the resumption of a credible political process under UN auspices.  The European Council was also united in its assertion that accountability for breaches of international humanitarian law must be upheld.  All options will be under consideration should the current atrocities continue.  That, of course, includes sanctions if necessary, and Ireland fully supports this position.</p><p>There was considerable interest in the European Council discussions on trade.  Our debate in the House last week heard a number of forceful interventions, in particular on the question of the provisional application of those elements of the CETA agreement which fall within the competence of the European Union.  This was also the focus of media coverage last week as intense negotiations continued between the Commission, the Canadian delegation, the Belgian Prime Minister and the Walloon Minister-President.  I appreciate there are differing views in the D&aacute;il on matters of political philosophy, and I welcome this spectrum of opinion.  However, let me be clear that Ireland, with one of the most open economies in the world, has been a beneficiary of free trade.</p><p>This openness is one of the reasons international companies locate here and why Irish companies, particularly SMEs, do so well exporting and trading on the international stage.</p> <p> The Government, while watchful of our own interests, continues to support free trade agreements where the substance and the detail are right.  From Ireland&rsquo;s perspective, the  discussions on trade at the European Council were probably the most significant.  EU leaders agreed on the importance of trade in creating jobs, growth and investment, and on the need to respond to today's challenges with an outward-looking and balanced trade policy.  I emphasise that, on CETA, Ireland was among a group of member states that successfully sought its designation as a mixed agreement.  This means that only  those elements of the agreement which fall within the competency of the EU would come  into force upon provisional signature.  Those elements which fall to national competency would not be in force until national parliaments, including the D&aacute;il, vote to allow that to happen.  The Government, along with others, insisted on this for legal reasons.  Furthermore, the investment protection provisions have been specifically carved out from provisional application which means that they will be implemented only when the D&aacute;il has voted for them.  We fully support the provisional application of CETA at the earliest opportunity.  When it is signed, there will be an accompanying interpretative declaration clarifying that the agreement will not affect public services, labour rights or environmental protection.  It is still hoped that the agreement can be signed at the EU-Canada Summit on 27 October.  The European Parliament would then be expected to give its approval in December.  The prospects for finalising the TTIP agreement with the US are, of course, much more difficult.  It will not happen before the presidential election.</p> <p> More generally, the Council also discussed EU trade defence instruments.  They came to the fore due to a variety of global trade factors, particularly pressure on the steel sector.  We do not have a steel industry and we, therefore, are consumers.  I intervened on the broad question of tackling unfair practices, and I stressed the need to ensure policies designed to help the few do not harm the overall competitiveness of EU industry.  This is particularly important for a small, open economy like Ireland, which is dependent on importing products.  However, we recognise that unfair trade practices need to be tackled efficiently and robustly and we have engaged pragmatically on this item.</p> <p>I will leave it at that.  The Minister of State, Deputy Dara Murphy, will deal with Russia when he replies to the debate.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-10-26a.155" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1224" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016102600028#AA00200"><p>Next March will make the 60th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Rome, which created what is now the EU.  Within days of the anniversary, the UK will submit formal of its intention to leave the Union.  In spite of 60 years successfully fighting the extremism of the left and the right and delivering a significant increase in living standards and a historic fall in poverty, the anniversary marks a dramatic escalation of what is a threat to the EU's very existence. June&rsquo;s Brexit referendum is not just bad for Britain; it is bad for everyone.  Every day it becomes clearer that the hysterical anti-Europeanism of mainly English politicians, ideologues and media owners did not involve preparing any concrete plans for what to do after the referendum.  They continue to abuse anyone who points out issues but they have yet to get beyond a shambolic and often arrogant statement that everything will be great when Britain leaves.</p>  <p>  The damage to Ireland is not hypothetical.  It is happening already and it risks becoming much worse.  Following the forthcoming forum, we should have a detailed discussion in the House about our strategy to Brexit and seek to agree a resolution setting out at least a statement of core principles which can be supported by all Deputies who believe in Ireland&rsquo;s long-term place in the EU.  However, I reiterate that we are not confident that the scale of the threat and its urgency is being properly reflected in Government policy.  Brexit represents a deep long-term economic and social threat to this country.  It will impact our core economic model and threatens to reintroduce divisions on this island which we have worked so hard to overcome.</p>  <p>  The budget was long on rhetoric but lacked any substance.  It is welcome that we are targeting companies in Britain to encourage them to move here, and we should certainly seek the transfer of an EU agency, but this is only a small part of the challenge we face.  Key industries and communities will suffer enormous damage from the volatility of sterling and the introduction of barriers to trade.  I have outlined previously what the Department of Finance's own two reports on exposure of the economy following Brexit will mean.  The Retail Excellence figures published last weekend are worrying as they suggest an initial reduction in sentiment and a downward trend.  We cannot wait two years to outline a strategy to help companies to diversify and compete.  We need to have our demands on the table from the start.</p>  <p>  If the EU wishes to show that Britain made a mistake, and if it wants to keep the 27 intact, then it has an obligation to do everything to assist Ireland and any other part of the Union which can show a significant negative impact.  Immediately following the referendum, it was a reasonable position to state that there should be no discussions until Article 50 was triggered.  This is no longer appropriate and discussions should start now.  First, the British have indicated when the two year period will be triggered, and, therefore, we are not talking about an open-ended negotiation.  Second, it is increasingly clear that any agreement beyond a crude hard Brexit will require the full period and that may not even be enough.  Finally, and more important, uncertainty and the fevered atmosphere which is developing is causing damage.  We need clarity and that can only happen when at least some preliminary discussions happen.  I agree fully with the idea that the British need to say what they want before there can be detailed negotiations, but it would be irresponsible to fail to at least agree formalities beforehand.  It would be unforgivable if time were wasted on discussing how the negotiations would be conducted or who would be involved.  It is ridiculous that there was no substantive discussion at this summit concerning the gravest threat facing the Union.</p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il believes that it is also time for the British Government to follow up its warm words for Ireland with a concrete demonstration of its good faith.  There is a increasing sense that Ireland will be prioritised only after the English Tory agenda has been addressed.  First Minister Sturgeon's frustration about how the devolved administrations are being treated has been well articulated and should be of concern to our Government.  There is much more to be said on this topic, but given time constraints, this will have to wait for another occasion.</p>  <p>  The summit&rsquo;s discussion on migration does not appear to have involved much of substance.  The emphasis of the policies discussed should have been placed on the actions required to stop so many people feeling they need to make a potentially deadly journey in fleeing to Europe.  I would like to again acknowledge the great humanitarian work carried out by our naval personnel.  We should be immensely proud of them and continue to support them in their work.  Separately, migration has been used by many political movements in a dark and cynical manner.  I addressed this issue in depth in a speech last week.  I will only repeat that it is our obligation to stand against the crude and divisive anti-immigrant populism which is present in too many countries.  There is clearly a need to dramatically increase funding for the EU bodies that can systematically study and report on such racist activity.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach agreed yesterday that we would have a full debate on the current status of trade negotiations. I have no sympathy for those who see a conspiracy in every trade agreement and refuse to acknowledge any benefits of free trade.  The fact is that Ireland is one of the world&rsquo;s biggest beneficiaries of the freer trade of recent decades.  To be anti-trade is to say to hundreds of thousands of Irish workers that their companies might not be able to compete fairly internationally.  However, as these agreements become more comprehensive and complex, the need to review them in detail and to ensure public legitimacy has also increased.  I hope the work on the CETA agreement will not be abandoned and a way forward can be agreed.  Notwithstanding what happens in Wallonia and in Belgium, it is important that we have a debate on this House because it has been one-sided so far.</p></speech>

There are many issues in respect of job creation and so on.</p>  <p>  The summit&rsquo;s conclusions on the energy union are to say the least disappointing.  Given our level of connectivity in energy and communications with the UK, an early statement is needed from Government on how it sees these areas developing as well as proposals for diversification where required.</p>  <p>  I welcome the fact that the summit condemned in clear language the barbarity of the ongoing bombing of Aleppo by Russia and Syria.  The fact that leaders failed to do anything other than issue a strongly worded statement on this humanitarian disaster is shameful.  The people of Syria are facing another winter is terrible conditions.  Millions are displaced and losing hope.  If Russia and Syria continue as they are, then at east hundreds of thousands more will become homeless and will be driven out of their country.  I am frankly sick and tired of the false equivalence we keep hearing from those who want to avoid singling out Russia for condemnation.</p><p>Let us remember something very simple.  Russia is responsible for a brutal dictator refusing to hand over power to democratic forces.  It is Russia which is using bunker-busting bombs to hit civilian hospitals and residential areas repeatedly.  To compare this to the bombing by America and others of the inhumane and ghastly ISIS group is perverse.</p> <p> It is a disgrace the Council failed to take a stand against Russia.  The craven behaviour of certain governments, operating in the hope of some small commercial benefit, undermines them and the Union.  The question for them is what Russia would have to do before they would be willing to take a stand against the Putin Government.  It has already invaded and partitioned neighbouring countries, stood by while opposition politicians and journalists have been murdered, intimidated member states of the EU and funded right-wing parties in European states.  It appears to believe the best way of promoting Russia is to undermine democracy.</p> <p> Sanctions have been an effective non-violent weapon for democracies faced with regimes which flout basic standards.  Sanctions were instrumental in bringing down apartheid in Rhodesia and South Africa.  In recent years, they secured the release of Aung San Suu Kyi and a return to democracy in Myanmar.  Sanctions targeting senior Russian personnel and the extension of Russian state power in Europe are the very least we can do.  Existing sanctions have hurt and they should be extended.</p> <p> Fianna F&aacute;il strongly opposes the tone and content of yesterday's European Commission announcement on CCCTB, the common consolidated corporate tax base.  It is manifestly an attempt to shift tax revenue to certain member states at the expense of others.  The idea that taxing businesses more will increase employment and growth is absurd.  The failure to produce a single piece of evidence backing these claims shows that it is purely about politics.  Fianna F&aacute;il will oppose any move by our Government to go along with these proposals.  We will be demanding the Commission publishes the background documents which detail the impact on member states of these proposals.</p></speech>

There was obviously a significant focus on Brexit.  While it is now over four months since the Brexit referendum, the British Government still seems devoid of a clear plan for the negotiations which are to begin early next year.  This is concerning.  However, as I said before, we should not get too mesmerised by this.  We need to get our own house in order.</p>  <p>  On Monday's meeting in Downing Street, the deputy First Minister, Martin McGuinness, told Theresa May that she cannot ignore the reality that the people of the North voted to remain in the EU or the enormous consequences of Brexit for Ireland.  He also told her that continued attempts to drag the North out of the European Union undermine the Good Friday Agreement.  The British Prime Minister, Theresa May, has refused to allow the Executive to have a formal role in the negotiations with the EU.  The British Government clearly cannot, should not be allowed to or will not negotiate in Ireland's interests.  London does not have the interests of the citizens in any part of this island at heart.</p>  <p>  I hope the Taoiseach used the Council meeting to tell other EU member states that we do not want a border on this island.  I have yet to hear him say that anywhere.  During the Council meeting, did he inform other European leaders that any attempt to drag the North out of the EU is a fundamental change in its constitutional position, against the will of the majority of people, and that such action undermines the Good Friday Agreement?  Are other European leaders aware of this?  I asked the Taoiseach to raise this specific question during pre-Council statements in the House.  Did he do so?</p>  <p>  The next meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council takes place on 18 November and the all-island civic dialogue meets next week.  Our aim should be to get a unified approach to ensure the best possible deal is won for the people of the island, North and South.  Citizens in the North - the Taoiseach may be surprised at how many - are looking for leadership from the Government to ensure an all-Ireland view is taken.  Many of those citizens have an entirely different position on the constitutional issue but wish to remain in the European Union.  The role and responsibility of the Government, as co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, must be to defend the integrity of the Agreement, as well as ensuring the "Remain" vote in the North is respected and upheld.</p>  <p>  The Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA, the EU-Canada free trade agreement, was recently rejected by the French-speaking Parliament of Wallonia in Belgium, despite serious pressure from the European Commission.  This has meant that Belgium cannot give its consent to CETA which has, at its heart, the controversial and undemocratic investment court system.  Sinn F&eacute;in has real concerns about this deal as we had with TTIP, the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership.  We have been highlighting the lack of transparency over the negotiations and drafting of this agreement.  The deal remains shrouded in secrecy and displays no transparency whatsoever.</p>  <p>  This rejection of CETA in the Parliament of Wallonia is a victory not only for regions such as Wallonia, which have been severely impacted by job losses over the past ten years, but also for citizens all over the European Union who have campaigned hard to defeat this deal.  CETA, a precursor for TTIP, was presented to the people under the same old pretences we heard rehearsed earlier today, namely what is good for trade is good for jobs.  However, CETA is opposed by European civil society organisations, trade unions, consumer organisations, anti-poverty networks, non-governmental organisations and farming organisations.  While the Government expresses concern about price volatility in the agrifood sector, it is cheerleading for this deal which will flood the market with an extra 50,000 tonnes of beef.  CETA should not be enforced on the Irish State.  There has been no debate on it in the D&aacute;il.  The Government ignored a recent motion in the Seanad earlier this month on the agreement.  Will the Government commit to allowing a debate to take place on this issue in the D&aacute;il in light of recent developments?</p>  <p>  There are heart-breaking conflicts occurring, with significant humanitarian emergencies as a result.  Some argue there is little we can do about them, but I disagree.  One case in point where the Government has failed absolutely is to honour our commitment, one in the programme for Government, to recognise the state of Palestine.  Almost two years ago, the D&aacute;il and Seanad voted in accordance with that commitment.  Since then matters have got worse for the Palestinian people.  I will not repeat all of the details of the aggression by Israeli authorities and so forth.  The Taoiseach has not yet raised this issue at European Commission meetings, despite having been asked by me and others many times to do so.  On 26 September, in the course of Taoiseach's Questions, I raised the issue of recognition of the state of Palestine.  He said he would come back to me on that but he did not.  Previously on Wednesday, 8 June, I raised the issue of the Government acting on the Oireachtas decision on the state of Palestine.  In his response, the Taoiseach said he would ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to brief me.  He also stated it "might be no harm if we had a debate on the Palestinian situation in due course."</p>  <p>  Neither he nor the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade have come back to me on this issue.  Neither has the Government allocated any time for a debate on the issue of Palestine.  It is time to stop the prevarication and formally recognise the state of Palestine.  It is also time for the Taoiseach to take leadership on this issue in the European Council.  That would send a clear signal to those caught up in war zones and refugee camps that someone is prepared to make a stand for peace.</p></speech>

Many parties in Europe would see this decision by a small region as an irritant or democracy gone mad.  I see it, however, as a victory for democracy and citizens all over Europe who have campaigned hard to defeat CETA.  Speaking of democracy, it is also regrettable the Government chose to ignore the vote in the Seanad against CETA.  So much for new politics.</p><p>Does the Taoiseach agree that the democratic political process in Belgium must be respected and that all threats against the people of Wallonia should be lifted?  There is a need for a serious rethink of the EU trade policy agenda, particularly the secrecy surrounding such deals, which issue I have raised on many occasions.  There is clearly huge public opposition to trade deals such as the CETA.  Most people are reluctant to give multinational corporations the power to control sovereign governments through an investment court system, previously known as the investor state dispute mechanism.  This issue should be re-examined in the context of the fact that there has been no debate on the CETA in this House.  I agree with previous speakers that it is wrong that we are pushing ahead on this agreement without a discussion of it, even at committee level, never mind anywhere else.  </p> <p> I would like in the time remaining to focus on the issue of migration.  We are all aware of the humanitarian crisis because of the closure of the camp in Calais which I understand is on fire and in which there were hundreds of unaccompanied minors.  I heard this morning that the Minister of State, Deputy David Stanton, was in Greece to discuss what Ireland could do to help in this regard.  I am concerned about some of the deals discussed at the EU Council meeting, including the European Union's threat to reduce aid to Afghanistan if it does not accept the return of 80,000 deported asylum seekers.  I understand tentative agreement has been reached between the European Union and Afghanistan in that regard, but how can we stand over this in the context of the human rights violations that will result?  We know that, on average, 14 people die per day while crossing the Mediterranean.  Reference was made by other speakers to the positive role being played in this regard by the Naval Service.  However, we have shown poor leadership that thus far, with only 69 refugees being accepted into Ireland.  I have asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade a number of times this week and previously at various fora for a note on the difficulties being experienced in this regard.  Perhaps the Taoiseach or somebody else might provide those of us who continually raise the issue of migration in this Parliament with information on where the problem lies and where the blockages are.  He might take on the task of informing us of what positive action we could take in order that we could inform others.</p></speech>

I will certainly make some references to it.  Given that the British Prime Minister, Ms Theresa May, took only a few minutes to set out her views at about 1 a.m., it clearly was not the focus of that meeting, but I will come back to the issue.</p>  <p>  On the issue that dominated the European Council meeting, namely, Russian aggression in Syria and the migration crisis, the distressing scenes of devastation in Syria have, rightly, caused outrage and dismay.  Last week in the Seanad the Labour Party spokesperson on foreign affairs, Senator Ivana Bacik, secured all-party agreement on a motion condemning the appalling bombardment of civilians in Aleppo and the ongoing humanitarian disaster in Syria.  The D&aacute;il also debated the issue last week in some detail.  At such a remove from the war, it can be hard to make a real difference, but the Labour Party will continue to question the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, about what Ireland is doing and to ensure there will be a concentrated effort to deliver whatever assistance we can, humanitarian or otherwise.  We have asked the Minister to express in the strongest possible terms Ireland's condemnation of Russia's support of the Syrian Government and its role in the horrific and inhumane bombardment of Aleppo.  We want Ireland to support the extension of sanctions against Russia and vote against its admission to the UN Human Rights Committee.  We have also called on the Minister to support the stronger approach being adopted by the German and French Governments to Russia's complicity in war crimes being committed against the civil population in Syria.  The failure of the European Council to include any reference to possible sanctions against Russia, given this complicity, is hugely disappointing, to say the least.  I hope Ireland was not one of the country's responsible for this omission. </p>  <p>  It is not acceptable for the European Union to stand on the sidelines and not take action.  The delay in welcoming those fleeing the war to Ireland deserves criticism in this House.  It is an issue for all Europeans.  Surely, we can now all accept the need for greater urgency in the resettlement and relocation of Syrian refugees.  Delays are occurring in Italy in the admission into that country of Irish personnel to help to process applicants for inclusion in the programme.  It is about time we were given a concrete timeframe for the admission into Ireland of the 4,000 refugees we have committed to receiving.  Our target is to have 520 refugees resettled in Ireland by the end of the year.  Will the Taoiseach commit to increasing that number?  Ireland is ready to provide for the safe relocation of those fleeing the war and w must deliver on our commitment.  </p>  <p>  When the budget was unveiled, the Labour Party leader, Deputy Brendan Howlin, criticised the Government for failing to include any increase in the Irish Aid budget, with only an extra &euro;10 million being provided for overseas development assistance.  Perhaps the Taoiseach might confirm if the additional &euro;10 million will be used to support the EU-Turkey refugee deal.  Faced with such a grave humanitarian crisis, we could have done better.  Like Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, I salute the commendable work undertaken by Naval Service personnel and also for their humanitarian efforts and professional approach which has earned it respect and admiration across the world.  </p>  <p>  On the Friday the European Council discussed the issues of trade and the CETA.  The collapse of the trade deal does not bode well for a possible UK-EU settlement following Brexit.  A key issue with the CETA was the lack of an input by national parliaments across Europe.  If the European Union is to retain competency on trade issues, it must do substantially more to reflect the concerns of the peoples of Europe expresses through national parliaments and their representatives.  There are many who welcome the stance adopted by Wallonia and Belgium as it highlights, in stark form, the democratic deficit at the heart of trade talks.  Future trade deals are dead, unless legitimate concerns, in particular about agricultural and food products and the investor court, are addressed.  </p>  <p>  On Brexit, on which issue I made a 20-minute contribution in April, the greatest challenge facing Ireland in Europe is presented by the prospect that there will be a hard Brexit.  A hard Brexit would not be in Ireland's interests.  The taking of a hard line in Europe means bad outcomes for Ireland.  Whatever our views and whether we like it, the people of the United Kingdom have spoken and decided to leave the European Union.  This is the time to engage in serious planning.  We most definitely need to accelerate our planning process.  I have heard too many people who think they are informed experts on this issue speculate about what might happen.  My view is that a Brexit will take a considerable period of time to complete.  Two years is only the starting base.  It took Greenland three years to leave and it is a small country.  A Brexit will take much longer to complete and this will create huge uncertainty.  It could take four to five years for it to be completed, irrespective of people's commitment.  I am, therefore, extremely concerned about this process.</p>  <p>  Last week, according to reports, the British Prime Minister was given just a few minutes at 1 a.m. to set out her views on Brexit.  That her contribution was met with silence before a group moved on to discuss other items should tell us a lot.  It was reported that Mr. Juncker had responded to questions with a phut.  Francois Hollande said the negotiations would be hard, while Ms Merkel said they would be rough.  It appears we are facing a further five months of uncertainty, as Article 50 will not be triggered until March.  Has Ireland sought a place on Mr. Barnier's team?  There are many experienced negotiators in Ireland, both politicians and civil servants, who played key roles in the peace process and EU negotiations.  These skills should be available at the Brexit negotiating table, principally to protect the peace process, as alluded to by Deputy Gerry Adams, but also in the context of the unique circumstances faced by Ireland.  </p>  <p>  In recent days I read with interest the national risk assessment 2016 report which indicates that Britain's departure from the European Union is the number one threat to Ireland's prosperity and that this will impact on the economy, our social infrastructure and standing on the international stage.  That is clear.  We should not, therefore, underestimate the significant change that is likely to occur at EU level from a political perspective in terms of maintaining a balance.</p><p>As the UK and Ireland often found themselves on the same side in debates on critical decisions, a valuable ally will be lost in terms of future arguments.  As my colleagues have mentioned, huge issues arise for this country with regard to the North and the South, the common travel area, the absence of customs and trade barriers and, of course, the Good Friday Agreement.  From the agricultural perspective there are issues relating to bio-security and veterinary check and inspections, which are very important.  All of these issues will require sustained argument and planning to achieve our objectives, which should be clearly spelt out.</p> <p> What will happen following Brexit will remain a matter of conjecture and speculation.  We are in a vacuum until the trigger is pulled next March.  After that, I foresee a further period that will create grave uncertainty.  We know how important trade is to our economy at all levels.  That must be the focus of significant attention, and I acknowledge that the Taoiseach has set up interdepartmental groups to work on that.  More than &euro;1 billion worth of goods and services are traded between Ireland and the UK every week and 40% of our exported goods arrive into the UK market.  Our food, drinks and agriculture industries are highly dependent on the maintenance of this trade in a free flowing fashion.  The imposition of trade tariffs would have a disastrous and negative impact.</p> <p> With regard to the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, and I am the Labour Party spokesperson on agriculture, the UK makes an &euro;11 billion contribution to the EU budget.  That is significant.  The loss of this funding will have a significant impact on our CAP benefits, which will become the subject of renegotiation in 2019.  We receive &euro;1.2 billion in single farm payments, so that is another area that undoubtedly will be the focus of attention at the relevant time.  There are a number of mushroom producers in my constituency.  That industry sustained significant losses immediately.  Three major mushroom producers have gone to the wall and two more are in the departure lounge, as it were, due to that impact.  I was disappointed that some emergency measures were not brought forward in the budget.  I believe that if the mushroom industry is assisted now in a short-term manner, it will be in a position to survive and continue.  There were over 600 mushroom producers in the country ten to 12 years ago, now there are just over 60.  The number has declined, although they have increased in scale.  The industry involves high volume production but very little profit, and the currency situation has impacted it significantly in a negative way.</p> <p> I cannot understand why we have not done what was done five or six years ago, whereby the PRSI rate for people in the industry could have been reduced from 8.5% to 4.25%.  That would have had a significant impact.  I implore the Taoiseach to ensure that the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Varadkar, examines this as a temporary arrangement to ensure the survival of the mushroom industry.  A total of 85% of its exports go to the UK, so it will be significantly affected over the next couple of years.  We must help it now.  It is no use crying crocodile tears when it collapses.</p></speech>

I will set aside the normal political debate we might have in a debate such as this and raise a specific and urgent issue on which I hope there can be all-party agreement to take action.  It could make a real difference to a very vulnerable group of people.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach is aware, and he referred to it in his contribution, of Ireland's commitment to take in refugees, and specifically unaccompanied minors.  The demolition of the Calais "Jungle" is currently under way.  There are 10,000 refugees in the camp, including over 1,000 unaccompanied minors who are in serious danger.  Fires are raging in Calais as we speak.  The last time a part of the Calais "Jungle" was knocked down, 200 unaccompanied minors disappeared, so there is an urgent issue at stake.  A group called Not On Our Watch, which is endorsed by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, and Sr. Stanislaus Kennedy and led by a great campaigner for refugees, Gary Daly, is liaising with an Irish woman, Karen Moynihan, who has been working in Calais specifically with unaccompanied minors.  This morning it asked Members of the Oireachtas to take action on this and to liaise with Karen to try and save 200 of these young, unaccompanied minors by relocating them to Ireland.  This would save them from the serious prospect and danger that they might disappear, as happened the last time, and be subject to trafficking, exploitation and degradation of a sort that is unthinkable for children but which has happened in recent times.</p>  <p>  The campaign has drafted a motion which will be circulated to Members in the next hour.  Representatives of Sinn F&eacute;in, Fianna F&aacute;il and Deputy Clare Daly's office attended the briefing and have given agreement in principle to sign up to the campaign.  We are hoping the Government will sign up to it as well, pass the motion and give a commitment to contact its French counterpart immediately.  The motion hopes that the Taoiseach's Department might do this, taking a lead from the top, and contact the French authorities with an offer to relocate 200 of these children.  They are currently in serious danger because of the fires that are raging and the potential consequences of the dissolution of the camp.  If we act now, we could save and transform the lives of these young, unaccompanied children.</p>  <p>  It would not cost us anything, which should be emphasised.  We were told in this morning's briefing that 800 Irish families have contacted the Irish Red Cross and said they are willing to take unaccompanied minors into foster care.  The families are ready to do this and there is an Irish woman, Karen Moynihan, in the camp who knows the children.  She can vouch for their age and knows them personally, so we have a straight direct line to the children who are now in danger.  The motion asks that the Taoiseach contact his French counterpart to make this offer, which is in line with our previously stated commitment to give refuge to unaccompanied minors, and asks that Tusla, youth services and other State agencies would co-ordinate with Karen Moynihan to identify these children and get them over here.</p>  <p>  It is a very straightforward request, and it is in line with the Government's stated policy and commitment.  Whatever difficulties there might be in identifying children in Italy and Greece, we can identify them in this case because we have people who are working with them.  The motion will be circulated and I hope the Taoiseach will give serious consideration to supporting it and taking this campaign on board.  The motion is from the campaign, not from us.  Hopefully, we can sign off on it and get that commitment as soon as possible.</p></speech>

One of them was a three year old girl.  They had made an 18 hour journey from Cherbourg in a sealed container containing perishable goods.  The migrant camp at Calais currently being dismantled contains 1,300 unaccompanied children according to some estimates.  As my colleague has explained, these children are at extreme risk of exploitation and trafficking.  How many lone children has the Government committed to taking in this year?  The answer is 20.</p><p>I share the opinion of the Irish Immigrant Council that this is not acceptable.  In fact, I would say that it is shameful.<br/><br/>Last week, &quot;Match of the Day&quot; presenter Mr. Gary Lineker called on the UK Government to do more and to take more child refugees into the UK.  Although he was criticised and abused by <i>The Sun </i>newspaper and by Tory MPs, many ordinary people agreed with the substance of his comments.  Where are the Irish Gary Linekers?  Why are there not more famous people here speaking out?  They should do so because 20 lone children is a scandal and many, many more should be taken in.<br/><br/>The Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA, currently hangs in the balance.  This EU-Canadian trade treaty opens the door to the privatisation of public services and lowers regulation to the lowest common denominator in fields such as environmental regulation, labour laws and so on.  It extends patent protection for prescription drugs, thereby pushing up drug costs and it establishes an investor court system.  An investor court system will mean that corporations can sue national governments that introduce new legislation which might restrict their ability to maximise profits.  This has the potential to unleash a wave of corporate law suits.  Courts of this kind have been used in the past to undermine progressive legislation.  For example, when the German Government, under pressure from public protest and public opinion, sought to phase out nuclear power, a Scandinavian nuclear power corporation sued it in an investor court and won hefty damages which were ultimately paid by German taxpayers.  Such courts will be able to be used in this way under this new treaty.  For example, if a government in an EU member state were to introduce legislation to ban the environmentally dangerous process of fracking it would be open to being sued and forced to pay damages should a case be taken to the investor court by a Canada based fracking corporation.  <br/><br/>Some might say that there are not too many Canadian corporations that might go down that road but they should think again because 81% of companies in Canada are US subsidiaries.  Approximately 24,000 US companies have office space and a base in Canada.  The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP, a trade agreement between the EU and the US is in serious difficulty, in large measure because of huge public opposition but CETA can be TTIP by the back door.  There are real dangers involved here.  I welcome the fact that four regional parliaments in Belgium have come out against it.  They are reflecting public opposition, including huge trade union opposition, in that country.  If there is to be any kind of democratic debate or check on this, democracy will win against this agreement.  That is the popular feeling in Europe.  CETA has been voted down in the Seanad.  It will have to be brought before the D&aacute;il and we must have a major debate on it.  My colleagues and I will be making the case against this pro-capitalist, anti-worker treaty.</p></speech>

Sadly, only last week I was told in this Chamber that the Government could do nothing about it because it is an unofficial camp, which I found to be an horrific response.  In general, the Government's response to the refugee crisis in Europe has been nothing short of disgraceful from the start.  The Government should be ashamed of how it has dealt with it.  The total lack of political will to actually help has been horrific.</p>  <p>  The French are dispersing these people to centres around France but have already said that they do not have the necessary facilities to deal with half the children, the unaccompanied minors, that are involved.  There are over 1,000 such children in the camp at Calais.  The last time the camp was cleared 129 unaccompanied minors disappeared.  I will not even speculate about where they ended up.  If, this week and next week, the children are taken to reception centres in places like Paris, statistics show that at least 40% will leave and end up on the streets.  They will leave the reception centres.  These children are not safe.  The British have agreed to do something, at last.  They are talking about bringing in a certain number of them.  They have said that they will concentrate on those under 12 but it just so happens that there are not many children under 12 in the camp.  There are lots of children aged between 12 and 18.  Indeed, most of them are in that age group so I remain to be convinced as to just how positive a role the British Government intends playing in this.</p>  <p>  Our Government is behaving as if this has nothing to do with us and is none of our business.  Even if we had never allowed any military operators to use Shannon Airport, we must still feel some sense of responsibility if people are in trouble.  Calais is only across the water from us.  We say that we care but there is no proof that we do.  We have not shown any proof that we care.  We said that we were going to bring 4,000 refugees here by the end of 2017 but the chances of us reaching that figure are nil at this stage, given that we are still only at about the 500 mark.</p>  <p>  The European Union has talked about dealing with migration and the problems involved.  However, it has no interest in the root causes.  We have the US giving munitions to Saudi Arabia every day at the moment to bomb the living daylights out of Yemen.  Over 10,000 civilians have been killed in Yemen but we have not heard a word about it in here.  What is wrong with us?  The people who have survived the attacks in Yemen will become refugees.  There will be hundreds of thousands of them because Yemen has a big population.  There are over 20 million people in Yemen and hundreds of thousands of them will become refugees because they will have no other choice.  They will be driven out of their own country because they are being bombed out of it.  In the same way, the Americans bombed the people of Afghanistan, Iraq and along with 14 other countries, they are bombing the people out of Syria.  It is just total madness and we do not say enough about it.  We are not neutral.  We facilitate it by letting the US use Shannon Airport as a military base.  Where is the rationale behind it?  I would like to hear someone rationalise it for me and give me a good explanation as to why we allow Shannon Airport to be used by the US military's war machine.</p>  <p>  There is just no end to this.  It has been getting worse and worse since 2001.  The whole region has been destroyed.  The EU, in its infinite wisdom, tried to do a deal with Afghanistan a few weeks ago.  The EU is going to send people back to Afghanistan.  It just so happens that the majority of the people in the Calais camp are from Afghanistan.  Deputy Clare Daly and I spent two long days talking to them there.  We also spent a day in the camp at Dunkirk, which is mostly populated by Kurds.  The Afghanis told us that they will do anything other than go back.  They would rather die in Europe than go back to Afghanistan.  Most of them have fallen out with either the Taliban, ISIS, or some other elements of al-Qaeda.  Others have family members who worked with the US in Afghanistan.</p><p><i>3 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p> <p>They are afraid to go back because their lives are in danger but the EU is talking about doing a deal with Afghanistan to send them back.</p> <p> We are now talking to the Africans.  At a Brussels conference recently they were talking about sending people back to Niger, Nigeria, Mali, Senegal and Ethiopia.  Leaked documents show that among the other countries been considered are Sudan and Eritrea.  Imagine doing a deal with Sudan to stop people coming out of the country into Europe.  The dictator of Sudan, Omar al Bashir, is wanted for war crimes and now the EU is considering hiring him to stop migration at source from  the Horn of Africa.  Last month Amnesty International released a report with evidence that earlier this year Bashir's airforce was dropping chemical weapons on some of the remote villages yet the EU is interested in doing business with this person in order to stop migrants coming to Europe.</p> <p> The many people who are still drowning in the Mediterranean are not coming because everything was grand where they were but they would like it better in Europe.  They are being forced from their homelands and the West has played a huge part in that.  We bear a huge responsibility for what is going on.  The race for control of African minerals by Western powers is linked to the fact that so many migrants are trying to get out of the continent of Africa.  Huge numbers are coming across the Mediterranean from the Middle Eastern region too.  Look at the number of Palestinian refugees in the world today.  We still entertain the Israelis as if there is nothing wrong with their relationship with the Palestinians, or with the fact that they are engaging in genocide.  They are trying to obliterate the Palestinian people and our Government is okay with that.  Will we continue to trade with Saudi Arabia?  There are people in here who say we should have nothing to do with the Russians and I would not defend them for one second, what they are doing in Syria is deplorable but so is what the Americans, the French and the British are doing.  The Saudis today are arming Al-Nusra which has become a more powerful force than ISIS.  We reap what we sow.  There are munitions going through Shannon to Saudi Arabia that are being used to kill innocent people in the Yemen and arms going through to Al-Nusra who are every bit as mad as the ISIS crowd yet we are still comfortable working with them.  When will we regain our neutrality?  I firmly believe that the majority of Irish people would like Ireland to be neutral.</p></speech>

I spoke ten days ago before the council meeting.  There can be no doubt but that Europe stands on the threshold of fundamental change.  Many of the crises facing the EU are the products of its arrogance.  That cannot be overstated because it is out of touch with ordinary countries and the project we all voted for fad&oacute; fad&oacute; in the 1970s.  It has neglected democratic principles and set aside the democratic will of member countries when it suited.  We have seen countless cases of that.  Is it any surprise that enormous sections of the population in member states are in open revolt against the increasingly elite view that is at the heart of the European vision which is alien to most ordinary people?</p>  <p>  The European Union has come late to the condemnation of the genocide of entire populations of Christian and Muslim minorities in the Middle East.  I visited Syrian refugee camps in Lebanon and saw the appalling vista.  I saw the grannies and the young children who were orphans.  I saw the trauma in their faces and the welcome they gave us but we are doing nothing.  When I came back from that trip with Deputy Grealish and Senator Mullen I asked the last Government countless times in this House for a debate on it.  I asked the Fianna F&aacute;il party for one.  No one wanted to hear about it.  See no evil, speak no evil: what we cannot see we will not worry about.  Now we are worried.  I do not always agree with Deputy Wallace but this is genocide, under the dictators in Iraq, Syria and Libya.  Charles Haughey went out to Libya and made deals with Gaddafi on beef.  There was control.  The Christians and the minority Muslim sects were allowed to practice whatever faith they wanted with total impunity and freedom and they were respected.  Now there is a seismic shift.  I recently met His Holiness the Pope and he begged us to do something about it.  He called it what it was, a world war being waged on Christian communities and minority Muslim communities.  We are sleepwalking while it goes on.  The Government refused to debate this.  I am asking now for more time for a proper and meaningful debate in view of the crisis.  </p>  <p>  We all acknowledge the deep concerns that exist because of the Brexit vote.  The budget paid scant regard to it.  I said that in my statement on it.</p>  <p>  I welcome the Harrington family and their friends from County Waterford who are in the Visitors Gallery.  They are business people and farmers but they are also Christian people who are aghast at what is going on and at our lack of emphasis on Brexit and its impact.</p>  <p>  The crisis in Europe was largely self-generated.  We dismissed it and took our eye off the ball.  We can all say now there are leaks about what Theresa May said then, and d&uacute;irt bean liom go nd&uacute;irt bean l&eacute;i go raibh fear i dTiobraid &Aacute;rann a bhfuil p&oacute;ca ina l&eacute;ine aige.  It is an old proverb.  It reeks of snobbery to say that the people in the UK are fooled into this decision.  They are a democratic people.  They always vote wisely.  Will it be like the Lisbon treaty?  They have a growing sense that the EU has removed itself from us and intruded into sovereign areas in many member states with bully boy tactics.  The Taoiseach had a habit of sucking up to Ms Merkel.  Last week I told him now it is time to be paid back after being the good boy for years.  Now it is time to look after Ireland and if we cannot deal with Britain as a sovereign country let the EU deal with it.  The last thing we want is what I saw recently going from Bosnia-Herzegovina into Croatia, a hard border, on a motorway that was easy to travel.  There were 52 people on the bus and all our passports were taken away and scanned, which took a full hour.  It is unimaginable to think that might happen in Newry or Aughnacloy or places I travelled to in the bad times and can now travel to with freedom.  Noises coming from Britain now suggest it wants a hard border.  That will have a huge impact.</p>  <p>  The mushroom farmers, which have a big industry in Tipperary, have been ravaged and devastated and I know they were given a few bob in the budget but they were struggling already and now the difference in the sterling value is crazy.  I met British visitors in my guest house this morning who talked about the poor value they are getting now.  There are huge issues.  We need a Minister for Brexit.  We need proper appreciation of what will or might happen and the impact it might have.  We all claim to be Christians.  We need to go and see the genocide that is happening and have the courage to have a debate in this Parliament and stand up as a neutral country, which we always were.  We were respected all over the world.  Our missionaries and emissaries went all over the world as good people.  We need that debate here now.</p></speech>

With regard to the humanitarian crisis, I compliment the people working in our Naval Service.  As Deputy Wallace rightly said, they are picking people from the water they should not be in.  We should not have allowed the humanitarian crisis to get to where it is.  Every effort, political and otherwise, should be made to address this issue.  There must be a better answer to the problem than people putting themselves in that kind of danger to get to what we would call a better place.  Through dialogue, work and politics, many from this House and other parliaments were involved in stopping people killing each other on the streets of the North every day.  Surely be to God, if that could be done, this humanitarian crisis can also be dealt with to allow us to reach a position where people can express their religious beliefs.  I do not care what religion a person is and respect whatever religion it is wherever he or she is from in the world.  That must be reciprocal, however.  Where Catholics are willing to accept other religions, other religions should reciprocate and accept the Catholic religion and other Christians.  That is only common sense, right and fair.</p> <p> I turn to Brexit.  Since becoming Chairman of the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs, I have embarked on a weekly dialogue with ambassadors from different countries.  Earlier today, for instance, I met the Spanish ambassador.  Spain faces many of the same implications from Brexit as we do.  We have one very important thing in common with the UK, which is the Border.  We are unique in that respect.  The difficulties and problems we face represent unprecedented and uncharted waters.  We are in a place with regard to our farming and business communities where we really do not know what the implications of Brexit are going to be.  What we do know, however, is that we must be political and sensible about it.  We have to be workmanlike in trying to minimise the negatives while maximising the positives if there are to be any for us as a nation.  I compliment people like Deputies Mattie McGrath and Se&aacute;n Haughey who are members of the committee and are doing Trojan work to grasp the problem we face.  Last week, we met Members of the House of Lords and Commissioner Phil Hogan was here from Europe to give his overview.  We might not have agreed on a lot of things in the past, but we respect the implications of the problem we all have currently.  We have to deal with the situation we are in.  We are all willing to put our shoulders to the wheel.</p> <p> Deputy Mattie McGrath touched on the following a few moments ago.  I would like to remember fondly and positively the great work that was done in the past on international relations.  Deputy Haughey is in the Chamber and I refer in particular to his late father who did great work on our behalf and on behalf of our farming community.  I acknowledge that because it is time things like that were said publicly.  I will not back down from that for anybody.  I am very concerned about the implications of Brexit and we have a job of work to do together in that regard.  I will continue to do my best.  Meetings are scheduled for many weeks to come with ambassadors and officials to grasp the problem we have and the committee and I will not be found wanting in that regard.  We will work in co-operation with the Minister because this is too serious an issue about which to be political.  The Minister and his colleagues in government are our Ministers.  I want to be proactive, workmanlike and sensible about this and not score political points because for the farming community and business people, it is too important a matter about which to be politically adversarial.</p></speech>

It is useful to have a debate beforehand and afterwards.  It is where so much of our key political discourse is taking place and it is appropriate for the House to spend time giving attention to it.  This brings us to the big issues.  It brings us out of the local and into the international and the great forces shaping our world and times.  It is important that we address those.  It is interesting to look at the key issues which dominated the Council.  These were the movement of refugees and our treatment and management of the refugee crisis and the management of goods, having particular regard to CETA, the Canadian-European trade arrangement which does not look like it will be signed tomorrow.  It seems to me that the approaches we are taking to these issues are connected.</p>  <p>  I turn to the refugee issue first.  I share the concerns that have been raised here and elsewhere that what I read in the Council conclusions and in the reporting from the summit suggests a certain sense of satisfaction about the worst aspects of the crisis which we saw last year, in particular with a large number of people crossing the Aegean from Turkey into Greece and from there into the Continent of Europe.  The figure quoted in the Council conclusions is that 98% of the level of travel has ceased.  The real fear is that, whatever about the management of the joint arrangement with Turkey, the management of those who have been caught in the middle in Greece in particular is indicative of an approach which sees the European Union failing to learn or change or improve its procedures.  We have gone from an open-door approach to a complete shut down, which will serve neither Europe nor the people who are trying desperately to flee conflicts in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and other areas neighbouring the EU.</p>  <p>  I note in the Council conclusions references to the rapid deployment of permanent co-ordinators in the Greek hotspots.  However, the reports from people engaged with those desperately isolated and vulnerable refugees caught in the middle of this whole policy change suggest that there is no sense of that actually happening.  I go back to our own local example which is that only 69 of the 4,000 refugees we promised to take almost eight months ago are here.  To take 69 out of 4,000 when the 4,000 are sitting in camps where they are mobile, easily accessible and easily identifiable is an indication of the wider problem.  We can only fear that it reflects a European Council approach which is perhaps pleased that we have sealed off the problem on one immediate border and can now resort to restoring Schengen as if the current arrangements are working.  They are not working.  They are not working on a humanitarian basis or even in terms of the European Union living up to its promise to be a safe haven and an enlightened Union which treats people in flight from danger in an appropriate manner.  I must raise concern on behalf of my party.  The clearing of the camp in Calais, the horrific situation whereby a whole range of young people are now completely lost in the international response and the lack of a co-ordinated European approach to managing that and the restoration of national controls are signs that our European refugee policy is not working.</p>  <p>  I referred earlier to the related issue of trade because the two are connected.</p><p>It is interesting in some ways that the European Union is constantly, correctly in my mind, telling the United Kingdom that in any negotiation on Brexit the movement of goods and people cannot be separated.  This issue is connected to trade because the fear is that the European Union has been excessively concerned with protecting the interests of those who trade goods as opposed to social and environmental considerations.  It is a world in which capital can move remarkably fast and international corporations often have power that exceeds that of countries because of their ability to trade and access finance across borders.  It is the indisputable power of capital and its speed of movement that gives it an unfair negotiating position in comparison to labour and natural capital which is less mobile.  It is the underlying concern that in its broad approach the European Union has had undue regard to the interests of capital compared to labour.  That is behind the fundamental concern of the Green Party throughout Europe about the nature of the trade agreements that have been signed.  For all the reassurance provided in the Council conclusions that trade arrangements will try to maintain the capability of national governments to regulate, in the agreements we have seen it is evident that there is a continuation of the policy of giving excessive power to capital as compared to labour and natural capital.</p> <p> The Minister-President of Wallonia, Mr. Paul Magnette, has taken a very prominent and, to my mind, the correct position in standing up for his region by saying he does not agree with the proposals made.  Despite extensive pressure exerted on him and his parliament, as I articulated in my speech prior to the European Council meeting, he helped to stop the CETA process.  It is better for us to recognise this at this stage and look to renegotiate the agreement.  It is not that we are opposed to trade, but we need to be able to move capital.  It has to be balanced.  The existing trade agreements, the CETA and the TTIP, are not properly balanced and we should use the opportunity to restore faith in the European Union and the balance between capital, labour and natural capital.  This should be done through a variation, such as that for which the Wallonian Parliament and my colleagues in the Green Party in the European Parliament have called.</p> <p> What the Taoiseach has said is true.  This one of the most open trading economies in the world.  We, therefore, have to get the balance of trade right.  We are dependent on free trade and will be most successful when we stand up for fair as well as free trade, but I did not read anything about this in the Taoiseach's speech or the analysis produced by the Government.  That needs to change.</p> <p> Reference is made in a Sherlock Holmes book to a dog or a hound that did not bark.  There was a lack of attention to Brexit within the European Council.  That was probably correct because it behoves the UK Government to present what it wants to do before the Council starts to develop its approach.  I reiterate the approach we should take which I mentioned to the Taoiseach yesterday during the taking of questions on Brexit.  We need to stand in solidarity with the other 26 member states.  We need to stand up for the connection with the movement of goods and people.  We should not look for a side deal, reflecting Ireland's peripherality or particular circumstances on the Border.  We have to manage that issue, but it should be as part of an overall co-ordinated European Union approach, not an approach whereby we try to side with the United Kingdom in a side deal which we bring to our European colleagues to be ratified as part of whatever arrangement is put in place.</p> <p> I very much appreciate the chance to reflect on the European Council's conclusions.  The upcoming Council will be critical, particularly in dealing with the Brexit issue.  I look forward to receiving as much information as possible in briefings from the Government, as the Taoiseach promised, in order that we can make a contribution to the overall policy approach to be adopted.</p></speech>

The reform was introduced following the rejection of the Lisbon treaty.</p>  <p>  A lot of the discussion in the House has centred on Brexit.  I note that the Taoiseach informed the House that Ms Tteresa May was attending her first meeting of the European Council since becoming Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.  Interestingly, he went on to say there had been no discussion of the issue at the meeting, which certainly says a lot.  There was a brief comment on the Prime Minister's intervention by President Tusk.</p>  <p>  We are all aware of the concerns in Ireland and our unique circumstances arising from the vote of UK citizens.  There are concerns about the common travel area, the possible introduction of a hard border, the introduction of barriers to trade and the sustainability of the peace process.  Does the Minister of State, Deputy Dara Murphy, think there is now an understanding of the special circumstances of Ireland arising from the vote of UK citizens?  Obviously, the Taoiseach has met Ms Angela Merkel, Fran&ccedil;ois Hollande, Commissioner Michel Barnier and other, but I am interested in hearing the perspective of the Minister of State, given that he has mixed with his counterparts from other member states, on whether we have got the message through that Ireland has unique circumstances.</p>  <p>  I understand the Minister of State will deal with the position of Russian and the civil war in Syria in his closing remarks.  Despite repeated claims to the contrary, the direct Russian intervention in the civil war in Syria a year ago was aimed at bringing about a shift in the balance of power in the conflict.  The prospects for a diplomatic solution to the conflict have never been favourable, with a number of international and regional actors putting their strategic interests above a resolution of the conflict.  However, the direct Russian intervention was characterised by military stalemate.  With the aid of Russian air support, the brutal regime of Bashir al-Assad has been emboldened and believes a decisive military victory is possible.  Direct Russian involvement in the conflict has further undermined the prospects for a sustained cessation of hostilities and a negotiated resolution of the civil war. </p>  <p>  The horrifying reality of the current situation is no more apparent than in the city of Aleppo, much of which has been subject to a sustained arterial bombardment by the Syrian regime and Russian military.  The indiscriminate bombing campaign has led to significant civilian casualties and brought terror to the 250,000 inhabitants of eastern Aleppo.  There was some talk prior to the summit that sanctions would be imposed, but this does not seem to have taken place.  What action against Russia was considered by the summit?</p>  <p>  There has been a lot of discussion about the dismantling of the jungle in Calais.  I ask the Minister of State to outline the position on the over 1,000 unaccompanied minors in the camp and whether the Government can respond to the crisis.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-10-26a.179" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1282" speakername="Dara Murphy" time="15:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016102600035#HH00400"><p>I will deal with the issue of Russian intervention in Syria in my closing remarks, given that we are operating within time constraints.</p><p>On that point I will answer the Deputy's other question by describing the sense I have of the position taken by our colleagues in other member states regarding the unique position that we have in Ireland. There are many areas where we and other member states have significant areas of common concern.  It goes to the point made by Deputy Eamon Ryan that it is vital to acknowledge Ireland will continue to be strong and enthusiastic members of the European Union and we will be part of the 27 member state and the negotiations that will take place with the United Kingdom.  Many countries share significant concerns that we already have around trade, a reduction in activity through the Single Market and the effects that other countries will also have for their SME sectors, exporters, businesses, the jobs that are created and their people.  It is true that Ireland will be more affected by that given that there is &euro;1.2 billion worth of trade crossing the Irish Sea every year and the 400,000 jobs on either side of that trade.</p> <p> While travelling recently in north eastern Europe it struck me that the United Kingdom is the second biggest market for many other countries.  We therefore have many areas where we can work with other countries.  Spain for example, and its land border with Gibraltar, has similar issues to be addressed as Ireland has with the North, but not as complex as Ireland's.  It is fair to say that Ireland has unique difficulties and while we will not be seeking to have a side deal, as was asked, within the deal that the European Union has with the United Kingdom, there will have to be a specific part of that process that deals with this island's unique circumstances.  These unique circumstances are the common travel area that has existed for so long now, the deep and significant progress made in the peace process, the legally binding international agreements that exist, through the Good Friday Agreement, between the United Kingdom, Ireland and the parties of Northern Ireland around governance, and the substantial support of the EU&rsquo;s PEACE and INTERREG programmes and other financial supports that have come to Northern Ireland and the Border areas.  There is a strong acceptance about these aspects.</p> <p> The Taoiseach has met with Chancellor Merkel, President Hollande, President Tusk and Michel Barnier, who will be negotiating on behalf of the Commission.  Our concerns are being expressed but the reason for the very brief intervention by Prime Minister Theresa May at the Council meeting last week was because, unfortunately, until the British come forward with their proposals there cannot be a reaction from the European Council or EU leaders as we do not know what the UK's ask will be.  Earlier in this discussion today reference was made to a scenario where the UK gets what it wants and Ireland's needs will come afterwards.  That is not the case.  The United Kingdom will present its suggestion after it triggers Article 50.  Ireland has no advance knowledge as to what that might be.  At that point, negotiations can commence properly and the Opposition will have a very important role, not least through the influence of its own party political groups.  I know, as Chairman of the European affairs committee that many Deputies are active members of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe group, ALDE, which, along with our group, the Green group and the other groups, can make sure Ireland's voice is heard at the EU Parliament, not just by Ministers, but also by other key politicians in the EU political institutions.</p></speech>

I have asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade at various venues if he would come up with a note.  I believe the Taoiseach was indicating that he might be able to supply the House with that.</p></speech>

The asylum process is clearly broken in Ireland and other European countries.  There is a problem in Italy, for example, around the system there.  There is a handful of people coming from Greece but there are clearly problems there.  I, and other Members, meet people every day who are asking about what Ireland is doing with regard to the crisis.  We would like to know of, and have some sort of sense of the difficulties and problems there are, and how we propose to fix them. Other speakers today referenced the meeting we had about Calais and fact that it is burning and the serious concerns we had about that.  One of the questions was whether the Government would agree to relocate unaccompanied children from that site.  Is the Minister of State in a position to address that issue or can he come back to us on it?  There will be an all-party motion hopefully coming to the House and we can get some sort of an agreement on that.</p>  <p>  I am concerned about the African and Asian states with which the EU is negotiating new bilateral agreements on migration.  With which countries are these agreements being discussed?  Are some of these areas war zones - it was suggested that Sudan was one of the areas - or are they countries with disgraceful human rights records where minorities and those who are gay or lesbian face discrimination? Are they countries from where many people are fleeing religious persecution? Could the Minister of State outline which countries these bilateral agreements are with? Reference was made to Afghanistan and the 80,000 Afghani nationals being sent back there.  Can the Minister of State confirm if Afghanistan is one of the countries being looked at?</p>  <p>  The European Commission has launched proposals for a common corporate tax base and a common consolidated corporate tax base.  The context is the renewed push across Europe by people who are concerned about tax avoidance.  I believe there are genuine, well-founded concerns around that.  Many of us have serious concerns about the impact of the proposal on Ireland's right to set its own tax rate.  While the ability to set our own tax rate will not be affected by this proposal the rules of calculation, deductions and exemptions will infringe on the rights of EU member states to set policies.  What are the Government's views on these recent proposals?</p></speech>

We are now approaching November and we still have December coming up.  With people taking much more dangerous routes to get into Europe, unfortunately more and more people are dying.</p></speech>

The <i>LE Samuel Beckett</i>has rescued today 122 people in the Mediterranean Sea.  I know people have been very complimentary about the work of our Naval Service in the Mediterranean Sea and this brings the number rescued up to 14,555.</p><p>Some of the figures we got earlier on migration were not correct as some of the Deputies have slightly inaccurate figures.  With regard to the numbers of people who have come to Ireland through resettlement and relocation, the Government has committed to 4,000 people.  It is fair to say that the numbers coming over have been lower than we would like.  There is a desire in Ireland that we welcome people who are in very difficult situations and that the compassion of the Irish people would be shown through these commitments.  We have committed, through resettlement, to take 780 people before the end of 2017 - to date, 520 in 2016 and an expected 260 in 2017.</p><p>Relocation, which Deputy Eamon Ryan mentioned, has been much more difficult.  So far 69 people have arrived in Ireland, but more are expected to arrive imminently, with perhaps up to 400 people coming in the next two to three months.  The figure of 69 is correct with respect to relocation, but we have done a little better on resettlement.  On adding the two figures, they do not come to 4,000.  It is to be determined whether a number of them will be dealt with through resettlement or relocation.</p> <p> I will leave it there to allow Deputy Ryan ask his question.</p></speech>

In any of his discussions, informal or otherwise, with UK Ministers or officials, did the Minister of State get any sense of what the UK's intention is in that regard?  For example, the Minister of State is au fait with the area of digital policy.  The CJEU has, in effect, been acting as legislature in this area in the absence of clear legislation on complex issues around privacy and copyright.  On all the complex digital policy issues, it is effectively the CJEU that has in a sense set the policy.  We trade with the UK with people buying off the Internet all the time.  If the UK will not recognise the CJEU's jurisdiction in digital services, what arbitration or jurisdiction might it use?  Has it given any indication of what alternative court mechanisms it might have in mind following the comments of the British Prime Minister, Theresa May?</p>  <p>  To take a second example, which is more directly applicable here at home, we are working on the development of an I-SEM, that is, an integrated single electricity market.  The Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Denis Naughten, who is sitting beside the Minister of State, is working on it.  How can we have an all-island electricity market if there is no final court of arbitration should there be a dispute?  How could we prosecute someone in the North or have any such trade arrangements if we do not know what is the final arbitration system?  I am keen to know if there has been any informal indication or sense from the UK authorities, if it is not going to recognise the CJEU, of what court system it will recognise.  How can we trade with a nation where there is no arbitration process to determine disputes?</p></speech>

An arbitration process for disputes would be required.  Neither the collective European Union nor Ireland, as a member state, has got any indication as to what the UK's intention is with respect to the courts and a court system.  It is important to note that all member states agreed the rules, so to speak, or the laws that the European courts, in a general sense, subsequently interpret.  It is not that the courts dictate to member states remotely.  The courts enforce laws and treaties that have been agreed by member states.  Deputy Ryan's question goes to the core of why we need to wait to see what proposals the UK will have to unpick itself from more than four decades of agreements.  To be blunt and to answer the Deputy's question, at its most basic, no, we have not received any indication from the UK of the answer to that particular question at this point.</p>  <p>  There is time for one more question.</p></speech>

I would be interested to know more about it.  The Brexit vote raised questions for the European project in every member state in terms of the threat it poses to the European Union, the democratic deficit and the declining support in some countries and so forth.

Very briefly, on the common consolidated corporate tax base, CCCTB, our priority will be to seek agreement on the proposal that will tackle further hybrid mismatches.  The Commission recently published a series of corporate tax proposals, which include the re-launch of the CCCTB.  The Department of Finance is examining this and I will be happy to deal with it more specifically at the next meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Union Affairs.</p>  <p>  Deputy Haughey is aware that the renewal of Europe was the subject of the leaders' summit in Bratislava.  In parallel to the security, migration and economic crises and now also Brexit, the challenge for the remaining 27 member states is to continue to deal with and not to forget the bread and butter issues that matter to the citizens of Ireland and the other 26 member states, including youth unemployment, in particular, job creation and other social issues.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to have the opportunity to wrap up this debate.  It has been a long and detailed meeting and we can continue the work with the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs.  The European Council meeting had a long and detailed strategic policy discussion on Russia and there has been a need for some time for this discussion, as Members will be aware.  It is important to state from the outset that Ireland wants to have, and wants the European Union to have, a stable and strong relationship with Russia in the long term.  This is in all our interests and consistent with our European values.  Notwithstanding a number of different positions of detail, it is fair to say that this objective is shared and was shared by member states at the European Council meeting.  It is important to stress that there is a strong sense of unity with respect to Russia and that strategic goal over the long term.</p>  <p>  However, there has been quite clearly a serious deterioration in relations between Russia and the European Union in recent years.  The conflict in Ukraine is central to this but there is also the matter of Russia's involvement in the Syrian conflict and the European Council's adopted conclusions reflected this reality.  In March the European Union agreed a set of five principles to guide our relations with Russia and Ireland agrees that these principles remain the structure through which we must move forward.</p>  <p>  On the positive side, one of the key points in the discussion was the recognition that there is some merit in engaging selectively with Russia on individual issues and on specific sectoral areas that are of interest to our European Union.  However, we must be clear that any resumption of selected dialogues should be gradual and used by the EU to seek a change in Russian behaviour.  As I stated, the conflict in eastern Ukraine remains central to this overall relationship.  It is very hard to believe that two years after signing the Minsk agreement we are still here calling for a stable ceasefire in eastern Ukraine.  This remains a matter of deep concern for us all.  We can be very clear on what needs to happen.  The path for a resolution of the conflict is set out clearly in the Minsk agreement.</p><p>The European Union has been totally consistent in linking the economic sanctions imposed in 2014 to the complete implementation of the Minsk accords.  The decision to impose such measures, which also have negative economic consequences for EU member states, is an indication of the seriousness with which we regard Russia's destabilising actions in eastern Ukraine.  There needs to be an urgent de-escalation of hostilities in the conflict zone and Russia needs to use its influence to help ensure the full implementation of the agreements.  Sanctions cannot and should not be amended before this happens. </p> <p> The European Council meeting was clear that the EU will never recognise Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea which took place in 2014.  This will remain an important principle in our approach.  Unfortunately, there has been no major change in policy by Russia or any indication that it is seeking to improve its relationship with the European Union.  While this is highly regrettable, it is also a matter of fact.</p> <p> As the Taoiseach outlined, the position in Syria was also discussed and there was unanimous condemnation of the attacks by the Syrian Government and its allies, most notably Russia, on Aleppo.  We are all shocked and outraged by the appalling scenes of suffering we are witnessing.  The excessive, disproportionate and indiscriminate use of military force against people in Aleppo is a clear violation of international law.  The D&aacute;il heard statements on the conflict in Syria just last week and Ireland continues to call for these atrocities to end, unhindered humanitarian access to be provided and the resumption of a credible political process under United Nations auspices.  It is worth recalling that the European Council's position is that all options remain under consideration if the current atrocities continue, including sanctions if necessary.  Ireland supports this position.</p> <p> The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, has conveyed Ireland's concerns regarding Syria, in particular the city of Aleppo, directly to the Russian ambassador in the clearest possible terms, most recently on 24 October.  I join him in urging Russia to use all of its influence in Syria to end these inhumane actions against a defenceless civilian population.</p> <p> Notwithstanding the appalling circumstances in Syria and our strong condemnation of Russia's role, it is important to note the European Union can take steps to bring about positive change.  The EU is a beacon of hope to many people.  Our values of democracy and tolerance remain a shining light to those suffering oppression and we must remain engaged to help them.  For example, it is of great importance that the EU maintains its support for civil society in Russia, which is now very vulnerable.  To reiterate, while we desire a strong and stable relationship with Russia over the long-term and we must bear in mind this goal in future, we do not expect any significant change in the European Union's approach if Russia does not change its ways.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-10-26a.206" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1234" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="15:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016102600038#LL00800"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 13 together.</p><p>The Government's national broadband plan, NBP, aims to ensure that every citizen and business, regardless of location, has access to a high quality, high-speed broadband service which will stimulate businesses and communities in villages and towns across Ireland.  The NBP is a national plan and aims to connect all premises in Ireland including those on our offshore islands, 66 of which are inhabited and which have a total population of 9,000.  The national broadband plan is being achieved through private investment by commercial telecommunications companies and State intervention in areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.</p><p>The commercial telecommunications sector has invested more than &euro;2 billion in the past four years in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high-speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.  This investment is continuing and approximately 1.3 million premises in Ireland can now get high-speed broadband of at least 30 Mbps.  I will cite some examples.  Virgin Media currently provides services of up to 360 Mbps, which are passing more than 750,000 premises.  Eir&rsquo;s broadband roll-out of services of up to 100 Mbps has passed 1.3 million premises across Ireland.  SIRO, an initiative made possible by Oireachtas legislation introduced by my Department - I remember supporting the Bill in question at the time - is rolling out fibre to the home in  towns across Ireland.  To date, 17 towns and 30,000 premises have been passed by SIRO.  Wireless operators have developed new technologies capable of delivering speeds of 100 Mbps.  Mobile operators are also rolling out 4G services across Ireland.  This is significantly enhancing the mobile broadband experience.</p><p>The high-speed broadband map, available at <i>www.broadband.gov.ie</i>, shows the extent of the State intervention area and the areas targeted for commercial services.  There are approximately 2.3 million premises in the State.  Of these, up to 1.6 million premises are in the commercial area, which is marked in blue on the map, and more than 750,000 premises are in the State intervention area, which is marked in amber on the map.  On 5 July 2016, I announced that my Department had also identified that up to an additional 170,000 premises, which are currently marked in blue on the high-speed broadband map, are unlikely to get access to services.  My Department is conducting further analysis to identify these additional premises, with a view to ensuring they can get a connection either by including them in the formal procurement process or through an alternative mechanism.  This work will conclude in the coming weeks and will be reflected in a further update to the high-speed broadband map.</p><p>The Department is now in a formal procurement process to select a company or companies which will roll out a new high-speed broadband network to all of the premises in the intervention area, which covers 100,000 km of road network and 96% of the land area of Ireland.  Intensive dialogue with bidders is continuing.  Approximately 150 hours of dialogue have taken place and more than 2,000 pages of contract documentation has been provided to the bidders.  The three bidders have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre to the home solution.  Householders and businesses may get speeds not just of 30 Mbps but potentially up to 1,000 Mbps, with businesses potentially availing of symmetrical upload and download speeds.</p><p>Earlier this year, before I came into office, the Department announced it would be June 2017 before contracts were awarded under the national broadband plan.  The bidders in the process have recently indicated that they may need more time to conclude the procurement process.  The timing of each stage of the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors, including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders during the procurement process.  Bidders need adequate time to prepare detailed proposals and their final formal bids and get the relevant shareholder and funding approvals at key stages of the process.  I do not propose to comment any further at this juncture given the sensitivity of discussions in the procurement process.</p></speech>

I am not laying this at the Minister's door as he is a relatively short period in office.  However, he deals with constituents in the same way that I do.  The programme for Government in 2011 stated that 90% of the homes and businesses in Ireland would have fibre broadband by 2015 but that did not happen.  Prior to the 2016 general election, commitments were made to meet the target of 100% coverage by 2020.  The pre-procurement process is underway and contracts were to be awarded by June 2017.  We were told there would be a three-year to five-year timeframe for the ultimate build-out.</p> <p> The Minister can understand how vast groups of people throughout the country do not believe anything that emanates from his Department at this stage and anything he has said today would not give them confidence.  It is a kind of rolling exercise - it depends on how it goes.  The facts are that there are many people in homes and communities who are in dire need of broadband, not just for business, but for education for their families and so on.  We understand the contracts will require nothing more than a document speed of 30 Mbps and an upload speed of 6 Mbps, while the commercial world is offering up to 1,000 Mbps.  Much higher speeds need to enshrined in the tender documents.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-10-26a.209" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1234" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016102600039#MM00200"><p>Deputy Dooley has raised a number of questions.  With regard to the speeds, to the best of my knowledge there is no commercial operator offering 1,000 Mbps at the moment.  What I am telling the Deputy here and now is that, under the national broadband plan, the rural areas throughout this country will potentially be able to get up to 1,000 Mbps because the contractors are telling me they will predominantly provide fibre to the home.  We will see a turnaround in regard to speeds in that people in the most isolated rural communities will have significantly higher broadband speeds than those available in many parts of this city and other urban areas across the country.</p><p>The number in the intervention area at present is 757,000 premises.  We said last June there are potentially another 170,000 homes in the blue area, to which the company said it would have brought high-speed broadband by 31 December.  We now know that is not the case and we are going through that.  This is why, when I met Members of the Oireachtas in the AV room in Leinster House last June, I actively encouraged them to ask the public to go onto our website at <i>www.broadband.gov.ie</i>to see if they are in the blue area, and, if they are not getting or are not promised those speeds by the end of the year, they should let us know.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-10-26a.210" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1291" speakername="Maureen O'Sullivan" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016102600039#MM00300"><p>My question relates to islands in particular.  While I totally accept what the Minister said about the need for rural broadband in order to halt rural decline, the islands are in a particularly precarious position.  We can drive anywhere for classes and education but if people are living on an offshore island, they do not have that access and they are also very dependent on the weather for ferry services.  From my own experience of islands, I know that broadband would make a difference in terms of people's access to classes and further education.  For example, I believe Teagasc is planning to offer a distance education green certificate online and various other colleges, including the Organic College in Limerick, offer a number of online courses.  These would all be of great benefit to people living on the islands, not to mention what could come about for business and employment.</p>  <p>  The children on those islands that only have a primary school and go out on a Monday to second level school are dependent on the ferry.  If there is no ferry, they could continue their education online.  There is also potential for a televised veterinary health service.   When the Minister is looking at the strategy, I ask that there be a specific strategy for the islands.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-10-26a.211" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1234" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016102600039#MM00400"><p>The Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Kyne, has argued with me that we should start with the islands and work back in regard to the rollout of broadband.  I know he is discussing this with the Minister, Deputy Heather Humphreys.</p>  <p>  Let me make it crystal clear that every second level school in Ireland has a minimum of 100 Mbps broadband speed, whether it is on the mainland or on an island.  What is hugely disappointing for me, as the Minister who funded the roll-out of this broadband through my Department, is that a number of the schools are not using it.  I was amazed to learn from talking to some second level schoolteachers during the summer about the lack of engagement in regard to the high-speed broadband that is currently available in our second level schools.  As the Deputy said, this could provide a far broader range of subjects.  On some of the islands, for the first time, second level pupils are getting access to honours maths, a subject that was never available to them before.  I would urge parents and pupils to actively encourage principals and teachers in the schools to use the broadband they have.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-10-26a.212" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1274" speakername="Timmy Dooley" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016102600039#MM00500"><p>I would be slow to lecture the schools in regard to the use of broadband.  The difficulty they have is when the children go home and attempt to do their homework.  If they are a couple of miles from the school, they have very poor coverage when they attempt to connect with the Internet.  I can understand how some principals would not raise expectations because they find that children are not able to participate in the kind of environment they would want.</p>  <p>  We need the Minister to recognise there will be further delays.  He should hard wire into the contract documentation minimum speeds well above what is being talked about.  As I have met them too, I accept the operators are coming to the Minister and offering him this, that and the other, but unless it is a requirement in the contract documentation, there will be no obligation on the operators who ultimately win the contracts to provide those speeds.  It may be available in some areas or at some times of the day, but it will not be available uniformly.  Some 30 Mbps is too slow as an upper limit.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-10-26a.213" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1234" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016102600039#MM00600"><p>First, 30 Mbps will never be and is not, as part of this contract, an upper limit for anything whatsoever.  The contract that will be signed by whoever the successful bidder is, or bidders are, will be future-proofed for the next 25 years.  That is why they have now committed to bringing fibre to the homes of the vast majority of premises across the country.  As a result, we are going to see speeds of up to 1,000 Mbps.  No one in this country is getting that at a domestic level at the moment and it is not being offered by any commercial operator, but we will be able to provide it.  We are future-proofing this contract for the next 25 to 50 years.</p>  <p>  With regard to school premises, there is not much point putting the facilities in place and then taking the attitude that Deputy Dooley is taking.  First, we need to utilise the assets that are there and provide access to online courses in a range of subjects that are not available in those schools at the moment.  There is no reason those schools cannot be opened in the evening as well.  Some of them provide adult education classes and there are opportunities in that regard also.  With the national task force on broadband and wireless, we are improving the existing coverage so people will be able to get services in the short term as well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-10-26a.214" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1291" speakername="Maureen O'Sullivan" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016102600039#MM00700"><p>I hope the Minister will take the advice of the Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, and start with the islands and work from there because they are in a particularly vulnerable position.  We have lost the island community on the Blaskets and there is a danger of losing the community on Tory Island.  We do not want to lose any more.</p>  <p>  In addition to the advantages for residents of the islands, there would also be advantages in regard to tourism.</p><p>The islands are to be found in some of the most beautiful places, although I know that when the Minister was on one of them in the summer, there was very bad weather.  They are places of outstanding natural beauty.  If there was live streaming of events, it would be very encouraging.</p> <p> I have a short anecdote about Cape Clear, the island with which I have the strongest association.  Back in the 1860s, there was a telegraph station on it.  When a ship would arrive from North America, a boat from Cape Clear would pick up a cylinder from it and bring it back to the island.  The information would be sent by telegraph to Cork and then London.  It was said the people on Cape Clear were the first to know about the start of the American Civil War and the assassination of President Lincoln.  As we have come a long way in the meantime, I hope that when the programme is rolled out, there will be a stricter timeframe in order that the islands can have broadband very quickly.</p></speech>

Just because County Roscommon has the worst broadband connection in the country and the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Heather Humphreys, represents County Monaghan which has the second worst broadband connection in the country does not mean that they will be first two counties in which the plan will be rolled out, with everywhere else being left behind.  That will not be the approach taken.  Every single community will have an opportunity.  The Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs is prioritising consideration of how the programme will be rolled out in each county.  Do we focus on primary schools and community centres initially or do we focus on industrial estates or the areas in the vicinity of towns?  These questions are all being teased out and there is engagement with the local authorities and local Leader groups.  I look forward to receiving the submission from the Minister.</p></speech>

I was not furnished with a copy in advance of its publication, which means that I am not in a position to respond comprehensively to its findings.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the current media mergers regime was introduced by the 2014 revision of the Competition Act 2002 and is operated by my Department.  This was in recognition of the fact that having free and pluralistic media was an essential component of a modern representative democracy.  An important part of the current regime is the requirement on the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, to prepare, every three years, a report on the ownership and control arrangements of media businesses in Ireland and to describe any change that may have taken place in the period since any previous report.  In June this year I published the first such report from the BAI entitled, Report on Ownership and Control of Media Businesses in Ireland 2012-2014.  In the report which is available on my Department's website the BAI concludes that there has not been a material reduction in media plurality in the State due to the limited changes in ownership and control in the period 2012 to 2014.</p>  <p>  To answer the Deputy's specific question, I have not read the report.  It was presented by Ms Lynn Boylan, MEP, at the European Parliament at the beginning of October.  It would have been helpful to include a copy when the parliamentary question was submitted.  In fact, my Department was not presented with a copy and had to download it from a news website during the week.  We received it within the past 48 hours and are going through it.  I understand it refers to the domination of two media outlets, one controlled by an individual and the other being RTE.</p></speech>

I received my copy of the report yesterday morning.  It was launched on Monday.  It raises serious concerns about media concentration and notes that Ireland has one of the most concentrated media markets in any democracy.  It points out that media plurality is an essential component of a well functioning democratic society.  As the Minister knows, the media landscape is on the verge of losing more diversity owing to the possible purchase of Celtic Media Group by International News &amp;amp; Media which is controlled or owned by Mr. Denis O'Brien.  Journalists are very concerned.  For a number of years the NUJ has sought the establishment of a commission to investigate these aspects of the media and map the way forward.  In his supplementary reply the Minister will probably refer to the constitutional questions.  I wish to deal with that aspect.</p></speech>

He submitted the question last Wednesday and only received the report yesterday.  Fair dues to him.  He received the report yesterday and I am supposed to respond to it today.  That is the difficulty and it is disappointing.  I have tried to be as open as I can with Members of the House, with whom I have engaged, including the Deputy, on various issues and for whom I have tried to provide as much information as I can within the legal confines I face as Minister.  The task would have been made easier if we had been given a copy of the report in advance.</p>  <p>  On the issue of constitutionality, as raised by the Deputy, it is correct to say an issue arises.  It was debated in the House in 2014 when we considered the Competition and Consumer Protection Bill.  One cannot deal with the issue of retrospective legislation without great difficulty.  On top of this, there is the issue of property rights.  I realise the two legal firms involved, one based in the United Kingdom and the other in Northern Ireland, have dismissed this issue, but it is complex.  There is a myriad of legal complexities involved.  One cannot just dismiss the Constitution.</p></speech>

I had hoped the Minister had a copy, but I recognise he has not had access to it.  We will correct this.</p>  <p>  With regard to retrospective legislation and the Constitution, Article 43 is the article to which the Minister alludes.  It states exercising the right to private ownership ought to be regulated by the principles of social justice.  Article 43.2.2&deg; states: "The State, accordingly, may as occasion requires delimit by law the exercise of the said rights with a view to reconciling their exercise with the exigencies of the common good".  The provision is qualified by the recognition of the common good.  The Constitution is very clear.  If it is not, we can change it.  Has the Minister sought the opinion of the Attorney General on this issue?  The former Deputy and Attorney General Senator Michael McDowell has expressed a view that is different from that of the Minister.  If the Minister did obtain an opinion from the Attorney General, what was it?  If Article 43 of the Constitution is a problem, it should be noted that we have had referendums on issues that some people might not count as being too important.  Having proper, functioning and open media is key in a democracy.  There is nothing stopping us from holding a referendum on this issue.  The Constitution was used as an excuse by the previous Government in the case of upward-only rent reviews.  The Minister should not use it as an excuse in this case.</p></speech>

When the issue was debated in the House in 2014, there was no significant Sinn F&eacute;in intervention on the issues highlighted in the report produced by Ms Lynn Boylan, MEP.  Deputy Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n did make reference on Second Stage to the need for diversity and plurality, but there was no amendment tabled in that regard.</p><p>Reference was made on Committee Stage to cross-ownership of the media, particularly to the setting of hard thresholds on cross-ownership.  At the time, the Minister, Deputy Bruton, responded that the advisory group on media mergers, whose recommendations preceded the Bill, believed that specifying metrics in legislation would be fraught with risk.  A large number of issues regarding the passage of this legislation were debated not so long ago.  The legislation is now in place.  There is a mechanism through the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland to review on an ongoing basis the mergers that take place and report back.  I published the first such report in June of this year.

There are rumours in the air - rumours usually have some foundation to them - that it is possible that An Post is in trouble financially.  I ask the Minister to make a statement on the matter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-10-26a.234" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1234" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="16:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016102600041#OO00900"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 12 together.  I thank both Deputies for tabling the questions.</p><p>  As Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, I have responsibility for the postal sector, including the governance of An Post, to ensure the company is fully compliant with the code of practice for the governance of State bodies and the governance functions included in the statutory framework underpinning An Post.</p><p>Operational matters and the role of developing commercial strategies for the post office network are a matter for the board and the management of An Post and not one in which I, as Minister, have a statutory function.</p><p>It is Government policy that An Post remains a strong, viable company and in a position to provide a high quality, nationwide postal service and that it maintains a nationwide customer-focused network of post offices in the community.  However, the postal sector as a whole is undergoing systemic change as a result of the growth of the digital economy.  The continuing decline in mail volumes, combined with the ongoing impact of e-substitution on retail businesses transacted through the post office network, is a significant challenge for the company and has an impact on its financial well-being.</p><p>In recognition of the changing commercial environment within which An Post operates, my predecessor established the Post Office Network Business Development Group last year, the remit of which was to examine the potential from existing and new Government and commercial business that could be transacted through the post office network.  The final report of the Post Office Network Business Development Group, which was published in January this year, represents an important step towards greater financial sustainability for the post office and the wider network.  On foot of the reconfiguration of Government Departments earlier this year, responsibility for the post office network transferred to the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  In my role regarding the corporate governance of An Post, I have impressed upon the company the vital importance of giving its full support and assistance to the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, as work is progressed on bringing about new opportunities for the nationwide network of post offices.</p><p>Managing the scale of the challenge facing An Post will require a focus on innovation and new business models by the company as well as the development of new commercial strategies.  In so far as the commercial and operational activities of the company are concerned, the board and management of the company are constantly working to ensure that the services the company provides are developed and delivered to meet the needs of its customers.  As a shareholder, however, I have a strong interest in the commercial and financial position of the company and I regularly liaise with the company in this regard.  The future sustainability of An Post and its relevance to consumers is recognised as an important priority for all involved.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-10-26a.235" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1274" speakername="Timmy Dooley" time="16:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016102600041#OO01000"><p>The fact is that the Government has continuously dragged its heels in announcing a sustainable plan for the future of the post office network.  The programme for Government committed to act swiftly on the recommendations of the Post Office Business Development Group and expand provision into such areas as motor tax and the new payment account system.  The Minister is a signatory to the programme for Government.  He entered into discussions with Fine Gael about the creation of a programme for Government.  He represented rural Deputies, as a result of which he finds himself in Cabinet, so I do not accept that he can somehow wash his hands of responsibility to the post office network and just talk about the corporate responsibility, financial viability and position of An Post as the shareholder of the company.  That is fine.  That is his fiduciary duty as a Minister acting on behalf of the State as the shareholder.  However, he is a signatory to the programme for Government and a Minister with a responsibility to the wider rural community based on his negotiations with Fine Gael.  I put it to him that it is incumbent on him to act in good faith on behalf of the people of the rural areas who believed this Government was serious about acting in a manner that would protect the network as it currently exists.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-10-26a.236" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1234" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="16:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016102600041#OO01100"><p>At the end of September, there were 1,127 outlets, comprising 51 company and 1,076 contract-operated post offices, and 113 postal agencies throughout the country.  The implementation of the recommendations of the Post Office Development Network Group falls under the remit of the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Humphreys.  However, I am conscious of the issues involved here.  Deputy Dooley is correct that this issue affects rural and urban communities across this country, because the urban communities have lost their post office networks as well, but there will not be a post office network for anyone if we cannot secure the long-term financial viability of the overall company.  The difficulty with the overall company is that it is managing a significant decline in mail volumes.  Mail volumes have declined by 30% since 2009.  The projected rate of fall in mail volumes between now and 2020 is 5% per annum.  Every 1% drop represents a &euro;5 million drop in revenue.  The reality is that the post office network and the other commercial operations of the company are profitable and the mail sector is the one that is losing money.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-10-26a.237" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1367" speakername="Br&iacute;d Smith" time="16:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016102600041#OO01200"><p>I would like to respond to the Minister on the question of the post office network losing custom to e-business.  That is true.  There is no doubt that when one looks at one's letter box, one sees how much less is coming in.  However, what the Minister has just said is like saying "I will split your head and give you a plaster" because at the same time as we acknowledge that e-business is taking over the actual post business, the Department of Social Protection has removed the option of payment of cheques through post offices.  There is an insistence by many Government Departments that payments to them are made by bank draft rather than, as happened in the past, giving people the option of using a post office draft.  Therefore, on the one hand, we are trying to keep the post offices viable and, on the other, Government Departments are removing business from them.  Where is the progress on the recommendations made in the care model for a new model of community banking?  When I lived in Germany there was a community bank called Sparkasse through which all workers got paid, regardless of where they lived.  It had branches in every village, every town and every corner, and ordinary people used them all the time.  They were basically a developed form of post office.  Where is the investigation into bringing that kind of viability to An Post which would actually work and retain the post offices, both rural and urban?</p></speech>

She is right in saying we need to look at new innovative products that can be developed and marketed by An Post.  The two big strengths An Post has are its name recognition and the fact that the organisation is trusted by the public, particularly older people.  It also has a strength not only in its brand, but also its nationwide reach.  It brings vans and postal workers to every single premises in Ireland five days a week, 52 weeks of the year.</p><p>It has been suggested that there is a question mark over the universal service provision, that is the five-day a week delivery to every address in the State.  I want to make it crystal clear to everyone in the House and outside it that I will not be changing the designation of An Post as the universal service provider or changing the obligation to deliver post every single working day, as set out in section 16 of the Postal Services Act 2011.</p> <p> We need to explore options such as the one Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith mentioned to ensure the long-term commercial viability of the company-----</p></speech>

I am sure the Minister would accept that the loss of the post office in such communities would signal the death knell of those communities and it would only be a matter of time before other services are hollowed out.</p>  <p>  We need Government action to identify the kinds of State services that can be delivered through the post office network.  There is no point in doing it when it is too late.  As the post offices become less viable, once these people retire the positions will not be taken up by others and the long-term future of rural Ireland will be seriously eroded.  Time is of the essence here.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-10-26a.243" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1234" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="16:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016102600042#PP00500"><p>The Deputy is correct.  This is why I was one of the few Members who bothered to make a submission to the Kerr report.  In my submission I highlighted that point and gave specific examples of State business that is not currently going through the post office network and that could be put through that network.  While there is a lot of wringing of hands over the post office network, it was disappointing that so few submissions were made by people in this House who seem to be concerned today over the viability of the post office network.</p>  <p>  We need to look at new services that can be done there.  The Deputy is correct that there is a reduction in the number of transactions within existing post office services.  If we stand still they will continue to reduce and put further pressure on the viability of many of our sub-post offices.  We need to look at new and additional services that ensure the State operates far more efficiently by diverting business-----</p></speech>

It is not just a question of a falling volume of mail; that is being compounded by the insistence of Departments to reduce Government transactions in post offices.  Together, these are putting huge pressure on the viability of An Post, while at the same time the Government insists that all these services be outsourced and liberalised.  That cannot be done.</p>  <p>  The third thing that kicked in here is the commitment in the programme for Government to investigate new models of community banking.  The speed with which the State was able to respond to the banking collapse that led to a bailout of &euro;64 billion by the citizens of the State was extraordinary.  Overnight the Government could pass legislation to save those banks.  Since the Government has been formed, to my knowledge there has been one meeting of the committee chaired by the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, and since then nothing has been done about it.  There has been no update on investigating a simple form of community banking and my guess is that is because the big banks will not tolerate it.  That is the kind of move we need in order to sustain the viability of this company.  The foot-dragging is doing nobody any good.</p></speech>

I apologise to her because I am trying to answer all the questions here.</p>  <p>  There has been a difficulty with instructions given to various Departments which has at least not helped the maintenance of the volume of transactions through the post office network.  I spoke directly to the Minister for Social Protection on the issue.  As the Deputy will be aware, before the summer the Minister for Social Protection issued an instruction to his departmental staff regarding the use or not of the post office network.  That has led to an improvement there.</p>  <p>  Work is ongoing on the basic bank account.  That will provide new and additional services to the post office network across the country.  There is the opportunity to expand that along the lines the Deputy mentioned.</p>  <p>  I believe there is an opportunity to outsource some administrative work, which is currently being done quite inefficiently in Departments, through the sub-post office network.  That was the basis of the submission I made to the Bobby Kerr report.  My submission is available online along with everything else.</p></speech>

Questions Nos. 14 and 17 are being taken together, so she is doing quite well today.</p><p>The Paris agreement aims to hold the increase in global average temperature to well below 2&deg; C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5&deg; C above pre-industrial levels.  It also aims to increase the ability to adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change and foster climate resilience.</p><p>The agreement puts in place the necessary framework for all countries to take ambitious action, as well as providing for transparency to ensure that all countries can have confidence in each other&rsquo;s efforts.  The agreement aims to tackle 95% of global emissions through 188 intended nationally-determined contributions, INDCs, which will set out how parties intend to meet their own emission reduction targets.  The Paris agreement itself does not set specific targets for CO2 emissions.  Ireland will contribute to the agreement via the INDC tabled by the EU on behalf of its member states, which commits the EU to a 40% reduction in EU-wide emissions by 2030 compared with 1990.  The specific details of the contribution to be made by each member state to this overall ambition remains to be finalised and Ireland is currently examining proposals made by the European Commission in this regard.</p> <p> The extent of the challenge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, in line with the Paris agreement and other international commitments, is well understood by the Government, as reflected in the national policy position on climate action and low carbon development, published in April 2014, and now underpinned by the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015, which was enacted in December of last year.  The national policy position provides a high-level policy direction for the adoption and implementation by Government of plans to enable the State to move to a low-carbon, climate-resilient economy by 2050.  Statutory authority for the plans is set out in the Act.</p> <p> In accordance with section 4 of the Act, and in line with responsibilities assigned to me as Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, I intend to make a draft national mitigation plan available for public consultation by the end of the year followed by submission of a final plan to Government for approval at the latest by June 2017.  The preparation of the national mitigation plan is statutorily designed to be a whole-of-Government approach to tackling greenhouse gas emissions.  In particular, Ministers with responsibility for the largest-emitting sectors, namely, agriculture, transport, electricity and the built environment, are required by Government to develop sectoral mitigation measures for inclusion in the plan.</p> <p> A key element of the development process of the national mitigation plan is the identification of the most cost-effective measures with the optimal mitigation potential, which safeguard Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness and ideally support sustainable economic growth.  Work is ongoing on this complex task by all relevant Departments and will culminate in a master list of potential measures being produced, from which the most appropriate measures will be selected for inclusion in the national mitigation plan.  As this process is yet to be finalised, detailed costings are currently unavailable.  In recognising the whole-of-Government approach under way, it is noted that the cyclical process of preparing appropriate policies and measures for both 2020 and 2030 will require a range of budgetary measures across a range of relevant Government Departments over the period concerned.</p> <p> My Department has received an allocation of &euro;100 million for energy projects in the estimates for 2017, the bulk of which will be allocated to energy efficiency and renewable energy, which represents an increase of  35% on last year's allocation.  My Department will target the upgrading of up to 30,000 homes in 2017 that will, together with the &euro;22 million retrofitting fund announced by my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, for local authority dwellings, have a significant impact on reducing carbon emissions as well as supporting the creation of jobs in the sector.  About 4% of the total housing stock will be upgraded in 2017.</p></speech>

I wish to reiterate the urgency of action needed on climate change.  I am on the Joint Committee for Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  From what I have seen both at the committee yesterday and in the past, there is double-speak going on.  On the one hand, we acknowledge verbally in our dialogue that we have a problem.  We have had a 1.38&deg; Celsius increase in temperature this year, which is the highest on record.  According to the Paris deal, we are to stay below 2&deg; Celsius, but we are hurtling in the opposite direction.  We are in a very serious situation.  When we compare the budget which has been given to deal with this situation with all the sweetheart deals that have been given to developers and landlords to encourage private development to so-called &quot;deal&quot; with the housing crisis, it leaves a lot to be desired.  I do not believe, as the Minister tried to argue, that the two things complement each other.  <i>Au contraire</i>.  What we are actually doing is assisting the heating of the planet to the detriment of what goes on here.  In my next minute, I will get to the question of land usage and what we do with our bogs, trees, etc.</p></speech>

That includes public and private buildings.  We will be putting people in new houses that are far more energy-efficient under the current building regulations than the building regulations that would have applied heretofore.  The energy efficiency of those buildings is far greater.  The amount of energy that is used to heat them is far less and, therefore, there are less emissions.  The focus at the moment has to be on the three big challenges that we have, none of which are actually carbon dioxide.  They are hydrofluorocarbon, HFC, black carbon and methane.  They are the ones that are warming up our environment at a rapid pace at the moment.  They are going to become a far bigger challenge between now and 2035 than the challenges that we have to face by 2050.  There was the Kigali agreement on HFCs last week, which is going to deal with and tackle that issue.  We now need to look at the other two issues as well.</p></speech>

In yesterday's committee debate on land usage, there was a real contradiction in what the committee was being told by the Department.  On the one hand, there is this ambition to adhere to the EU regulations on land usage and to use it better for absorbing carbon, and on the other hand, there is great excitement when it comes to CETA or trade deals with Egypt, for example, for live cattle.  How do we get live cattle reared in Ireland on to boats to transport them to Canada or Egypt?  We have to produce and grow them here.  That leads to a huge increase in methane, which is one of the problems we have.  I am told that the average farm has 16 cattle.  That gives an indication of the size of the big ones.  When one looks at the graph, there are a huge number of ranchers in Leinster and Munster producing incredible amounts of beef.  That has an impact on the climate.  This is what I mean about the contradiction.  On the one hand, we are saying that we are doing something and, on the other hand, we are increasing agricultural beef production.  There is no joined-up thinking-----</p></speech>

We have the best carbon footprint for milk production anywhere in the EU.  There are less carbon emissions from dairy production in Ireland than in anywhere else in the EU.  We are equal to one other member state.  With regard to beef, we are the fifth-best in the EU and are working towards becoming not only EU leaders but world leaders in this.  Only last month, I had a detailed bilateral discussion with my colleague from New Zealand on this very issue.  We can have beef produced in other parts of the world in a far less efficient manner that is transported either on the hoof or in carcass form, or we can actually produce it quite efficiently here in Ireland.  Can agriculture help in regard to the fight against climate change?  Yes, it can.  What we want to see is a situation in which our food production in this country is carbon neutral.  By working through the forestry sector, through better land use, through better management of agricultural slurries and so forth, and through more efficient rearing of animals that makes agricultural production itself far more efficient and profitable in returns to the farmer, we can reduce emissions.</p></speech>

I will go all day at this.  Let me go over it again.  The Minister should be concerned about the budget, but he does not seem to be.  He seems to be happy enough that he has &euro;500,000 for a national dialogue.</p><p>There were 15,000 young people on the streets protesting during the Paris deal on climate change.  They have had the dialogue and they know what they are talking about.  They are extraordinarily concerned about the future of the planet.  The &euro;24 million on energy efficiency and renewables will go nowhere towards having an impact. There is &euro;2 million for better homes energy, &euro;4 million for better energy communities and &euro;8 million for warmth and well-being schemes.  This just is not sufficient to take this seriously.  Where does the Minister think he can get additional resources?  Has he thought of looking at the fact our pension reserves give a chunk of money to oil companies and to researching companies which extract gas and oil instead of trying to reduce such activities?</p></speech>

Now we need to convert it into action and have real engagement with communities throughout the country rather than the approach that has been taken until now to lecture people on it.</p>  <p>  With regard to the budget, &euro;100 million was invested in energy projects through the Department, with &euro;63 million for the better energy homes and communities scheme, &euro;9 million for electric vehicles, &euro;7 million on renewable the heat incentive scheme, &euro;111 million on the GLAS scheme, &euro;112 million on the afforestation scheme and &euro;52 million on the beef genomic scheme.  A total of &euro;430 million has been allocated to the OPW with regard to flooding and &euro;22 million in the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government for the retrofitting of local authority homes.  Relief for the VRT on electric vehicles has been extended for another five years.  The VRT on hybrid vehicles has been extended for another two years.  The natural gas used in vehicles has been reduced to the EU minimum.  We have introduced reductions through the abolition of carbon tax with regard to biomass fuels.</p></speech>

I will hold the Minister to this for as long as I can stay in the House to do so, and I will keep a close eye on it.  It was a big mistake to privatise broadband, but if the Minister is going to do it and put the money into climate action then let us see the colour of this money.</p>  <p>  We need a plan for public transport to see it is not as a burden but an opportunity to stop hiving off State routes to top private operators.  As an essential part of any plan to deal with climate change we have to get carbon emissions and cars off the road.  We also need to think strongly about our targets.  We are way off target and the EPA report yesterday, just so people do not get too alarmed about it, is a disaster.  We will be 14% below our targets by 2020.  This is a very worrying development for us.  There is much to be addressed.</p></speech>

The draft will be completed before the end of the year and will go for public consultation.  It will be finalised next year.  This will set down the blueprint and not just in my Department with regard to energy.  It will also involve the built environment, with regard to the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government and the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and will also involve transport and agriculture.  The capital plan that will be finalised next year will have to feed into this.  As part of the discussions in the run-up to the budget this year, I made it clear to the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, that the capital plan will have to reflect what we are doing with regard to the mitigation plan.  Yes, we have big challenge ahead of us.  There is no doubt about this, but we have made start this year.  Everyone is always looking at the glass as half empty.  Let us start to look at it as half full.  We have been a world leader with regard to hydrofluorocarbons.  We were one of the first countries to put forward money on this.  We are a world leader with regard to our dairy industry.  We will be a world leader with regard to our beef industry.  We are engaging with countries such as Tanzania, Costa Rica and New Zealand to see how we can improve agriculture efficiency and reduce emissions, not just for ourselves but for farmers throughout the world, particularly in the developing world where there will be a huge challenge post-2030.</p></speech>

There are not many, and I am not too sure whether we are leading in some of the areas he mentioned, but an area where I know we are not leading but falling dramatically behind is that of demand management efficiency and domestic home management energy systems.  We have no smart metering programme roll-out ready.  We have been working on this.  I remember working on it seven or eight years ago, when it was first thought about and ready to go, but for five years nothing has happened.  Demand management and efficiency saving is the first step.  What are our plans for smart metering?  When will we roll it out?

The EU's third energy package sets out the need to roll out smart meters based on economic assessment and provides that in the case of electricity, "where roll-out of smart meters is assessed positively, at least 80% of consumers shall be equipped with intelligent metering systems by 2020".  In the case of gas, there is no specific target, but any roll-out is subject to economic assessment.  The key determinant of the scale, scope and timing of the roll-out of smart meters is a cost benefit analysis that is being developed by the CER.  The results of this cost benefit analysis are expected in the first half of 2017.</p>  <p>  Previous statements had indicated that the roll-out of smart meters would likely commence, at the earliest, in late 2018.  The go-live date of smart services would follow once a significant number of smart meters have been rolled out.  The Commission for Energy Regulation commenced a replanning process of the national smart metering programme in July 2016 with ESB Networks, Gas Networks Ireland and other relevant stakeholders in order to bring more clarity and certainty regarding the timelines for implementation of the programme.  This replanning process, which will conclude later this year, may lead to the timelines being extended.</p>  <p>  The costs of rolling out smart meters will be included in the costs of distribution networks in the same way as other infrastructure investments are paid for.  These costs are approved by the regulator and charged by ESB Networks and Gas Networks Ireland to energy supply companies.  The energy supply companies generally include these costs in the standing charges on customer bills.</p></speech>

We rolled out a very large testing scheme and the ESB had all the factual analysis.  There is an endless amount of economic analysis.  It needs leadership now.  It needs political leadership to kick the system out of the inertia, conservativism, lack of ambition and lack of energy and start making this happen.  We are in severe danger.  We were ahead of the game seven or eight years ago but we are now falling way behind.  It needs more than just waiting for the energy regulator to do yet another study to assess another study.  This has been studied to death, internationally and here at home, for the past five or six years.  There is an opportunity for us to get the funding that will not now go to the UK.  The European Investment Bank and others spent approximately &euro;3.5 billion in clean energy lending to the UK which will now not go there.  If we had ready-to-go big scalable projects in clean energy and efficiency we could get funding from the EIB.  We could kickstart our economy and save our emissions but we are not doing it.  We are falling way behind.  A country that has all of the IT businesses and a good distribution and transmission system should be ahead of the game on this.  It is not good enough to say we have to do more studies.  It is time for us to start doing something.</p></speech>

The results of the updated cost benefit analysis, which is available on the CER website, shows that net present value is minus &euro;59 million for electricity meters only.</p><p><i>5 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p> <p>Where electricity and gas meters are included, the net current value is estimated at minus &euro;54 million.  The most recent cost benefit analysis, therefore, was marginally negative.  Technology has changed.  One of the most significant changes which was not envisaged when the Deputy was Minister is the Internet of Things.  Only last month I launched one of the first national networks in Kilbegley, south Roscommon in my constituency.  It will dramatically change how we consider smart metering and smart devices.  I had an interesting conversation with Glen Dimplex - I am sure the Deputy had one also - about the way it was developing products.  All this needs to be considered before a decision is made.  There is no point in using yesterday's rather than tomorrow's technology.</p></speech>

The cost benefit analysis that was finally dragged out of the system in 2013 was known about as far back as 2009.  A greater cost benefit needs to be taken into account.  We are breaking through the ceiling in the context of our emissions and nowhere near our targets, but we are missing out on an economic opportunity.  The big message for those who always engage in the cost accounting analysis on every line is that they should think of the bigger picture.  The technological industrial revolution is taking place in the interface between digital and clean energy technology.  We have every reason to be the best in the world in this area and sell that expertise to the rest of the world, but that cannot be done if the basic technological elements such as smart meters are not in place in order that other companies can use their products in innovative ways and the Internet of Things can kick off.  If the State is not monitoring or measuring or putting a price on products, it will not happen.  We will probably not do it until the next decade, which will probably be a decade late in grabbing the opportunity.  That is what the Minister needs to overcome.  He should tell the regulator and the Department to make this happen.</p></speech>

It has changed dramatically in the past decade.  I want to be sure that if we charge every ESB customer &euro;400 for a smart meter that, first, they will benefit from them and, second, that it is the most cost effective way of making this investment.  I want to establish whether there are other more efficient ways by using new technology.  That analysis will be completed in the next few weeks.  When the commission publishes the findings, we can examine the approach we are taking.  The Deputy is also correct about the investment being made.  I want an answer to the question of whether it should be used for this or some other technology before I proceed.  Smart metering could provide huge opportunities and the type of meter is crucially important to the decisions we will take not just for now but for the next decade and the following decade.</p></speech>

In December 2015 the procurement for the State intervention commenced.  It aims to deliver networks with at least 30 Mbps download and 6 Mbps upload speeds to all premises within the intervention area.  Intensive dialogue with bidders is continuing and the three bidders have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution.  Householders and businesses will get speeds not just of 30 Mbps but potentially 1,000 Mbps, with businesses potentially availing of symmetrical upload and download speeds.</p>  <p>  In accordance with commitments in A Programme for Partnership Government, the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Rural, Regional and Gaeltacht Affairs is leading in the establishment of two regional action groups to help to accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once contracts have been awarded.</p>  <p>  The commercial telecommunications sector has invested more than &euro;2 billion in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecommunications services.  Approximately 1.3 million premises in Ireland can now get high speed broadband and at least one mobile operator is delivering 4G services to more than 90% of the population. </p>  <p>  In July I established a mobile phone and broadband task force with my colleague, the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Rural, Regional and Gaeltacht Affairs, to address immediate issues related to the quality of mobile phone and broadband coverage.  I expect the task force to report by the end of 2016.  In addition, I recently signed regulations allowing ComReg to proceed with an early 2017 auction of the 3.6 GHz radio spectrum band, to provide for an 86% increase in the total spectrum available for mobile and fixed wireless services.  I have also secured &euro;8 million for RTE in my Department's Estimate for 2017 which will allow it to free up the 700 MHz spectrum band.  ComReg expects to auction this spectrum which will provide for significantly enhanced mobile coverage.  The 700 MHz band is particularly suited to rural environments as the signal can travel long distances.  I also intend to discuss with ComReg the possibility of including elements within the auction process to ensure black spots, particularly in rural areas, will be identified and adequately addressed.  These initiatives should assist in significantly improving the quality of broadband and mobile phone services across the country, putting Ireland to the forefront internationally in terms of connectivity.</p></speech>

To what extent does he expect to compete with best practice internationally when the current investment programme is completed, both in respect of broadband and mobile telephony?  The quality of the service provided is embarrassing.  Adequate evidence has been available for a long time of the areas with poor service which require urgent upgrading.  How is it planned to integrate the new services, when available, with medical and educational services to their mutual benefit?</p></speech>

We will have the most modern network in the world when the investment programme is completed.  The national broadband plan provides that Ireland will be the first country to bring fibre broadband to the home extensively in rural areas.  This has not been done anywhere else in the world to date.  It will deliver speeds up to 1,000 Mbps to homes and businesses throughout the country.</p>  <p>  On mobile telephony services, we intend to use the 700 MHz spectrum to focus on a geographic rather than a population basis.  The intention is to roll out 5G mobile services on this spectrum, which will mean that Ireland will probably be one of the first countries in the world to roll it out on this basis.  At the conclusion of the investment programme, Ireland will be a world leader in this regard.</p>  <p>  We are focused on what we can do practically in the short term, which is why we are not waiting for the mobile phone and broadband task force to complete its report at the end of the year.  As suggestions and proposals are made, we are engaging with solutions.  I have announced a number of decisions, including the release of the 3.6 GHz spectrum.  We will continue to do this between now and the end of the year.</p></speech>

Will the regulator become more active than in the past, with a view to encouraging service providers to ensure the continued provision of the highest quality service?</p><p>Despite numerous attempts to encourage it in the past, it has been impossible for many of us to penetrate the wall of bureaucracy that seems to exist.  Accordingly, we end up having extra participants in particular networks, leading to a lower quality of service.  Can we be assured this will be addressed in this context?</p></speech>

People living in Armagh city can see if there is one particular mobile provider they should not use if they want 3G services.  People will be able to do that in every single community.

The PSO levy consists of a set of support schemes designed to facilitate the national electricity policy objectives for renewables, indigenous fuels and security of supply.  The PSO has supported the connection of over 2,000 MW of renewable energy to the electricity grid.  It will continue to support the development of renewable energy to ensure we can meet our target of increasing renewable electricity penetration to 40% by 2020.</p><p>Recent international studies have shown that Ireland has had one of the lowest per unit supports for renewable energy in the European Union.</p><p>The calculation of the level of the PSO is a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER.  The total PSO levy for 2016-17 is &euro;392.4 million.  This equates to less than &euro;6 per month for domestic consumers and represents an increase of less than &euro;1 per month.  The biggest drivers for the proposed levy increase are the lower predicted wholesale market electricity price and increased deployment of renewables.</p><p>I am conscious of the impacts of energy costs on industry and households alike.  As the wholesale electricity price is falling, this should be passed onto domestic electricity customers and more than outweigh the levy increase.  In this regard, I am pleased to see that most electricity suppliers have recently reduced their standard prices.</p><p>Customers can also avail of discounts available, either by contacting their supplier directly, or by using the price comparison websites accredited by CER, such as <i>bonkers.ie</i>or <i>switcher.ie</i>, to switch to discounted tariffs.  A customer consuming the average amount of electricity could save over &euro;200 per annum by switching suppliers.</p></reply>

These are footed by the consumer at the end of the day.  This is at a time when there has been a significant collapse in wholesale gas prices.  The Minister is aware consumers are not seeing the equivalent cuts in their electricity and gas bills from the main retail operators.  While he is correct that wholesale gas prices decreased by 29% in 2015, the retail equivalent decrease was just 5%, a mere &euro;50 reduction per annum.  Any retail energy bill decreases will be negated by the planned PSO levy increase of over 30% this October.</p>  <p>  I agree with the PSO approach and support for the renewable energy sector.  I also acknowledge the necessity of getting tariffs in place to encourage the solar sector to become part of that mix of renewables.  Does the Minister believe the CER is sufficiently empowered with enforcement and sanctioning powers regarding the wholesale electricity and gas market to ensure consumers are getting a fair price?</p></speech>

The wholesale price of electricity makes up 50% of a bill, while the network charges make up 30%.  That would be a higher factor than would be the case in most other EU countries, purely because we have a dispersed rural population.  Up to 30% of our population is on 97% of the country&rsquo;s landmass.  Due to that, the distribution charges are significantly higher than in other parts of the European Union.  The retail margin the companies have is between 10% and 12%.</p><p>The advantage with the fall in the wholesale price is retailers will pass on those reductions to consumers.  However, because of that, we have to compensate the wind operators for that fall in the wholesale price, which, in turn, leads to an increase in the PSO.  This has increased by &euro;10.80 to &euro;70.80 per annum.  I encourage people to shop around.  If they go to <i>bonkers.ie</i>or <i>switcher.ie</i>, they can save up to &euro;200, which would more than negate the cost of the PSO.</p></speech>

I am not calling into question its directors or anyone else involved in the agency.  Is it adequately resourced and appropriately configured from a legislative point of view in challenging the network operator?  If the Minister is suggesting that is where a large percentage of the cost is, then consequent reductions in the wholesale price will not be passed on if a large portion of the cost is a function of the network provision.</p></speech>

Electricity generated from burning peat releases at least twice as much greenhouse gases as coal.  That said, the ESB&rsquo;s coal-fired power station at Moneypoint is Ireland&rsquo;s largest single source of carbon dioxide emissions.  If we are to meet our binding climate change mitigation targets - I am referring to the 2030 ones, as we will fall well short of the 2020 ones by 12 million tonnes of CO2 - we must cease destroying the environment with these immensely damaging power generation methods and move wholeheartedly into wind, solar and tidal energy.  What are the Minister&rsquo;s plans for these areas?</p></reply>

This is reflected in the national policy position on climate action and low carbon development, published in April 2014, and now underpinned by the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015, enacted in December 2015.  The national policy position provides a high-level policy direction for the adoption and implementation by the Government of plans to enable the State to move to a low-carbon economy by 2050.</p><p>Statutory authority for the plans is set out in the Act.<br/><br/>The national policy position establishes a long-term objective to pursue substantial decarbonisation of the energy, transport and built environment sectors, as well as pursuing carbon neutrality in the agriculture and land sector.  Transition to low carbon electricity generation will be key to successfully meeting this objective.  Work is ongoing in this context in my Department, with the development of sectoral mitigation measures for the electricity generation sector for inclusion in the first statutory national mitigation plan.  The first iteration of this plan will place particular focus on tracking implementation of measures already under way, putting in place the necessary measures to address the challenge to 2020 and also on planning ahead to ensure that beyond this appropriate policies and measures are in place.<br/><br/>A Programme for a Partnership Government sets out the commitment to establish a national dialogue on climate change.  There is also a specific commitment that the national dialogue on climate change will identify the most suitable replacement low carbon power generation technology in anticipation of Moneypoint, the only coal burning plant in Ireland, coming to the end of its operating life in its current configuration.  In this regard, my Department is reviewing existing analysis and studies carried out on Moneypoint in preparation for an initial discussion within the framework of the national dialogue on climate change, which will examine a range of issues, including technology options, security of supply, competitiveness and sustainability.  My Department is currently assessing how best to optimise the processes that will underpin the national dialogue, including scale and format.<br/><br/><font color="#0D0D0D"> The White Paper on energy policy sets out a vision to decarbonise the energy sector in Ireland in the coming decades which will ultimately involve moving away from higher emission fuel types to lower emissions fuels or zero carbon renewable energy technologies.</font></p></reply>

We do not even meet our EU regulations.  The recent decision to delay the implementation of the EU air pollution limits for Moneypoint is illustrative of the level of willingness to tackle these issues.  I am sure the Minister is aware of the recent court decision on Edenderry and the likelihood that Bord na M&oacute;na's planning permission will be overturned because An Bord Plean&aacute;la did not take on board the fact that 1.2 million tonnes per annum of peat was being burned at that plant, which information should have been included in the environmental assessment.  I understand there are approximately 250 jobs at stake.  Bord na M&oacute;na made over &euro;50 million in 2014 and &euro;33 million in 2015.  As such, it has money to invest in renewable energy.  Has the installation of solar panels in the bogs been considered?  Has a cost benefit analysis been done on the possibility of moving in that direction?  There is much talk about plans but we are not doing a whole lot yet and so we are missing our targets.</p></speech>

To put things in perspective, there are 1,443 jobs in the midlands associated with Bord na M&oacute;na and the three peat-fired power stations in Lanesboro, Shannonbridge and Edenderry.  The Edenderry plant is the first to come before the planning process.  There are many families who are reliant on employment in the three plants involved.  The maintenance of solar panels would involve only a handful of those people.  What then are we to do with the remainder of the people?  Do we throw them on the scrap heap?  Are we to declare the midlands a no-go area in terms of employment?  We are currently working on a bio-energy plan that will result in the conversion of the three plants to renewable sources of fuel, which will be biomass fuel.</p></speech>

We are trying to sustain employment.  There is no point talking about closing plants until such time as we have in place an alternative.  There reaction thus far to proposals put forward by environmental groups has been negative because people tend to forget that we are talking about human beings, families and lives.  We need to take a balanced approach to this issue.  As Minister, I will take a responsible approach to it.  I will work to decarbonise our energy system but I will do so in a responsible manner and not in a way that results in 1,443 families being thrown on the scrap heap.</p></speech>

In regard to his comment that what we are talking about is people's lives, according to a report by the European Environmental Bureau, alongside others, the delay in dealing with the problems of air pollution at Moneypoint is having a direct impact on the health of asthmatic children and results in scores of premature deaths.  If the Minister believes that the only employment this Government can provide in the midlands is in the area of peat burning then we need a change of Government.  There are many other ways to create jobs.  When will this Government start investing in indigenous industry?  I was approached recently by a number of young people who were trying to start up a business in Ireland.  There is little support provided for start-up business in this country, except in the case of multinationals and so on.  Young people are not being helped to start businesses.  I do not need a lecture from the Minister on energy.  His argument is that as long as there are jobs involved we are not going to deal with the environmental impact of this industry.  None of us wants to see people unemployed.  For the life of me I do not understand the attitude to employment in Ireland.  We are totally dependent on foreign direct investment, the companies involved in which appear to locate wherever they want.  We would probably not be able to get them to locate in the midlands.  When will this Government start investing in young people trying to start up businesses in Ireland?</p></speech>

We will be announcing a consultation document on the renewable heat incentive scheme before the end of this year, which will create demand for bio-energy crops in this country and will build up the capacity needed to convert these peat-fired stations from peat to biomass.  The installation of solar panels across the midlands will not create jobs.  We need to put in place a sustainable plan that benefits the local communities involved.  It needs to be accepted that this is about communities and families.  We need to come forward with sustainable solutions rather than suggestions to close three peat-fired power stations.</p></speech>

The landfill is well established, has been in operation for some years and, dare I say it, an uneasy peace existed between the facility and locals until recently.  However, there have been difficulties recently which have exacerbated the relationship, strained matters and caused considerable concern, unrest and upset to the surrounding area for some miles around.  The landfill has seen an escalation of activity since earlier this year.  I understand that the landfill was approaching end of life at the end of last year but a decision was taken in February or certainly spring of this year to ramp up the intake of the landfill from 120,000 tonnes per annum to 360,000 tonnes per annum.  Obviously, a trebling of the volume of waste going into the landfill places a considerable burden on neighbouring communities and the wider county as people traverse multiple local and backroad routes to access it.  This trebling occurred almost overnight.  I understand a formula was used, which I might come back to in a moment, and that a number of local authorities simultaneously invoked emergency powers to enable this, technically, to happen.  However, it has meant that all of a sudden the volume of trucks pounding down the local roads surrounding the landfill has hugely increased.</p>  <p>  The landfill is in a relatively rural and remote area and the only approach routes are across local, rural roads.  As a local representative before I came into this House, I was very familiar with complaints on the standard of those roads as they were not to mind after 360,000 tonnes of waste will have pounded down them across every hour of the day, every day of the week.  There has been no attendant infrastructural improvement to the roads surrounding the landfill since permission was granted to treble the volume of waste.  The local authority suggests there are a number of approved haul routes but in my opinion and that of the residents for a radius of many miles around the landfill, these roads are totally inadequate for the volume of traffic now traversing them.  It also seems grossly unfair.  Everybody understands that waste has to go somewhere and we even understand that, at times, it has to go to Kildare, but I understand anecdotally that the Drehid landfill is now taking waste from almost the entire greater Dublin area.  I understand that the delays with the Poolbeg incinerator have led to a concentration of waste at Drehid landfill.  I understand there is a landfill in Galway but obviously Drehid is closer to Dublin.  It seems completely disproportionate, unfair and overly burdensome on the residents of Kildare to have to suffer and become the dustbin of Dublin.</p>  <p>  What actions are in place to sustain and manage this?  What kind of infrastructural improvements will accompany the trebling of capacity?  Is the Minister aware of this development and is it in fact the case that waste from the entire greater Dublin area and surrounds is being deposited in the Drehid landfill in north-west Kildare?  What infrastructure needs to be put in place and how soon can we get it?  It is completely disproportionate and unfair to expect a rural location in north-west Kildare to absorb the volume of trucks, waste, odours, traffic and heavy goods vehicles from miles around pounding down its roads on a daily basis and in the absence of any public consultation.  I understand that an application is due to be made to the EPA to, as it has been put, regularise the situation, but this has come about at the flick of a switch when there was an emergency invocation in February or March.  It is unsustainable and unfair on the residents of Kildare and I ask the Minister to address it as a matter of urgency.</p></speech>

Waste management planning is the responsibility of local authorities under Part II of the Waste Management Act 1996.  In this regard, waste management plans for the Connacht-Ulster, eastern midlands and southern regions were made in May 2015.  In brief, the plans comprehensively set out clear strategies, policies and actions to address, <i>inter alia</i>, the prevention, generation, collection and management of waste in the State for the period 2015 to 2021.  The development and implementation of the plans will give effect to national and EU waste management policies and legislation.  I am precluded under section 60(3) of the Waste Management Act 1996 from the exercise of any power or control in relation to the performance by a local authority in particular circumstances of a statutory function vested in it under the Act.</p><p>Waste capacity developments, including any future potential pinch points and the coming on stream of additional capacity, are kept under constant review by the three regional waste management planning offices in consultation with industry and other waste regulatory bodies, including my Department.  In line with Government policy, the management of waste in the State generally is continuing to move away from the disposal of waste at landfill.  In 2011, the number of landfills which accepted waste for disposal stood at 21.  Currently, there are four landfills actively accepting waste around the country.  The coming on stream of the Dublin waste-to-energy plant at Poolbeg next year will be another significant development in terms of how we manage our waste in the State.  Regulatory authorities and waste operators will continue to engage to ensure that the sector has the capacity to deal appropriately with the waste we generate.</p><p>The waste management facility at Drehid is governed by waste management and all other applicable legislation, including the licence and planning permission attached to the site.  The facility in question operates under an industrial-emissions licence granted by the Environmental Protection Agency.  The monitoring and enforcement of conditions attaching to the industrial-emissions licence is a matter for the EPA.  All documents relating to individual licences, including inspection information, are available to view on the EPA's website at <i>www.epa.ie</i>.  Issues pertaining to planning legislation, including matters regarding traffic management, do not fall under my remit as Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment.</p><p>The big issue here is a capacity issue nationally in relation to waste.  That is why we are actively engaging on ways to reduce the volumes of waste going into landfill.  That is why we are actively trying to encourage people to segregate their waste into brown bins for biorecycling or composting, blue or green bins in relation to recyclables and into the black bins.  A significant level of segregation again takes place in relation to black bins before waste goes into landfill.  I encourage people to segregate their waste properly, which would reduce the volumes going into landfill.  As we are in reuse month, I encourage people to reuse goods.  Rather than to use the likes of disposable cups, I ask people to use mugs and reusable cutlery and cups.  I say the same in relation to goods which can be reused for another purpose and up-cycled.  Instead of disposing of computers, they could be sent for specific recycling whereby they can be used in the developing world.</p><p>There are major opportunities to create employment and reduce the volumes of materials going into landfill.  That is the long-term sensible solution to address the overall problem we have in regard to landfill.</p></speech>

I respectfully suggest that although I wholeheartedly support opportunities for segregation, recycling and reuse, as I am sure my constituents do, that will not address the 360,000 tonnes of waste hammering down the road at full speed today, tomorrow or over the next year, which is the immediate problem.  The Minister has suggested that there are clear strategies, policies and actions to address the issue of waste.  In this case they are not working.</p>  <p>  I referred to an e-mail I received from An Bord Plean&aacute;la earlier this year when I highlighted this issue directly with the agency.  It referred to section 56 of the Waste Management Act being invoked to enable the simultaneous invocation by multiple local authorities of emergency powers to enable landfill to ramp up immediately, and that this was to address a potential shortfall in capacity nationally and the fact that there was a backlog and stockpiling of waste at licensed and permitted sites.  Something is going wrong.</p>  <p>  There would not be a great deal of confidence in the EPA in Kildare, in particular in Kildare North.  Multiple complaints were made to the EPA about the landfill at Kerdiffstown over a number of years, culminating in a fire at the site which could be seen from the nearby N7.  The High Court issued &euro;10 million in fines, the highest fines ever imposed following a waste management conviction.  With respect to the EPA, we do not have much confidence in it to deal with this issue.</p>  <p>  There is an immediate issue, as I have said.  It appears, and from what the Minister said it is not denied or confirmed, that multiple waste from the greater Dublin area is involved.  According to the Minister, there are four landfills in the country and this appears to be the one in closest proximity to Dublin.  As I said at the outset, it seems unfair and disproportionate to concentrate waste in one rural location on the perimeter of Dublin.  I call on the Minister to take action to examine the infrastructure and planning needs, and address with the EPA and lead authorities the waste management plan because the residents cannot continue with this situation.  It is making their lives a nightmare on a daily basis.</p></speech>

As I set out previously, I am precluded under statute from intervening in matters concerning waste management planning and industrial emissions licensing, which are functions of local authorities and the EPA, respectively.  In addition, matters pertaining to planning legislation, including issues regarding traffic management, do not fall under my remit as Minister for Communication, Climate Action and the Environment.</p><p>Notwithstanding that, the regional waste management planning office, working in a co-ordinated and co-operative manner to drive the implementation of waste management plans, will ensure that the health of communities and the environment in the three regions are not compromised.  The regional waste management planning officers will continue to engage with industry and other waste regulatory bodies, including my Department, concerning waste capacity developments.</p><p>On the issue of waste capacity developments, I understand that earlier this year, following consultation with the three regional waste management planning officers, the industry and other waste regulatory bodies, including my Department, it was evident that some collectors were experiencing difficulties in finding suitable residual waste disposal outlets.  On foot of a recommendation by the three regional waste management planning officers, additional disposal capacity was released under section 56 of the Waste Management Act 1996 for a limited period of time to overcome a pinch point experienced in the State in the first half of 2016.</p><p>As I previously stated, all documents relating to individual licences, including inspection information, are available to view on the EPA website, <i>www.epa.ie</i>.  It is the responsible authority.  I have found the EPA to be very thorough.  I know there are ongoing issues and I will not and cannot comment on them.</p></speech>

I also want to acknowledge the Minister, Deputy Naughten, and the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Canney, because both know the situation to which I refer.</p><p>I want to bring a particularly heartbreaking case to the attention of the Minister of State, Deputy Dara Murphy, today.  It involves an unjust deportation order.  A couple have been separated by thousands of miles and a system that has failed them miserably.  It is the story of a Ballinasloe woman, Harriet Bruce, and her Brazilian born husband, Kleber Medeiros, who was deported from Ireland on 13 July.  I am calling for an urgent review of the matter.</p><p>Kleber Medeiros had lived in Ireland since 2011 and was working in a specialist job.  I want to be honest with the Minister of State.  He was here illegally at that time, but was trying to regularise his situation and had applied for a <i>de facto </i>visa.  He fell in love with a local lady, Harriet Bruce.  They became engaged last year.  However, somebody made an objection to the HSE, which registers marriages, saying it would be a marriage of convenience.  It has since been clearly established that this objection had no foundation.  The couple went ahead with a religious ceremony and on 10 December 2015 the couple married in St. Michael's Catholic Church in Ballinasloe.</p><p>However, in July Kleber received a letter from the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service telling him to present himself to make arrangements for his removal from the State.  The couple were devastated, but Kleber, who was very anxious to co-operate and was optimistic that the situation would be resolved, duly presented himself and did the right thing but he was deported the next day and remains in Brazil.</p><p>On 22 July, a letter to Kleber from the HSE arrived in their home in Ballinasloe.  It stated: &quot;Following an investigation of an objection to the above proposed marriage, the superintendent registrar has decided that there is not sufficient evidence to uphold the objection and that no impediment to the marriage exists&quot;.  We regularly criticise the HSE, but it made the correct decision in this situation.  It admitted that the marriage was genuine and a marriage certificate was issued, but unfortunately the letter came too late.  The couple's lives have been turned upside down.</p><p>The ironic thing is that the marriage certificate has been issued and Kleber needs to sign the form, but he is not permitted to enter the country to do so.  Harriet has a business in Ballinasloe, but has left Ireland temporarily to be with Kleber in Brazil.  She has to return to look after her business.  I call on the Minister of State to review this case as a matter of urgency.</p><p>They are real people and should not be reduced to file numbers.  I hope they are looked after because their only crime was to fall in love, and now they are being punished.  As I said, Harriet has business and property commitments in the State.  It is outrageous that, as an Irish citizen, she would have to close her business and move halfway around the world simply because she fell in love and chose to marry a non-EU citizen.</p><p>I implore the Minister of State to a review Kleber Medeiros's deportation order, or, at the very least, allow him to return to Ireland to sign the marriage certificate which was justly granted to the couple.  It is time to reunite this genuine couple.  In fact, it is time to bring Kleber home. </p></speech>

I have also read the additional material he sent to me.  It is not the policy of the Department of Justice and Equality to comment on the details of decisions reached in individual cases.</p>  <p>  However, in general there is a perception that marrying an Irish citizen confers an automatic right to reside in the State, which is not in fact the case.  Where a person is illegally present in the State, he or she cannot simply rectify that situation by entering into a marriage with an Irish or other EU citizen or another person who is lawfully resident in the State.  In general terms, if the Department was to treat marriages involving persons illegally present in the State in such a fashion, it would have the result that marriages contracted solely for the purposes of confirming lawful immigration status would become an even more attractive proposition with various issues and consequences for the overall integrity of the immigration system.</p><p> The Civil Registration (Amendment ) Act 2014 provided additional powers to marriage registrars to refuse to accept the validity of proposed marriages.  Most of those additional powers relate to the immigration status of one or both of the parties concerned.  These measures were taken primarily to combat the problem of sham marriages.  The T&aacute;naiste has a particular concern about sham marriages and she has taken action to combat them in conjunction with the Garda Commissioner who has established Operation Vantage in order to investigate such marriages.  Operation Vantage has proven very successful in reducing instances of sham marriages in the State.  I should make it very clear at this stage that I am not suggesting at all that the marriage in question comes into that bracket or should be in any way taken to be a sham marriage.  The Deputy should note that various immigration decisions which issue from the Department are, in many cases, not predicated on an assumption that a marriage is a sham marriage.  They instead focus on the fact that the person concerned is in the State illegally and consideration of the case made by the person concerned as to why they should not be deported is fully taken into account under the relevant statutory framework.  In addition, any claimed rights arising under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights and under the Irish Constitution are examined, weighed and balanced against the right of the State to maintain a functioning immigration system.  The outcome of that process, in many cases, is that a deportation order is then made.  Such decisions can be re-examined and subsequently affirmed or revoked.  It is open to any person who is subject to a deportation order to submit additional information at any time and to request a reconsideration of their case.  I understand in this case that has recently been done.  This material will be fully considered and a further decision will issue in due course.  If the decision is made to revoke the deportation order then this person, like any other person in a similar case, would then be allowed to return to the State.  I accept the genuine nature of the Deputy's concern and he should encourage the couple to please supply any additional information they may have.</p></speech>

I am glad he clarified that he was not suggesting this was a sham marriage because this was not a sham marriage.  This was a man who came to seek a better livelihood in Ireland.  He worked in the Ballinsaloe region and he contributed to the local economy.  He fell in love with a local girl, they got engaged and then married.  The State, through the HSE, has the marriage certificate saying that everything was okay and yet he cannot come back into the State to sign it.  I know the Minister of State understands that but to me this is a terrible case.  It is heartbreaking.  I have spoken to members of the family and it is heartbreaking for them all.  They are at their wits' end about the situation.  I acknowledge what the Minister of State has said and I appeal to him.  I know he is a compassionate individual and I say to him that we should make every effort to rectify what I believe is a wrong so that this couple can get on with their lives in which they were happy, contented, running a business and paying taxes.  I firmly believe that a wrong has been done and while I acknowledge all the Minister of State has said we really need to look after this couple to ensure that they get fair treatment.</p></speech>

I reiterate that a person who does not have a right or entitlement to be in the State does not generate such a right by going through a ceremony of marriage.  I note what the Deputy has said and I assure him that all relevant issues put forward by the person concerned, or on his behalf, will be fully considered by the Department of Justice and Equality officials before a decision is made on whether to revoke or reaffirm the deportation order.  I will also make sure to pass on the note the Deputy has presented here to the Department, but the Deputy may already have done that.  I am sure the Deputy will accept that we cannot prejudge the outcome of that process.  I thank him particularly for the empathy he has shown to this couple.</p></speech>

Tuigim nach bhfuil an tAire Oideachais agus Scileanna, Teachta Richard Bruton, in ann bheith anseo.  Is trua sin mar seans go mbeadh n&iacute;os m&oacute; eolais aige le d&eacute;ile&aacute;il leis an gceist seo, ach b'fh&eacute;idir go mbeidh an tAire St&aacute;it in ann cuidi&uacute; linn leis an gceist.  I wish to raise the matter of a school which should have had - and should have - Delivering Equality of Opportunities in Schools, DEIS status.  I understand that DEIS is being reviewed at the moment.  I guarantee that if the review was concluded and the school had to apply that it would fully comply with every single criterion that it might be required to satisfy.  I say this because the school is due to lose a teacher as of next Friday and 5th and 6th classes will have to amalgamate.  If the Minister of State or the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton had visited the school they would understand fully the context.</p>  <p>  There are a number of reasons to ask the Minister for Education and Skills to intercede in this case to ensure that the teaching post is no longer under threat of being removed on Friday.  The Minister should understand that these classrooms are very small rooms.  I will return to the size later.  The area in which the school is situated and from where the school's cohort of children come, has been identified by drugs task forces and by the DEIS system in the past, as having severe disadvantage.  It is in this context that I believe the Minister for Education and Skills would allow the school to retain the teaching post to ensure that the children were not further overcrowded in the classrooms.</p>  <p>  The figures are set out in the rules of the Department of Education and Skills but a strict adherence to those figures does nobody any favours unless they take the particular situation into account.  I know the Minister of State might suggest that there is an appeals process but I do not believe that the Assumption Girls Primary School in Walkinstown was fully looked at when there were making the decision.  I have been to the school on a number of occasions and I have visited recently.  I saw for myself how overcrowded classrooms are.  The Department's recommendation for the size of a classroom is 76 sq. m.  If one visits the classrooms in the Assumption school the classrooms average around 46 sq. m.  This means that the decision to remove a teacher will exacerbate an already overcrowded situation.  I ask that this be taken into account.</p>  <p>  I would also ask the Minister to consider the disadvantaged status of the areas in which the school cohort lives - areas which have a number of DEIS schools within them.  The areas, and especially Dublin 8,10 and 12, have been identified by drugs task forces and partnerships as disadvantaged, which is recognised by virtually every Department and that should carry over into schools those children attend.  It is not the case in this instance.  I appeal to the Minister to reinvestigate this and to reinstate the teacher in the meantime.</p></speech>

They have had a long day because this morning, in response to the fact that tomorrow they could lose their teacher and with the permission of the parents, there was a protest by the students outside the school.  It was very emotional because they had been linked with the teacher for two months and created a proper bond with her.  However, they are now being told that after next week, when they come back to school, there will be three classrooms rather than four and that they will be cramped into them.  As noted by Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh, the recommended size of a classroom is 76 sq.m.  The classrooms in the Assumption girls' school, which is old, are only 46.75 sq.m in size.  We are talking about girls in fifth and sixth class who are growing and developing.  They are not small children.  This has to be a factor in the decision, but I do not know whether it has been taken into account.</p>  <p>  Having spoken to some of the officials, it appears that the school needs to have 229 students.  Those involved in it had thought it would have 234 students, as it was developing, but it did did not reach that number.  It lost some children because families could not afford the rental prices in the area.  They are victims of the housing crisis also.  At 222 students, the school is down seven, while the official cut-off point is 229.  If it was down by one student, would it still lose a teacher?  There have be to be some criteria, but there cannot be a cold cut-off point.  Other factors, particularly school classroom sizes, should also be taken into account.  Futhermore, if there was a review, the school would probably fall under the DEIS umbrella.</p>  <p>  I appeal to the Minister to review the situation.  The matter has been submitted to the appeals board.  The school originally applied for two extra teachers because it had developing school status.  On 30 September, however, when it had to give the figures to the Department, it did not have the 229 students required.  It then had a short time period within which to make an appeal and it appealed on the grounds of exceptional accommodation needs, but it was turned down and told it would lose this teacher which it so desperately needs.  Up to 33 fifth and sixth class students will be stuck in a room 46.75 sq.m in size.  Health and safety concerns and other considerations should be taken into account.  Last year space in some of the classrooms was so tight that there was no room for volunteers to sit down beside students.  They had to kneel beside them.</p>  <p>  Will the Minister allow the school to retain the teacher for the eight months left in the school year and review the situation next year when it has been indicated that there will be more enrolments in the school?  I hope the Minister will see sense and not take a clinical approach and cause the school to lose a teacher just because it is seven students down.</p></speech>

Mika has told me that the school does not have the 230 students it had expected to have and that the fifth and sixth classes will be squished - a great word kids use - into one classroom.  She says not everyone could manage to go to a private school or one that is further away from their area and that accommodation prices are getting higher and higher in the area.  She says they could not blame the parents if they have to or want to move.  She says one of their teachers will lose her job and that their education could be affected.</p>  <p>  I received another e-mail from Gr&aacute;inne.  She says that, as a pupil with dyslexia, it will be hard for her to work with more students in her classroom and that her teacher will not be able to help her and the other sixth class girls as much.  She says they will have confirmations this year and that it will be even harder for the teacher because she will have fifth and sixth class students in one small room.  She says her school has very small classrooms which can barely fit the 23 girls in them and wonders what it will be like to have 32 girls in one small room.</p>  <p>  People of my vintage look at photographs and remember the time when we were children.  A teacher would have been in a sea of children because in the 1960s classes could had up to 50 children.  Thank God, we have moved on since.  However, here is a case in which the class size will increase from 23 to 28, 30 and 32 students when four classes become three.  If the number of teachers is reduced from four to three, it will maximise the number of students in the classrooms.</p>  <p>  On top of this, we have to think of the ages of the girls.  They play camogie and musical instruments and attend dance classes and so on after school.  They bring their gear with them and it is left in the classroom.  Other Deputies have raised the health and safety issues, which are a concern.  My concern is that three Deputies handed a letter to the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Richard Bruton, last week, appealing to him to think about this situation.  I am sure it does not mean a thing to him because he is up to his eyeballs in dealing with the threatened ASTI strike.  Furthermore, there is an official in Athlone who is ticking a box that the school has applied on exceptional accommodation needs grounds but that it does not fulfil the criteria and that, therefore, the teacher has to go.  Ms O'Brien will have to leave the school on Friday and the girls are distraught, as are their parents.  The girls should be heading into the mid-term break with a sense of glee and looking forward to Hallowe'en.  Instead, they are massively disappointed.</p>  <p>  I have a map to show to the House that was given to me by the principal.  It depicts part of Dublin South-Central and the pink dots represent DEIS schools.  The large black dot represents the Assumption girls' school.  We can see that the area is full of DEIS schools, rightly so, because it is considered to be economically disadvantaged.  As the Assumption girls' school does not have DEIS status, it always under scores in the pupil-teacher ratio.  It is unfair that the officials in Athlone do not take the opportunity to send a cigire which is what we used to call them into the school to examine the space in which the children have to study and learn and the teachers have to work.  This needs to be done with a sense of urgency.  Can it be done and how can we do more to ensure it will be done?  Anyone who visits the classrooms and sees the children and their teachers packed into them, with their gear, will realise this is not just about pleading for an extra teacher but a genuine health and safety issue.  More importantly, the children deserve, as does everyone, including those mentioned by Mika who can afford to go to a private or another school, equal opportunity in education, but they are not getting it because someone in Athlone ticked the wrong box.  Will there be an instruction to those in Athlone that someone should visit the school and listen to the case being made, rather than treating this as bits of paper on which to tick boxes?</p></speech>

I know that in schools in my constituency and that of Deputy Jonathan O'Brien there is often a difficulty, particularly in areas with a high density of DEIS schools.  Schools can have similar issues and not be designated as DEIS schools.  I know, in particular, of the great work being done by parents' committees working in conjunction with school authorities.</p>  <p>  The criteria used in the allocation of teaching posts are published annually and the key factor in determining the level of staffing resources provided in individual schools is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolment, as the House will be aware, on 30 September of the previous year.  The staffing schedule is an objective and transparent method in treating all schools equally in the allocation of classroom teachers.  In budget 2016 a one point improvement in the primary staffing schedule was announced.  This reduced the average pupil-teacher ratio to 27:1.  The revised and improved staffing schedule and the circular outlining the staffing arrangements for schools are also available on the Department's website.</p><p>The new arrangements have been implemented for the 2016-17 school year.  Prior to this year, classroom teachers were allocated to primary schools on the basis of an average pupil-teacher ratio of 28:1.  The staffing arrangements also include the provision whereby schools experiencing rapid increases in enrolment can apply for additional permanent mainstream posts on developing grounds, using projected enrolment for the following September, in this case September 2016.</p> <p> The school referred to by the Deputies was initially due, in accordance with the published staffing arrangements for the 2016-17 school year, to have seven classroom teachers based on its September 2015 enrolment of 182 pupils.  The school applied for developing school status on the basis of a projected enrolment of 234 pupils for September 2016.  On the basis of the projected enrolment, the school was granted approval for two developing posts on a provisional basis.  These posts were approved up to 28 October, pending confirmation of the required enrolment achieved on 30 September 2016.  The school achieved an actual enrolment of 228 on 30 September 2016.  This enrolment is sufficient for the retention of one of the developing posts.  As a result, the school will have a mainstream staffing of eight classroom teachers for the 2016-17 school year.  As set out in the staffing arrangements, the second developing post which was provisionally approved pending confirmation of actual enrolments is, as the Deputies noted, due to be suppressed on 28 October 2016.</p> <p> The staffing arrangements also provide for an appeals mechanism for schools to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent appeals board.  The school submitted an appeal to the October meeting of the primary staffing appeals board.  A school must demonstrate to the appeals board&rsquo;s satisfaction the reasons an additional teaching post is warranted under criteria outlined in Circular 007/2016.  Decisions are made by the appeals board on the basis of the information provided by the school.  The primary staffing appeals board considered the appeal made by the school and was satisfied that the appeal put forward by the school did not unfortunately warrant a second teaching post in accordance with Circular 007/2016.  The board of management  of the school has been notified in this regard.</p> <p> The primary staffing appeals board operates independently of the Minister for Education and Skills and its decision is final.</p></speech>

If the school was a DEIS school, the threshold or ratio would be lower, it would have access to the home-school liaison and school completion programmes, literacy and numeracy supports and other planning and professional supports.  Not only does it not have access to such supports but it is due to lose a teacher unless the Minister agrees to intervene.</p><p>Three quarters of schools in the Dublin 8, 10 and 12 areas have DEIS status.  Given what has happened in these communities for the past 30 or 40 years and perhaps even longer, all schools in these areas should have DEIS status.  Anyone who is familiar with the Dublin 12 area in particular will understand the context and background of children in the area who attend the school in question.</p><p>A pupil-teacher ratio of 27:1 is not conducive to a good teaching outcome, as all Deputies who have served as their party spokespersons on education will accept.  According to the Minister of State, the school's enrolment was six short of the figure required for a second additional teacher.  He also indicated the school can apply again next year for an additional teacher.  Next year will be too late for this year's sixth class, which will be forced to amalgamate.  </p><p>The appeal letter issued by the board of management and principal states: </p><blockquote>The combined 5th/6th class, would have to operate with so little space in horribly cramped, overcrowded conditions where their education would be seriously compromised, even jeopardised.  Should a teacher be absent and a class need to be split among the remaining teachers, we will find ourselves unable to accommodate pupils safely with adequate supervision.  Leaving children outside rooms, in corridors is simply not an option!</blockquote><p>This is what the school will be forced to do if the Minister continues with the policy that was announced. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-10-26a.388" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1306" speakername="Joan Collins" time="18:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016102600052#ZZ00600"><p>As Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh stated, Deputies were half expecting the reply from the Minister of State.  However, I also expected a little more understanding of the position in which the Assumption girls primary school finds itself and possibly some ideas on how to address the issue.  The Minister of State indicated that the pupil-teacher ratio currently stands at 27:1.  Fifth and sixth year students in the school will be taught in classes of 33, 32, 31 or 30 pupils, depending on how the teachers decide to move them around.  It is horrendous that such circumstances are being accepted.  Members of the appeals board should visit the school and carry out an assessment to determine whether it has made the correct decision.</p>  <p>  The school does not have DEIS status and does not have access to the supports associated with such status, which many other schools in the area enjoy.  To some degree, the school envies other schools in the area for the supports they have, although it also wishes them well.  Teachers must deal with young girls arriving at schools with basketball and hockey gear, a change of clothes and so on.  I ask for an opportunity to meet the Minister in the next 24 hours.  The additional teacher should be maintained at least until further discussions are held.  Members of the appeals board should visit the school before making a final decision in the matter.</p>  <p>  The school has a right to feel let down by the system and the State.  To leave 32 or 33 young girls in classrooms of 46.73 sq. m. is horrendous.  I ask the Minister to revert to us with a more positive statement, for example, to inform us that a meeting will be arranged in the school next week or two.  The additional teacher must be retained, if possible.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-10-26a.389" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1367" speakername="Br&iacute;d Smith" time="18:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016102600052#ZZ00700"><p>In acknowledging that the Minister is not present, I find it difficult to accept that it is not a function of the Minister to interfere with the primary staffing appeals board or that the board's decision is final.  That approach is a little harsh and begs the question as to why we have Ministers if they cannot intervene in crises that deserve immediate attention.</p>  <p>  I ask the Minister of State to make clear to the Minister that the school did not appeal the decision on the basis that it was seeking DEIS status but on the grounds of exceptional accommodation difficulties.  This issue, therefore, is one of health and safety.  Any member of a trade union working in an ordinary workplace will be aware that guidelines apply to the space in which people work and that this has health and safety implications.  According to the rules for national schools, space of 15 sq. ft. should be available to each person in a classroom.  Should the class sizes in Assumption girls primary school increase to 32, 30 and 28 pupils per teacher and classroom, the space available to each child will be 5.16 sq. ft.  This would breach national school rules.  If the Department is prepared to live with breaches of its health and safety rules for children, perhaps we need to raise the matter with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Katherine Zappone, or appeal to the Ombudsman for Children.  I expect circumstances to arise in which children's health and safety is put at risk as a result of a decision taken in the absence of a clear examination of what was asked.</p>  <p>  I ask the Minister of State to indicate to the Minister that the school has written to him to find out why its appeal was rejected and why he does not accept that the school has a cast-iron case based on exceptional accommodation difficulties.  He should also explain the rationale for his statement that the decision is final and this is the end of the story.  That is not good enough.  This is the 21st century and children in question who have much to gain and offer are being discriminated against.  They are being impacted on by the housing crisis because families are moving out and are being further impacted on by the policies of the Department of Education and Skills which, as I have pointed out, is breaching its own rules.</p></speech>

All of us who are politicians, particularly those who represent disadvantaged areas with a significant number of DEIS schools, have experience of many such cases.  The Government is aware of the difficulties and we are working through them.  The Deputies have seen changes in the pupil-teacher ratio.  As the country recovers, it is an absolute priority to ensure this will happen more in the future.  I re-emphasise that the staffing arrangements process for schools is independent.  It is important to respect both the independence of the appeals process and the application of staffing arrangements for schools generally, which have to be implemented in a fair and consistent manner.  The primary staffing appeals board is independent of the Minister for Education and Skills and its decision is final.  However, based on an enrolment of 222 pupils and taking into consideration the staffing schedule for the next school year, Assumption girls' school in Walkinstown will have an entitlement to eight classroom teaching posts, with effect from September 2017.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-10-26a.393" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1296" speakername="Jim O'Callaghan" time="18:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016102600053#AAA00500"><p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&quot;</p><p>One of the fundamental requirements in a functioning democracy is an independent and effective judiciary.  If we want to assess whether a country has a functioning democracy, the first thing we need to do is to identify whether it has an independent judiciary that can stand up to and stop actions of the parliament and-or the government which are unlawful or which infringe the rights of citizens.  If a country does not have such a judiciary, it cannot be described as a real democracy.  In totalitarian countries the courts and the judiciary become part of the ruling regime of the state.  We saw how judges such as Roland Freisler in Nazi Germany and Andrei Vyshinsky in Stalin's Russia controlled courts that were nothing more than an appendage of the ruling regime in these countries.  At no stage do courts that are controlled and subservient to a regime ever stand up to it; at no stage do they ever deviate from government policy.</p><p>When the Constitution was enacted in 1937, at a time when fascism was spreading throughout Europe, it established, in Articles 34 to 37, inclusive, an independent courts system.  The operation of that system was obviously reflective of the system that had operated prior to independence, but, nonetheless, it finally and definitively established independent courts in the country.  The Constitution expressly provides that justice is to be administered by judges appointed under it.  We talk a lot about justice in this House and public commentary.  It is important that we try to recognise what it is that justice seeks to achieve.  It seeks to correct wrongs done; it seeks to uphold constitutional and legal rights; it seeks to provide punishment and-or compensation for those who have suffered through the wrongs of others; and it seeks to deter the State from unlawfully interfering in the lives of people.</p><p>The Constitution specifies in Article 35 that judges are to be appointed by the President.  This is done after nominations are made by the Government.  The Constitution also specifies that judges must take an oath on assuming office.  Since enactment of the Constitution, hundreds of persons have been appointed as judges by the President.  They have been appointed based on nominations made by the Government of the day.  It is important to note that we had and have in this country an independent Judiciary, notwithstanding the fact that its members have been nominated by the Government.  There are many examples in our history of judges and courts dealing a serious blow to the plans of the Executive because they infringed the rights of citizens or were otherwise unlawful.  For example, we recall that, in 1986, the ratification of the Single European Act was stopped because the Judiciary and the courts stated it needed to be put to the people.  There are hundreds of other examples where Ministers have been given what the Taoiseach would refer to as a &quot;wallop&quot; by the courts and long may that continue.  Nonetheless, the manner in which judges have been nominated by the Government has been shrouded in mystery and the people do not know the basis on which individuals are nominated for appointment to such an important office.  We know how professors in universities and the director general of RTE are appointed; therefore, it is extremely important that the public be aware of the manner in which individuals are appointed to the Judiciary.  In order to ensure judicial independence will be strengthened, it is important that the public be aware of the characteristics the State seeks in persons nominated for appointment to the Bench.  Although the country has been well served by the Judiciary, that has been despite, not because, of the judicial appointments process.</p><p>If we want to enhance and improve our democracy, it is important that the public be satisfied that persons nominated for appointment to judicial office are, in fact, the most suitable persons who have applied.  It is the case that individuals with party political affiliations have been appointed to be members of the Judiciary.  Many of that group were appointed because of these affiliations and some were appointed despite them.  Nonetheless, the fact that they had political affiliations did not prevent them from exercising their judicial functions in an independent way.  There must also, however, be a group of people who are not as identifiable and who deserved and wanted to be made judges but who never had that opportunity.  They probably never got it because they were not connected with the Government of the day.  If we had a system based solely on merit, many of them might have been appointed.  It is important to point out that most judges were appointed on the basis that the respective Government of the day believed or had been advised the people it was appointing were the most suitable to fill the available posts.</p><p>The purpose of the Bill is to try to improve the process by which members of the Judiciary are nominated and appointed.  I think every Member of the House will agree that the abiding principle must be that nomination and appointment to judicial office should be based solely on merit.  People should not be appointed because of their party-political or ideological allegiance.  They should be nominated because the Government believes they will make excellent judges who will be able to administer justice in the State.  In order for Members to assess whether they wish to support the Bill, it is important that I, first, outline the current situation in the making of judicial appointments.  If there is a vacancy in a court, an advertisement is placed by the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, JAAB, that was established in 1995.  The board simply gives advice to the Government on judicial appointments.  Its job is to give the names of seven people to the Government for each vacancy, although it does not rank the individuals in terms of whom it believes is the best.  The Government must first consider these names and, if it decides not to select any of the individuals on the list submitted, it must publish in <i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;il</i>the fact the person chosen was not recommended by the JAAB.</p><p>The system in place does not identify the best candidates for appointment.  It is difficult for politicians or persons who are not acquainted with the courts to know what are the characteristics of a good judge.  A good judge is someone who applies the law in a fair way.  It is not his or her job to become a social engineer or an unelected politician who seeks to decide cases based on his or her own preferences, whether political or social.  The job of a judge is to adjudicate on facts and apply the law in a correct manner.</p><p>In Ireland we have had a creative Judiciary that, since 1965, has recognised that under the Constitution citizens enjoy unenumerated rights, that is, rights not written down in it.  The Judiciary has enumerated these rights and extracted them from many decisions of the superior courts.</p><p><i>7 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p> <p>The rights of Irish citizens and people living here have been improved because judges have extracted and enumerated those rights.  The importance of appointing the right people to the Bench is evident from the fact that the Judiciary plays such an important role in enumerating the rights of Irish citizens.</p> <p> The qualities and characteristics that the State should seek in judges are integrity, independence, intellectual skill, good temperament, common sense, sound judgment, impartiality, objectivity, fairness, equanimity, composure, sensibility, cultural sensitivity, courtesy, consideration, an ability to communicate well, a strong work ethic, efficiency, organisational skills and an ability to command respect.  They must also have a very good understanding of the law.  It must be the case that judges who are appointed to apply and interpret the law understand the law.  For that reason, we need good lawyers to apply to become judges.  Not every good lawyer will make a good judge, but one cannot be a good judge unless one is a good lawyer.  For many years we have appointed judges who fulfil many of these characteristics but it is essential that we seek to identify the best candidates for appointment so that they can be selected.</p> <p> The general purpose of the legislation is to set up a judicial appointments commission.  Its job will be to recommend and rank in order of preference three persons for appointment to each vacant judicial post.  Constitutionally, the entitlement to nominate still remains with the Government so it is necessary to ensure that any new body that is established conforms with that constitutional requirement.  The proposals contained within this legislation do conform with the requirements of the Constitution.</p> <p> It is important that it is the Government that is ultimately responsible for nominating individuals for appointment by the President.  Otherwise we will hand over this crucial responsibility to an unelected body that is not accountable to the people.  What we need is a body that makes recommendations, and those recommendations must be taken seriously and considered adequately by the Government.</p> <p> If under this legislation the Government decides not to nominate one of the three individuals recommended by the judicial appointments commission, it must provide a reasoned explanation on the Minister's website.  I am conscious that, at present, the Government has indicated that it is its preference not to nominate for appointment any new judges until new legislation is in place.  The Government should be careful about that proposed approach.  The individuals who will be affected by a delay in appointing judges to the Bench are not the lawyers who are seeking appointment or the politicians but the individuals who are waiting to get their cases heard.  Most people stay away from the courts.  Those who go to court probably go only once or twice in their lives, and it is an extremely stressful occasion for them.  People are entitled to know when their cases will be heard rather than having to go to the court only to be told there is no judge available.  The Government, notwithstanding the fact that it is anxious to introduce legislation in this area, must continue its constitutional job to nominate individuals to the Bench.</p> <p> I remind the Government that, in November 2010, former Senator Pearse Doherty, who is now a Deputy in this House, took a case challenging the decision by the then Government not to have a by-election.  He said in making his case that the Government was failing to comply with the constitutional requirement that sought to ensure constituencies had full representation.  The courts agreed with him.  The court said one cannot delay unreasonably in holding a by-election.  Similarly, if the current Government continues to delay in appointing individuals to vacant positions on the Bench, it will be threatening the requirement of justice, as provided for in Article 34 of the Constitution.</p> <p> I am glad to see the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross, is present.  He has a considerable interest in this topic.  I may be wrong in my assessment of him and, if I am, I apologise.  My assessment of his concern in respect of this issue is that what is occurring may be like what is occurring with the boards of Irish public companies in that individuals are being appointed to the Bench because they are friendly with individuals in the Government or elsewhere.  That may have been a problem in the past but it is not the problem at present.  The current problem in respect of appointments to the superior courts is that not enough people are applying for the positions.  This is partly attributable to economic issues, such as the fact that one must now be 20 years on the Bench before one can get a pension.  Thus, people have to apply by the age of 50, which deters many.  There was also a constitutional amendment that removed the guarantee judges had in respect of their salary.  That probably affected the number of people who wish to apply.  This is an extremely important issue and I welcome the fact that there is such interest in it among the members of the Government.  That said, it is important that we seek to get it right.</p> <p> I shall move on to the provisions of the Bill.  The Bill sets out in Part 2 the terms under which the judicial appointments commission shall be established.  It sets out the functions of the commission.  One of the important functions will be to invite individuals to apply.  We live in a small country and it is important that a body such as this seeks to identify and headhunt people it believes will be good judges.</p> <p> We set out the membership of the commission in section 7.  There are 12 persons on the commission I have proposed.  Of those 12, only five will be judicial members.  Seven will be non-judicial members.  It is important that the individuals recommending persons for appointment have an understanding of how courts operate.  If we wanted to appoint the editor of a newspaper, it would be extremely important for the interview panel to contain individuals who know how newspapers operate.  Similarly, it is vital that we have in the recommending process and among the membership of the commission individuals from the courts who know what is required of a judge and who know better than most what is required of a person to be appointed as a judge and whether he or she would be suitable.  The five judicial members are the Chief Justice and the presidents of the four other courts.</p> <p> I propose seven non-judicial members.  It is difficult to identify persons who should be on such an important body.  I am happy to accept any proposals that come from elsewhere in the House.  We need to realise, however, that no matter what regime operates in the world, people who are appointed as judges have to be lawyers.  I have never heard it proposed that judges not be lawyers.  We have a system in Ireland where some cases are heard by juries.  Juries determine questions of fact but most cases are determined by judges sitting on their own.  Not only must they determine fact but they must also have a good understanding of the law.  For that reason, there should be representation from the Bar Council, the Law Society and the Free Legal Advice Centres, which represent another vital area of the legal profession.  There should be members from the Citizens Information Board, an t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s um Ard-Oideachas, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission and the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.  I am open to proposals in respect of the make-up of the commission.</p> <p> The rest of Part 2 deals with the disqualification of members of the commission and how long they can serve.  Part 3 deals with the judicial appointments process.  What will happen under this scheme is that if there is a vacancy on a court, the Minister will request the commission to recommend three persons and rank them in order of preference.</p> <p> Under section 13, the commission will be able to consult the court in order to assess what competencies are required.  One might find that a court needs a judge to be recruited who is an expert on family law or criminal law, or a judge who is proficient in the Irish language.  That is an important requirement at the outset.</p> <p> Section 15 sets out the criteria for a recommendation for appointment.  This is a requirement imposed on us not simply because it is common sense but also because there was a declaration of the European Networks of Councils for the Judiciary, signed in Dublin in May 2012, calling for a clearly defined and published set of selection competencies against which candidates for appointment to judicial office should be assessed.  That is what we have done here.  We have set out the characteristics and competencies.  I recited them earlier.  It is important that they be contained within legislation so the public can see the characteristics required of somebody being appointed to such an important job.</p> <p> Section 17 sets out the requirements concerning a recommendation by the commission.  The commission may interview or seek individuals but ultimately it shall submit to the Minister the names of three persons whom it recommends for nomination and it shall rank those three persons in order of its preference.</p><p>This legislation also provides that anyone applying for judicial office must give an undertaking to engage in training if required to do so by the president of his or her court.  This is an important requirement because sometimes judges require training in areas of the law which are new to them.</p> <p> It is also important in section 18 that the deliberations of this new statutory body remain confidential.  People will not apply if they think it will be publicly disclosed that they applied and were rejected.  Section 22 deals with nomination to judicial office.  After the process is completed by the judicial appointments commission, it should give the Minister the names of three individuals, ranked 1, 2 and 3.  The names then come to Cabinet and the Government makes a decision.  The Government, if it wants to, can pick No. 3 or No. 2 and does not have to provide any explanation.  This is important in order to ensure it remains constitutional.  However, if the Government decides to pick none of the three, it must publish on the Minister's website a reasoned decision for not having done so.</p> <p> The other Parts of the Bill relate to recommendations by the commission for nomination to the important positions of Chief Justice and presidents of the Court of Appeal, the High Court, the Circuit Court and the District Court.  The basis upon which Governments decide to nominate individuals to, for instance, the position of Chief Justice is one of the great mysteries of our time.  The Bill sets out to require the commission to provide the Government with a recommendation in respect of individuals who it believes would be suitable for appointment to these very important positions.</p> <p> A number of other minor issues are dealt with at the end of the legislation, with which I will deal briefly.  Before doing so, I should say that this legislation would also be of use for appointments to the European Court of Human Rights and the two courts established under the Treaty on European Union.  Part 4 proposes a change to the law that would require that individuals, in order for them to be appointed as judges of the superior courts, have at least 15 years' standing as a lawyer.  At present they only require 12 years' standing.  Finally, there is a provision that would increase the retirement age of District Court judges from 65 years to 70 years.  At present District Court judges must retire at 65 but they are allowed to seek a renewal on a yearly basis.  That should be brought in line with other judicial positions, and their retirement age should be 70.</p></speech>

Reform of the judicial appointments process is a priority for me and for the Government and is an area which is the subject of intensive work at present.  The current programme for Government contains commitments to reform this system, in particular by setting up a new judicial appointments commission.  I will update the House on the status of those reforms later in my contribution.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge that Deputy O'Callaghan's Bill represents a very useful framework for debate on the reforms necessary to update and improve the approach we take to judicial appointments.  He introduces it at a point at which my Department has concluded a wide-ranging and in-depth review of all the issues surrounding the topic, a review which has already been well signalled to the House.</p>  <p>  Review of the law and procedures in this area needed comprehensive research and consultation with the interested and affected people and groups.  This is particularly so given the complexity of existing law in the area, the extensive range of issues involved and, as the Deputy said, the fundamental importance of judicial appointments to public policy and to our democracy and its growth.  My Department has carried out that research and has conducted the consultation to which I have referred.</p>  <p>  We embarked on a major review of the judicial appointments process and sought submissions in open consultations in 2014 as a first step.  It is vital if reforms applicable to this area are to be meaningful and effective that they emerge from a genuine consultative process, public debate and debates in this House.  However, in considering the Private Members' proposals before the House today, I intend to outline the clear principles of reform that underpin the legislative scheme I propose to advance over the coming short number of weeks.</p>  <p>  In all this, I must be very conscious of the fact that the Judiciary and the courts, as key organs of the justice system, are constitutionally independent in their operation.  This is a very basic principle within which we continue our work.  International best standards require this as the independence of the Judiciary is vital for its role in safeguarding fundamental freedoms and rights.</p>  <p>  I want to be clear about one thing before continuing.  We are most fortunate in having in Ireland a strong, independent, impartial and well-respected Judiciary.  Let us create no impression that we are trying to fix some fundamental failings in the judicial system.  Any such inference simply could not stand up.  A central tenet of the review is the need to ensure and protect the principle of judicial independence, and I do not think anyone in this House would argue with that, as enshrined in Article 35.2 of the Constitution.  The State has been very well served by an independent Judiciary.</p>  <p>  However, the focus is very much on the manner in which the selection, recommendation and appointment arrangements can be improved in a new statutory framework.  The objective of this is to increase transparency, match best international practice and ensure that Ireland leads out on the guarantee of a highly effective and impartial judicial appointments system.</p>  <p>  I will not go into the history of the Courts and Court Officers Act 1995, suffice to say it has been in place for 20 years.  In many respects, it led the way internationally at the time, but I have no doubt that it needs fresh appraisal at this point.  Reforms and improvements can be made to deliver a more transparent and accountable system while looking after the independence of our Judiciary.  Deputies will be fully aware that under the Constitution, judges are appointed by the President on the advice of the Government.  It must always be an act of the Executive, therefore, under the Constitution, to advise the President on the matter.  This is all set out in the Courts and Court Officers Act 1995, which established the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board.  The board must recommend a minimum of seven candidates for each vacancy and submit to the Minister the name of each person who has applied to the board.  I do not have the time to go into all the other details but I think most Deputies contributing tonight will be familiar with the process.</p>  <p>  The consultation process undertaken by the last Government sought to be as inclusive as possible, engaging the broader public and interested stakeholders.  The following matters were highlighted when we were engaged in that consultation: the existing provisions for eligibility for appointment; the need to ensure and protect the principle of judicial independence; the promotion of equality and diversity; and the role of the advisory board, its membership and its procedures.  Clearly, work can be done in this regard, and we received many very thoughtful and challenging submissions.</p>  <p>  The programme for Government commitments are the basis for the approach we will take to the development of our legislation.  The Programme for a Partnership Government responds to the crucial matters of the recommendations procedure and the composition of the board.  Specifically, the programme for Government states, "We will reduce the number of suitable candidates proposed ... for each vacancy to the lowest number advised as constitutionally and legally permissible by the Attorney General, but in any event not more than three candidates to be shortlisted ... for any vacancy."  People will be familiar with the other points we made about a reduction in membership; an independent chairperson selected by the Public Appointments Service and approved by an Oireachtas committee; and a lay majority including independent people with specialist qualifications.  Suitable provisions to take account of these priority matters are being finalised and are the subject of the view and advices of the Attorney General on key constitutional and law matters, and I and my Cabinet colleagues, including the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, are working intensively on these issues.  These reforms will be set out in a Government Bill which will reflect the programme for Government commitments, deal with a number of other areas and build on the 2014 consultations.</p>  <p>  Deputy O'Callaghan has devised a progressive and interesting basis for the consideration of reform of the judicial appointments system.  He has already outlined the various competencies he believes are necessary and which judicial appointments he feels should be included in the work of a new commission, including Chief Justice and court presidents, where he seeks to confine selection only to judges of the relevant courts.  As he said, he has included the European Courts as well.  He talked about the increase in the standard practice rule from 12 to 15 years.  He does not make any provision in respect of the direct eligibility of District Court judges for consideration for appointments as High Court judges.</p><p>I would like to examine further the implications of the Deputy's Bill.</p> <p> As Deputies are aware, I am currently finalising a general scheme of a Bill to bring to Government.  The intention of that is to replace the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board with a judicial appointments commission which will have a dual role of making recommendations to Government for appointments and making longer term contributions to the development of the system of judicial appointments.  For example, it will research international practice, keep selection processes under review and make recommendations to Government.  The general scheme also proposes to reduce the number of recommendations coming from the commission to three as opposed to the minimum of seven forwarded by the JAAB under the Courts and Court Officers Act 1995.  I have been advised that under the Constitution, the Government must have a choice and a minimum of three recommendations would be adequate to provide that choice.</p> <p> The general scheme also proposes to change the composition of the new body - the commission - to increase lay membership and have a lay chairperson no longer appointed by the Minister, but by open appointment.  The general scheme also proposes to open up appointments at every level and in every relevant court to the new process; make District Court judges eligible for appointment to the High Court; consolidate the existing and mostly un-codified provisions on qualifications and eligibility; and repeal previous enactments. </p> <p> While there is a certain amount of common ground between the two Bills, there are significant differences and further detailed analysis of the overall effect of reforms in this area is required.  This can be done without any significant delay and, on that basis, the Government has decided not to oppose the Deputy's Bill.  The Government intends to bring forward as a priority a Government Bill to reflect the outcome of the consultation process, and the common ground in this Private Members' Bill and the programme for Government commitments.</p> <p> I again take the opportunity to thank the Deputy for his very constructive input to the process and to the formulation of policy in this area.  It is a priority matter for the Government and I look forward to bringing the Bill to the House at the earliest opportunity.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-10-26a.398" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1280" speakername="Jonathan O'Brien" time="18:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016102600056#DDD00200"><p>I acknowledge that the T&aacute;naiste advised me that she may have to leave before I conclude.</p>  <p>  I commend Deputy O'Callaghan on the publication of his Bill, which is comprehensive and well-drafted legislation.  It is clear that considerable thought went into it.  This is an area where we need to be very careful because it is necessary to work around constitutional limitations in the appointment of judges.</p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste has indicated her intention to publish the general scheme of a Bill at the earliest possible opportunity.  Unfortunately, we have heard that on numerous occasions and we still do not have an indication as to when the general scheme will be published.  Deputy O'Callaghan has pointed out the contradiction that is facing the Government.  On the one hand it has indicated there will be no further judicial appointments until the new legislation is in place.  However, owing to failure to make appointments, even the Court of Appeal is estimated to have a backlog of about 1,800 cases, which is not acceptable and cannot be allowed to continue.  The Government needs either to make a decision to publish the legislation as quickly as possible, let us debate it and pass it, or to make a decision to recommence the appointment of judges.</p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in has a long-standing position in this area.  In 2003 in the Six Counties a criminal justice review document dealt with the appointment of judges, which led to the Northern Ireland Judicial Appointments Commission being given enhanced powers not only in the appointment but also in the removal of members of the Judiciary in the North.  That is something we have long supported and giving those enhanced powers to the commission within the Six Counties was a key part of the negotiations with the DUP in 2008.</p>  <p>  There are similarities between what the Government proposes to introduce as outlined in the programme for Government - the T&aacute;naiste has outlined some of those issues - and some of the provisions in Deputy O'Callaghan's Private Members' Bill.  For me and my party it is not just about the appointment process.  There are broader matters we need to consider.  There are very limited means of investigation into the conduct of members of the Judiciary where allegations of wrongdoing have been made.  Very few constitutional provisions govern such investigations.  We should look at that area during the passage of this Bill or if that is superseded by the publication of a Government Bill, I hope it will be contained in the Government's proposed legislation.</p>  <p>  I understand the Government is considering introducing a code of conduct as part of its general scheme.  I believe that came up in the consultation process undertaken in 2014.  If that is the case I would welcome it.  A code of conduct needs to be put in place.  In addition to a code of conduct, we also need a mechanism to remove judges and we need further discussion on the issue.  It is not contained within Deputy O'Callaghan's Bill which we are debating tonight and I have not seen it in the programme for Government.</p>  <p>  The programme for Government is very clear in what it proposes.  It proposes to get rid of the JAAB and introduce a judicial appointments commission.  It refers to the makeup of that commission and proposes reducing the number of persons being recommended to Government for consideration.  That is all well and good and similar to what Deputy O'Callaghan has proposed.  However, again there is no mention of the process for removing judges.  We need to have a serious look at that issue.  If it is not something we can do during the passage of this Bill, I hope the Government can deal with it when publishing its Bill.</p>  <p>  We could also have further discussion on the makeup of the commission.  I do not believe the Government has indicated the number of members of the commission.  It indicated it would have a lay majority and a lay chairperson.  The Bill before us tonight also proposes a lay majority.  It does not go so far as to propose a lay chairperson but nor does it rule out that possibility from my reading of Deputy O'Callaghan's Bill.</p>  <p>  Deputy O'Callaghan's Bill proposes putting into legislation the nominating bodies for those laypersons.  I do not know if it is correct to define it in legislation, but I agree that the nominating bodies need to have the expertise to know what is needed for any judge proposed for appointment.  We should have further discussion on that.  Deputy O'Callaghan has said he is open to that discussion as the Bill progresses.</p>  <p>  Section 8 deals with the terms of office of members of the commission and section 9 deals with the disqualification and removal of members of the commission.  I again return to the point that if we are to have comprehensive legislation dealing with judicial appointments, I would hope it would include a code of conduct and the removal of judges.</p><p>There is much that is of merit in having elements of Deputy O'Callaghan's Bill and some of the statements from the programme for Government, which will hopefully be reflected in the Government's Bill.  I believe this is an issue on which we can find consensus across the Chamber.  That is sometimes very rare.  On this issue, there is a general consensus that this system needs to be overhauled, that there needs to be a lay majority on any commission and consensus on the make-up of the commission and on some of the powers.</p> <p> The only other area that I believe we need to look at is ongoing training for members of the Judiciary.  Some reference is made to training for people who are put forward for appointment in Deputy O'Callaghan's Bill, but as with any other profession, if one is in a position for 20 or 30 years, one has to have that continual professional development.  It is my understanding, though I am no expert on this, that there is no requirement on judges to engage in any continuous professional development.  That is something that they should be engaging in.  Whether that can be put into any possible legislation remains to be seen, but it is an area we would like to explore further on Committee Stage if we get the opportunity to discuss Deputy O'Callaghan's Bill.  As I said, continuous professional development for judges is as critical as continuous professional development for teachers, social workers or in any other group in society.  Given the important role that we place on members of the Judiciary, it is crazy to have a situation in which they are not obliged to engage in that continuous professional development.</p> <p> We will be supporting the passage of the Bill to Committee Stage.  My suspicion is that it is going to be overtaken by the publication of a Government Bill, which I would hope happens sooner rather than later.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, has a particular interest in this and I do not think it is any secret that there are probably differing opinions within Government on how best to proceed.  I hope that those differing opinions can be resolved in the very near future.  We cannot have a situation in which we are saying on one hand that we are not going to appoint any further judges until we actually resolve this, and then have no indication of when this is going to be resolved.  It is not sustainable and something has to give.</p> <p> I commend Deputy O'Callaghan.  We will be supporting the passage of the Bill to Committee Stage.  If we do get the opportunity to discuss it on Committee Stage, I acknowledge the Deputy's willingness to look at the area of lay representation and how we nominate those people.  We will also be looking at tabling some amendments around the introduction of a code of conduct and the possibility of giving the commission extended powers to look at the removal of judges, or at least the recommendation to remove judges.  Of course, with any recommendation to remove a member of the Judiciary, there has to be a fair hearing for that member and there has to be an appeal mechanism put in place.  Again, that is probably something that we need to have a look at as the Bill progresses.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-10-26a.400" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1370" speakername="Willie Penrose" time="19:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016102600057#EEE00200"><p>I warmly welcome this Bill and I have no hesitation in offering Labour Party support for its passage into law.  I commend my colleague, Deputy O'Callaghan, for doing a fine job in publishing this comprehensive Bill.  It is sensible, constructive and balanced.  The Government has no credible excuse to delay its implementation.  It can clearly be improved upon and various amendments from all parties could be incorporated on Committee Stage.  Therefore, the Government should get on with it.</p><p>In that respect, it contrasts sharply with the proposals published by the then Deputy and now Minister, Deputy Shane Ross, in 2013.  I am glad he is here because I have a few words to say to him.  The Minister wanted a judicial appointments council to recommend suitably qualified candidates on merit.  He wanted a joint committee of the Houses of the Oireachtas to consider the recommendations and then nominate judges for appointment by the President.  However, bizarrely, he wanted our Constitution amended to stipulate that no judge or practicing lawyer could have any role at all in assessing the qualifications of the candidates or in recommending their suitability.  He said that the Constitution should also be amended to require that the Oireachtas joint committee that made these nominations had to have a permanent Opposition majority.  In other words, according to the Minister, Deputy Ross, if one wants to have a role in selecting the judges, one should either know nothing at all about either the law or lawyers, or one should lose the general election and be in Opposition.</p><p>  This is daftness on stilts.  It is so manifestly absurd that I do not understand how its author can be taken seriously as either a political commentator or a practicing politician, let alone a Government Minister.  The Minister's gadfly pesterings clearly entertained a readership in the leafy suburbs, but he has contributed nothing serious to this debate.  In Opposition he was a noisy distraction.  In Government he has become an empty space.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-10-26a.402" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1370" speakername="Willie Penrose" time="19:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016102600057#EEE00400"><p>The Minister's only remaining contribution, and I am astounded by it, is a threat to personally veto all future judicial appointments until he gets his own way.  That is a disgrace.  He regards the need to fill his political trophy cabinet as taking precedence over the constitutional principle of collective Cabinet Government responsibility.  He seems to think nothing about standing in the way of the Government discharging its basic constitutional functions as and when required.</p><p>Does the Minister know about the Court of Appeal position as it stands?  It will get worse if his tantrumic posturing is given any attention.  Some 660 criminal cases were inherited from the old court of criminal appeal.  All cases that were ready for hearing have by now been heard.  The remainder have been given a date for hearing before the end of the year.  That is on the criminal side.  However, on the civil side, the new court is overwhelmed by appeals, not just appeals against final judgments in decided cases, but appeals against summary judgments, discovery orders and procedural orders of all sorts and sizes.  There are 600 new civil appeals each year, and the court has capacity to deal with about 350 of them.  What does that mean?  It leaves a shortfall of 250 cases a year.  In addition, the court inherited a backlog of cases that were transferred to it from the Supreme Court list.  There was 1,082 of those.  There are still more than 700 of these cases to be heard.  So, when one adds the arrears that accumulate annually to the backlog of old cases, it is clear that the new court cannot ever clear its list.  That was referred to recently by an eminent academic from Maynooth.</p><p>  The old maxim that justice delayed is justice denied is clearly relevant in this situation.  I am sure that the Minister, Deputy Ross, does not want anyone to be denied justice.  This is not the fault of the six judges on the civil side of the Court of Appeal under the presidency of Mr. Justice Se&aacute;n Ryan.  No matter how hard they work, and they are working extremely hard, their backlog will continue to increase.  The solution is obvious and is staring this Government in the face.  It needs to appoint new judges to the Court of Appeal.  It does not need any kind of grandstanding or anything else.  It needs them to be appointed.  The people need them to be appointed.  The people who have the cases need them to be appointed, not anybody else.</p><p>  I am a barrister but I have no interest in being before the courts.  However, I know as a practicing barrister what is happening and I think I can give an opinion on it.  This is no time for ifs, buts or maybes.  It is no time for showboating or histrionics.  We in the Labour Party demand that the Government discharges its constitutional duty and deals with this accumulating crisis in the administration of justice, by making new appointments immediately to the Court of Appeal.  I know myself that there are at least four to six judges required immediately.</p><p>Turning back to the sanity of the Bill before us, it would establish a judicial appointments commission to recommend and rank three individuals for each judicial vacancy based on merit.  That recommendations must be merit-based and that the number of recommendations should be reduced from seven to three are proposals which are universally accepted.  I have no problem with these provisions and am happy to accept them.  They are endorsed by the judicial appointments review committee, established by the judges themselves, and by everybody else.  We are all on board.  Therefore why the delay?</p><p>The Bill also proposes that if the Government fails to nominate someone from that recommended list, it must publish a reasoned written decision for not doing so.  This is stronger than the current provision and I agree with it.  The Bill would repeal Part IV of the Courts and Court Officers Act 1995, under which the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board advises the Government.  That arrangement was part of an emergency deal struck between Labour and Fianna F&aacute;il, arising from the Harry Whelehan controversy.  In the circumstances in which it arose, it is perhaps not surprising that the package was not entirely thought through.  I accept that.  Defects in the current regime include the requirements that the board must make at least seven recommendations for each vacancy and that the recommendations are not listed in order of preference.</p><p>However, while the Act seems to give the board discretion to choose between candidates where there are more than seven, in practice the board does not operate the Act in this way.  Instead of seven names being forwarded, all applicants who are not considered unsuitable have their names sent forward to Government.  This means that in some cases dozens of names go to Government for each vacancy.</p> <p> Deputy O'Callaghan's Bill provides for a commission with a well thought out mixture of competencies.  As well as the Chief Justice and the presidents of the Court of Appeal, High Court, Circuit Court and District Court, there would be nominees of the Citizens Information Board, the Higher Education Authority, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, the Free Legal Advice Centres, the Law Society and the Bar Council.  There is also provision for gender balance on the commission.  I am pleased to see the Bill lists as qualities needed in a judge integrity, independence and intellectual skills, as well a sound temperament and common sense, which are most important attributes, composure, courtesy, consideration and communication skills.  The commission should also have regard to the importance of promoting gender and cultural diversity, and of ensuring a sufficient numbers of judges with proficiency in the Irish language.</p> <p> There are one or two issues that I hope we have an opportunity to consider on Committee Stage.  One arises from the fact that a judicial career is embarked upon after a career in practice.  I fully support this.  I believe it is a feature which enhances judicial independence.  Our judges are not schooled before appointment.</p> <p> The State cannot and should not compete against the market in terms of the remuneration it offers to judges, but the State can compete in terms of its pension offering.  The salary package for judges should make it an attractive option for practitioners to consider well into their 50s and even early 60s.  The recent changes we made to that offering were a mistake, particularly since the savings made, in the overall context, were insignificant.  If agreed on Committee Stage, perhaps the Bill could become a vehicle for reversing those changes, particularly with regard to pensions.  The judges recommended that an advisory board or commission should be empowered not just to rank candidates but to designate any particular candidate as outstanding.  They also said it should be empowered to inform the Government when it considers there are not sufficient candidates of sufficient quality.  I would be interested to hear Deputy O'Callaghan's view on these two recommendations.</p> <p> I see no need to wait any longer for a Government alternative to the Bill.  We have more than just the bones of a workable solution here.  With a bit more work on Committee Stage, incorporating what Deputy O'Brien and other contributors, including those from the Government have said, we can have a new system up and running within a matter of weeks rather than months.  Therefore, I have no hesitation in joining other Members in commending the Bill to the D&aacute;il.  I call upon the Minister to expedite the introduction of a judicial conduct Bill, which I have called for on numerous occasions and which the Chief Justice has also sought in recent speeches.  The Bill before us should also be expedited to ensure two important Bills are passed in the House, which would make a massive contribution to the administration of justice in the country.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-10-26a.404" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1281" speakername="Mick Barry" time="19:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016102600058#FFF00200"><p>I strongly suspect there may be more nonsense spoken on this subject than perhaps any other subject that is debated in Irish society.  Much of it relates to the so-called independence of the Judiciary.  I will start by making a couple of points on this.  To illustrate the point, I will take a couple of quotes from members of the Judiciary.  In 2012, when he was the head of the Association of Judges of Ireland, Mr. Justice Peter Kelly said appointments to the Supreme Court were &quot;purely political&quot;.  In the same year, Judge Michael Pattwell said his appointment was political, and expressed the view that all appointments to the Bench by the previous Fine Gael and Labour Party Government were of judges with Fine Gael or Labour Party connections.  In 2011, the <i>Irish Independent </i>pointed out that of the 168 judges on the Bench of the State, 56, exactly one third, had what the newspaper described as &quot;personal or political connections to political parties&quot;.</p><p>It is not just their connection with political parties which makes members of the Judiciary part of the ruling elite in this country.  It is also the salaries and the lifestyle they lead.  In 2010, the European Commission for the Efficiency of Justice completed a survey of judges' pay in 46 European countries.  It found that in the Irish State judges' pay was among the highest of any of the 46 countries at three times the European average.  It was not three times the lowest rate, it was three times the European average.  I did a check before I came in here, and I stand to be corrected on these figures, but the latest figures I was able to get, which may be one or two years old and may underestimate the position, is that a Supreme Court justice would receive a salary of &euro;197,272 per annum and a District Court judge would receive &euro;122,512 per annum.</p><p>The social position of judges in society was illustrated rather well by an occurrence in the High Court in 2012, when a case was taken by a small construction company against Cement Roadstone Holdings, CRH.  The judge presiding over the case, Mr. Justice John Cooke, had to withdraw from the case when it was pointed out he had shares in CRH.  It was not &euro;1,000 worth of shares or &euro;2,000 worth of shares, but &euro;135,000 worth of shares in the company.  He had not ruled himself out of the case, which had been going on for a year or two, because he was not aware of the fact he was the owner of those shares, which says something in and of itself.  It is not just the political connections of the judges, it is their social class, their wealth and their income.  This is in a society which is more divided now than ever before on grounds of income and social class, which is part of the legacy of the Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny.</p><p>The Central Statistics Office tells us the wealthiest 10% of households in the State now own more than half of household wealth at 53.8%, but the bottom 20% are in negative territory and owe more than they own.  For people who find themselves at the top of the social pyramid, their psychology, class outlook and class bias are built in.  How can it be otherwise?  It is reflected through members of the Judiciary and is shown very clearly in their attitude to social protest.  In 2003, more than 20 men and women from working class communities were imprisoned for campaigning against bin charges in the State.  In 2005, five brave men, the Rossport five, were imprisoned.  Injunctions against workers on strike, trade unions and trade unionists are a regular occurrence.  We had this with Marine Terminals in the docks in 2009, the Greyhound dispute in 2014, and with Aer Lingus in 2014, with a threat to bankrupt the largest union in the state, SIPTU, with an injunction.</p><p>There is also a bias against the left in the Judiciary.  I will give examples regarding my own party.  In July 2015, one of our councillors, Councillor Mick Murphy, applied for a permit from the local Garda chief superintendent to collect funds in the run up to an election, to use for election purposes.  This man is of good character and has never been convicted of any offence.  The Garda superintendent turned down the application on the grounds it would encourage, directly or indirectly, unlawful acts and protests.  This was at the height of the anti-water charge campaign.  When the ruling was appealed to the District Court, the judge said, &quot;We are talking about door to door collections here ... which at best could be described as an invasion of privacy in the home or nothing short of coercion upon that individual to give in circumstances where they might not wish to.&quot;  The judge was Judge Michael Coghlan.  He had been the director of elections for the Labour Party in the 2009 European Parliament elections in the Leinster constituency, a campaign which I presume involved going door to door and knocking on hundreds of thousands, or perhaps tens of thousands, of doors.</p><p>The verdict handed down last week by the judge in the case of the 17 year old individual in the Jobstown trial, the so-called Joan Burton protest in 2014, and I will deal with the broad principles of it and not go into huge detail, was chilling for anyone concerned about civil liberties.  Judge John King found the 17 year old, who was 15 at the time of the protest, guilty of false imprisonment, a charge which is in the same league as kidnapping.</p><p>He was involved in a protest that blocked a Minister's car and he called on others to block the car.  He walked backwards holding a mobile phone asking the Minister to talk to us.  He may momentarily have been blocked by someone himself, thereby blocking the Minister and her adviser briefly.  The implications of that ruling are that anyone involved in a sit-down protest, a form of protest employed on hundreds of occasions since the foundation of the State by many different groups, including students, trade unionists and farmers, is potentially committing a criminal offence which is in the same league as kidnapping.  It is a comment on the rather tame character of journalism in this State that this ruling has not excited a greater degree of critical comment to date.  Judge John King was appointed by the Fine Gael-Labour Party Government in 2015.</p> <p> The Bill tinkers with the judicial appointments system in a minor way.  It has some positives, which we welcome.  The legislation makes it more difficult for the Government to pick its own favoured judges in a nakedly partisan way, improves the gender composition of the Bench, which could be important in domestic violence cases and so on, and provides for training for judges.  Training should involve addressing the behaviour of some judges to improve their dreadful approach to members of the Traveller community who appear before the courts.  I have some quotes relating to comments made in our courts in recent years about members of the Traveller community but I do not have time to go into them.  Changes are needed to judicial appointments and the judicial system in significant measure.  With regard to important key aspects, those changes are not to be found in this Bill.</p></speech>

People often correctly give out about politicians but at least we have to go before them once in a blue moon and there is some element of accountability and right to recall whereas the Judiciary is completely and utterly a law unto itself.  It is great that so many judges perform so well but we are stuck with those who do not.  While I am glad Fianna F&aacute;il introduced the Bill, the measures will only go some way to improving the quality of the judges we end up with.  The idea that somebody could be in such a position of power because of political connections rather than merit and so on is absolutely reprehensible and I welcome the measures in this regard.  However, we need to put the spotlight on this issue.  Substantial reform in this area is critical.  The lack of training and regulation of judges is a huge problem.  When they behave irrationally, nothing can be done.  The idea of justice not only being done but being seen to be done cannot happen in our State while the Judiciary is organised in the manner it is currently.</p>  <p>  I would like tell to story and I assure the Chair that the story, even though it involves a court case, will not go into details of the case in front of the judge but it is a graphic example of what I am talking about.  It is incredibly fresh in my mind because it happened today and it involved me and a judge in Naas District Court.  The history of this case is that I was summonsed to appear before Naas District Court on a driving offence.  I allegedly drove at a speed of 59 km/h in a 50 km/h zone.  Three weeks ago, I was called in respect of the case.  The case was not listed for a hearing on that date; it was to be the first mention in court.  When I arrived in court, the case was No. 188 on the list and the judge is well known in the area, for whatever reason, for not starting judicial proceedings on time.  Even though the court is scheduled to begin at 10.30 a.m., he regularly appears much later than that.  There is also a tradition of cases being religiously taken in order.  In every court sitting I have ever attended as an observer, defendant or plaintiff, the judge normally goes through the list, dispenses with the cases in which a court date is being sought and keeps back the cases that are due for hearing in order to efficiently administer justice and ensure the management of the time of all the people who end up in the court on the day, including those who take time off work to attend because they have been summonsed as witnesses or defendants, solicitors, garda&iacute;, prison officers and so on.  My case was listed as No. 188 out of 188.  The judge proceeded with the cases for the morning.  I watched what was happening in them, and then I instructed a solicitor on this minor driving matter and left the court at lunchtime.  Later that day, I attended an Oireachtas committee meeting and I was not to know that the judge having reached case No. 175-----</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-10-26a.408" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1259" speakername="Clare Daly" time="19:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016102600059#GGG00400"><p>I am.  It relates to the fact that judges are not subject to any accountability whatsoever and to the huge costs the State can incur because of their irrational behaviour.  When the judge was finishing up for the day, he had reached case No. 175 but decided to jump to the end of the list and call case No. 188.  He called the solicitor before the court and asked him where was his client, even though I had instructed the solicitor, and what reason I had for not being there.  The reason was I had been there in the morning and had watched how this judge had dealt with cases.  I witnessed cases being called for which people did not turn up on similar charges or did not have a solicitor.  No Bench warrants or any other proceedings were dealt with.  A judgment was simply given in those cases.</p>  <p>  Judges are an incredibly powerful position.  I respect our court system and I respect the fact that judges have discretion but that discretion has to be exercised proportionately and rationally and when it is not, there has be some body in place to call them to account.  The judge could accuse me, without any recourse on my part, of disrespecting the court.  By doing that and issuing a Bench warrant in those circumstances when I clearly was not a risk of absconding - the case not even listed for a hearing and he dealt with other cases earlier without issuing a Bench warrant against those who were not there or who did not have a solicitor - the consequence of his action was that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which was an innocent victim, was subject to massive negative publicity that it had orchestrated this.  A sergeant had to leave his post in Newbridge, drive in a squad car to Swords and spend the day there vacating the order at enormous expense to the State.  I had to return to Naas District Court today to listen to the same judge lecturing me about disrespecting his court, not giving me an opportunity to say anything about his irrational decisions but, at the same time, carrying on.  Our laws provide that nobody can do anything about that judge but he is causing huge problems with regard to the administration of justice given the inefficiency of the court sittings in his district.  This needs to be radically reformed.  I am glad that Fianna F&aacute;il opted to introduce the Bill today because it is long overdue.  This is only one aspect of judicial oversight and we need to go further.  I acknowledge a judicial council is included in the Government's programme but some outrageous decisions and behaviour are taking place in our courts.  In fairness, the presidents of the District Court, Circuit Court and so on can do nothing about it.  That cannot be allowed to continue.</p>  <p>  Judges have been appointed to areas or even communities in which they worked as a solicitor and this has led to conflicts of interest.  They presided over cases involving people they formerly represented and proceeded to hear the cases, which is completely wrong.</p><p><i>8 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p> <p>The option of challenging judges through a judicial review is not sufficient because one is putting oneself in a position of massive expense and accusing a judge of bias, which people do not want to do.</p> <p> Other Members have made points about some inconsistent decisions which have been made with far more awful consequences than mine.  I wanted to use my case as an example of the utterly ludicrous behaviour of some of the people we have entrusted to manage our courts but no one can do anything about it.  The saddest point about the case I referred to is that the judge in question is the sitting judge in Naas District Court.  This means he can stay there for as long as he likes.  From looking at him today, he has a few years left in him.  The court could have him for about 12 more years.  The expense to the State of having 100 garda&iacute;, solicitors and people tied up every day while he operates his court place like I described is utterly ludicrous and in radical need of change.  I support this Bill as a first step in that process.</p></speech>

Tosach maith, leath na hoibre.  It is a tiny baby step, however.</p>  <p>  Under the Constitution, judges are appointed by the President, acting on the advice of the Government.  The existing system of appointment involves the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board submitting to the Minister for Justice and Equality the names of the persons who have applied for judicial appointment and whom it recommends for appointment.  The Minister then brings these names to the Government which, in turn, submits its advice to the President.  It all seems to be a transparent, accountable and fair process.  However, the reality is different.  The intrusion of political favouritism in the appointment of judges has been ongoing since the foundation of State.  If it was not, then there would be no need to reform the current system.  Goodness knows from what we heard tonight and from what we know, the system is in bad need of reform.  Talking about reforming the procedures for the appointment of judges has been doing the rounds since 2013, or before that.  I compliment the stance taken by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, who has insisted how members of the Judiciary are selected and appointed be completely overhauled.</p>  <p>  Deputy Penrose, who is a barrister - he did not declare that, although he never hides it - gave a lecture recently in which he was scathing about the Minister, Deputy Ross, and about what he said before he went into government and what he is doing now.  Deputy Penrose said that according to the Minister, there were two qualifications to be a judge, namely, know nothing and lose the election.  While Deputy Penrose did not lose his seat, the Labour Party was fairly banished in the last general election.  It is almost a shipwreck now.  While I have great respect for Deputy Penrose and the legislation he has introduced, he can apply that to his own situation.</p>  <p>  We must have a declaration of interests for judicial appointments.  I sat for a long time in the Government formation talks, in and out with the Minister, Deputy Ross, and many others.  There was ferocious resistance when I looked for a declaration of interests for judges to be part of the programme for Government.  If they could have banished me to hell or to Connacht from Government Buildings, I would have been banished that day.  There was ferocious upset and annoyance with me, as if I were off my rocker.</p>  <p>  We heard Deputy Clare Daly's case and we know what goes on in the courts.  There was the scandal of the CRH case and the judge.  I brought some of the small families into this House, I have gone to court with them and I have attended CRH annual general meetings with them.  The judge who was hearing the case, denied justice to ordinary families and small business people who gave employment and were wonderful people in their own right.  They were gobbled up by this conglomerate, CRH, while the Competition Authority stood idly by.  The judge was prepared to sit on the case when he had millions of euro worth of shares in CRH.  When he was forced off the Bench, he declared he had forgotten or did not know he had the shares.  When one is dealing with this kind of issue, there has to be transparency.</p>  <p>  There are many good judges who work hard in the family and other courts.  However, there are many bad ones too.  Once a judge is appointed, he or she is a judge for life.  The retired District Court Judge Pattwell, who was quoted tonight, admitted he was appointed politically.  I know why and when he was appointed and who did so.</p>  <p>  I was in the Circuit Court for 17 days on the most spurious of charges.  The Minister, Deputy Ross, wrote a chapter in a book about it.  What was allowed to be published, after the barristers dealt with it, was honest and forthright, showing part of what went on.  I was singled out by a special judge when I looked for a special sitting.  It suited everyone but my barrister said I would never get it.  I did get it.  The eminent judge I got was hand-picked by the party introducing this Bill to come down to get me out of this place because it did not want me in here.  I have said this to Members privately but they tell me I am daft and mad.</p>  <p>  I am sure Members will have watched the film "Double Jeopardy".  I was meant to be in two different courts, the Circuit Court and the District Court, at the same time on the same day.  This was totally unfair and it was impossible for me to be in two courts at the one time.  My case went on for 17 days at enormous cost.  There was naked political corruption in the case.  Thankfully, I was before a jury of my peers and, after 17 and a half days of a sitting, they decided I was innocent of any charges.  However, there was no redress.  I did not get any expenses or anything else.  I paid the price, as did my late mother and many other family members who were tortured in that way.  It stinks to high heaven.</p>  <p>  The good work done by judges is being negated by the craziness of some of these people.  I have gone to the Four Courts with the New Land League, Jerry Beades and many others, trying to assist people.  In one case, a poor woman was meant to be brought to the court in a prison van.  I must thank the prison warders for being so kind to her by bringing her in a car instead.  She was not able to stand up or talk.  I could not hear a word of the recently appointed judge, who was not so long ago around here advising the Labour Party, Mr. Justice Humphreys.  She could not hear him either.  This happens in many courts.  I protested by trying to stand beside her on the Bench as a lay litigant but I was not allowed to do so.  Justice delayed is justice denied.  Justice unheard is a farce.  The lady was not able to stand but the judge would not allow her sit.  The treatment was degrading, insulting and disgusting.  Thankfully, she is out now and living in Tipperary, although she is from Cork.</p>  <p>  One cannot hear a word that goes on in most courts.  The judges do not care.  It suits the barristers fine.  They will do the talking while we pay up and shut up.  It is terrible that in most cases one cannot hear a word as it is all done between the barristers.  If one takes a case to the High Court, where up to 500 cases can be brought, one must have a solicitor, a junior counsel and a senior counsel.  It is a racket.  The barristers do not object to it because it is an industry.  Out of 50 cases, 40 could be settled on the steps of the court against the wishes of the clients, like in my cases where people were claiming money from me for accidents.  The whole barrister and legal system needs to be reformed because it is a cosy cartel.</p>  <p>  Litigation is responsible for the 40% increase in car insurance prices.  It is robbery and deceit.  Insurance for families and young people has been hijacked, resulting in many not being able to afford it.  One only need compare the number of whiplash claims in England to those here.  The system is rotten.  Many people face eviction from their homes because their banks have taken them to court or sold on their mortgages and loans to vulture funds which have done so.  They have no hope when the judges sitting on their cases will not declare they owe millions of euro to the very same banks.  I have been at more court cases like this than I want.  They involve unfortunate people.  The Garda is now being used to deny people like me going into the court as lay litigants.  It is an abuse of power.</p></speech>

I salute the Minister, Deputy Ross, for what he is trying to do in government.  I saw the resistance when I looked for a declaration of interests from judicial appointments.  All Members must make one.  What is so precious about judges?  Are they an endangered species?  Mention was made of the new Court of Appeal and all the cases it has heard.  The establishment of that court was forced through this House with no accountability as to how many cases it would hear, when it would do so or the costs involved.  There is no justice for ordinary people because they cannot afford it.</p><p>The barristers are not jumping up and down to change that any time soon, and neither are the solicitors.  There are many good solicitors and barristers but their rates are exorbitant and prohibitive.  Justice over-charged for is justice denied.  We have heard of judges who do not declare, will not declare and are untouchable.  They retain their positions for life, with no requirement to take refresher courses, which I have looked for in the past.  Numerous times in the past I have raised in this House with Fine Gael the matter of a judicial council Bill, as did the Minister, Deputy Ross, and many others.  It is supposedly a commitment in the programme for Government.  When will it be published?  It appears to me to be very far down the line.  We need the political appointment of judges removed from politics.  While models elsewhere, including Spain, are working well, the model here is not functioning.</p></speech>

I think that as a Republic we are a success, although not in every way.  We all have failings.  People watching the proceedings of this House might on occasion think we are a shower of clowns and as such we are not a success.  I have an endearing respect for the State.  I respect the flag, the harp and our institutions.  I am currently reading a book about the history of the 1916 Rising by Charles Townsend, an English historian who writes brilliantly about the men whose statues are displayed around this House.  I have huge regard for them in the context of the foundation of our State and for their inspiration in starting that.  I also read another book by Charles Townsend about the period 1920-1921, which inspired me even more.  We won our independence through the people's courts.  Through our collective refusal to recognise English law our country became ungovernable and we made a historical leap.  The collective sense that we were able to manage our own legal system broke an empire.  I still get that sense when I go into courts and I see the same iconography, the same flag, the same harp.  The Acting Chairman, Deputy Catherine Connolly, knows that the courts in this country are not all flash and modern: they are old, decrepit and run down in many ways but I get a certain pride from that.</p>  <p>  I am nervous about speaking from personal experience.  To be honest, I believe one of the strengths of our judicial system is its independence.  Much as I respect what I have heard this evening from Deputy Mattie McGrath and Deputy Clare Daly and yesterday from Deputy Paul Murphy in terms of their experiences in their individual court cases, I am slightly nervous of our mixing personal experience of the judicial system with our role, which is to legislate and be connected with the courts in an integrated synchronised way to protect and develop our constitutional Republic, which I stand by, as I am sure everybody else here does too.  My experience, although I do not propose to speak about any individual court case, is one of concern.  I recall being told by friends of mine, one of whom is a sergeant in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, that a particular person would not make it because he or she was not the right political colour.  One might similarly hear at The Bar that a particular person is likely to get a case because he or she is of the right political colour.  There is that sense in The Bar that to get appointed a person has to be part of one tribe or another.  I do not like that.  I do not think it sits with the tradition of an independent Judiciary that has the confidence of all the people, which was the foundation stone of our State in 1918-1919 when we took onto ourselves a separate judicial system, a people's court system.</p>  <p>  I would like to relate one other personal experience which occurred towards the end of my time in government, which was a particularly tense and difficult time within this State.  During my time as a Minister with responsibility in the industrial area I was approached by someone who was interested in investing in the State.  The investment never took place and so it does not matter.  However, I met the person in the context of trying to encourage investment in the country.  The person, who was an intellectual who came from a country with a lesser independent judicial system, told me that he or she wanted to invest in Ireland because this is one of the few countries in the world where a person can take a case against the Government and have a 50:50 chance of winning, depending on the merits of the case.  I note the Minister, Deputy Ross, is nodding.  That is a reasonable characteristic of the independence of our judicial system.  It says something about the strength of this country.</p>  <p>  Deputy Clare Daly is correct that every court is important.  The District Court, in terms of how a judge applies the law, is as important in some ways as the Supreme Court.  That is the strength of our State.  The people's court starts with how we treat every citizen in the District Court.   For all our failings, including in the judicial system and the appointment of judges, in which I was involved when my party was in government, although I was not particularly comfortable with the nature of the judicial appointments process, in terms of appointments to the High Court and the Supreme Court, we have managed to maintain an independent Judiciary, to appoint some of our best people to the Supreme Court and to develop on the founding strength we had in 1919 or 1920.</p>  <p>  Deputy O'Callaghan's proposal is a positive one in that it retains the final selection process within the political system, which I believe is right.  I believe that constitutional balance is right.  I do not believe we should be handing the entire selection process over to some independent so-called arbitration system.  It is right that be retained by this assembly of Deputies, which is akin in some ways to the very juries that are the cornerstone of our judicial system.  We are ordinary citizens who happen to be elected representatives.  It is appropriate that our elected Cabinet, similar to a jury - there are 15 members of Cabinet and 12 members on a jury - would make the final call.  It is equally appropriate that we try to wash away some of the legacies of tribal politics around whether a barrister is a Fine Gael barrister, a Fianna Fail barrister, a Labour Party barrister or a Green Party barrister.  I do not think that is necessarily strong or good for our judicial system.  The proposal advanced in this Bill is that a public appointments system would present a choice to Government and the representatives of this House but that the final choice would rest with the political system.  Part of the strength of, and reason for, our independence is our strong independent constitutional system.  Part of that is this House and the Government which makes the Executive decisions which have to be tested in this House.</p>  <p>  Drawing again on personal experience I have a friend who was very involved for many years in environmental campaigning in India, a country with a similar constitutional structure, very much inspired by our independence revolution movement and our ability to break from the empire.  The parallels are uncannily close.  The Indians fought in huge numbers - approximately 1 million, I think - in the First World War with the promise of home rule which was never delivered, similar to the Arab people.  India finally achieved its independence and established a constitution that is very similar to ours.  It has had a slightly different experience in that while its high courts are very proper and, no doubt, august and independent, much of its judicial system is not to my mind as independent as ours has proven to be.</p>  <p>  We need to be careful and to look after the baby as we change the bath water.  The proposal from Fianna F&aacute;il in this case does that.  The Green Party is happy to support this Bill, to stand up for the independence of our judicial system and the right of the political system to be the final arbiter of choice and to stand up for the Republic as ordinary citizens representing people in this House in the same way as ordinary citizens stand in a court as part of a jury to make decisions on behalf of all other citizens.  That is right and proper.  It is what we all seek to defend today.</p></speech>

I welcome the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill and I congratulate my colleague, Deputy O'Callaghan, on bringing it forward.  It seeks to establish an independent commission which will recommend and rank suitably qualified persons for appointment to the Judiciary.  It is a merit based system that will aid transparency, fairness and independence in terms of the appointments of all judges.  We are fortunate in this country to have a proven and independent Judiciary.  Justice must not only be done: it must be seen to be done.  This Bill, if enacted, will aid transparency of the independence of judges by providing a merit based system of appointment.</p><p>It is also a timely Bill.  We understand that judges cannot be appointed until such a Bill is passed.  We have a farcical situation.  The non-appointment of judges suggests that the Government takes the view that it has an entitlement to play around with a key pillar of our democracy for the political whims of some.  Such a Government is willing to indulge notions of grandeur.  The Judiciary is the guardian of our Constitution and the arbiter of disputes.  It is vital to the proper functioning of our democracy.  By withdrawing judicial appointments, the Government brings the judicial system into disrepute and undermines the separation of powers.  I agree with Deputy O'Callaghan that the non-appointment of judges is potentially in breach of the Constitution, in particular where non-appointment is for political reasons.</p> <p> The non-appointment of judges is not only important because of the importance of the Judiciary itself and its constitutional role, it is important primarily because of the implications for victims.  It is those who find themselves in court who are the real victims of delays in the appointment of judges.  The victims of the Government's attitude are those who find themselves before the courts through no fault of their own in family law, civil and criminal proceedings.  If one goes into the High Court tomorrow to seek a date for a civil case, one will not get a listing until approximately March 2018.  That is 16 to 18 months away.  Even if one turns up in March 2018, one's case might not get on.  In the Central Criminal Court, the wait is 18 months.  This is after a serious criminal case of murder or rape has actually been prepared by garda&iacute; and the DPP.  When a victim or witness turns up after 18 months and another key witness or expert is not available, the case will not be heard and will go back for another 18 months.  There are criminal cases which are not seeing completion for over a decade after they first come before the courts.  Meanwhile, the alleged perpetrators are on bail year after year.  That is fine if they are innocent, but where is the justice in having those people out on bail for such lengthy periods if they turn out to be guilty?  How many criminal cases have been lost and how many prosecutions have failed because of delays in our courts?  Over time, the memories of witnesses dim and people start to have self doubt.  Victims or witnesses die and evidence may be lost.  In the Court of Appeal, the delay is six to eight months.  To have sufficient numbers to hear cases, the Court of Appeal is pulling judges out of the High Court, which increases the delays in the lower court.</p> <p> All this is hugely important.  Whether they are people in family law disputes, civil disputes, victims or witnesses in criminal cases or innocent persons who are charged with an offence, they all have their lives put on hold.  I have seen people in the courts as year after year drags on and their physical and mental health deteriorates.  In those circumstances, it is wholly unacceptable that there would be any delays in the appointment of judges.  In circumstances where there is now a perfectly acceptable Bill before the House, in Deputy O'Callaghan's legislation, I urge Members to support it and drive it on.  If the issue of non-appointment of judges drags on and there is a challenge by a victim or a witness where a case collapses on foot of delays, imagine the embarrassment for the Government.  More importantly, imagine the embarrassment for the State if the courts found that the failure to appoint judges for political reasons was in breach of the Constitution.  It would bring the entire system into disrepute on an international level.</p> <p> The losers in all of this are the victims.  Their physical health and mental health is at risk.  Ultimately, the loser could be the State itself.  We have heard several times that justice delayed is justice denied.  It is not an empty phrase.  It is a very meaningful one for those who are in the courts on a daily basis and going through delays which constitute what I consider a quiet nightmare.  It is something to which very little attention has been paid.  I encourage people to attend to it because it is a quiet nightmare for all those involved in court cases.  Most people will never have anything to do with the courts and on the rare occasions they do the stress involved is phenomenal.  I have heard so many people over the years say that they were sorry they had ever gone to court and made a complaint because of the delays involved.  I urge the Government and, in particular, the Minister, Deputy Ross, to support Deputy O'Callaghan's Bill.  Let us bring forward and enact a Bill that is fair and will bring about the transparency and independence needed to allow us to get on with the appointment of judges and, once again, restore credibility to the judicial system and the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-10-26a.419" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" time="19:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016102600062#KKK00200"><p>I thank everybody who contributed on the Bill so far.  It contrasts markedly from debates in the House over the last few years which have been very divisive and witnessed a unity in opposition to exactly the proposals included in the Bill.  The only group to do anything about judicial independence and judicial appointments in the past was the Independent group.  In the past, Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Labour Party have united in opposition to Bills of this sort.  As such, I congratulate Deputy O'Callaghan for introducing a very constructive and radical departure for a major political party in this debate.  It has taken a great deal of courage and imagination to put forward such an encouraging change.  For a barrister to do it is remarkable and should be noted.  Having said that, the Bill is not radical enough.  It should be more radical, but a major step has been taken in this discourse by all the parties in the House and it is indicated that something is happening which is different, albeit not everything.  Something is happening in the Judiciary which is being resisted, but which people in the House have the courage to take on board.  While there are differences between the Fianna F&aacute;il Bill before the House today and the Bill the Government will introduce shortly, we will also see if we are mature about it a unity of purpose.  We will be able, not in a very short period of time, to have a completely new system of appointing our judges.</p>  <p>  One or two speakers have taken up the reasonable point that it is wrong to block or oppose the appointment of further judges until the legislation is introduced.  Deputies Brown and Penrose made the point.  I understand what they are saying about some justice being delayed, although I do not think the problem is as acute as it might be because not that many judges are due to be appointed.  However, the history of this particular subject has been cursed by delays, pretence and Governments continuously coming forward to say they are looking at this, will address it and have commissions sitting here, there and everywhere on it.  However, nothing ever happens.</p><p> My fear, which is justified by the evidence of the past 20 years and before that, is that if delays are allowed, permitted or encouraged, nothing will happen.  There is already a major backlash against the sort of proposals contained in Deputy O'Callaghan's Bill and those the Government will introduce.  The powerful voices the Judiciary are already being heard and are mobilising against this.  We must ensure that this goes forward and that radical change is enacted.  The only way to do that is to appoint judges quickly.  The only way to pass legislation quickly is to take that stance.  I fear, with justification, that delay will mean it will never happen.  By insisting on this course, things will happen very quickly.</p> <p> This particular problem arose in and around 1995 when the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, JAAB, was established.  Deputy O'Callaghan knows the make-up of the board because he has suggested some substantial reforms to it.  However, I do not think people realise that the current composition of the board is a stitch-up.  It comprises political appointees and lawyers.  Let me remind the House who is on the board.  It has 11 members.  The Chief Justice chairs it, there are four court presidents, the Attorney General, a political appointee for the past 20 years and, before that, a nominee from the Bar Council and a nominee from the Law Society, all of whom are either political or legal insiders.</p> <p> The only three people who do not come under that category are what they so cosily call three lay nominees but they are also political appointees.  They were appointed by successive Governments that chose people with whom they felt safe.  This was done in the same manner in which all political appointees are nominated in this country.  They are people who, almost invariably, have identifiable political colours.  That is the system that we must reform.  This is a carve-up between lawyers and politicians.  No wonder there is resistance to that reform from lawyers and politicians.  That is what is happening today.  It is very difficult to break what is an appointments cartel of lawyers and politicians.  The first step is being taken here today.</p> <p> No doubt Deputy O'Callaghan and any other barristers in the House will be aware that the JAAB is known in the Law Library as "JAABs for the boys".  It is ridiculed by its own people.  In this House I have heard for many years lawyers who are also politicians saying that political connections do not matter.  People on these benches have said that.  It is patent nonsense.  I will not dive into the depths of breaking the protocol in the House by naming those who have been appointed judges because, as has been admitted very honestly by Deputy O'Callaghan, of their political colour.  Everybody knows them and knows that this is happening.  It is happening because it is Buggins' turn.  It happens under Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Labour Party.  That is what we are trying to break and we will break it.  If it takes another month or two to do so, that is all right.  It must be done quickly.</p> <p> Rural politicians have told me that they have queues outside their clinics and people knocking on their doors asking if there is any chance of an appointment to the District Court.  If people in this House are honest, they will confess that is what has happened to them and has been the normal route to the District Court.  They come through the JAAB system, which is a farce.</p> <p> I understand that the board has to nominate seven members for each appointment.  The clear evidence is that the numbers have gone up to 40, 50 or 60.  The names go to the Minister via the system by which people are chosen by those who are politically appointed.  The decision goes to the Cabinet and the Minister who, no doubt, has been lobbied in turn picks someone who is from his or her political colour.  That is what has been happening.  Does anybody in this House know how many interviews the JAAB has held over the past 20 years?  It has the power to hold interviews, but in 20 years it has not held a single interview held for a judge's job.  That is what we are trying to reform and what is so important about what we are discussing.  That is why it is so important that the main political parties accept that.</p> <p> The Bill tabled by Deputy O'Callaghan is a tremendous step forward.  I said it is not radical enough because the programme for Government specifies something which is loathed by the judges - but patently necessary - namely, that there must be not just a reduced number of legal personnel but a lay majority on the board.  We can no longer have an arrangement between political nominees and judges.  Not only must there be a lay majority on the body choosing judges, there must also be a lay chairperson.  There is a difference between our Bill and that proposed by Deputy O'Callaghan.  I understood his Bill states that the Chief Justice will remain in place.  It is a reasonable point of view but I do not agree with it.  The power should not rest with the Chief Justice in this particular area.</p> <p> I would like to take up one point made by Deputy Mattie McGrath.  Judges should be subject to far greater scrutiny, not just in terms of being able to make them leave office in different ways than is currently the case but they must also be subject to disciplinary action.  The idea that they should not be obliged to make declarations of interest is totally and utterly wrong.  It would serve their purpose if they did not see themselves as above this sort of transparency.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-10-26a.421" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1296" speakername="Jim O'Callaghan" time="20:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016102600063#LLL00200"><p>I thank all Members who made contributions on the debate for reading the Bill and for the thoughtful contributions that have been made.  Many Members spoke about issues concerning the Judiciary that go beyond the appointments process.  I do not intend to reply to them.</p>  <p>  The debate indicates that there is a necessity for legislation in respect of a judicial council, something that was promised and which the Judiciary sought.  This is a matter with which the House should deal.</p>  <p>  I refer to the comments made by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald.  I would like to deal with one or two issues in response to what she said.  She made a number of comments in respect of the Bill.  She said in respect of appointments for the position of Chief Justice and the presidents of the courts that I sought to limit the appointment of those persons within the courts.  That is not correct.   In respect of the proposal I have for the appointment of an individual as Chief Justice, I propose that any member of the superior courts would be eligible.  That would also apply in respect of the President of the Court of Appeal and the President of the High Court - any superior court judge would be available for the appointment.</p>  <p>  The Circuit Court presidency should only be available to an individual who is a member of the circuit court, and I say the same in respect of the president of the District Court.  I do not think it is a good idea that individuals who are not judges are appointed to positions where they would be running courts. </p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste said, in the context of her Bill, that she would like to see a facility for District Court judges to be eligible for appointment to the High Court.  This House and the Government should be careful about promoting judges through the different ranks of the Judiciary.  There is an obvious necessity to appoint High Court judges to the Court of Appeal or from the Court of Appeal to the Supreme Court.  Sometimes Circuit Court judges are appointed to the High Court.  However, if District Court judges are eligible for appointment to the High Court, I would be concerned that some ambitious individuals may seek to curry favour with the Government so they could get those promotions.  We do not want that in the Judiciary.</p><p>A judge looking for promotion is not a good judge.  Deputy Jonathan O'Brien made reference to the removal of judges.  That is a matter to be dealt with by the House and I believe there is legislation in place to deal with such an issue, if it ever occurs, under the Constitution.  The supervision or disciplinary matters in respect of the Judiciary are matters to be dealt with by the proposed judicial council.</p> <p> I welcome Deputy Penrose's speech.  He made a valuable contribution with regard to my statement.  It is the Government's constitutional duty to fill vacancies when those vacancies appear in courts.  The Government can take a period of time in which to nominate individuals to fill those vacancies, but if the Government delays unnecessarily or disproportionately then, in my view, it is getting close to breaching its constitutional duty to fill those positions.</p> <p> Contributions were made also by Deputy Mick Barry but I am not sure whether or not the Deputy intends to support the Bill.  He said that there are parts of it he welcomed and part of it was merely tinkering with the legislation.  I note also the comments made by Deputies Clare Daly, Mattie McGrath and Eamon Ryan.  I will correct one of Deputy Ryan's assertions.  Sometimes politicians have a slightly incorrect view of lawyers and what happens and the individuals who are barristers.  I think it was Deputy Ryan who said there were a lot of barristers who seek to affiliate themselves with political parties in the hope that this will promote their careers.  In my opinion, it is extremely damaging to a barrister's career to get involved in politics.  People will think the barrister is not serious about his or her career and it can have a damaging impact.  If I was giving advice to any young barrister who was anxious to develop a strong practice, I would say stay away from politics.</p> <p> I will now turn to the issues that were raised by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, in his speech.  The Minister made a number of points, some of which are valid, but I fear that he is missing the main point.  The Minister believes that this is all some cosy cartel where lawyers are getting together with judges and appointing their mates to the Bench.  That is not correct.  The biggest problem this State faces currently is that we cannot get enough quality people to apply for appointment to the superior courts.  The Minister, Deputy Ross, refers to it as "JAABs for the boys".  I have been working in the law library for 23 years and I have never heard that.  What I have heard is that people are desperate to try to get applicants to apply for positions on the Bench and in the past six or seven years that has changed considerably.  It used to be the case that people, when they got the age of 55 and having had a good strong practice as a lawyer, would apply to do a job as a High Court or Supreme Court judge.  That is not happening anymore.  It is a real crisis.  We have to ensure that we seek to attract the best people to fill these positions because they play an extremely vital and important role in our society.</p> <p> I say to the Minister that I am happy to work with the Government and with him on any legislation that the Government intends to introduce.  We are told that the Government is going to introduce legislation shortly.  I do not know what "shortly" means in a political context but I know that under the supply and confidence agreement that my party has with Fine Gael, there is a requirement on any Bills that pass on Second Stage to be brought to Committee Stage within ten weeks.  That brings us to the beginning of January 2017 and I want my legislation before the committee at the beginning of January.  The Fine Gael Party has an agreement with my party that this will happen.  If the Minister, Deputy Ross, knows that his legislation is going to be introduced in the D&aacute;il before then, so be it.  We could look at it and maybe put both pieces of legislation to Committee Stage at the same time.  If, however, it is not in on time and if it is not in by January this Bill will be proceeding on Committee Stage.  Lyndon B. Johnson said that the most important trait in politics is being able to count.  I know that in the House there are approximately 80 Members who will support my legislation.  I do not, however, want to put myself in a position where I am in conflict with the Government; I want to work with the Government.  I would have thought that the appropriate mechanism would be for the Government to put down amendments to my legislation if it wants to get its proposals in at the same time.</p> <p> The Minister, Deputy Ross, said that the Judiciary is desperate for this not to happen.  That is not correct.  The Judiciary put in a submission a number of years ago with regard to how it wanted the appointment process changed.  The Judiciary accepts and recognises that judicial independence will be enhanced if there is a transparent process whereby people are appointed to the Bench solely based on merit.  There is no dispute in the House that people in the past were appointed to the Bench because they had political affiliations.  Not all of them and not even the majority of them, but a lot of them were.  As I said at the outset, a lot of them were appointed to the Bench despite the fact that they had political affiliations with a party which was not in government at the time.  It is incorrect to state that there is some great conspiracy out there trying to stop this radical legislation.  I do not deserve any credit and I do not deserve any medal for bravery for introducing this legislation.  It is perfectly coherent legislation that all Oireachtas Members should be thinking about.  It is something that should have been done in this House long ago, I accept that.  I welcome the fact the Minister, Deputy Ross, is interested in this area but it is instructive that the Minister, who has been in the Oireachtas for 35 years, is now putting it forward as the main issue of concern in government.  In my respectful submission the Minister, Deputy Ross, has misidentified what is the problem.  The problem is not that this is a cosy cartel: it is not.  The problem is that we are finding it difficult to attract the best persons to be appointed to the Bench.  It is also important that we should retain governmental control of this process, as required under the Constitution.</p> <p> My final point is around an area where there was some dispute with regard to the membership of this board that would make recommendations.  In my view, the board should be chaired by the Chief Justice.  As I said earlier, if I have an interview panel to select a person to be an editor of a newspaper, I want somebody on that interview panel who knows how newspapers operate.  The last thing I want is a collection of lawyers on an interview panel deciding that they think they know how it operates.  Being a judge is a very specialised and particular skill.  We need to have people with knowledge of that and who know how courts operate.  We do not want this mythical group of lay people, who know nothing about the courts, who give the appearance of transparency, who then sit in a room looking at each other wondering how to decide between two competing individuals.  For that reason, we need to have people with knowledge of the courts in this body.</p></speech>

Section 3 amends the earned income tax credit to increase the value of the credit from &euro;555 to &euro;950.  While it is a small step it is a very welcome measure for the self-employed.  They need to be supported because they are the backbone in trying to recover Ireland's economy.</p>  <p>  Section 4 deals with the home carer tax credit.  While the increase is most welcome it simply does not do enough to benefit families who care for their children in their own home, which is very important.  The benefit to families is limited, particularly since tax individualisation, as one-income families pay more tax than dual income families on every euro earned.  We cannot discriminate against one-income households particularly in light of the newly introduced child care scheme.  I appeal to the Minister to review the workings of this scheme.  During the budget debate some people took umbrage with me but it is not just my belief as studies have proven that the best place for a young child to be raised, certainly in the first six months of their lives or longer, is in the home.</p><p>I have nothing at all against child care.  It is very necessary.  My own children were in child care.</p> <p> Section 7 extends the home renovation incentive scheme for a further two years.  I had proposed this scheme in my pre-budget submissions for many years and I welcomed its introduction.  If it helps families and small businesses and limits the potential of the black market, it is very welcome.  The scheme is working successfully.  I suppose I have to declare an interest as I put new windows in my house under this scheme.  It is an important scheme that gives small business people great opportunities and cuts out the black market.</p> <p> Section 8 deals with the first-time buyers scheme.  I have huge concerns in this regard.  I have told the Minister, Deputy Coveney, this in committee.  I am slightly pleased that an amendment has already been proposed to avoid over-borrowing but it is a matter of concern that this was not raised at the outset.  The Central Bank rules and the requirement that 80% of the price of a house would have to be borrowed support the more well-off and not ordinary couples who want to build houses or buy second-hand homes.  These people, who might have some savings, want to work and perhaps have their own house on a family site.  Not to allow this was a retrograde step because there are many who are forced to sell houses or want to sell houses so that they can trade up or down.  The scheme is narrow and negative.</p> <p> Section 11 extends the start-your-own-business relief for a further two years and this is most welcome.  T&aacute; f&iacute;or-fh&aacute;ilte roimhe sin.  We need those who are qualified, educated and have the vision and the enthusiasm to start their own businesses and we need to stimulate and support them.</p> <p> Section 14 makes a number of amendments to the living city initiative.  While the amendments in this regard are welcome, they simply do not go far enough.  What about our living towns, our rural towns and our villages?  It is not all about Dublin, although it seems to be.  There are other cities as well.  I am not being anti-Dublin, but we need the rural towns and the county towns too.  A tax incentive scheme could revitalise Ireland&rsquo;s largest towns and provide badly needed homes and, more importantly, bring life back into our towns.  This should not have been ignored in budget 2017.  It is crazy that in certain towns there are streets on which no one lives.  We need to be imaginative and get people back living in them, thereby reducing the housing list.  We are making living towns but the shops close at 6 p.m.</p> <p> Preliminary findings from the analysis of census 2016 by the Heritage Council of Ireland reveals that there is more than 10,000 vacant non-holiday homes in 17 of the larger towns across the country.  That is bizarre.  Those homes should be utilised.  Where they are built, finished and ready, they should be used.  The living city initiative, which is currently confined to parts of the cities of Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway, Waterford and Kilkenny, must be extended and targeted at some of the country&rsquo;s largest provincial towns, including Clonmel.  The latter, which was the largest inland town until quite recently, has 536 vacant homes.  Imagine it.  Nenagh has 603 vacant non-holiday homes and Thurles has 499 vacant non-holiday homes.  There are 3,000 approved applicants on the housing lists in Tipperary.  Those vacant homes would half the lists.  We need to use our imaginations and introduce stimulating legislation.</p> <p> There are homes in our towns which are lying idle, which are almost derelict and which could be put to good use but for the cost of redevelopment, particularly the taxes and charges.  An individual in my town of Clonmel had a business that closed down not so long ago.  It was a relatively new business, in operation for perhaps ten years.  He could convert the premises to four or, possibly, five apartment units.  He went to the planners with his agent for a pre-planning meeting.  His bank would not loan him the money but his accountant told him to run away from it in any event because he would have to pay 50% of the costs in development charges, planning fees and God knows what.  Four families could have been housed in what is an empty but pretty modern building that will become derelict.  Where is the imagination?  This has been a gravy train for the county councils but they need to wake up and smell the coffee.  Those charges were brought in during boom times.  They need to be reduced so that business people such as that young man who has a young family to do this.  He cannot let the premises because no one will take it up.  He wants to change the use, but the process in that regard is too slow, arduous and costly.</p> <p> Such an extension could play a major role in revitalising these towns and deliver thousands of habitable dwellings for homeless families and workers.  It is not rocket science.  We can have all the plans and homeless conferences we like, and I sympathise with anyone who is homeless, but we are achieving nothing.  The answer is right in front of us and all that are needed are some slight amendments to the legislation and a bit of imagination.  County managers and chief executive officers of councils should be instructed to get off their high horses and change the rates.  They might say it is a matter for local authority members, but they all should be instructed as I have outlined.  In the context of the most recent county development plan for towns in Tipperary, I made a submission to the effect that if there is a need for a change of use, this should be quite easy to facilitate.  There would be no need to be reckless.  We can observe the planning laws but we need to cut down the costs and the red tape.  Do not say it is a no-no and that it would be a contravention of the plan.  Have it in the plan that it can be done.</p> <p> While I welcome the extension of the living city initiative, we simply cannot ignore the towns.  The Government has given a commitment to rural Ireland and an extension of the living city initiative to a living town initiative would be a first step in the right direction.  I looked for that in the programme for Government as did the Rural Independent Group - including Deputy Danny Healy-Rae and others - and the Independent Alliance.  This needs to be examined and delivered upon.  I have just given the example of the planning charges, and there are many more I could give.  They are just too prohibitive.  Amendments to the county development plan are not wanted.  They are not listening.  It is a closed shop.</p> <p> Section 17 amends the income averaging regime for farmers.  The IFA and other groups lobbied for this.  I agree with and welcome it but I am concerned that the regime only allows farmers to elect the averaging regime for a single year but we know that there could be two very difficult years in a row.  What options are available in this regard?  This is very badly needed.  Farmers are not trying to get out of paying tax.  In a year such as this, however, when the price of milk, beef, cattle and cereals are through the floor, they experience difficulties.  In difficult years, it is not viable to produce those items and crops to which I refer.  What will farmers do?  They should get some way of writing off this year and levelling it out.  They will pay it.  I am not saying that they do not pay it.  They will pay it.</p> <p> The amendment relating to vulture funds is very disappointing.  Section 21 amends section 110 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 and tightens the loopholes used by vulture funds to pay an effective zero rate of tax on profits made on financial investments.  It is like closing the stable door when the horse has not only got out but has gone off around the coast.  It is ridiculous.  Vulture funds and big investors availed of loopholes for far too long and, while I welcome the fact that it was brought in immediately, the whole area of retrospection should have been examined.  We hear all kinds of stories every day.  We hear that AIB has sold off lots of the loans.  There is something going on there because there is an eerie silence in cases I am involved in.  They are in stalemate and are not being moved on at the moment.  I am worried that they are all going to be sold off by banks that we bailed out and literally own.</p> <p> Section 25 reduces the capital gains tax rate, which is again very welcome for the self employed and farmers.  It is also very welcome by vulture funds and therein lies the problem.  We have new vulture funds in the country, which include the equine empires.  I welcome them and support them.  Coolmore Stud is one in my county.  It gives great prowess to the racing industry, great enjoyment and good employment to people and support in respect of community issues.  However, these funds will not stop - and cannot be stopped - gobbling up, grabbing and taking over all the land, including most of that in south Tipperary, as well as in south Kilkenny, west Waterford, east Cork, and now Kildare and north Tipperary.  They are everywhere.  This has to be stopped because this welcome measure was intended for families to be able to pass on land without capital gains tax.  The long and the short of it is that with these vulture funds we do not know from where the money comes.  They can outbid anyone and they closed down the place when they buy them.  They just bulldoze them.  They bulldoze the fences, put up new ranch gates and hire security firms.  A snipe would not get through the ditches not to mind, say, a rabbit getting a look in.</p> <p> This is bad for Ireland.  I lobbied the Government but it has not dealt with this matter.   It suits the big conglomerates.  The same applies to the vulture funds.  While the measure was necessary, I sought a land cap of 750 acres, which is more than beneficial to anyone.  It should be a lot less, but I stuck it at 750 acres.  It was ignored in the budget.  The Government will have to step in.  These funds now have so much land in Tipperary it is the equivalent of 100 farmers each having a family farm of 120 acres.  This is totally unacceptable.  It does not affect the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's area but it affects all the good land.</p><p><i>9 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p> <p>We are back to the landlords and the penal times and we do not have a land commission or anyone looking at the issue.  The Government and its predecessor have adopted a hush-hush policy, as did the Government before that, of which I was a supporter.  The policy is that we must not touch these people because they are paying the parties handsomely and supporting them.  This is utterly wrong and immoral.  Ordinary families have to leave.  Where will we get our schoolchildren or our football, hurling and camogie teams?  How will we fill our community halls?  We will have a wasteland for horses only.  </p> <p> While I do not find anything wrong with the increase in the price of cigarettes because they are bad, I feel for small shopkeepers.  Similarly, the legislation on alcohol is killing and crucifying small self-employed shopkeepers.  The Government will not tackle the supermarkets, Coolmore Stud and other conglomerates because those that are big and powerful must not be touched as their lobbies are too powerful.  Meanwhile small shopkeepers are being denigrated, destroyed and subject to onerous taxes.  Cigarettes will be sold on the black market, resulting in a loss of revenue to the Government.  Black market cigarettes are much worse for the health of smokers and increasing the price of cigarettes provides support for illegal industries.  </p> <p> I would say much more if had time.  I welcome the Ceann Comhairle back to the House.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-10-26a.432" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1320" speakername="Danny Healy-Rae" time="20:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016102600066#OOO00200"><p>The Government's credibility will depend on the success of the housing strategy it announced some weeks ago and again in the budget a fortnight ago.  Many young couples are disappointed that the Finance Bill does not provide any help to first-time buyers who purchase a second-hand home.  It is also unclear whether repossessed houses in housing developments that fell into other people's hands will qualify as new houses.  The help-to-buy scheme is unfair to persons whose first home was repossessed as these people never owned their homes because they were taken from them on the basis that they could not pay for them.  It is sad that no facility has been provided to this group when they seek to buy a home.  It is unfortunate and unfair that they will not be classed as a first-time buyer.</p>  <p>  I am glad houses in County Kerry are not as expensive as in other places.  I am aware of a farmer's son who wanted to borrow &euro;100,000 from a bank to build a house.  The bank would only lend him &euro;180,000, which the amount it stated it would cost to complete the house.  It would then be more suitable for the bank to get rid of the house if the young man found himself in the position that he could not pay for it.  He only wanted to borrow &euro;100,000 because he has brothers who work in the building trade and he could get other help to do much of the work involved.  The bank will not give him less than &euro;180,000, which would be grand except his income means he does not qualify for a mortgage of &euro;180,000. </p>  <p>  In other parts of the country, the help-to-buy scheme will assist first-time buyers paying up to &euro;600,000 for a house.  If a buyer needs to borrow 70% of the cost of &euro;600,000 home, he or she will have to take out a mortgage of &euro;420,000.  To obtain such a facility from a bank, the borrower's gross annual income would have to be &euro;120,000.  People on incomes of &euro;33,000 or at most &euro;40,000 believe this is wrong because the scheme will help upper-income earners to the detriment of lower-income earners.  The scheme seems to be designed for the wealthy rather than the poor.  I and many others are very hurt by this because it is not fair that it facilitates people earning &euro;120,000.  Others have been left out, for example, people seeking to purchase a second-hand home to do up with funding from the home renovation scheme in order that they can put a roof over their heads.</p>  <p>  The help-to-buy scheme is unworkable when one considers the figures.  A person seeking a mortgage of &euro;420,000 must have an 84% deposit.  The Government's attempt to rectify the housing problem is poor and will not succeed.  We also have many other problems in the housing sector.  It is clear, for example, that only four or five construction companies will qualify under procurement rules to tender for national or State building schemes.  This is unfortunate because smaller builders who have stood the test of time will not get a look in or a smell of these tenders.  They will do the building for the bigger companies and many of them will not get paid, as happened many times in the past.  This is very unfortunate.  Many issues need to be rectified but the budget made no attempt to do so.  The biggest problem facing the country is housing and we are not properly addressing the social housing aspect of the problem. </p></speech>

One of the main features that was focused on was the help-to-buy scheme, which I described as the help-to-sell scheme in my response to the Budget Statement.  The sentiment I expressed turned out to be true because in the immediate aftermath of the scheme's announcement, media reports suggested the price of some new houses jumped by approximately 20%.  Across media outlets, we heard many potential first-time buyers say they were terrified the measure would lead to price rises and make an uphill struggle even more difficult.  In my local area in Kildare, prices in one development increased on the very evening of the budget.</p>  <p>  Despite claims to the contrary from the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, and Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Coveney, on the floor of the House, it became obvious within hours of the budget that the Central Bank of Ireland had grave concerns about the help-to-buy measure and its potential to impact on the market and undermine the very rules the Central Bank had put in place to try to protect first-time buyers or at least keep prices at a stable level.  Both Ministers were adamant that the Central Bank had given them the go-ahead for this measure.  Within 48 hours of the much feted measure being announced, it was being rolled back and we see in section 8 of the Bill that it has been altered.  These alterations are not sufficient, however.  Just yesterday, Davy Stockbrokers revised upwards the growth forecast for prices in the residential housing market.  While I acknowledge that this could be driven by a number of factors, the scheme appears to be one of the drivers of this upward revision.  Davy Stockbrokers now estimates that property prices will grow by 7% in 2017, due in part to the help-to-buy measure or help-to-sell scheme as I describe it.  The net effect of the scheme will be to raise property prices.  I ask the Minister of State to explain how higher prices will help first-time buyers to purchase a home.  </p><p>Even if we ignore the issues of affordability that the measure creates, there is another serious flaw, which is that it splits the market of prospective first-time buyers between those who can afford the new builds that developers are providing and those who seek more affordable options on the second-hand housing market.  It is very difficult to see how we can ensure a social and demographic mix with such a policy.  I come across many people who are looking for solutions because they are in a home they bought before the crash that is now way too small for their family's needs at this point.  It is not that there are not starter homes.  In many cases, it is that the wrong people are in the starter homes or too many people are in homes that are too small.  The totality of this needs to be looked at.<br/><br/>It is for that reason the Social Democrats will table an amendment to the Bill seeking to remove what we see as a retrograde measure in its entirety.  We believe the housing crisis should be tackled, but not by rehearsing failed policies of the past.  We had a first-time buyers grant in the past which was simply absorbed into the cost of houses.  That was the reason given in this House as to why it was dispensed with.  We need to grasp the bull by the horns and tackle the supply at source in the here and now by utilising fiscal measures designed to immediately make thousands of vacant units available as housing options.  For example, for every 1% decrease in the vacancy rate, and we have one of the highest vacancy rates in Europe, we would release approximately 5,000 housing units which are immediately available rather than being units that must be built.  It is obvious that is where some of the emphasis should have been put.<br/><br/>We also intend to propose the removal of the special assignee relief programme.  This is designed to provide a tax relief for those specialists who are deemed deserving of a special tax arrangement by virtue of their expertise.  This measure costs the State an average of &euro;20,000 per employee every year and it runs over a period of five years.  We believe that if a company believes an employee is specialist enough to warrant such remuneration, then the employer should pay for those costs rather than the State.<br/><br/>There is a principle of equality in the tax system.  That issue of equality is one that runs through a number of other areas, and is one I will return to later.  Part of the reason that people are not coming to live here or are not staying here is the cost of living, with the cost of housing one of the big contributors.  There are a number of things that need to be done in this regard.  It is not clear who has responsibility for the land bank that comes under various Departments, State agencies and semi-State agencies.  It seems to us this is one thing that prevents the amalgamation of a range of different house types being built, including housing for sale, local authority housing and housing for rent.  We feel this is a practical step that should be taken.<br/><br/>Measures in regard to a minimum effective rate of corporation tax are needed.  If we need extra Revenue staff, that needs to be implemented to make sure the 12.5% rate is the effective rate.  I would welcome the extension of the home improvement tax relief.  More can be done on this and we could be more ambitious.  With regard to the whole area of climate change, the housing stock is one of the three big areas along with agriculture and transport, to each of which we need to pay attention.  The first one, housing, is the more difficult of the three but something ambitious could be done in regard to retrofitting homes.  We import a huge amount of oil every year and reducing that would have a positive impact on the economy.  The website <i>www.daft.ie</i>undertook an analysis recently which referred to the number of vacant houses available in the country.  When it looked again at the figures, there was a significant redundancy rate within the vacant housing stock which is caused primarily by the fact houses are left vacant and allowed to become derelict, without heating and so on.  Reducing that vacancy rate may well reduce the redundancy rate.<br/><br/>We believe the housing fund could have been much more ambitious.  We rarely come across a situation where ICTU and IBEC both agree but one of the areas they agreed on was the need to expand the capital side of the spend.  I know a smoothing effect was used, which is very welcome.  However, there needs to be a negotiation at European level, particularly around funds to be spent directly on building houses.  There is an emergency fund at European level but house building would not qualify because a natural disaster is required to leverage that fund.  However, one could not say this is anything but a disaster and there is no end in sight to what is a major emergency.  There is broad support for such a negotiation and it could save a substantial amount of money by reducing the cost of housing and increasing the housing stock.  In the rental sector, I am now hearing that people are entering bidding wars in order to rent a house and the amounts being paid have gone through the roof, if the House will pardon the pun, even in the last three or four months.<br/><br/>I referred to land management, which is a big issue.  If we are to reduce costs, the scale at which we build is important.  The State has a land bank but that does not appear to be co-ordinated.  That co-ordination needs to happen as a matter of urgency.<br/><br/>I want to deal with the issue of equality, which is very much a budgetary issue.  I remember the day equal pay for equal work happened because I was one of those people who got a bigger pay cheque that day.  It is one of those big days in my life that I remember.  Essentially, I was sitting beside a man who started the job after me and did the same work but he got paid more than I did.  On that day, I got an equal pay packet.  What is going on in regard to teachers, nurses and garda&iacute; is wrong.  I listened to the Minister this morning.  He was pushed over and over again, and asked whether he supported equality of pay for equal work in principle.  He ducked and dived and would make no commitment, even in principle.  There has to be a response to that.</p><p>One cannot have people doing exactly the same job for different amounts of money.  Pay restoration is certainly happening but people possibly do not believe it is happening quickly enough.  The principle of equal pay for equal work needs to be stated.  It needs to be stated clearly in the House that the principle should be applied.</p> <p> As I stated, there are certain provisions in the Bill that we welcome and there are some very significant ones that we oppose.  The issue of housing has been badly handled.  Given that it is the number one issue and that it has reached crisis level, that is more than disappointing.</p></speech>

I am so sorry about this but I have to be in a certain place at 9.55 p.m.</p>  <p>  I am glad to have an opportunity to speak on this important legislation.  I will add my humble contribution to those made by numerous Deputies in the course of the debate.  Housing and the lack of it have rightly been identified as a major issue.  The Government has put in place very considerable investments and supports to address this.  It has made available &euro;5.3 billion over the next few years.  It is a matter for the powers that be, the local authorities on which we all served, to utilise the funds available as quickly as possible to provide the housing necessary to meet the needs of our people.</p>  <p>  I listened carefully to the speeches this morning because I was in a position to do so.  I was particularly impressed by the contribution of Deputy Connolly, who clearly has an understanding of the housing problem from having worked directly with the people in need of housing.  Her contribution was realistic and based on clear knowledge of the issue.  She did not attribute anything to anything other than the need to deal with the issue through the normal system of provision, whereby the local authorities provided housing directly for people within their catchment areas.  We all know that policy became old-fashioned over the years.  Gradually, it was pushed to one side and eventually everybody relied upon the private sector to provide rental property.  This did not work and could never work.  Some of us present, including the Ceann Comhairle, pointed that out at the time.  Unfortunately, nobody listened to us at the time.  It is only now, several years later, that we find the damage done was colossal in more ways than one.  One thing that happened at the time in question was that responsibility for the main stream of local authority housing was given to voluntary housing agencies.  The agencies are particularly good at dealing with special housing needs and supports but they were not equipped to deal with the whole housing problem, nor could they ever be so equipped.  It was not their statutory responsibility.  It was a dream, a pipe dream, and it simply did not work.</p>  <p>  The measures put in place by the Government are realistic, forthright and urgent.  They recognise the need to do something about the matter in the shortest time possible.  In such circumstances, we need to allow the matter to take root and settle.  We need to go back to the old local authority housing loans.  There are several tranches of demand in this housing area.  We did away with the old local authority housing loans and the system has become very complicated in recent times.  There is now an assessment group that takes some days to assess eligibility for a loan.  This is crazy because, as the Ceann Comhairle and I well know, it does not take any more than 20 or 30 minutes, if one has the information, to make an assessment.  Either the person has the capacity to repay a certain amount or he does not.  There is not much sense in saying that if a person is five, seven or ten years in a job, he or she has a better chance of repaying because nobody has an absolute guarantee of a job at any time, including Members of this House.  Suggesting a person has a better chance of getting a loan if he or she has been a certain number of years in the job is one of the most ridiculous suggestions I have ever heard.  We all know it depends on the job and how long it will stand for.  This is in somebody else's hands.  There is no risk-free lending.  There is no such thing as a guarantee of the ability to pay and there never has been.  That is not what lending is about.  We need to clear this up and reintroduce the loans to which I referred as a matter of urgency.</p>  <p>  We need to reintroduce the use of private developed sites, or what we used to call private sites, through the local authorities.  They were extremely effective and efficient in delivering houses to the people who were at the first stage of being able to provide a house for themselves.  For instance, young garda&iacute;, nurses, professionals, local authority workers and civil servants had a great opportunity, and many of them availed of it.  They provided themselves with a house without ever burdening anybody else.  If they had not done so, they would now be crowding the system and driving up house prices by virtue of creating more competition in the marketplace.  Private sites and county council loans can be incorporated into the plan, even after the passage of the Finance Bill.  I hope they will all be utilised as quickly as possible.</p>  <p>  House prices in this country are way too high.  I had the temerity to mention that at a meeting of the housing committee recently and there was absolute uproar.  People tore their hair out and beat their breasts stating it was an appalling thing to say.  I had suggested a Deputy's salary would not service a loan of more than &euro;250,000.  It would not, should not and could not.  Two and a half times the income of the main earner was always the norm in the determination of the ability to repay a loan.  Now people on the same salary as a Deputy are expected to service a loan of &euro;300,000 to &euro;400,000.  I cannot understand for the life of me how people could expect that.</p>  <p>  We have inherited much of the high pricing from the boom time.  It is a legacy issue.  Everybody felt it was better to be living in a very expensive house.  We all lived in more expensive houses during the boom.  I did not notice any difference.  I did not feel any better getting out of bed in the morning and walking down the hall, and I did not feel very lucky to be living in a very expensive house.  Everything was relative to the prices everywhere else.  Whatever the market determined at the time was what we were committed to.</p>  <p>  Consider the circumstances when and if house prices stabilise.  It will take a little while because there are people who will be caught in relative negative equity in the climb-down.  A house worth &euro;600,000 or &euro;700,000 is pricey.  It is not a first-time buyer's house, no matter what happens.  We need to be very careful to ensure the lending market is not taken over by people who have resources and need more to extend a loan or improve their chances of building a house at the kinds of prices in question.  If it is at all possible, I hope we will graduate in the direction of encouraging a decrease in prices.  The Central Bank of Ireland is quite correct in doing whatever it has to do to keep the prices down.  There is nothing to be gained from everybody having a house worth &euro;1 million.  It creates circumstances in which nobody else can buy.  I am not looking at anybody on the other side of this House.  God forbid that I would be in any way suggesting that anybody on the other side of the House would have a house like that.</p>  <p>  I would love to go on but I must conclude.  I am grateful to the Ceann Comhairle and Deputy Donnelly for having allowed me this opportunity.  Perhaps my colleague on whose time I infringed will take a full slot if he gets the opportunity in the course of the evening.</p></speech>

As I have laid out previously, if the current situation is allowed to continue, with vulture funds paying virtually zero taxes, the State will lose out on &euro;10 billion to &euro;20 billion in taxes it should be collecting and that would be collected in other eurozone countries.  That amount of money would obviously make a huge difference if invested in public services, housing, infrastructure, communities and the supporting of enterprise.  The tax avoidance we see does not need to be curtailed, rather it needs to be shut down completely.  That is the stated intent of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, and the Government and the Finance Bill is the mechanism with which to do it.  The question for us, therefore, is how the Bill measures up to the Minister's and the Government's stated intent to shut down tax avoidance by vulture funds.  Having analysed the proposed changes and consulted industry experts, I would like to make four points, the first of which is that the amendments made in the Bill do represent genuine progress in shutting down tax avoidance by vulture funds.  The second is that, in spite of this, the amendments still allow multiple loopholes that will allow vulture funds to continue to pay almost 0% tax.  The third is that the amendments include new loopholes that could lead to even greater tax avoidance in the property sector and beyond.  The fourth is that the new loopholes relating to property tax could make the existing commercial property asset bubble even worse, leading to a knock-on deterioration in the housing crisis.</p>  <p>  I will go into more detail on each of these points, but, before I do, let us recall how little tax vulture funds pay in Ireland.  In the past few years they have spent about &euro;40 billion in buying loans from NAMA, IBRC and the private banks.  Based on numerous filed accounts by vulture funds, they appear to be making annual profits in the region of &euro;3 billion.  Were the State taxing these profits in exactly the same way it taxes all other companies in Ireland, it would take in an additional &euro;1 billion a year in taxes.  These are some examples of what is actually being paid.  </p>  <p>  In 2014 Tanager made &euro;9 million in profit and paid &euro;500 paid in tax, giving an effective tax rate of 0.006%.  In 2015 Mars Capital made &euro;11 million in profit and paid &euro;250 in tax, giving a tax rate of 0.002%.  In 2014 - my favourite - Beltany made &euro;36 million in profit and paid &euro;250 in tax, giving a tax rate of 0.0007%.  Believe it or not, that is a tax rate that is 43,000 times lower than the rate at which Irish companies all over the country are paying every year.  At this rate we are looking at lost revenues to the State of about &euro;10 billion.  However, it gets worse because that is just the figure for lost taxes from vulture funds on the interest payments they are receiving from families who are paying their mortgages and businesses in servicing their commercial loans.  The values of the underlying assets are increasing as loan impairment costs fall and property prices rise.  Based on the accounts of several vulture funds, it seems that if capital gains were also taken into account, the State would receive an additional &euro;10 billion in tax.  Therefore, taking into account profits for the vulture funds on both interest payments and in capital gains, the State is looking at avoided taxes in the region of &euro;20 billion.</p>  <p>  The Finance Bill does represent some real progress in shutting this tax avoidance down.  First, marking to market has been explicitly ruled out.  Had it not been, vulture funds would have been able to avoid billions of euro in capital gains tax on gains they have seen to date in the value of assets.  Second, a 20% dividend on withholding tax has been applied to a new class of property investment fund known as Irish real estate funds, IREFs.  Third, the Revenue Commissioners have been given stronger powers of oversight over section 110 schemes, the financial vehicle of choice for tax-avoiding vulture funds.  Unfortunately, in spite of this progress, the Bill leaves several other loopholes open and provides for some new ones.  The result, as it stands, is that vulture funds will be able to continue paying taxes at close to 0%.  Many vulture funds set themselves up as section 110 special purpose vehicles.  This makes them exempt from all taxes, including VAT, stamp duty, corporation tax and dividend withholding tax.  Instead, they are meant to pay a flat tax rate of 25% on their profits, but, as can be seen in the examples I have given, they reduce their declared profits to almost zero, yielding a few hundred quid on tens of millions of euro in profit.  They do this essentially by making loans to themselves at very high interest rates.  The loans are located offshore, typically in zero-tax jurisdictions such as the Cayman Islands and the interest rates on the loans are adjusted upwards to account for all the profits generated in Ireland, leaving no profits to be taxed here or where the loans reside in the Caymans and other places.</p>  <p>  The Finance Bill states these loans must now offer a "reasonable commercial return", which is welcome.  This is an attempt to stop profits being moved offshore using very high interest rates.  However, the Bill does not state whether this applies to existing or to new loans only.  If it does not apply to existing loans, the vulture funds have nothing to worry about and can continue to place offshore all of their profits, as they currently do.  However, even if it does apply to existing arrangements, we have evidence of lending rates in Dublin in the case of commercial property of greater than 15%.  A few corporate finance tricks can then be used to justify a "reasonable commercial return" of, say, 20%, and that 20% will be enough to keep things going as they are, with no profits being declared in Ireland.  We, therefore, need to amend the Bill to ensure this provision on a "reasonable commercial return" will apply to existing arrangements and that reasonable commercial rates will reflect normal banking rates, usually around 3% or 4%, not the higher rates of 15% or 20%.</p>  <p>  Even if we were to do this, there is another loophole because the Finance Bill states the new restrictions will not apply if the loans are listed on a stock exchange as a collateralised loan obligation, commercial mortgage-backed or residential mortgage-backed securities.  It takes about two weeks and about &euro;50,000 in legal fees for a vulture fund or any other financial institution to take all of its loans and have them packaged in a nice prospectus and listed on a stock exchange.  Once it does this, we are back to zero taxes.  This loophole smacks of very heavy lobbying by the industry.  I am told it has the financial advisers very excited because if this can be done for vulture funds, it can also be done for every other financial corporation holding loans - for example, banks, pension funds and life assurance companies.  Therefore, in effect what the Bill would be doing in allowing this is creating a new market in mortgage-backed securities based on tax avoidance.  What would the result of this be?  Not only would vulture funds be able to continue to avoid paying taxes, so too would a new host of other foreign investors, essentially taking a sizeable asset base out of the Irish tax net.  This new mechanism needs to be deleted from the Bill.</p>  <p>  Even if we were to do this, there will be yet another loophole because the Finance Bill provides for IREFs to be exempt from capital gains and withholding taxes once they hold an asset for five years or if it is owned by something called a collective investment undertaking.  Therefore, if all else fails, if we manage to clamp down on interest rates and somehow not have them list their loans on a stock exchange, vulture funds can make an internal transfer of their loans from the section 110 company to the IREF.  They can backdate the move to before 5 September and then organise the IREF to be owned by a collective investment undertaking located offshore and, yet again, they will pay zero tax.  Therefore, with all of these loopholes still available, it is unlikely that the Bill, without significant further changes, will have much effect in stopping tax avoidance by vulture funds and the Department of Finance agrees.</p><p>The budget estimates that additional revenues through these changes for next year will come to &euro;50 million.  Based on the profits being earned by the vulture funds, that &euro;50 million would represent an effective tax rate of about 0.7%, so we are still good.  We may no longer be at the 0.0007%, but 0.7% is also not acceptable.</p> <p> Not only is the Finance Bill as it stands unlikely to succeed with vulture funds, but it appears to facilitate new tax avoidance in the property sector and beyond.  For example, the amendments appear to open the door to tax avoidance by any Irish company worth over &euro;10 million.  How is that done?  Any Irish company worth over &euro;10 million can go through a set of legal and financial steps which would allow the owners of the company to no longer own the company but to own a loan to the company.  This loan could be used, as they are now by the vulture funds, to suck all the profits out of the company, into a section 110 vehicle, and then offshore, thereby avoiding all corporate taxes.</p> <p> As already discussed, the Bill also creates a mechanism for commercial and residential mortgages to be offshored, moving them into a tax-free world, but there is more.  Through IREFs, it also creates a mechanism for funds to buy commercial property directly and never pay any taxes on income or capital gains.  So the owners of commercial property will not have to pay any tax and the owners of the loans to property will not have to pay tax.  Therefore, we are now at risk of taking the entire Irish commercial property sector, one of our biggest asset classes, out of the Irish tax base.  No other eurozone country does this and neither should we.</p> <p> If we do, two things will happen.  First, the corporate tax base will be significantly eroded.  Second, an existing asset bubble in commercial property will inflate further.  Dublin is now the second most expensive commercial property market in the eurozone.  Why is this?  We have about the same cost to build and more or less the same average wages as everybody else, so commercial property prices should be about the same here as they are in the rest of the eurozone, but they are not.  Commercial property in Dublin is now the second most expensive in the eurozone, which is cause for concern.  That is an asset bubble.  It is happening because we are offering massive tax incentives to people investing in commercial property.</p> <p> So demand increases and rents become too high for businesses.  With such high returns, zoned land is developed, not for housing which is what we need, but for offices and other commercial property because the returns on developing commercial property far exceed the returns on developing residential property.</p> <p> Why are we giving tax incentives to foreign institutional investors to maintain this bubble?  Why are we on the verge of making this bubble worse by giving even more tax breaks?  Are we not afraid of Irish banks lending Irish deposits yet again against inflated property values?  Is it not better to have commercial property investors paying Irish taxes as they do in the rest of the EU?  Do we not want more rational Irish commercial property prices, against which our Irish banks can lend safely?</p> <p> If we are serious about shutting down tax avoidance in the domestic economy, I offer my suggestions as to what the Finance Bill needs to do.  First, section 110 status must be ruled out fully for all activity in the domestic economy.  Once a tax free vehicle is allowed to exist in the domestic economy, smart accountants and clever lawyers will find ways of using it, as I hope I have already demonstrated they are already planning to do after the enactment of the Finance Bill.</p> <p> Second, the five-year capital gains exemption should be removed from the IREFs and we should properly tax Irish commercial property.</p> <p> Third, any amendments giving tax exemptions for listed mortgage-backed securities should be deleted.</p> <p> Fourth, all Irish companies paying reduced Irish taxes should file publicly accessible accounts with the Companies Registration Office.  We only found out about the vulture fund tax avoidance because section 110 companies have to file their accounts publicly.  However, many other tax-avoidance vehicles do not, meaning we have no idea what is going on in other parts of the economy.</p> <p> I have prepared a detailed policy note which I will send to the Minister, Deputy Noonan, for consideration.  I will also send it to Members of the House.  My hope is that these changes can be incorporated on Committee Stage.  If they are not, we can look forward to continued, growing, massive tax avoidance leading to underfunding in public services and infrastructure; a growing bubble in commercial property with rising rents for businesses; the Irish banking sector lending into another commercial property bubble; and a lack of development of residential housing, leading to yet higher prices.</p> <p> If we make the changes, we can look forward to something altogether better: better public services, higher quality infrastructure, thriving communities, reduced costs of doing business, more affordable housing, a level playing field for businesses paying their taxes in this country and, critically, less risk of yet another property and foreign-capital-fuelled bubble and collapse.</p> <p> It is entirely up to us, as legislators, to make this choice and in the coming weeks we will find out what choices are made.</p></speech>

We have come a long way when one takes a view from 2011 when our country was spending 50% more than it was taking in in revenue.  A ten-year Government bond was yielding approximately 14% which was huge, indicating the capacity of our country to borrow.  Let us consider where we have come in a short space of time in terms of the macroeconomic picture.  We are projected to have a deficit of 0.4% of GDP for 2017.  We are on course for break-even in 2018.  The yield on a ten-year bond is now approximately 0.33%.  This shows how far we have travelled in terms of the country's capacity to borrow money.  It is important that the Government sticks rigidly to the programme it is on in terms of prudent fiscal management.</p>  <p>  It is important to establish a rainy-day fund from 2018.  One of the main problems in 2011 and prior to that when we hit economic turbulence was that the country had no money to invest in the economy.  We need to deploy such a fund in a counter-cyclical manner, as was pointed out in the budget speech, in order to invest money into our economy when we hit tough times.  It is very important to build up that rainy-day fund to ensure that our State has the maximum resources to manage difficult periods.</p>  <p>  I wish to speak about the measures in the budget affecting the farming community.  The Finance Bill allows farmers to opt out of income averaging, whereby they pay tax averaged over a three-year period.  However, in a year when cashflow is under pressure they would still be paying a high rate of tax even though they might have a loss in that year.  It is very important that we are giving farmers a chance to opt out of income averaging for the current year and defer a tax liability, which essentially will give them the cashflow and room that they need.</p>  <p>  It is very important that the farm restructuring relief has been extended to the end of 2019 which will allow farmers to consolidate their holdings.  There is a &euro;25 million allocation for the animal welfare scheme for sheep farmers.  A &euro;150 million loan fund has been introduced and farmers can borrow amounts up to &euro;150,000.  It will be available to livestock, tillage and horticulture farmers.  It will give access to funds at approximately 2.95%, which will give significant flexibility to farmers in accessing funds.  At times when a sector meets cashflow pressure we need to put facilities in place, as the Government has done.</p>  <p>  On income tax, we should continue to phase out the universal social charge.</p><p>It must hit our lower and middle-income earners.  The 0.5% reduction in the rate of the three bands was very important, but, critically, increasing the 2.5% ceiling to &euro;18,772 will protect those who are on the minimum wage to ensure they are not hitting the top rate.  It is very important that we are protecting and reflecting those on the margins and who are under pressure.</p> <p> One third of a million people in this country are self-employed and there is a huge differential between the PAYE tax credit and the fact that there was no earned income tax credit until two years ago.  We must respect the self-employed and try to bring parity in order that there is no differential between them.  The Government has done a lot to get to this stage of bringing the credit up to &euro;950.  We have to acknowledge that these one third of a million people employ 92,000 employees.  They are all paying 10.75% PRSI on those employees.  I think we need to be reflective in this regard when looking at our tax system.</p> <p> There is a huge ongoing debate going on the alleged disparity between income tax paid for those on lower incomes compared with those on higher incomes.  A survey was brought out by the Irish Tax Institute which shows that in the case of an individual on &euro;55,000, he or she currently pays more tax in Ireland than in Sweden, Spain, Switzerland or the US.  He or she pays &euro;800 more than in the UK.  In terms of the differential between wages of &euro;75,000 and &euro;25,000, the person on &euro;75,000 earns three times more but pays eight times more tax.  In the differential between someone on &euro;75,000 and someone on &euro;35,000, the person on &euro;75,000 earns 2.1 times more but pays four times more tax.  It is important to recognise that it is a progressive taxation system.  The more one earns, the more tax one pays.</p> <p> There is a notion advanced by some people on the far left who state the corporate tax rate should increase to ensure we increase the revenue.  Let us analyse that.  If the corporate tax rate is increased, the first thing that will happen is the share prices of corporations will be pushed down.  Essentially, what happens is that when people sell their shares, the capital gains tax is also reduced because the capacity of the share price is reduced and it is not as valuable.  Therefore, that taxation revenue stream will not hold up.  The second thing that will happen if corporation tax is increased is there will be less dividend income to go around the shareholders.  What will happen then is that less taxation will be paid on dividend income.  That also will reduce the amount of revenue coming through from that tax sector.  Just because the corporate tax rate can be increased, it does not mean the other income streams will hold up.  They will actually drop.  It is a kind of mixed blessing, for want of a better word.  It is important that we rigorously keep to our 12.5% rate.  It was important that this commitment was made very strongly in the budget.</p> <p> I recognise the increase for home carers.  There is no doubt that we would like to do a lot more.  Any Government would like to do a lot more.  The Government is in a very difficult position as the fiscal space available is very tight.  We have to ensure that we help those in most need.  The expansion of the pension to bring in our carers, our blind, our widows and people with disabilities was a very important move by the Government in order not to divide society.</p> <p> One of the more contentious aspects of the budget is the help-to-buy scheme.  No matter what action is taken within the housing sector, it is going to be controversial.  We saw the various different manifestos before the last general election and their proposals for housing.  The ESRI was very clear on one issue at that point.  It was that a help-to-buy or incentive scheme should not be given to save for a deposit on the second-hand housing market.  It was very clear that the second-hand market has a fixed supply.  The only direct result of that would be to increase the price of houses on the second-hand market.  The approach the Government has taken is a very targeted approach in that it has pointed very clearly at the supply of new housing.  Obviously, that is where we have a huge problem at the moment.  Essentially, there are people who are paying huge amounts of rent and who are finding it very difficult to get a deposit and get onto the ladder to buy a house because so much of their monthly income is being taken up by rent.  It is important that this gives individuals a chance to get on the property ladder.  There is a debate on where the ceiling is at and whether it should be at &euro;600,000 or below.  Anyone buying a house for &euro;400,000 or more does not benefit in respect of the tax take he or she is getting because it is capped at &euro;400,000.  It is important to point that out.  The line has to be drawn at some point.  We want to see that those who need it most benefit from it.</p> <p> The backdrop to the budget has been very difficult.  What is progressive is that the Action Plan for Jobs is working and there have been huge dividends from the reduction of part-time work in our economy.  We have seen a reduction in the number of people who are on schemes.  It is important that we spread the message that we are strong in supporting job creation.  There are obviously going to be huge challenges ahead.  There is no doubting that.  One of the biggest challenges will be the defence of our corporate tax rate.  There is a great debate going on in Europe on the harmonisation of tax.  We really need to defend that on foot of the budget.  I acknowledge the State has robustly appealed the Apple case, which I also believe is very important.  In terms of employees looking to January, it is important for them to know that if they are on low to middle incomes, the budget will benefit them.  We need to continue on that path to try to bring our marginal tax rate below 55%, below 50% and to keep reducing it.  The critical thing in allowing us to do that is the expansion of our work force.  The more people who are employed, the more people who are paying tax.  In essence, it gives the scope to relieve tax for people and to ensure there is more money in their pockets at the end of the day.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-10-26a.449" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1229" speakername="Billy Kelleher" time="21:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016102600071#TTT00200"><p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Finance Bill that will enact the legislative changes announced in the budget itself.  At the outset, let us be clear: this was not a very inspiring budget by any stretch of the imagination.  It was cautious and safe in the sense that there were no imaginative proposals in it in the context of the challenges we face as a country and society, where we have come from and where we want to go.  It lacked creative ambition in many areas.  In my ten minutes to contribute, I will concentrate on a few areas.</p>  <p>  If we are to be honest with ourselves in this House, the greatest crisis facing Ireland as a country internally is the whole issue of housing and the dysfunctional housing market that is presently in operation.  What we are effectively doing is enslaving another generation.  During the Celtic tiger, we enslaved people to high mortgages and high house prices.  What we are now doing is enslaving a whole generation to renting homes for the foreseeable future.  There is nothing in this budget or Finance Bill that gives me any confidence that the housing supply is going to increase quite dramatically in the short and medium term.  There are a number of fundamental blockages that have to be addressed.  The key issue is supply.  There is nothing here that is going to stimulate any form of supply.  The announcement of the Minister, Deputy Coveney, of the housing strategy is but that: a strategy.  However, I do not see anything in it that will actually put down bricks, blocks and foundations in the short and medium term to address the chronic shortage of housing in this country.</p>  <p>  It is not as if Fine Gael has arrived into Government in the last few days.  It has been in government for six years and this is its sixth budget.  In that time over the last number of years, there was no strategic planning put in place to develop a housing strategy to deal with what was an escalating problem, not just in the last number of months, but for the last number of years.  I can remember previously in this House in 2011 and 2012 the great fanfare from the Government benches about how they were going to address all of the ghost estates.  They were bringing in bulldozers and knocking the whole lot.  What we should have been doing was looking at the demographics and the pressure points that were beginning to show from early 2013 onwards that there was going to be a housing supply shortage and how it was going to create chronic problems for first-time buyers in general.</p>  <p>  I will give a few statistics.  In Cork, in the first eight months of this year, one of five of the residential properties that were sold was purchased by first-time buyers.  In other words, 710 of the 3,643 houses were bought by first-time buyers.</p><p><i>10 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p> <p>This is 19.7%.  We now have a situation where first-time buyers pay an inordinate amount of money on a monthly basis in rent.  If we look at the Dublin market in August, the average rent paid for an average family house in the capital was &euro;1,454.  The difficulty we have is that first-time buyers will simply never get on the property market because they are consistently paying out huge sums in rent.  They will never be able to secure a house in itself because they will never be able to meet the criteria laid down by the Central Bank.  The Central Bank is the only thing acting as a brake at present on escalating house prices.  The shortage is there, the demand is there, but access to credit for first-time buyers is now but a pipe dream.  There has been some effort in the help to buy scheme.  All the help to buy scheme will do is give some people additional money to purchase homes in a market where there are huge shortages of housing stock.  All the Government is doing is throwing additional money at a problem to inflate house prices.</p> <p> We have been around the block too often.  The market is completely dysfunctional and nothing has been done in the intervening years since the crash in 2007 to address this issue.  We have a &euro;200 million infrastructure assistance fund for local authorities to address the chronic issues of infrastructure deficits in terms of water, sewerage and roads to open up some land for development.  Then we go to the other side of the problem, which is our pillar banks.  We still have a dysfunctional banking system.  The pillar banks are incapable of lending into the development market to allow for the building of houses.  Most of the development of housing developments is done by mezzanine finance, where exorbitant rates of interest are paid to try to access finance to build homes.  Our pillar banks, which are there by the good grace of the taxpayers who stepped in and supported them, are now washing their hands of what is a national crisis.  They are doing nothing to address it in terms of assessing business proposals being put forward by developers and builders to access finance to build homes that first-time buyers need and want.  In all of this we have a crisis, and the budget and the Finance Bill have done nothing to address it.  I am afraid the housing strategy as announced by the Minister, Deputy Coveney, is but a strategy and in many ways it will have no meaningful impact on the problem itself.</p> <p> We now have a situation where we have gazumping of rental properties.  Recently I came across a situation in Cork where a family made an offer of &euro;1,100 for a rental property but by the time they got back it had increased to &euro;1,350, at which stage the family had to withdraw.  This was all in the space of a matter of hours.  This is what families face on a continual basis.  I cannot see how the housing stock can be increased with the proposals out there, when we have severe blockages in financing developments throughout State.  While we tinker around the edges, families struggle on a continuous basis to buy a home or build a home so they can call it their home, as opposed to being in a situation where they are serfs for the rest of their days, paying exorbitant rents to investors.</p> <p> In the first eight months of the year, of the 3,640 houses sold in Cork one quarter were bought by private investors because they can bring cash to the table.  They are the people who can purchase the buildings and houses for sale in the State.  This is what is happening.  The help to buy scheme is a token effort to pretend the Government is doing something for first-time buyers, but in effect the overall problem is the fact our dysfunctional housing market is just not being addressed.  Local authorities simply cannot fund the infrastructure deficits which exist in terms of water, sewerage, roads and other infrastructure, which are important for opening up development sites. Coupled with this problem is the issue of access to finance.  Only a few housing schemes are being built and they are coming on the market very slowly.  There have been only a couple of hundred in Cork in the past 12 months.  I am quite definite that more could be built if some form of finance was made available by our pillar banks, which have washed their hands of assessing any business plan to do with construction.  This is a major flaw in the strategy being discussed.</p> <p> On the broader issue of the budget itself and the Finance Bill, what I found strange was that under our confidence and supply agreement with the Government we were told there would be no surprises in the budget, and by and large there were not any major surprises, but something I found distasteful to say the very least was that the Minister, Deputy Noonan, could bring &euro;200 million out of his back pocket in the days before the budget.  We were told the fiscal space available was approximately &euro;1 billion, but when it came to delivering the budget we were told it was &euro;1.2 billion.</p> <p> On the broader issue of budget itself, independent commentators have said, and I am not taking any credit for this personally, it is a fact that it is the first progressive budget in the past five years.  The previous five budgets were regressive.  They asked those at the bottom to pay most.  I am sure this was the intention, given Fine Gael's announcements during the general election and the campaign it ran for US-style taxes, which effectively are about giving greater tax breaks to those at the top and forcing those at the bottom to pay.</p> <p> Overall it was an uninspiring budget.  The Government is failing miserably on the issue of addressing the chronic shortage of houses for first-time buyers.  As I have stated, it is condemning another generation of people who just want to put a roof over their heads and those of their families to years of serfdom, funding investors through exorbitant rents.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-10-26a.451" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1324" speakername="Frank O'Rourke" time="21:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016102600072#UUU00200"><p>As did my colleague, Deputy Kelleher, I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Finance Bill.  I want to highlight areas for further expansion and engagement in various areas and Departments as Bills emerge in the time ahead.  Fianna F&aacute;il's input, as per the confidence and supply agreement, as my colleague has outlined, ensured a fairer budget for all with a ratio of 3:1 between spending and tax cuts.</p>  <p>  With regard to the first-time buyer scheme, I hope the Minister will actively engage with all in the coming weeks prior to Committee Stage so the legislation is amended where necessary to show fairness to all those who wish to participate in it.  In particular, I believe the first-time buyer's grant should be available to all those purchasing a house for the first time and not just those buying new properties.  The difficulty at present is very few new houses have been built, for the reasons we know and have outlined in the House on many occasions.  Excluding second-hand homes being purchased by first-time buyers is a great mistake in my view and opening it up needs to be considered.  The timing of the introduction of the grant also needs to be considered.</p>  <p>  The establishment of the budgetary oversight committee is to be welcomed, as the lack of an impact assessment meant some flaws in the help to buy scheme.  These have been rectified by the Central Bank.  Another area that needs to be looked at and has not been touched on is people trying to trade up.  Many families are living in houses with negative equity.  Their family circumstances suggest they need to move into a larger home, but they cannot afford to rent somewhere larger.  They are being caught for tax on their own property if they rent it out, and if they sell it they will find themselves at a loss.  This area is catching out many families and needs to be looked at.</p>  <p>  The reduction in the rate of USC is to be welcomed, as it reduces somewhat the burden on low and middle income areas.  The modest increase in people's take home pay ensures some benefits from the growing economy for the squeezed middle.  The only issue with this is that at present the break given to people in USC is being consumed in other areas, such as motor insurance.  The Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, will bring forward measures next month in this regard.  Motor insurance has increased by 40% over the past 18 months to two years.</p><p>The reduction in USC and more will be consumed by the 40% increase in motor insurance costs.  Unfortunately, that reduction will not have a positive impact on families or on local economies.  There will be no local spend because the modest reduction will be consumed by increases in motor insurance and so on.</p> <p> The provision for the capital expenditure programme is disappointing.  While the additional &euro;250 million is welcome, the programme falls short in many areas.  More investment is needed in bus and rail services to encourage more people to use public transport.  They will avail of it once services are provided.  Reduced fares and improved services need to be examined to reduce congestion on our road network.  For example, there is terrible congestion on the M50 at the moment.  The only way to get people out of their cars is to provide an adequate public transport system.  The current capital expenditure programme falls short in this area.  The interest rate on State borrowing through the relevant agencies is almost at 0% and, therefore, this was a missed opportunity for an improved and more ambitious programme.  Previous Administrations invested heavily in improving our road network to bring it up to motorway and dual carriageway standard.  The standard of roads such as the N3, N4 and N5 needs to meet dual carriageway or motorway standard.  That will enhance access to hard-to-reach areas, make them attractive for foreign direct investment and assist businesses and people living in those areas.  Tourism is also a massive industry and if people can access these areas and the right services are provided, they will certainly do so.  That is why the Government needs to invest in and protect the road network.  There are proposals to build more centres of excellence in the health sector but people need to be able to access them.  Currently, there is a deficit in this regard and this is another missed opportunity that needs to be examined.  There is a massive transport deficit in Celbridge in my constituency.  A bridge costing &euro;15 million is required to assist further development in the town, which has a population in excess of 20,000, but it has not happened.  Ring roads need to be competed in Clane and Maynooth to facilitate further public transport links to those towns while Kilcock and Leixlip need park-and-ride facilities to promote public transport.  The transport sector needs to be addressed under the capital expenditure programme.</p> <p> The child care measures announced in the budget amount to a start and I welcome the Government's commitment to the quality of child care provision but it still has a long way to go, in particular, in respect of the support for lone parents who wish to access third level education and for mature students.  People who want to access FETAC level 8 courses do not receive the same supports as those participating on level 6 and 7 courses.  That is wrong and they are at a disadvantage.  This needs to be considered and provision needs to be expanded.</p> <p> The &euro;5 increase in the old age pension is welcome, as is the increase to 85% in the Christmas bonus.  However, the Minister for Social Protection should work to increase the bonus to 100% as quickly as possible.  It is important that his Department adjusts the pension means test limit in order that the increase does not negatively impact on services such as medical cards because the increase could lead them to losing a service they need.  More needs to be done for the self-employed.  They contribute hugely to the Exchequer and to the economy and they need to be able to avail of social welfare supports if they find themselves out of work or if they are out sick but that is not the case currently.  The Minister also needs to focus on this.  The approach to child benefit was hugely disappointing given the previous Administration cut the rates in two successive budgets.  The Government parties chose to ignore it on this occasion.  I made a proposal to extend child benefit to those in full-time second level education, which the Minister accepted.  He said it would examine it seriously.  It would cost the taxpayer &euro;60 million but this opportunity was also missed in the budget.  It is an expensive time for families when children are in their final year in school.  They are struggling and hard pressed and the fact child benefit was not extended was a mistake.  Hopefully, it will be considered in the upcoming social welfare Bill.</p> <p> The increase of &euro;15 million for the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, is welcome.  However, the increase needs to be closer to &euro;50 million for the fund to have an impact on waiting lists.  Yesterday, I raised the outpatient waiting list for spinal surgery in Tallaght hospital in the House.  Currently, more than 400 people are on the list in the hospital's catchment area, which includes counties Kildare, Longford, Westmeath and Dublin.  There has been a lack of investment in a dedicated spinal surgery theatre.  It would cost &euro;4 million and &euro;300,000 per annum thereafter to service it.  This should come under the capital expenditure programme and such investment needs to be made to deal with the waiting list.  While the NTPF deals with emergencies, it does not have a long-term strategy in this regard.  The Government must invest in this infrastructure and in supports to meaningfully tackle the problems in the health service.</p> <p> No funding was provided to fast-track the national broadband plan.  People, for example, in the north west of my constituency, cannot even study from home, never mind operate a business or work from home because of the lack of broadband services.  It is a huge problem.</p> <p> A special fund should be administered by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to assist Irish businesses to promote themselves in light of the UK leaving the EU.</p> <p> I welcome the additional funding for An Bord Plean&aacute;la to enable it to fast-track large residential developments in the recently introduced planning Bill.  The irony, however, is there are sites zoned in my constituency and elsewhere with planning permission and companies funded to build on them but they cannot do so because Irish Water has told them the necessary infrastructure will not be in place for between three and six years.  We have a housing crisis and this is crazy.  Companies cannot build because of the lack of infrastructure.  This needs to be examined and the additional &euro;200 million provided must be focused on the areas in crisis in order that both housing and infrastructure can be delivered in tandem.</p></speech>

Sometimes Teachta Kelleher can almost achieve the impossible.  He almost got me to feel sorry for the Minister of State who had to listen to his contribution because the Minister of State will agree that if Fianna F&aacute;il Members were sitting in his seat and if Teachta Kelleher was a Minister, there would have been nothing different in this budget.  The Deputy made many comments about the failures in housing and health but Fianna F&aacute;il had an opportunity to put forward an alternative budget and it failed to do so.  It was the first year that the party did not produce a costed alternative.  Instead, it criticised my party for putting forward an alternative that delivered on the big issues facing families.  One of the few remarks the Deputy made that I agree with is there were no surprises in the budget.  We got the same as we always have from Fine Gael-led Governments, which is an unfair budget that did not grapple with the big problems facing most families.  We got the usual confusion and spin with no detail about any of the proposals that were announced.  There was no vision and no plan for most sectors.</p>  <p>  I will take up some of the issues raised by the Fianna F&aacute;il spokespersons to which they did not provide solutions.  There was a great deal of debate in the House about housing prior to the budget.  An Oireachtas committee was set up to examine how we can meet the challenge of the housing crisis.  It is accepted universally outside the Chamber that the best way to do this is for the State to start building homes again and for the State to purchase homes.  Capital funding was needed to enable local authorities to buy houses and build homes to increase capacity in the system.</p><p>That would have the added advantage of driving down rents in Cork, Dublin, Waterford and other major cities, as well as in rural areas.  We proposed an additional 7,000 units through acquisitions and new builds as part of our capital plan, yet I was told by Fianna F&aacute;il that this was too ambitious and could not be achieved.  It would be a drop in the ocean in terms of what will actually be necessary in the next few years, but it was a start and a move in the right direction.  What we got from the Government, however, on this issue had been taken straight from the Fianna F&aacute;il playbook when it was unable to solve any of the big problems, namely, the introducing of tax breaks.  We had the so-called first-time buyer's scheme which was half-baked, with no real detail and which had not been properly teased out.  Within a couple of days the cracks appeared, there were U-turns and the proposal is now left standing without any real merit.  What budget day and the Finance Bill are about is celebrating that we are taking big decisions to deal with the problems facing families.  We know that housing is the big issue, with people unnecessarily being in emergency accommodation, sleeping in their parents' and friends' front rooms and without a roof over their heads.  This is the time to deal with these issues and put our money where our mouths are.  Fianna F&aacute;il had the chance to do so, but, of course, it did nothing, as usual.  The Government of Fine Gael and the Independents had its chance, but it did nothing either.  Here we go again with no real solution to the housing crisis.</p> <p> Before the budget we were led to believe through a big announcement that there would be a significant child care package for working families and the so-called "squeezed middle".  By the way, the squeezed middle includes those on an income of &euro;30,000 to &euro;40,000 a year, not those on an income of &euro;70,000 or &euro;80,000 a year, as Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael seem to think.  The majority of workers in the State earn less than &euro;45,000 a year.  They are the ones who need support the most.  When it came to child care, the Government announced a package which, again, had not been thought out or would not benefit the majority of working parents.  It announced a package it would not even be able to deliver because there is not the capacity in the case of most child care providers to enable people to take the advantage of it in the first place.  It was another of the big issues on which there was no vision, detail or plan.  It is made up as the Government goes along in the hope everything will work out, but it does not.</p> <p> Health, an issue close to Deputy Billy Kelleher's heart, is another case where things are being kept as they are.  There is no plan to deal with the two-tier health service, to move to a universal health care system or to deal with the record numbers on waiting lists.  There are record numbers of patients in public hospitals who are being outsourced to private hospitals.  In Waterford the figure doubled from 3,000 patients in 2013 to over 6,000 in 2015.  It is welcome that at least patients are being treated.  Again, however, it is a sticking plaster solution - outsourcing to private hospitals, putting more public money into private hospitals and not providing capacity in public hospitals.  There has been a doubling of agency staff costs because we are not employing the number of health staff we should.  This is an additional cost because it does not save the State any money.  Every week, when the figures come out, with record numbers of patients lying on hospital trolleys, the Minister trots out the tea and sympathy and there will be a discussion about what we need to do about the problem, but when the time comes to do something about it - budget day - nothing is done.  Why are the resources not put into the health service?  It is because the Government is not committed to Sinn F&eacute;in's vision for a universal health care system and increasing capacity in public services to deliver for patients.</p> <p> There was the Cassells report on education.  If we, in Sinn F&eacute;in, did not provide for the increased capacity as outlined in the Cassells report in our alternative budget, we would have been rightly castigated.  We included an additional &euro;130 million, in current and capital expendidture, in our alternative budget, &euro;100 million of which was based on the Cassells report, but what did the Government provide?  It only provided a fraction of that figure.  We are nowhere near what we need to provide the capacity needed at third and fourth level, in the universities and institutes of technology, as well as at primary and second level.</p> <p> All of the problems about which Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael will cry crocodile tears such as schools without resources, there not being enough special needs assistants, high pupil-teacher ratios, with the numbers on hospital trolleys and the homelessness crisis will be part of every Member's narrative for several months.  However, when the Government had the opportunity do something about it, it did nothing.  It gave us a bland budget, as Deputy Billy Kelleher admitted, but it was something of which he was part.  He supported it and is allowing it to happen.  I do not see any vision.</p> <p> We need more money for mental health services.  We rightly had emotional debates in the House on these issues because they affect many people.  We were then told the money was not available to fund the services we needed.  However, adjustments to a figure of &euro;25 million were made to the capital acquisitions tax regime, which will have an impact on a tiny number of citizens.  It is unconscionable that we will give a tiny number that &euro;25 million because we want to change the inheritance tax rules to make a small number of people wealthier when we could have used the money to fund mental health services.  These are the choices we have to make as politicians.  It makes me laugh when I hear Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael accuse Sinn F&eacute;in of being populist as they were the parties which gave in to the vocal lobbies in this respect.  They also wanted to phase out the universal social charge, a move which officials in the Department of Finance described as base eroding.  They said it would not have an impact on many working families and would be regressive.  I am a member of the Committee on Budgetary Oversight.  We had any number of individuals and groups before us to discuss this issue, including the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, the ESRI and IBEC, and every single one of them stated it would be a mistake to phase out the universal social charge.  They all said we needed to increase capacity in the capital spend to build schools, hospitals, improve roads and provide for flood relief measures.  I am sure we will hear Deputies Billy Kelleher and Frank O'Rourke talk again about flooding.  Where is the money for flood relief measures?  Less than &euro;50 million was provided.  When we had the opportunity to increase capital funding, we did not take it.</p> <p> We hear much from both Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael about the fiscal rules.  Brian Hayes, MEP, spoke recently about the need for flexibility in that regard.  Some of the Fianna F&aacute;il members of the Committee on Budgetary Oversight and the finance committee also spoke about the need for more movement on the fiscal rules and we had an opportunity to spread the cost of capital investment over four years.  This would have allowed us to front-load capital investment this year, but what did the Government provide?  The additional capital spend was only &euro;400 million.  It blew the chance to take advantage of one of the few opportunities to avail of flexibility.  Sinn F&eacute;in did take advantage, which is why it proposed a capital spend of &euro;1.2 billion, which would have used up &euro;400 million of the fiscal space available.  That would have allowed money to be allocated for flood relief measures, road projects, hospitals, schools and the supply of housing.  Instead, the Government delivered a bland budget.  I would actually hazard the guess that when the ESRI makes the final analysis, this will not be considered to be a progressive budget.  For all of the credit Fianna F&aacute;il was trying to take for a so-called progressive budget, let us see what happens with the final analysis is made in the next few weeks.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-10-26a.455" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1302" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="21:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016102600074#WWW00200"><p>We are debating legislation to give effect to what can only be described as a builders' bonanza, but what Fianna F&aacute;il has named a help-to-buy scheme.</p><p>As we know, all of the available evidence points to the fact that this scheme will increase house prices and young families' level of debt, while also increasing profits for the building industry.  The census figures for this year indicate that Dublin Fingal -  my constituency - with a population growth rate of  8.1% since 2011, is the fastest-growing constituency in the State.  This population increase demonstrates the absolute need to ensure an adequate housing supply and rent certainty not only in my constituency but in other constituencies, none of which this Government has provided for or plans to provide for.  This Bill is proof of that.  I meet people every day who are desperate to purchase homes in my community but owing to crippling high rents they cannot save for a deposit.  The Government's help-to-buy scheme has forced up the price of new homes and far from helping people to buy it is putting homes even further from their reach.  I do not know how a person is expected to save for a deposit if living in Swords and paying &euro;1,400 per month in rent or living in Skerries and paying &euro;1,300 or &euro;1,400 per month in rent.  It is not going to happen and that is unacceptable.</p> <p> In this give-away budget, no thought was given to the type of homes that will be bankrolled by the help-to-buy scheme.  I say this because the area I represent is, as I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, is aware, affected by pyrite.  Families and young couples, first-time buyers who paid large sums of money for their homes, now find those homes effectively rendered worthless.  Some are in limbo in that they can neither sell their houses nor extend them to reflect their changing circumstances.  Burdened with negative equity and houses with no resale potential and often little chance of remediation, these people found no hope or comfort in the budget.  I have already addressed directly with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, the issue of exemption from local property tax for home owners whose properties are affected by pyrite.  Unfortunately, I have had very little positive outcome in that regard.</p> <p> I would like now to draw the attention of the Minister of State to another issue which I believe should be given consideration if the Government is serious about helping these people.  Budget 2017 provides for &euro;22 million to fund the pyrite remediation scheme.  The Government has said that this is a clear signal of the importance it attaches to addressing the issue of pyrite remediation.  It has been said that this fund will facilitate the remediation of approximately 400 dwellings under the scheme in 2017.  If, however, the Government is serious about the importance it attaches to addressing this issue, I can recommend a course of action that will go a long way towards addressing the struggles facing many home owners, particularly in the constituency of Fingal.</p> <p> The Minister of State will be aware that it is a condition of eligibility under the pyrite remediation scheme that an application to the Pyrite Resolution Board must be accompanied by a building condition assessment with a damage condition rating of 2.  This means that many households are locked out of the scheme and stuck in limbo.  They have to pay privately to have their houses tested but if the house does not have a damage condition rating of 2 they cannot seek reimbursement of that cost.  It should be borne in mind that these people are the squeezed middle rather than people on salaries of &euro;70,000 plus.  These homes have pyrite damage.  The home owners could not have known that their houses were pyrite affected when they bought them.  To get the remediation work done, the house must have a particular level of damage.  These people will never be able to sell their homes or recoup the value of them because of pyrite damage.  We can all agree on that.  They are effectively stuck between a rock and a hard place.  All they can do is wait until the pyritic damage worsens.  Rather than being able to have the problem addressed when the property is assessed as having grade 1 damage, they have to wait until it worsens to qualify for the scheme.  Responses to parliamentary questions to the Minister are to the effect that the Pyrite Resolution Board has advised that seven dwellings which had a damage condition rating of 1 when their building condition assessments were first completed and, as such, were refused under the pyrite remediation scheme, have now progressed to a damage condition rating of 2.  Damage condition ratings are moving from 1 to 2 but meanwhile people have to live in these homes.  Many of these houses have cracks running up the walls yet these people have to wait until such time as the damage condition reaches level 2 before they can have the problem addressed.  That is no way for anybody to live.  Damage could be progressing without the knowledge of the board.  Many families have been left disenfranchised by this because the damage to their homes is not bad enough or they do not have the money to have their homes assessed.</p> <p> This group of people were encouraged at the time to get themselves onto the property ladder and so they bought starter homes.  They are now left with houses riddled with pyrite and no recourse to remediation.  There is much talk about the help-to-buy scheme and helping people to stay in their homes and so on.  However, where is the help for the people who have a damage condition rating of 1, negative equity and starter homes which have now become their "forever" homes and which, perhaps, not accommodate their families?  These people are stuck in houses in which the damage might potentially worsen, and probably will, and have been effectively rendered useless.  There could be pyrite in their gardens and so they cannot extend.  They bought the houses that they believed were going to be their starter homes.  They did so to get on the proper ladder and in the hope that they would later have an opportunity to move up the ladder.  They now find themselves stuck.  There is nothing in budget 2017 for these people.</p> <p> I have placed a motion on the Order Paper which I hope all Deputies, and most especially those in my constituency who have heard the stories at first hand, will be able to support.  The Minister of State will be aware that I could not table legislation owing to a potential cost on the Exchequer.  Now that this issue has been brought to his attention, I hope that he will find a way to help these people.  I believe they have done nothing wrong.  They bought houses at a time when property prices were rising.  They scrambled to get themselves onto the property ladder and bought small to medium-sized modest houses.  They now have to wait and hope that the damage to their homes will graduate from grade 1 to grade 2 so that they can claim compensation, which seems very wrong.  They are stuck in their homes.  They cannot extend because they might be pyrite in their gardens.  They are effectively in limbo.  I do not think that is any way for people to have to live.</p> <p> I have brought this issue to the Minister of State's attention.  As already stated, I have tabled a motion on the Order Paper for which I will be seeking support.  I hope that, in the meantime, the Minister of State will find a way to help these families in distress.</p></speech>

It is obvious that we are emerging from very difficult budgets of recent years.  I would first like to make some general points on the Bill.  The attempt to spread the positivity widely was an opportunity lost to have a constructive impact on a particular section of society.  A little given to a lot of people will not have a significant impact in the same way as a lot given to a particular sector would.  I wish to speak about one particular sector whose needs have rarely, if ever, been met in budgets, namely, those with disabilities, either physical or mental or both.  We all know that the cost of living for people with disabilities is much higher than the cost of living for those who are abled bodied.  The Disability Federation of Ireland sought a &euro;20 increase to meet that extra daily cost.  This &euro;20 increase would have gone some way to meet that need but that did not happen.  People with disabilities continue to be disadvantaged.</p>  <p>  While positive measures such as the preschool provision for children with disabilities, medical card cover for all children and domiciliary care allowance measures were welcomed by the disability sector, as Senator John Dolan pointed out, disabled people "need measures to ensure that they get out of the spiral of poverty and exclusion."  There was an opportunity in the budget to kick-start recovery in the disability sector but it was not taken.  This means that people with disabilities will continue to comprise one of the groups most risk of poverty.  We know that 30% of people with disabilities work but more of them could work if the necessary supports were in place.</p><p>What I am talking about is the principle of living with dignity, to which the Disability Federation of Ireland and the Centre for Independent Living constantly refer.  The late Martin Naughton who passed away recently was a tireless advocate, campaigner and voice for those with a disability.  I met him in 1971.  His passing brought a great deal of sadness to his family and friends as well as to the community he served.</p> <p> Various organisations are telling us there is a crisis in relation to people with intellectual disabilities.  The figures for those in need are startling, particularly those in need of residential support as a matter of priority.  There are people who need additional resources because of their changing needs.  There are 150 adults per month who require respite, but only 3.8 beds are available per night.  That means only 27% of respite needs are currently being met.  We hope that budgets will make a positive difference and have an impact.  Looking at it from the perspective of the disability sector, including the intellectual disability sector, the opportunity to make a difference in this budget has been lost.  I highlight this in the hope that next year these might be the groups whose needs are given priority in the budget.  Unfortunately, very few of the measures in the Finance Bill will make an appreciable difference to the lives of people with disabilities.</p> <p> Reading through the various tax measures, I was thinking in particular of communities in my constituency.  I was at an event in a community earlier this evening which was a very sad one.  This is a community like many in my constituency where there is a high incidence of lone parents, addiction, early school-leaving, overcrowding and unemployment.  If I had brought a copy of the Finance Bill with me and asked the people there to have a look and see what was in it for them, I am sure that first of all they would have found the language totally alien.  They would also have found that there is very little in it for them.  Who is benefiting from the measures, then?  Once again, it is landlords, developers and property speculators as well as farmers and fishermen.  I certainly do not begrudge fishermen the advances they got in the budget because we have seen the failures of successive Governments in the past as well as at EU level which brought about increasing difficulties for those of our fishermen who were trying to stay in the industry as Irish waters were opened up to super-trawlers.  What we will see as a result of the various tax measures in the Bill will be an increase in the number of wealthy people in the country.</p> <p> We all know the extent of the lobbying and submissions before the budget.  As such, I ask myself whose hand or influence we see having the greatest impact in it.  Do we see organisations like St. Vincent de Paul, Social Justice Ireland, TASC or the European Anti Poverty Network?  Unfortunately, we cannot see their imprint on the budget.  What we see is the hand of business and the wealthy, albeit there are measures for small and medium enterprises as well as for those starting their own businesses.  It brings me and many others to the acknowledged need for an independent budget office that can do the equality proofing and social impact analysis in order that there will be a real change to budgets which make a real difference to the lives of those who most need it.</p> <p> On 17 October, we held the annual event at the Famine statue on the quays to commemorate the UN's end poverty day.  There was testimony from people who expressed real poverty and social exclusion.  The slogan of the group is "Leave no one behind".  Listening to those testimonies and the reality of the lives of those on the margins, we saw the need for a budget committee to focus on how change can come about in their lives so that no one is left behind.  We need an economic policy that ensures equality and does not exacerbate inequality.</p> <p> The universal social charge, USC, was introduced as a temporary austerity emergency tax.  Certainly, it caused hardship to those on lower incomes.  At least, however, the principle was there that those with more paid more.  The changes in the USC, however, appear to mean that the more one earns, the more one will benefit.  We never seem to consider a financial transaction tax and what that could bring in for much-needed services and resources.  Looking at the housing aspects of the Bill, we see benefits for landlords.  The rent-a-room allowance is increased and the renovation and living city schemes have been extended.</p> <p> While the long-range housing plans to build 47,000 houses by 2021 are very welcome, they will make only a small dent in the current waiting lists.  What is needed are the financial resources to get local authorities to start building social housing because we cannot continue to rely exclusively on the private rented sector.  I note the impetus on student accommodation.  I see it in Dublin Central where considerable building is going on.  There is more that will start.  There was an announcement just this week of plans for the docklands.  Part of the rationale is that there is a shortage of student accommodation which means that students are taking up much-needed private rented accommodation.  Therefore, if students can be moved out of the private rented sector, it would free up accommodation for families, couples and single individuals.  While that is fair enough, I wish the urgency I see in Dublin Central to build student accommodation could be applied to the building of social housing.  We need building companies, developers and the private sector and they are entitled to make a profit.  However, lessons must be learned from the excesses of recent years.</p> <p> Unfortunately, the budgetary measures are not addressing the needs of those requiring loans.  We look at the deposit situation.  Who can rent and at the same time save the level of deposit that is needed on what Social Justice Ireland reckons is the median salary of &euro;36,000 a year, but which the Minister reckons is &euro;70,000 a year?  The crippling rents being paid in the private sector are preventing people saving.  Many people are paying a rent equivalent to, if not more, than they would pay for a mortgage.  We are paying lip service to the principle of rent certainty because rents are increasing.  Some suggest they are increasing at a rate of up to 40%.  Telling people who face this rent increase even though rents are not supposed to be increasing to take their issues to the PRTB is not the answer at all.  Serious issues are being raised by economists and stockbrokers in relation to the section 8 first-time buyers scheme.  They expect house prices to rise by 7% rather than by 5%.  It is unfortunate where the Minister has tried to do something, but we all know about the law of unintended consequences.</p> <p> Sadly and disturbingly, wealthy people can use a loophole in the Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act to gift houses to their children.  I do not know whether the Minister of State agrees, but the estimated loss to the Exchequer is of the order of &euro;100 million because inheritance tax does not apply.  It is the lack of accountable and transparent tax systems internationally that is creating inequality and exacerbating existing poverty.  Tax justice involves addressing tax avoidance and tax evasion, the cost of which is in the billions.  The OECD figures on lost revenue are startling.  The Revenue Commissioners report that &euro;3 billion has been recovered in additional tax, interest and penalties that would have been lost through tax evasion.  As such, the question is how much more could be recovered if we worked more stringently on the illicit tax flows.  Ireland has gone some way recently by adopting country-by-country reporting which is vital for tax transparency.  However, we could have gone further to support the calls by various NGOs and civil society groups for an intergovernmental body on tax under the UN.  Instead, we went with the OECD model.  While that is positive, it means the reporting will not be public.</p> <p> We still do not know what the effective corporate tax rate is.  It seems to vary from company to company.  Everybody knows the level of income tax paid by most people in this country but we have a different rule for the corporate sector.  The Minister for Finance said the progress made over the past 12 months highlights how our corporate tax regime meets the highest standards in tax transparency.  If the commitment is to transparency, why can we not know what is being paid by corporations?  That is not an attack on foreign direct investment.</p></speech>
